<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy advertisements, <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/national/90-year-old-man-spends-10k-on-ads-to-tell-att-ceo-about-his-slow-internet-service/">especially in legacy media</a></li>

<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Say “I don’t know” or “I don’t have an opinion” when you don’t</li>

<li>Especially to kids when they annoy you.</li>

<li>Start a blog or substack so you can say “I’m a writer” without lying. Then start conversations with strangers by saying “Hi, I’m a writer doing a piece about &lt;location/circumstance you’re in&gt;. Can I ask you a few questions?”
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn how professionals email by <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails">reading leaked emails</a>.</li>
<li>Use contract-to-hire
<ul>
<li>Even for CEO-level roles, this can be done well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As mentioned above, buy <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">research or data</a>, e.g. for compensation</li>
<li>Market-test a mere idea by (1) setting up a landing page with an interest form and (2) buying a cheap social media ad campaign. (HT <a href="https://twitter.com/daytimeskye/status/1608107407678349317">@daytimeskye</a>)</li>
<li>Merge with your competitors, a la PayPal</li>
<li>Work in public
<ul>
<li>Or mostly in public, a la SpaceX who livestreams everything</li>

<li>Sell to unusual markets

<li>This gif is running at normal speed :)</li>
<li>You could use this as a backup to your AdBlocker - when YouTube forces you to turn the AdBlocker off</li>
<li>Will be turned into a browser extension that runs automatically (comment !remindme! 5 days)</li>
<li>Only speeds up Ads - doesn't affect your normal videos</li>
<li>Also mutes the Ads - doesn't affect your normal videos sounds</li>
<li>Autoplays the Ads so you can skip them faster</li>
<li>This demo doesn't click "skip" automatically - but it will in the next version :)</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this little bookmarklet demo, I develop other cool extensions - like <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mobile-view-web-testing-d/clepmakjkiihmfoepipckkafafdepjne?hl=en-GB">Mobile View - Web Testing &amp; Device Simulator</a> (for responsive design!).

			<p>A little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically,
	        you could find this type of humor anywhere. But only
	        a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have written this
	        story, in just this way….</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		
	</div>
	<div id="story">
		<p><span>It was</span> quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of
		Earth by lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven’t done anything
		about it; I can’t think of anything to do. I wrote to the
		Government, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and maintenance
		of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I’m not
		the first to discover it. Maybe it’s even under control.</p>

		<p>I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a paperbacked
		book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the reference that
		first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn’t respond. It took some
		time for the full import to sink in. After I’d comprehended, it seemed
		odd I hadn’t noticed it right away.</p>

		<p>The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties,
		not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out, customarily
		masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise, however,
		became transparent in the face of the following observations by the
		author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew
		everything — and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble
		remembering it even now) read:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes slowly roved about the room.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll
		like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through
		the air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the
		story was surprised. That’s what tipped me off. No sign of amazement
		at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes moved from person to person.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from
		the rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my
		breath choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention
		<a id="page129" title="129">&nbsp;</a>of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the
		characters in the book, it was perfectly natural — which suggested they
		belonged to the same species.</p>

		<p>And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author
		was taking it rather <em>too easily</em> in his stride. Evidently, he felt this was
		quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this
		knowledge. The story continued:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… presently his eyes fastened on Julia.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She
		is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I sighed
		with relief. They weren’t <em>all</em> non-Terrestrials. The narrative continues:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter
		ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family
		regarded me in wonder.</p>

		<p>“What’s wrong, dear?” my wife asked.</p>

		<p>I couldn’t tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary
		run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. “Nothing,” I gasped.
		I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span>In the</span> garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I
		read the next revealing passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if
	        he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a
	        smile.</p>

		<p>It’s not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed
		it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it
		was thrown away. I don’t care. In any case, the full meaning was there,
		staring me right in the face.</p>

		<p>Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their
		anatomy at will. Eyes, arms — and maybe more. Without batting an eyelash.
		My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point. Obviously
		they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of primitive single-celled
		things. Beings no more developed than starfish. Starfish can do
		the same thing, you know.</p>

		<p>I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly by
		the author without the faintest tremor:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went
			inside, part over to the cafe for dinner.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.
		<a id="page130" title="130">&nbsp;</a>Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the
		upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really stumbled
		onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… I’m afraid there’s no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has lost
			his head again.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Which was followed by:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… and Bob says he has utterly no guts.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,
		however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… totally lacking in brains.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<hr>

		<p><span>There</span> was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I
		had thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also
		being an alien life form, similar to the rest:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the young
			man.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It didn’t relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I didn’t
		really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in her usual
		manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart, arms, eyes, brains,
		viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion demanded. Without a
		qualm.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… thereupon she gave him her hand.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I shudder
		to think what he’s done with them, by this time.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he took her arm.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Not content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own. Flushing
		crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But not
		in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy
		whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… her eyes followed him all the way down the road and
			across the meadow.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the
		accursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing
		Monopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,
		brow feverish, teeth chattering.</p>

		<p>I had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let
		them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don’t want to get mixed up
		in it.</p>

		<p>I have absolutely no stomach for it.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Some wireless headphone users note low sound quality and lack of high frequencies when using the standard Bluetooth SBC codec, which is supported by all headphones and other Bluetooth audio devices. A common recommendation to get better sound quality is to buy devices and headphones with aptX or LDAC codecs support. These codecs require licensing fees, that's why devices with them are more expensive.</p><p>

It turns out that the low quality of SBC is caused by artificial limitations of all current Bluetooth stacks and headphones' configuration, and this limitation can be circumvented on any existing device with software modification only.<a name="habracut"></a></p><h2>SBC codec</h2><p>SBC has lots of different parameters that are negotiated during the connection setup phase:</p><ul>
<li>Audio channel type and number: Joint Stereo, Stereo, Dual Channel, Mono;</li>
<li>Number of frequency bands: 4 or 8;</li>
<li>Number of audio blocks in one packet: 4, 8, 12, 16;</li>
<li>Quantization bit allocation algorithm: Loudness, SNR;</li>
<li>Maximum and minimum bit pool used in quantization process: usually 2-53.</li>
</ul><p>

The decoder is required to support any combination of these parameters. Encoder may implement only a part of them.<br>
Existing Bluetooth stacks usually negotiate the following set of options which I call «profile»: Joint Stereo, 8 bands, 16 blocks, Loudness, bitpool 2..53. This profile encodes 44.1 kHz stereo audio with 328 kbps bitrate.<br>
Bitpool is a parameter that changes encoding bitrate: the higher it is, the higher the bitrate, and hence the quality. But exact bitpool value corresponds to exact bitrate only within exact profile.<br>
The bitrate is also significantly affected by other parameters: audio channel type, number of frequency bands, number of audio blocks. You can increase the bitrate indirectly by negotiating non-standard profiles, without changing the bitpool.</p><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/formulas/359/ca0/835/359ca08359d109bf3c7633f9adae5744.svg" alt="$ bitrate = \frac{8 \times frame\_length \times sample\_rate}{subbands \times blocks} $" data-tex="display"></p>
<p><i><span color="#666666">Bitrate calculation formula</span></i></p><p>


For example, Dual Channel mode encodes channels separately, using individual bitpool for each channel, unlike Stereo or Joint Stereo, which use bitpool for both channels. Forcing the device to use Dual Channel instead of Joint Stereo will get us almost doubled bitrate of 617 kbps, with the same bitpool value of 53.<br>
To me it feels that bitpool should be an internal variable. I assume that it is an A2DP specification design fault that bitpool value is not bound to other codec parameters and only defined as an independent negotiated variable.</p><p>

Fixed bitpool and bitrate values originated from recommended profile for high quality audio. But the recommendation should not be the reason to set the limit on these parameters.</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/5bf/c7d/cc55bfc7d4e0a7e9ca4aee331f6c9992.png" alt="Bluetooth SBC profiles table" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/5bf/c7d/cc55bfc7d4e0a7e9ca4aee331f6c9992.png"></p><p>

A2DP specification v1.2, which was active from 2007 to 2015, requires all decoders to work correctly with bitrates up to 512 kbps:</p><blockquote>The decoder of the SNK shall support all possible bitpool values that do not result in excess of the maximum bit rate. This profile limits the available maximum bit rate to 320kb/s for mono, and 512kb/s for two-channel modes.</blockquote><p>

No bitrate limit stated in the new version of the specification. It is assumed that modern headphones with EDR support released after 2015 can support bitrates up to 730 kbps.</p><p>

For some reason, all currently tested Bluetooth stacks (Linux (PulseAudio), Android, Blackberry and macOS) have artificial restrictions of maximum bitpool parameter, which directly affects the maximum bitrate. But this is not the biggest problem, almost all headphones also limit the maximum bitpool value to 53.<br>
As I've already seen in my tests, most devices work fine on a modified Bluetooth stack with a bitrate of 551 kbps, without interrupts and crackling. But such a bitrate will never be negotiated under normal conditions, with stock Bluetooth stacks.</p><h2>Bluetooth stack modification</h2><p>Every A2DP-compatible Bluetooth stack should support Dual Channel mode, but there's no way to force usage of this mode.</p><p>

Let's add a switch to the user interface! I made patches for Android 8.1 and Android 9, which add full support for Dual Channel into the stack and into developer menu, and handle Dual Channel mode as an additional «HD Audio» codec like aptX, AAC or LDAC by adding a tick to the Bluetooth device settings Here's what it looks like:</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/xd/k_/nn/xdk_nnwukcz446jxexaes4pdscw.png" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/k_/nn/xdk_nnwukcz446jxexaes4pdscw.png"></p><p>

<a href="https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:bt-sbc-hd-dualchannel+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)">Android 8.1 patch</a></p><p>

This checkbox toggles Dual Channel mode which is configured to use <b>551 kbps</b> for EDR 3 Mb/s devices and <b>452 kbps</b> for EDR 2 Mb/s devices.</p><p>

This patchset has been merged into the following alternative firmwares:</p><ul>
<li><b>LineageOS 15.1</b> (since 31 March, 2019) and <b>16.0</b> (since May 13, 2019)</li>
<li><b>Resurrection Remix</b> (since May 14, 2019)</li>
<li><b>crDroid</b> (since May 13, 2019)</li>
</ul><h2>Where did 551 and 452 kbps come from?</h2><p>Bluetooth time division technology is designed to efficiently transmit large fixed-size packets. Data transfer occurs in slots, the largest number of slots sent in one transmission is 5. There are also transfer modes using 1 or 3 slots, but not 2 or 4. You can transfer up to 679 bytes in 5 slots, at a connection speed of 2 Mbps, and up to 1021 bytes at a speed of 3 Mbps. In 3 slots maximum amount of data is 367 and 552 bytes, respectively.</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/6c9/653/b866c9653eeb255db44e7fd94a409a90.png" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/6c9/653/b866c9653eeb255db44e7fd94a409a90.png"></p><p>

If we want to transfer less data than 679 or 1021 bytes but more than 367 or 552 bytes, the transfer will still take 5 slots, and the transmission will take the same amount of time, which reduces the transmission efficiency.</p><p>

44100 Hz audio encoded using SBC in Dual Channel mode with bitpool = 38, 16 blocks in a frame, 8 frequency bands, produces audio frame of 164 bytes, with 452 kb/s bitrate.<br>
Audio payload should be encapsulated into L2CAP and AVDTP transmission protocols, which deduct 16 bytes of overhead from the audio payload.</p><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/formulas/b5d/9b7/6de/b5d9b76de49674bf1b01dc6a373de765.svg" alt="$\begin{align*} framelength &amp;= 4 + \frac{subbands \times channels}{2} + \\ &amp; \begin{cases} \frac{blocks \times channels \times bitpool}{8} &amp; \text{if mono or dual channel mode} \\ \frac{subbands+blocks \times bitpool}{8} &amp; \text{if joint stereo mode} \\ \frac{blocks \times bitpool}{8} &amp; \text{if stereo mode} \\ \end{cases} \end{align*}$" data-tex="display"></p><p>



One 5-slot audio transmission can contain up to 4 audio frames:</p><pre><code>679 (EDR 2 mbit/s DH5) - 4 (L2CAP) - 12 (AVDTP/RTP) - 1 (SBC header) - (164*4) = 6</code></pre><p>
A single packet transmits up to 11.7 ms of audio data, which will be transmitted in 3.75 ms, and we have 6 unused bytes left in the packet.<br>
If you slightly raise the bitpool, 4 audio frames can no longer be packed into a single transmission. You'll have to send 3 frames at a time, which reduces transmission efficiency, reduces the amount of audio transmitted in one packet, and will increase chance for audio stutter under poor radio conditions.</p><p>

551 kbps bitrate for EDR 3 Mbps was selected using the same principle: with Bitpool 47, 16 blocks per frame, 8 frequency bands, the frame size is 200 bytes, with a bit rate of 551 kbps. Single transmission can bundle up to 5 frames or 14.6 ms of music.</p><p>

The algorithm for calculating all the SBC parameters is quite complicated, you can easily make a mistake if you try to calculate all of them manually, so I made an interactive calculator to help those who interested:<br>
<a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator/">btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator</a></p><h2>What is that all for?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief of aptX sound quality, in some cases it can produce worse audio quality than SBC with a standard 328k bitrate.</p><p>

SBC dynamically allocates quantization bits for frequency bands, acting on a «bottom-to-top» basis. If the whole bitrate was used for the lower and middle frequencies, the upper frequencies are «cut off» (silenced).<br>
aptX quantizes frequency bands with the same number of bits constantly, which makes it a constant bitrate codec: 352 kbps for 44.1 kHz, 384 kbps for 48 kHz. It can't «transfer bits» to frequencies that need them most. Unlike SBC, aptX will not «cut» frequencies, but will add quantization noise to them, reducing the dynamic range of audio, and sometimes introducing crackles. SBC, on the contrary, «eats the details» — discards the quietest areas.<br>
On average, compared to SBC 328k, aptX makes less distortion in music with a wide frequency range, but on music with a narrow frequency range and a wide dynamic range SBC 328k sometimes wins.</p><p>

Let us consider a special case, a piano recording. Here's a spectrogram:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/nq/rc/ernqrcwa0ic5mqwopjg5zbu_fxm.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/i9/uh/z1/i9uhz1ewchvoprxywldrtfknlom.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i9/uh/z1/i9uhz1ewchvoprxywldrtfknlom.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

Most energy locates in the 0-4 kHz frequencies, and lasts up to 10 kHz.<br>
The spectrogram of the file aptX file looks like this:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/bl/do/dlbldoq_rdrjykephl2ostfbafk.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/sx/3i/lw/sx3ilwm6riwrjelw-ofmljdd54m.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/3i/lw/sx3ilwm6riwrjelw-ofmljdd54m.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

Here is SBC 328k:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/3m/ke/us3mke0av1s_1ezkyk6ycq1g2vo.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/ah/ob/br/ahobbramaxjmsr0htxagkiflomk.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ah/ob/br/ahobbramaxjmsr0htxagkiflomk.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

It can be seen that the SBC 328k periodically completely cut off the range above 16 kHz, and used all available bitrates for the frequency ranges below this value. However, aptX introduced more distortions into the frequency spectrum audible by the human ear, which can be seen on the subtracted original audio spectrogram from the aptX spectrogram (the brighter, the more distortion):<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ug/-i/5z/ug-i5zpihrfnvumf9no_glecqna.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/_e/vj/gv/_evjgvlrkbymm5ptv5ymkn2orya.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/vj/gv/_evjgvlrkbymm5ptv5ymkn2orya.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

SBC 328k has introduced less distortion to the signal in the range from 0 to 10 kHz, and the rest frequences had been сut:<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/x8/7z/tfx87z8hpenx51spblrfvkc-ihe.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/-a/m6/23/-am623wsmq09jfcr80kmkjubp0u.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/m6/23/-am623wsmq09jfcr80kmkjubp0u.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

485k bitrate was enough for SBC to save the entire frequency range, without cutting off the bands.<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_c/mc/xy/_cmcxyxwlf7u4tv-rbplwk5bmtu.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/xx/a0/pa/xxa0patcvltugsfjwxzmh_na_rm.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/a0/pa/xxa0patcvltugsfjwxzmh_na_rm.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

SBC 485k produces much better results in the range of 0-15 kHz on this sample than aptX, and a smaller but still noticeable difference at 15-22 kHz (the darker, the less distortion):<br>
<a href="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e-/qz/h8/e-qzh8azmingcbhvuwxj8iptuau.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780q1/webt/yv/mi/7v/yvmi7vfj5-ot3ztrfv-gvx43yxy.jpeg" alt="image" data-src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/mi/7v/yvmi7vfj5-ot3ztrfv-gvx43yxy.jpeg" data-blurred="true"></a></p><p>

By switching to a high-bitrate SBC you will get sound which is superior to aptX most of the time, on any headphones. On headphones with EDR 3 Mb/s support, 551 kb/s SBC produces sound that is very close to aptX HD.</p><h2>Can we go even further?</h2><p>Android patchset has an additional option to increase bitrate for EDR 2 mbps devices even further. You can bump the bitrate from 452 kbps to 595 kbps, at the cost of reducing the stability of the transmission in case of congested radio conditions.<br>
Just set the persist.bluetooth.sbc_hd_higher_bitrate variable to 1:</p><pre><code># setprop persist.bluetooth.sbc_hd_higher_bitrate 1</code></pre><p>
Extreme bit rate patch is currently merged only in LineageOS 15.1, but not in 16.0.</p><h2>Compatibility with the devices</h2><p>SBC Dual Channel is supported by almost all headphones, speakers and car head units. This is no wonder — the standard mandates its support in any decoding devices. There are a small number of devices on which this mode causes problems, but these are very rare cases.<br>
More details on compatible devices can be found at <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=914135">4pda</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/improve-bluetooth-audio-quality-t3832615">xda-developers</a>.</p><h2>Sound difference comparison</h2><p>I made a web service that encodes audio to SBC (as well as to aptX and aptX HD) in real time, right in the browser. You can compare the sound of different SBC profiles and other codecs without actually transmitting audio via Bluetooth using this service, on any wired headphones, speakers, and on your favorite music. You can also change the encoding parameters directly during audio playback.<br>
<a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-encoder/">btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-encoder</a></p><h2>Contacting Android developers</h2><p>I tried to contact many Bluetooth stack developers from Google, asking them to consider including my patches to the main Android branch—AOSP, but did not receive a single answer. My patches in <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:bt-sbc-hd-dualchannel+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged)">Gerrit code review system for Android</a> have not received any comments from anyone involved in the development as well.<br>
I would be glad if anyone could tell Google developers about this implementation of SBC HD for Android. The gerrit patchset is already out of date (this is one of the earliest revisions), but I will update it if developers are interested in my changes (it's not easy for me to update it, I don't have Android Q compatible devices).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Users of LineageOS, Resurrection Remix and crDroid firmwares can enhance Bluetooth audio quality by ticking a checkbox in Bluetooth device settings. Linux users can also get a higher SBC bitrate by installing <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pulseaudio-discuss/2019-June/031168.html"> the patch from Pali Rohár</a>, which among other things, adds support for the aptX, aptX HD and FastStream codecs.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Indeed, we now know that despite its supposedly bullet-proof organizational structure and its stated mission of responsible AI development, OpenAI was never going to be allowed to actually put ethics before money.</p><p>To be clear, AI safety is a really important field, and, were it to be actually practiced by corporate America, that would be one thing.<strong> </strong>That said, the version of it that  existed at OpenAI—arguably one of the companies that has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done the most</a></span> to pursue a “safety” oriented model—doesn’t seem to have been much of a match for the realpolitik machinations of the tech industry. In even more frank terms, the  folks who were supposed to be defending us from runaway AI (i.e., the board members)—the ones who were ordained with responsible stewardship over this powerful technology—don’t seem to have known what they were doing. They don’t seem to  have understood that Sam had all the industry  connections, the friends in high places, was well-liked, and that moving against him in a world where that kind of social capital is everything amounted to career suicide. If you come at the king, you best not miss.</p><p>In short: If the point of corporate AI safety is to protect humanity from runaway AI, then, as an effective strategy for doing that, it has effectively just flunked its first big test. That’s because it’s sorta hard to put your faith in a group of people who weren’t even capable of predicting the very predictable outcome that would occur when they fired their boss. How, exactly, can such a group be trusted with overseeing a supposedly “super-intelligent,” world-shattering technology? If you can’t outfox a gaggle of outraged investors, then you probably can’t outfox the Skynet-type entity you claim to be building. That said, I would argue we also can’t trust the craven, money-obsessed C-suite that has now reasserted its dominance. Imo, they’re <em>obviously</em> not going to do the right thing. So, effectively, humanity is stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>As the conflict from the OpenAI dustup settles, it seems like the company is well positioned to get back to business as usual.

Companies realize that the technologies they are selling can be disconcerting and disruptive; they want to reassure the public that they’re doing their best to protect consumers and society. At the end of the day, though, we now know there’s no reason  to believe that those efforts will ever make a difference if the company’s “ethics” end up conflicting with its money.

Rust has been a prominent topic at the Kernel Maintainers Summit for the
last couple of years, and the 2023 meeting continued that tradition.  As
Rust-for-Linux developer Miguel Ojeda noted at the beginning of the session
dedicated to the topic, the level of interest in using Rust for kernel
development has increased significantly over the last year.  But Rust was
explicitly added to Linux as an experiment; is the kernel community now
ready to say that the experiment has succeeded?
</p><p>
The Rust-for-Linux project has added a full-time engineer in the last year,
Ojeda said, and a student developer as well.  Various companies have joined
in to support this work.  There is also work underway to get the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/698724/">Coccinelle</a> tool working with Rust code.  A
priority at the moment is bringing in more reviewers for the code that is
being posted.
</p><p>
On the toolchain front, work on <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">gccrs</a>, the GCC-based Rust
compiler, has slowed significantly.  The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc">GCC code generator
for <tt>rustc</tt></a> is showing better progress; it can compile kernel
code now and has been merged into the compiler.  This GCC-based backend
will enable the expansion of Rust support to architectures that are not
supported by the LLVM-based <tt>rustc</tt>.  Meanwhile, the Rust project
itself is increasing its involvement in this work; this is good, since the
kernel has some unique requirements and will need guarantees that language
changes won't break kernel code in the future.
</p><p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/952032/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/MiguelOjeda-sm.png" alt="[Miguel Ojeda]" title="Miguel Ojeda"></a>

Within the kernel, work is proceeding in a number of subsystems.  The Rust
implementation of Android's binder is working well and its performance is
on a par with the C implementation.  The amount of unsafe code that was
needed to get there was pleasingly small.  Filesystem bindings are the
subject of work by Wedson Almeida Filho, who is targeting read-only support
for now.  The object there is to make it possible to implement a filesystem
in 100% safe Rust.
</p><p>
In general, he is finding an increasing number of maintainers who are open
to the idea of using Rust.  That leads to an issue the Rust developers have
run up against, though.  It would be good to have some reference drivers in
the kernel as an example of how drivers can be written and to make it
possible to compare Rust and C drivers.  The best way to do that often
seems to be to merge a Rust driver that duplicates the functionality of an
existing C driver — but that sort of duplicate functionality is not
welcomed by maintainers.  Perhaps, he said, it would be good to allow a few
duplicate drivers that are not meant for actual use, but only as examples
for other developers to use.
</p><p>
There are some other challenges; upstreaming the block-layer abstractions
has run into some resistance.  Virtual filesystem layer maintainer
Christian Brauner said that he is not opposed to merging those
abstractions, but he would rather not do that and see filesystems built on
it right away.  He would prefer to see an implementation of something
relatively simple, along the lines of the binder driver, to show that
things work as expected.
</p><h4>A driver soon?</h4>
<p>
Dave Airlie, the maintainer of the DRM (graphics) subsystem, said that, if
he has his way, there will be a Rust DRM driver merged within the next
couple of releases.  Christoph Hellwig shot back that Airlie was willing to
"make everybody's life hell" so that he could play with his favorite toy.
Merging Rust, Hellwig said, would force others to deal with a second language,
new toolchains, and "wrappers with weird semantics".  Dan Williams said
that the current situation "is what success looks like", and that the
kernel community was already committed to Rust.
</p><p>
Airlie continued that a lot of the Rust work is currently blocked in a sort
of chicken-and-egg problem.  Abstractions cannot be merged until there is a
user for them, but the code needing those abstractions is blocked waiting
for code to land in multiple subsystems.  As a result, developers working
on Rust are dragging around large stacks of patches that they need to get
their code to work.  Breaking that roadblock will require letting in some
abstractions without immediate users.  Ojeda agreed that this problem has
been slowing progress, but said he has tried not to put pressure on
maintainers to merge code quickly.  In the case of networking, ironically,
the Rust developers <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/949270/">had to ask the networking
maintainers to slow down</a> merging Rust code.
</p><p>
The conversation took several directions from there.  Greg Kroah-Hartman
said that merging the binder driver would be a good next step; it is
self-contained, has a single user that is committed to its maintenance, and
doesn't touch the rest of the kernel.  Kees Cook disputed the description
of Rust as a "toy", saying that there is a lot of pressure to not use C for
new code; Hellwig responded that the developers would have to rewrite
everything in Rust, otherwise the resulting dual-language code base would
be worse than what exists now.
</p><p>
Dave Chinner worried that maintainers lack the expertise to properly review
the abstractions that are being merged.  Airlie replied that maintainers
merge a lot of C APIs now without really understanding how they work.  A
lot of mistakes have been made in the process, but "we're still here".
When things turn out to be broken, they can be fixed, and that will happen
more quickly if the code goes upstream.
</p><p>
Ted Ts'o expressed concern about the burden that adding Rust code will
place on maintainers.  The Rust developers are setting higher standards
than have been set in the past, he said.  Getting good abstractions merged
is one thing, but who is responsible for reviewing drivers, and how will
tree-wide changes be handled?  The Rust effort, he said, is getting to a
point where it is impacting a growing part of the community.
</p><p>
Williams pointed out that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/951846/">the previous
session</a> had discussed how hard it is to get kernel subsystems to move
to new APIs; now, he said, there is talk of moving to a whole new language.
Hellwig said that the real problem is that the Rust bindings tend to work
differently than the C APIs they provide abstractions for; the new APIs may
well be better, but they are still completely new APIs.  What should be done,
he said, is to first fix the C APIs so that they are directly usable by
Rust code.  He proposed that, for each subsystem that is considering
bringing in Rust code, a year or two should first be spent on cleaning up
its APIs along those lines.  Ojeda said that this kind of API improvement
has already happened in some subsystems.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds said that he was seeing a divide between the filesystem and
driver maintainers.  Developers on the filesystem side tend to be more
conservative, while the driver world "is the wild west".  Driver authors
tend not to understand concurrency, he said, and a lot of the code there is
broken and unfixable.  So it is unsurprising that there is interest in
bringing in a language that better supports the writing of correct and safe
code.
</p><p>
Brauner said that Rust can help with a lot of problems, since the compiler
can keep a lot of bugs from making it into the kernel.  But he worried
about whether there would be maintainer and development support for it a
few years from now.  Airlie again mentioned developers with out-of-tree
code needed by Rust code; Cook answered that the people shepherding that
code <i>are</i> maintainers, and that bringing it in would bring the
maintainers with it.  Airlie added that those maintainers are the sort of
younger developers that the kernel community would like to attract.
</p><p>
Chinner said that he would like to see a reimplementation of the ext2
filesystem in Rust.  It is a complete filesystem that makes wide use of the
kernel's APIs, but it is still small enough to read and understand.  If the
Rust APIs can support an ext2 implementation, they will be enough to
implement others as well.  Meanwhile, the ext2 implementation would be good
reference for maintainers, who could compare it to the C version.
</p><h4>Confidence</h4>
<p>
Ts'o asked when the community would feel enough confidence that it could
have modules where the only implementation is in Rust.  Binder could be a
good start, he said, perhaps followed by a driver that sees wider use.
Airlie said that he is considering a virtual graphics driver that
reimplements an existing C driver.  There is also the driver for Apple M1
GPUs.  He is feeling a fair amount of pressure to get it upstream and
is wondering if there is any reason why he should keep it out.  After that,
he would love to see a rewrite of the Nouveau driver for NVIDIA GPUs.
</p><p>
Arnd Bergmann said those drivers could be OK, but that it will be quite a
bit longer before something like a keyboard driver could be merged; the
toolchain just isn't ready, he said, for a driver what would be widely
used.  That led to a question about the frequent version upgrades being
seen in the kernel, which moved to Rust 1.73.0 for 6.7.  That upgrade
process will eventually stop and a minimum Rust version will be set once
the important features that the kernel depends on have stabilized.  He said
that he has been working to get the kernel code into the Rust
continuous-integration tests to help ensure that it continues working as
the compiler and language evolve.
</p><p>
Bergmann said that he didn't plan to look seriously at the language until
it could be compiled with GCC.  Torvalds answered that, while he used to
find problems in the LLVM Clang compiler, now he's more likely to find
problems with GCC instead; he now builds with Clang.  Ojeda said that he is
working on finding developer resources for gccrs; the project is currently
sitting on over 800 out-of-tree patches and still has a lot of work to do
on top of that.  GCC support will be a while, he said.
</p><p>
Ts'o complained that the language still isn't entirely stable.  This could
be a particular problem for the confidential-computing community; they are
concerned about security and, as a consequence, about backports to
long-term-support kernels.  But if those kernels are on different Rust
versions, those backports will be problematic.  Ojeda said that, while it
is a "crazy idea", backporting the version upgrades could be considered.
He doesn't think that the change rate will be high enough to be a problem,
though.
</p><p>
At the conclusion, Torvalds pointed out that there have been problems over
the years with GCC changes breaking the kernel; the same will surely happen
with Rust, but it will be the same thing in the end.  The session, well
over time, was brought to a halt at this point.  Whether the kernel
community has truly concluded that it is committed to Rust remains to be
seen; there will almost certainly be pull requests adding significant Rust
code in the near future.<br clear="all"></p><table>

By mass, there’s more titanium in the earth’s crust than carbon by a factor of nearly 30, and more titanium than copper by a factor of nearly 100.</span></p><p><span>But despite its abundance, it's only recently that civilization has been able to use titanium as a metal (titanium dioxide has been in use somewhat longer as a paint pigment). Because titanium so readily bonds with oxygen and other elements, it doesn’t occur at all in metallic form in nature. </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0801280/page/n71/mode/1up?q=%22difficult+to+machine%22" rel="">One engineer</a><span> described titanium as a “streetwalker," because it will pick up anything and everything. While copper has been used by civilization since 7000 BC, and iron since around 3000 BC, titanium wasn’t discovered until the late 1700s, and wasn’t produced in metallic form until the late 19th century. As late as 1945, there was no commercial production of titanium, and the metal only existed in tiny amounts in labs. But less than 10 years later, thousands of tons of it were being made a year. And 10 years after that, it formed the literal backbone of the most advanced aerospace technology on the planet.</span></p><p><span>As a report to the </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/1712/chapter/4#14" rel="">National Research Council notes</a><span>, “the birth of a tonnage structural metal industry is an unusual event. Only three such births have occurred in the past 100 years [now closer to 150] – aluminum, magnesium, and titanium – and no new one is in prospect.” How did titanium go from totally unused to a critical aerospace technology? What does it tell us about technological development? Let’s take a look.</span></p><p>Titanium was first discovered in 1790 by William Gregor, an English clergyman and chemist who realized he couldn’t identify a metal contained in a white oxide mixed in with the black sands of Cornwall. In 1795, Martin Klaproth, a Prussian chemist, was able to extract titanium from the mineral rutile. Because of the strong bond it formed with oxygen, Klaproth named the metal “titanium” after the Greek Titans.</p><p>Because titanium bonds so readily with other elements and contaminates so easily, it's extremely difficult to obtain in a pure state, and for the next hundred years titanium was mostly regarded as a laboratory curiosity. In the 1880s, two Swedish scientists successfully produced 94% pure titanium metal, and in 1910 Matthew Hunter, a scientist at General Electric, developed a variant of their process to produce metallic titanium while searching for a material for improved lightbulb filaments.</p><p>But a commercially viable process for producing titanium wasn’t developed until the 1930s. In 1930 William Kroll, a scientist from Luxembourg, began experimenting with titanium in his home lab, and developed a process to produce titanium by reacting titanium chloride (TiCl4) with magnesium under a vacuum. By 1938, he had successfully produced 50 pounds of titanium metal, and successfully formed it into wires, rods, sheets, and plating. Kroll came to the US in 1938 to attempt to sell his process, but was unsuccessful.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png" width="724" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:561,&quot;width&quot;:724,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f78383e-815c-442f-b206-3a135861b996_724x561.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Kroll’s samples of titanium metal in 1938, via Kroll 1955</figcaption></figure></div><p>That same year, the US Bureau of Mines began to investigate titanium, in response to promising studies of its properties performed by the Philips Corporation (which had developed its own process for producing titanium). The Bureau of Mines concluded the Kroll process had the most potential as a commercial process and began to develop it. Its work was delayed by the war, but as early as 1944 the Bureau of Mines was making 15-pound batches of titanium in a plant that could make 100 pounds of titanium a week.</p><p>After the war, the Bureau’s work on titanium accelerated. By 1947 it had successfully scaled up Kroll’s process, and had produced two tons of titanium “sponge,” a porous, spongy metal created by the process, which is melted down to produce bars, sheets, wires, etc. A 1948 report on titanium’s properties commissioned by the Bureau concluded that titanium and its alloys had great potential engineering applications. Titanium was nearly as strong as stainless steel, but weighed 40% less. It was also incredibly corrosion-resistant, and maintained much more strength at elevated temperatures compared to aluminum. This made it potentially very useful for aerospace applications, where weight was at a premium and materials were often exposed to high temperatures.</p><p>The military had followed the progress of the Bureau’s development work, and interest in the metal was high after samples began to be investigated by Army, Navy, and Air Force labs. Titanium began to be called a “wonder metal”:</p><blockquote><p><em>The metal gained numerous advocates within the military and industry. Early promoters visualized the use of titanium in naval vessels, armor plate, tanks, trucks, landing craft, aircraft structures, and airborne equipment. It was thought that it could possibly replace both aluminum and steel in the design of many defense applications. - Simcoe 2018</em></p></blockquote><p>In 1948, titanium first began to be produced commercially, at a small DuPont plant that could produce 100 pounds of titanium a day. The first batches of titanium went to experimental use on military jets, such as the F-84 and the F-86. To try to kickstart the industry, the Air Force encouraged manufacturers to substitute steel with titanium, and the Army Ordnance Corporation placed an order for $1 million worth of titanium metal.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png" width="839" height="639" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:639,&quot;width&quot;:839,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa24e7ebd-a9b3-4ecf-abc5-a2d34c0b14ff_839x639.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>F-84, via wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div><p>In the press, titanium began to be called “the wonder metal," “the miracle metal," and the “Cinderella metal” (because it had been overlooked for so long). An executive for a company producing titanium noted that “Sensational magazine articles predicted that titanium would become the miracle metal-for spacecraft, ‘atomic furnaces,’ airplanes of all kinds, submarines, railroad tracks, truck bodies, portable bridges” (Rowley 1972). Between 1950 and 1952, more than two dozen companies announced plans to produce titanium.</p><p>But the nascent titanium industry struggled. In 1951, the materials advisory board projected the need for 30,000 tons of titanium products, but actual shipments were just 75 tons, barely enough for research applications. Producers had assumed that the same equipment for melting, rolling, and shaping stainless steel could be used for titanium, but this turned out to be very difficult: titanium didn’t behave like steel, or like any other metal. Titanium was found “not to forge like any other material,” (DTIC 1952) and stamping it in presses damaged the stamping dies. A company that studied grinding titanium noted that “titanium grinds unlike steel. Anything you have learned concerning the effective grinding of steel does not apply in the case of titanium”. The first attempts to use titanium on commercial aircraft resulted in a sheet of metal so brittle it could be torn in half like a sheet of paper. Mills found that they often “produced more scrap than useful metal" (Simcoe 2018).</p><p>To support the budding industry, the US government stepped in. It funded the construction of several titanium sponge plants, and agreed to purchase any surplus titanium sponge production for the national stockpile. It offered rapid amortization of titanium production equipment for tax purposes, and demonstrated production techniques at the Bureau of Mines’ pilot plant. The Army funded projects to develop better alloys, including one of 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) that remains the most popular alloy of titanium today, and is credited with saving the titanium industry. When it was found that rolling titanium into sheets consistently was difficult, in 1956 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop sheet rolling of titanium, “one of the most comprehensive technical programs ever undertaken in metallurgy” (Simcoe 2018). Production problems were overcome, and titanium was increasingly used for aerospace applications.

To meet the unprecedented performance requirements (a cruising speed of Mach 3 and a cruising altitude of nearly 90,000 feet), Lockheed needed a metal that would retain its strength at the hundreds of degrees the exterior of the plane would reach. This ruled out aluminum, leaving either stainless steel or titanium. Ultimately, titanium alloy was selected for the A-12, as it would cut the gross weight of the plane nearly in half.</p><p><span>Titanium had never been used to such an extent on an aircraft, or anywhere else. Lockheed had worked with titanium on a small scale since 1949 but prior to the A-12 titanium had mostly been used for small components on jet engines. For several years, for instance, 50% of all titanium was used in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_J57" rel="">J-57 jet engine</a><span>. But on the A-12, titanium would be used for nearly every part of the airplane – 93% of the gross weight of the A-12’s structure was titanium.</span></p><p>Building a plane out of titanium proved difficult. Initially Lockheed “had no idea how to extrude it, push it through into various shapes, or weld or rivet or drill it” (Rich 1994), and every production problem solved seemed to reveal two or three more. Titanium was found to be “totally incompatible” with chemicals like chlorine, fluorine, and cadmium. In one case, an engineer who marked a sheet of titanium using a pen with chlorine-based ink was shocked to see the ink etch away the metal like acid. Titanium bolts that were heated had their heads pop off, a problem that was eventually traced to cadmium-coated wrenches used to tighten them. Titanium welds made in the summer unexpectedly failed, due to (it was eventually realized) chlorine that the local utility added to the water during the summer to prevent algae growth.</p><p>When Lockheed tried to fabricate a portion of the forward fuselage, which had to be made from a novel “beta” titanium alloy, it found that the titanium was so brittle after heat treating that it would shatter if dropped on the floor. This was eventually resolved by replacing an acid-pickling process with one identical to that of Lockheed’s supplier, but not before scrapping thousands of titanium components. Of the first 6000 pieces fabricated from the beta titanium alloy, 95% were lost.</p><p>But over time, Lockheed overcame its production problems. In machining, for instance, drill bits initially needed to be replaced every ten holes, ten times as often as when drilling aluminum. In other machining operations, the rate of metal removal was just 5% of the rate when machining aluminum. To improve its machining, Lockheed developed new drill bits, cutting fluids, and cutting machinery, and learned the proper “feeds and speeds” for machining titanium (it was found, for instance, that small changes in cutting speed had a large effect on tool life). Over the course of the program, the rate of metal removal in machining was increased to “3 to 10 times the industry average” (Johnson 1970), and drill life was increased by more than a factor of 10.</p><p>The A-12 “practically spawned its own industrial base” (CIA 2012), and over the course of the program thousands of machinists, mechanics, fabricators, and other personnel were trained in how to work with titanium efficiently. As Lockheed gained production experience with titanium, it issued reports to the Air Force and to its vendors on production methods, and “set up training classes for machinists, a complete research facility for developing tools and procedures, and issued research contracts to competent outside vendors to develop improved equipment" (Johnson 1970).</p><p>The A-12 first flew in 1962. 14 years later, its successor, the better-known SR-71, set an airspeed record of nearly 2200 miles per hour, which remains unbroken today.</p><p>While titanium manufacturing for aerospace was ramping up, a very different use of the metal was being discovered. In 1952, Swedish medical researcher Per-Ingvar Brånemark was studying blood flow in healing bones. In one experiment studying the bone marrow of rabbits, Brånemark’s team implanted a tiny camera into rabbits legs, to watch the wound heal from the inside. When they later went to remove the camera, they found that the titanium camera casing had bonded with the bone.</p><p>At the time, it was thought that the body would eventually reject any foreign object implanted in it. Dr. Brånemark’s discovery that bone would bond directly with titanium (which he dubbed “osseointegration”) was radical, and had huge potential implications for medical implants. Brånemark quickly pivoted his research to study osseointegration, eventually receiving a grant from the US National Institutes of Health. Research on his own students (where he implanted a small piece of titanium in their arms) showed that titanium could be safely implanted in the body with no ill-effects.</p><p>Interestingly, during the course of this research, it was noticed that bone could conduct sound – a deaf patient was able to “hear” the ultrasonic vibrations used to check that the titanium had been implanted correctly. One of Brånemark’s students followed up on this discovery, and developed the first bone conduction implants to restore hearing in deaf people.</p><p><span>Brånemark’s team went on to develop titanium dental implants (which were often made from </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EhnsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Titanium+world+war+2&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;source=gb_mobile_search&amp;ovdme=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi4uIr5zen_AhWukWoFHQT1Av0Q6AF6BAgDEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Titanium%20world%20war%202&amp;f=false" rel="">surplus aircraft-grade titanium</a><span>) that lasted much longer than implants of other metals. Today, the Brånemark system of dental implants is still sold, and titanium is the most popular material for dental implants, as well as being used for other medical implants such as </span><a href="https://www.addmoretolives.com/titanium-vs-ceramic-which-type-of-hip-replacement-implant-is-better-for-you/" rel="">artificial hips</a><span>.</span></p><p>You can get a sense of the development of the titanium industry by reading reports on industrial symposiums held in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA382831/page/n3/mode/2up?q=subsidy" rel="">first symposium on titanium</a><span> was held in 1948, and was organized by the Navy to provide “a comprehensive review of the titanium research effort”. Several military organizations discussed their research programs, but most of the presentations were on topics such as physical properties of titanium and its various alloys, the crystal structure that resulted from different methods of fabrication, and methods of melting titanium sponge. The pages are full of pictures of laboratory setups, graphs of data on stress-strain relationships, phase diagrams, and magnified pictures of titanium microstructure. Nearly all the presentations are from either research labs or from companies trying to produce raw titanium “sponge” from ore.</span></p><p><span>In 1952, </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0635553/page/n30/mode/1up?q=subsidy" rel="">another titanium symposium</a><span> was held, this one sponsored by the Army’s Watertown Arsenal. By then, titanium was being manufactured in large quantities, and while the prior symposium had been focused on laboratory studies of titanium’s physical and chemical properties, the 1952 symposium was a “practical discussion of the properties, processing, machinability, and similar characteristics of titanium". While physical characteristics of titanium still took center stage, there was a practical slant to the discussions – how wide a sheet of titanium can be produced, how large an ingot of it can be made, how can it be forged, or pressed, or welded, and so on. Presentations were by titanium fabricators, but also by metalworking companies that had been experimenting with the metal.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Though by 1952 many of these companies had been working with titanium for years, there’s an air of uncertainty in many of the presentations, a distinct sense of “this is what we’ve learned so far, but there’s still much we don’t know.” A company that studied the effects of different working fluids when grinding titanium admitted that not enough was known about the chemistry at work to understand why different fluids had different effects. A company that studied surface treatments and polishing methods noted that “materials and methods for polishing titanium have not been definitively established," and that while “the most commonly used abrasives are not completely satisfactory," manufacturers were working on the problem, and “more efficient methods will no doubt be developed”. A company that studied cold-forming of titanium sheets described its own methods as “crude and undeveloped”.</p><p><span>In 1966, </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0801280/page/n71/mode/1up?q=%22difficult+to+machine%22" rel="">another titanium symposium was held</a><span>, this one sponsored by the Northrup Corporation. By this time, titanium had been used successfully for many years, and the purpose of this symposium was to “provide technical personnel of diversified disciplines with a working knowledge of titanium technology.” This time, the lion’s share of the presentations are by aerospace companies experienced in working with the metal, and the uncertain air that existed in the 1952 symposium is gone. A presenter on titanium’s corrosion resistance noted that “the corrosion resistance of titanium, unlike that of most metals, can be defined within rather simple limits." A presentation on forging noted that “titanium alloys are quite forgeable…The evidence which substantiates this statement is the large number of jet engine and missile components plus the growing lists of structural parts that have been produced in the last 10 years.” And a presentation on machining noted that “Fifteen years ago, titanium was considered to be very difficult to machine. Subsequent research and experience, however, have progressively improved this situation," the result of “gradual refinements in tool materials, machine tools, tool geometries, and cutting fluids”.</span></p><p>Thus, by the mid-1960s, titanium had become a mature engineering material. While there was still much to learn about titanium, the practical aspects of working with it and using it to solve engineering problems were well-understood, and it increasingly found use in aerospace and other industry applications. Following the A-12, for instance, military aircraft began to make extensive use of titanium in their structural frames. From military aircraft, titanium made its way into commercial aircraft. By 1971, 46% of titanium was going towards commercial aircraft, compared to 37% to government aerospace projects.</p><p>What can we learn from the story of titanium?</p><p>For one, titanium is a government research success story. Titanium metal was essentially willed into existence by the US government, which searched for a promising production process, successfully scaled it up when it found one, and performed much of the initial research on titanium’s material properties, potential alloys, and manufacturing methods. Nearly all early demand for titanium was for government aerospace projects, and when the nascent industry struggled, the government stepped in to subsidize production. As a result, titanium achieved a level of production in 10 years that took aluminum and magnesium nearly 30.</p><p>The government’s support of the early industry was successful: shortly after the program was initiated in 1951, the cost of titanium began to decline more steeply. Since then, titanium costs have fallen at an impressive 23% learning rate (ie: costs fall 23% every time cumulative production doubles), similar to the learning rate in solar PV production. When government subsidies were removed in the late 1950s, the industry struggled, but cost declines continued. And from the initial government projects in military aerospace, titanium has spread into commercial aircraft, medical implants, industrial equipment, and other uses. Titanium is thus a successful case of the government jumpstarting an industry.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png" width="681" height="471" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:471,&quot;width&quot;:681,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb915cb8-1ca7-40ba-83b8-d7dbcdfadb15_681x471.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via USGS data</figcaption></figure></div><p>But titanium is also a story about the limits of this sort of jumpstarting. Despite its impressive learning rate, titanium remains an expensive, niche material. A 2006 report noted that titanium is five times as expensive as aluminum to refine and ten times as expensive as aluminum to turn into finished products. Despite initial expectations, titanium hasn’t widely displaced either aluminum or stainless steel, and is only used where its unique properties make its high cost worth it. The aerospace industry remains the largest user of titanium.</p><p>It's interesting to compare progress in titanium production with progress in solar photovoltaics. In both cases, the basic phenomenon (metallic titanium and producing electricity from sunlight) had been explored in the late 1800s, but it wasn’t until mid-20th century technology breakthroughs (the Kroll process and the silicon PV cell) that they became practical. In both cases, the US government funded much of the initial development, and acted as the first customer (government satellites and government aerospace projects). Both have similar learning curve slopes, and both technologies gradually expanded outside of their initial markets as knowledge was gained and the costs of the technology fell. And in both cases, there were sky-high expectations for the “potentially world-changing technology” that neither initially lived up to.</p><p>But whereas titanium remains a relatively niche, expensive technology, solar PV is increasingly widely deployed, and seems poised to become the primary method of electric power production. In learning curve terms, while both titanium and solar PV have similar learning rates, the solar PV curve has stretched much farther. Between 1975 and today, cumulative titanium production has increased by perhaps a factor of 5-10 (cumulative US consumption of titanium sponge was about 250,000 tons in 1975, and about 1.3 million tons in 2019). Cumulative solar PV production, on the other hand, has increased by a factor of more than 300,000. Though they have the same learning rate, solar PV has had many more doublings in production volume, and its costs have thus fallen much further.</p><p>I can see at least two potential factors here. One is that solar PV production has seen a much greater level of government support than titanium production has. In addition to early government support in the 1950s, solar PV also saw US and Japanese government investment in the 1970s, and German government support in the 1990s (via a generous feed-in tariff). Today, governments around the world support solar PV via feed in tariffs, tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards. Continued government subsidies have incentivized increased production, which has resulted in the costs of solar PV continuing to fall. Without that government support, the level of production of solar PV would have been much lower, and its march down the learning curve would have happened much more slowly.</p><p>Titanium, on the other hand, has seen much less government support. After subsidies were withdrawn in the late 1950s, the titanium industry has been dependent on large government or commercial aerospace projects. If those fail to materialize (such as when Cold War strategy pivoted from bombers to missiles, or when supersonic commercial aircraft development was canceled), the industry has struggled. If government support of the industry had continued, perhaps it would be farther along on its learning curve.</p><p>The other potential factor is technical: while there are many potential process improvements to solar PV manufacturing, there may be substantially fewer potential improvements in titanium production. In the 1950s, it was hoped/assumed that a better process for producing titanium sponge would come along to replace the Kroll process, which is a laborious and energy-intensive batch process that must be done in an inert atmosphere. But such a process has never materialized, and the Kroll process remains the primary method of refining titanium ore. Likewise, turning titanium sponge into metal is an energy and capital-intensive process, often requiring multiple rounds of melting the metal to achieve sufficient purity. This process has also changed little since the 1950s.</p><p><span>Beyond the lack of process improvements, titanium is just fundamentally difficult and expensive to deal with. Turning titanium ingots into bars and sheets is a challenge due to titanium’s reactivity: it readily absorbs impurities, requiring “frequent surface removal and trimming to eliminate surface defects” which are “costly and involve significant yield loss.” Machining titanium is likewise fundamentally expensive. </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG789.html" rel="">As one report notes</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The hardness that makes titanium so desirable also makes it more difficult to machine than traditional aluminum. This presents a challenge akin to that of machining high-strength steel. However, the process is complicated by titanium’s high reactivity and low thermal conductivity. It is highly reactive and tends to wear tools very quickly, especially at higher temperatures. The low thermal conductivity means that high temperatures can be generated easily in the course of machining. Consequently, titanium must be machined at lower tool speeds, slowing production.</em></p></blockquote><p>If there are simply fewer potential process improvements in titanium production compared to solar PV, due to the lack of better refining processes and the various physical constraints dictated by its chemistry, there’s less room for costs to fall. With less room for costs to fall, titanium remains an expensive, niche material, which in turn keeps production volumes low.</p><p>Titanium is also a story about the importance of serendipity in scientific discovery and technology advancement. Titanium’s biocompatibility, and its usefulness for medical implants, was discovered purely by chance. Studying biocompatibility led to another chance discovery, that of bone conduction of sound. Both of these discoveries led to the development of important medical technology, implants and hearing aids.</p><p>Finally, titanium is also a story about the critical role that manufacturing plays in technology development. The knowledge required to turn titanium into a practical technology came from the research lab, but it also came from the factory floor. Using titanium meant understanding its chemical properties, but it also meant figuring out how to forge it, weld it, press it, turn it into fasteners, design parts effectively with it, designing tools to machine it, and a million other shop floor discoveries that came from actually building things with the metal. As one producer noted, “you cannot ship a customer a carload full of tensile properties, nor a box full of Charpy tests. You have to make something out of the material in order to use these marvelous characteristics.” (DTIC 1952). It's only after the enormous effort to build the all-titanium A-12, and the training of thousands of machinists, fabricators, engineers, and other workers to work with titanium, that we begin to see titanium being used in large amounts in military and commercial aircraft. This sort of practical knowledge – the learning that comes from actual production – is critical for technological progress. Technology consists of materials and machines and ideas, but they’re all stitched together by a collection of people that know how to do things. It’s by way of those people doing those things, and understanding them better and better, that new and better technology becomes possible.</p><ul><li><p>Report of Symposium on Titanium, 1948</p></li><li><p>Proceedings of the titanium symposium at Watertown Arsenal, 1952</p></li><li><p>Titanium 1966: Lectures given at Norair symposium</p></li><li><p>Johnson 1970 - Some Development Aspects of the YF-12A Interceptor</p></li><li><p>Johnson 1981 - Development of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird</p></li><li><p>Rich 1994 - Skunk Works: A personal memoir of my years at Lockheed</p></li><li><p>Donachie 1988 - Titanium: A technical guide</p></li><li><p>Titanium: Past, Present, and Future (1983)</p></li><li><p>Tylecote 1976 - History of metallurgy</p></li><li><p>Simcoe 2018 - The history of metals in America</p></li><li><p>Robarge 2012 - Archangel: CIA’s supersonic A-12 reconnaissance aircraft</p></li><li><p>Seong 2009 - Titanium: industrial base, price trends, and technology initiatives</p></li><li><p>Abkowitz - The emergence of the titanium industry</p></li><li><p>Kroll 1955 - How commercial titanium and zirconium were born</p></li><li><p>Titanium in aerospace applications (1961)</p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Google has <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> it will shut down Manifest V2 in June 2024 and move on to Manifest V3, the latest version of its Chrome extension specification that has faced criticism for putting limits on ad blockers. Roughly said, Manifest V2 and V3 are the rules that browser extension developers have to follow if they want their extensions to get accepted into the Google Play Store.</p>



<p>Manifest V2 is the old model. The Chrome Web Store no longer accepts <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Manifest V2 extensions</a>, but browsers can still use them. For now. Manifest V3 is supported generally in Chrome 88 or later and will be the standard after the transition planned to take place in June 2024.</p>



<p>A popular type of browser extensions are ad blockers. Almost all these ad blockers work with block lists, which are long lists of domains, subdomains, and IP addresses that they filter out of your web traffic. These lists are commonly referred to as rulesets. One part of the transition will <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/improvements-to-content-filtering-in-manifest-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“improve” content filtering</a>. And to be fair, Google has made some compromises when it comes to the version as it’s now in the planning, compared to what it originally planned to do. </p>



<ul>
<li>Originally, each extension could offer users a choice of 50 static rulesets, and 10 of these rulesets could be enabled simultaneously. This changes to 50 extensions simultaneously and 100 in total.</li>



<li>Extensions could add up to 5,000 rules dynamically which encouraged using this functionality sparingly and made it easier for Google to detect abuse. Extensions can add rules dynamically to support more frequent updates and user-defined rules. But it comes with the risks of phishing or data theft because these “updates” are not checked during the Chrome Web Store review. For example, a redirect rule could be abused to inject affiliate links without consent. But Google has decided that <code>block</code> and <code>allow</code> are not that easily abused so it will allow up to 30,000 rules to be added dynamically.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, this is still far from enough to fully reach the potential of the best ad blockers we have now. And it’s not just the hard limits on filtering rulesets, there are a lot of other new limits on filtering. Items can’t be filtered based on the response headers or according to the URL in the address bar. Also, extension developers are limited in what regular expressions they can use, along with other technical limitations.</p>



<p>Even if this is not targeted at ad blockers specifically, it’s still a major change that makes blocking requests less flexible. But the bottom line result is that it limits the API that many ad blockers use, and replace it with a less capable one.</p>



<p>Google’s will tell you that by limiting extensions, the browser can be lighter on resources, and Google can protect your privacy from extension developers and calls it “a step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) however calls Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deceitful and threatening</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Under the new specifications, browser extensions that monitor and filter the web traffic between the browser and the website will have greatly reduced capabilities. This includes ad blockers and privacy-protective tracker blockers. No real surprise, considering Google has trackers installed on <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">75% of the top one million websites</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According</a> to Firefox’s Add-on Operations Manager, most malicious extension that manage to get through the security review process, are usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. So in their mind, what would really help security is a more thorough review process, but that’s not something Google says it has plans for.</p>



<p>After looking at the arguments Google used to justify this transition, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ArsTechnica</a> came to the conclusion that there’s no justification for arbitrarily limiting the list of filter rules. It says once Manifest V3 happens, Chrome users will be limited to light ad blocker functionality while users will need to switch to Firefox or some other non-limited browser to get the full extension.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Firefox said it will adopt Manifest V3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. And Chrome’s market share will certainly have influenced that decision as well.</p>



<p>Google Chrome Enterprise users with the “ExtensionManifestV2Availability” policy turned on will get an extra year of Manifest V2 compatibility. </p>



<p>If you want to help Malwarebytes get ready for the transition, you can <a href="https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/294541-malwarebytes-browser-guard-beta-for-manifest-v3/">test the beta version of Browser Guard</a> for Manifest V3.</p>

          <h3>Introduction to CSS Grid</h3>
      </summary>
  

<p>CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/">different use cases</a> — and they actually <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-replace-flexbox/">work together</a> quite well! Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.</p>



<p>The intention of this guide is to present the Grid concepts as they exist in the latest version of the specification. So I won’t be covering the out-of-date Internet Explorer syntax (even though you can absolutely <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-in-ie-debunking-common-ie-grid-misconceptions/">use Grid in IE 11</a>) or other historical hacks. </p>


</details>

  <summary>
          <h3>CSS Grid basics</h3>
      </summary>
  

<p>As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it’s an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is now!</p>



<p>To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-display">display: grid</a></code>, set the column and row sizes with&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>, and then place its child elements into the grid with&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-column</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-row</a></code>. Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.</p>

          <h3>Important CSS Grid terminology</h3>
      </summary>
  

<p>Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse them with one another if you don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don’t worry, there aren’t many of them.</p>



<div>
<div><h4 id="grid-container">Grid Container</h4>


<p>The element on which&nbsp;<code>display: grid</code>&nbsp;is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example&nbsp;<code>container</code>&nbsp;is the grid container.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="item item-1"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item item-2"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item item-3"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>


<h4 id="grid-line"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-line"></a>Grid Line</h4>


<p>The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-line.svg" alt="" width="318" height="216"></figure>


<h4 id="grid-track"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-track"></a>Grid Track</h4>


<p>The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them as the columns or rows of the grid. Here’s the grid track between the second and third-row grid lines.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terms-grid-track.svg" alt="" width="319" height="216"></figure>


<h4 id="grid-area">Grid Area</h4>


<p>The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells. Here’s the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-area.svg" alt="" width="324" height="220"></figure>
</div>



<div><h4 id="grid-item">Grid Item</h4>


<p>The children (i.e.&nbsp;<em>direct</em>&nbsp;descendants) of the grid container. Here the&nbsp;<code>item</code>&nbsp;elements are grid items, but&nbsp;<code>sub-item</code>&nbsp;isn’t.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="item"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item"&gt;
    &lt;p class="sub-item"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>


<h4 id="grid-cell"><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-cell"></a>Grid Cell</h4>


<p>The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It’s a single “unit” of the grid. Here’s the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-cell.svg" alt="" width="326" height="221"></figure>

<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid"><code>grid</code></a></li>
</ul>


</details>


<div><h4 id="prop-display">display</h4>


<p>Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>grid</code></strong>&nbsp;– generates a block-level grid</li>



<li><strong><code>inline-grid</code></strong>&nbsp;– generates an inline-level grid</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid | inline-grid;
}</code></pre>



<p>The ability to pass grid parameters down through nested elements (aka subgrids) has been moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids" rel="noopener">level 2 of the CSS Grid specification.</a>&nbsp;Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/grid-level-2-and-subgrid/">a quick explanation</a>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns<br>grid-template-rows</h4>


<p>Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;track-size&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid using the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/">fr</a></code>&nbsp;unit (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-fr-unit?utm_medium=content_acq&amp;utm_source=css-tricks&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=awareness_bestsellers" rel="noopener">more on this unit</a> over at DigitalOcean)</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;line-name&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– an arbitrary name of your choosing</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: ...  ...;
  /* e.g. 
      1fr 1fr
      minmax(10px, 1fr) 3fr
      repeat(5, 1fr)
      50px auto 100px 1fr
  */
  grid-template-rows: ... ...;
  /* e.g. 
      min-content 1fr min-content
      100px 1fr max-content
  */
}</code></pre>



<p>Grid lines are automatically assigned positive numbers from these assignments (-1 being an alternate for the very last row).</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-columns-rows-01.svg" alt="" width="337" height="293"></figure>



<p>But you can choose to explicitly name the lines. Note the bracket syntax for the line names:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: [first] 40px [line2] 50px [line3] auto [col4-start] 50px [five] 40px [end];
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end] 100px [third-line] auto [last-line];
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-column-rows-02.svg" alt="Grid with user named lines" width="348" height="292"></figure>



<p>Note that a line can have more than one name. For example, here the second line will have two names: row1-end and row2-start:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end row2-start] 25% [row2-end];
}</code></pre>



<p>If your definition contains repeating parts, you can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-repeat-notation?utm_medium=content_acq&amp;utm_source=css-tricks&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=awareness_bestsellers" rel="noopener"><code>repeat()</code>&nbsp;notation</a> to streamline things:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px [col-start]);
}</code></pre>



<p>Which is equivalent to this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start];
}</code></pre>



<p>If multiple lines share the same name, they can be referenced by their line name and count.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item {
  grid-column-start: col-start 2;
}</code></pre>



<p id="fr-unit">The&nbsp;<code>fr</code>&nbsp;unit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of the free space of the grid container. For example, this will set each item to one third the width of the grid container:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>The free space is calculated&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;any non-flexible items. In this example the total amount of free space available to the&nbsp;<code>fr</code>&nbsp;units doesn’t include the 50px:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr;
}</code></pre>




</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</h4>


<p>Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-area">grid-area</a></code>&nbsp;property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-area-name&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– the name of a grid area specified with&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-area"><code>grid-area</code></a></li>



<li><strong><code>.</code></strong>&nbsp;– a period signifies an empty grid cell</li>



<li><strong><code>none</code></strong>&nbsp;– no grid areas are defined</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-areas: 
    "&lt;grid-area-name&gt; | . | none | ..."
    "...";
}</code></pre>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item-a {
  grid-area: header;
}
.item-b {
  grid-area: main;
}
.item-c {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.item-d {
  grid-area: footer;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header header"
    "main main . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer footer";
}</code></pre>



<p>That’ll create a grid that’s four columns wide by three rows tall. The entire top row will be composed of the&nbsp;<strong>header</strong>&nbsp;area. The middle row will be composed of two&nbsp;<strong>main</strong>&nbsp;areas, one empty cell, and one&nbsp;<strong>sidebar</strong>&nbsp;area. The last row is all&nbsp;<strong>footer</strong>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-template-areas.svg" alt="Example of grid-template-areas" width="347" height="268"></figure>



<p>Each row in your declaration needs to have the same number of cells.</p>



<p>You can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single empty cell. As long as the periods have no spaces between them they represent a single cell.</p>



<p>Notice that you’re not naming lines with this syntax, just areas. When you use this syntax the lines on either end of the areas are actually getting named automatically. If the name of your grid area is&nbsp;<strong><em>foo</em></strong>, the name of the area’s starting row line and starting column line will be&nbsp;<strong><em>foo</em>-start</strong>, and the name of its last row line and last column line will be&nbsp;<strong><em>foo</em>-end</strong>. This means that some lines might have multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example, which will have three names: header-start, main-start, and footer-start.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-template">grid-template</h4>


<p>A shorthand for setting&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>, and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>&nbsp;in a single declaration.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>none</code></strong>&nbsp;– sets all three properties to their initial values</li>



<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-template-rows&gt;</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>&lt;grid-template-columns</code>&gt;</strong>&nbsp;– sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>&nbsp;to the specified values, respectively, and sets&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>none</code></li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template: none | &lt;grid-template-rows&gt; / &lt;grid-template-columns&gt;;
}</code></pre>



<p>It also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for specifying all three. Here’s an example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template:
    [row1-start] "header header header" 25px [row1-end]
    [row2-start] "footer footer footer" 25px [row2-end]
    / auto 50px auto;
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s equivalent to this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25px [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];
  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header" 
    "footer footer footer";
}</code></pre>



<p>Since&nbsp;<code>grid-template</code>&nbsp;doesn’t reset the&nbsp;<em>implicit</em>&nbsp;grid properties (<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-rows</a></code>, and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</a></code>), which is probably what you want to do in most cases, it’s recommended to use the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid">grid</a></code>&nbsp;property instead of&nbsp;<code>grid-template</code>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-column-row-gap">column-gap<br>row-gap<br>grid-column-gap<br>grid-row-gap</h4>


<p>Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it like setting the width of the gutters between the columns/rows.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;line-size&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– a length value</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  /* standard */
  column-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;
  row-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;

  /* old */
  grid-column-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;
  grid-row-gap: &lt;line-size&gt;;
}</code></pre>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 80px auto 80px; 
  column-gap: 10px;
  row-gap: 15px;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-gap.svg" alt="Example of grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap" width="348" height="312"></figure>



<p>The gutters are only created&nbsp;<em>between</em>&nbsp;the columns/rows, not on the outer edges.</p>



<p>Note: The&nbsp;<code>grid-</code>&nbsp;prefix will be removed and&nbsp;<code>grid-column-gap</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>grid-row-gap</code>&nbsp;renamed to&nbsp;<code>column-gap</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>row-gap</code>.

</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-gap">gap<br>grid-gap</h4>


<p>A shorthand for&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">row-gap</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">column-gap</a></code></p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;grid-row-gap&gt;</code>&nbsp;<code>&lt;grid-column-gap&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– length values</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {

  grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 80px auto 80px; 
  gap: 15px 10px;
}</code></pre>



<p>If no&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">row-gap</a></code>&nbsp;is specified, it’s set to the same value as&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row-gap">column-gap</a></code></p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: The&nbsp;<code>grid-</code>&nbsp;prefix is deprecated (but who knows, may never actually be removed from browsers). Essentially&nbsp;<code>grid-gap</code>&nbsp;renamed to&nbsp;<code>gap</code>. The unprefixed property is already supported in Chrome 68+, Safari 11.2 Release 50+, and Opera 54+.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-justify-items">justify-items</h4>


<p>Aligns grid items along the&nbsp;<em>inline (row)</em>&nbsp;axis (as opposed to&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-items">align-items</a></code>&nbsp;which aligns along the&nbsp;<em>block (column)</em>&nbsp;axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>start</code></strong>&nbsp;– aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell</li>



<li><strong><code>end</code></strong>&nbsp;– aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell</li>



<li><strong><code>center</code></strong>&nbsp;– aligns items in the center of their cell</li>

<p>This behavior can also be set on individual grid items via the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-self">justify-self</a></code>&nbsp;property.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-align-items">align-items</h4>


<p>Aligns grid items along the&nbsp;<em>block (column)</em>&nbsp;axis (as opposed to&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-items">justify-items</a></code>&nbsp;which aligns along the&nbsp;<em>inline (row)</em>&nbsp;axis).

<li><strong><code>stretch</code></strong>&nbsp;– fills the whole height of the cell (this is the default)</li>



<li><strong><code>start</code></strong>&nbsp;– aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell</li>



<li><strong><code>end</code></strong>&nbsp;– aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell</li>



<li><strong><code>center</code></strong>&nbsp;– aligns items in the center of their cell</li>



<li><strong><code>baseline</code></strong> – align items <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/NWvvPRj" rel="noopener">along text baseline</a>. There are modifiers to <code>baseline</code> — <code>first baseline</code> and <code>last baseline</code> which will use the baseline from the first or last line in the case of multi-line text.</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {

<p>There are also modifier keywords <code>safe</code> and <code>unsafe</code> (usage is like <code>align-items: safe end</code>). The <code>safe</code> keyword means “try to align like this, but not if it means aligning an item such that it moves into inaccessible overflow area”, while <code>unsafe</code> will allow moving content into inaccessible areas (“data loss”).</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-place-items">place-items</h4>


<p><code>place-items</code>&nbsp;sets both the&nbsp;<code>align-items</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>justify-items</code>&nbsp;properties in a single declaration.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;align-items&gt;</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>&lt;justify-items&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– The first value sets&nbsp;<code>align-items</code>, the second value&nbsp;<code>justify-items</code>. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.</li>
</ul>



<p>For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-items"><code>align-items</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-items"><code>justify-items</code></a>.</p>



<p>This can be very useful for super quick multi-directional centering:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.center {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}</code></pre>
</div>











<div><h4 id="prop-place-content">place-content</h4>


<p><code>place-content</code>&nbsp;sets both the&nbsp;<code>align-content</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>justify-content</code>&nbsp;properties in a single declaration.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;align-content&gt;</code>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<code>&lt;justify-content&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– The first value sets&nbsp;<code>align-content</code>, the second value&nbsp;<code>justify-content</code>. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.</li>
</ul>



<p>All major browsers except Edge support the&nbsp;<code>place-content</code>&nbsp;shorthand property.</p>



<p>For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-align-content"><code>align-content</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-content"><code>justify-content</code></a>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns<br>grid-auto-rows</h4>


<p>Specifies the size of any auto-generated grid tracks (aka&nbsp;<em>implicit grid tracks</em>). Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid. (see&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/difference-explicit-implicit-grids/">The Difference Between Explicit and Implicit Grids</a>)</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;track-size&gt;</code></strong>&nbsp;– can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#fr-unit">fr</a></code>&nbsp;unit)</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-auto-columns: &lt;track-size&gt; ...;
  grid-auto-rows: &lt;track-size&gt; ...;
}</code></pre>



<p>To illustrate how implicit grid tracks get created, think about this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 90px 90px;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-01.svg" alt="Example of 2x2 grid" width="401" height="427"></figure>



<p>This creates a 2 x 2 grid.</p>



<p>But now imagine you use&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-column</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-column-row">grid-row</a></code>&nbsp;to position your grid items like this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item-a {
  grid-column: 1 / 2;
  grid-row: 2 / 3;
}
.item-b {
  grid-column: 5 / 6;
  grid-row: 2 / 3;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-02.svg" alt="Example of implicit tracks" width="405" height="326"></figure>



<p>We told .item-b to start on column line 5 and end at column line 6,&nbsp;<em>but we never defined a column line 5 or 6</em>. Because we referenced lines that don’t exist, implicit tracks with widths of 0 are created to fill in the gaps. We can use&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-columns</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-auto-columns-rows">grid-auto-rows</a></code>&nbsp;to specify the widths of these implicit tracks:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-auto-columns: 60px;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-03.svg" alt="grid-auto-columns-rows" width="406" height="273"></figure>
</div>



<div><h4 id="prop-grid-auto-flow">grid-auto-flow</h4>


<p>If you have grid items that you don’t explicitly place on the grid, the&nbsp;<em>auto-placement algorithm</em>&nbsp;kicks in to automatically place the items. This property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works.</p>



<p>Values:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><code>row</code></strong>&nbsp;– tells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary (default)</li>



<li><strong><code>column</code></strong>&nbsp;– tells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary</li>



<li><strong><code>dense</code></strong>&nbsp;– tells the auto-placement algorithm to attempt to fill in holes earlier in the grid if smaller items come up later</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense;
}</code></pre>



<p>Note that&nbsp;<strong>dense</strong>&nbsp;only changes the visual order of your items and might cause them to appear out of order, which is bad for accessibility.</p>



<p>Examples:</p>



<p>Consider this HTML:</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;section class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-a"&gt;item-a&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-b"&gt;item-b&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-c"&gt;item-c&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-d"&gt;item-d&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="item-e"&gt;item-e&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>



<p>You define a grid with five columns and two rows, and set&nbsp;<code>grid-auto-flow</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>row</code>&nbsp;(which is also the default):</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;
  grid-auto-flow: row;
}</code></pre>



<p>When placing the items on the grid, you only specify spots for two of them:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.item-a {
  grid-column: 1;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
.item-e {
  grid-column: 5;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}</code></pre>



<p>Because we set&nbsp;<code>grid-auto-flow</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>row</code>, our grid will look like this. Notice how the three items we didn’t place (<strong>item-b</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>item-c</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>item-d</strong>) flow across the available rows:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-flow-01.svg" alt="Example of grid-auto-flow set to row" width="404" height="159"></figure>



<p>If we instead set&nbsp;<code>grid-auto-flow</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>column</code>,&nbsp;<strong>item-b</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>item-c</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>item-d</strong>&nbsp;flow down the columns:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;
  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
}</code></pre>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-flow-02.svg" alt="Example of grid-auto-flow set to column" width="405" height="159"></figure>

  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
}</code></pre>



<p>And the following two code blocks are equivalent:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: 100px 300px / auto-flow 200px;
}

.container {
  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-auto-columns: 200px;
}</code></pre>



<p>It also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for setting everything at once. You specify&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-areas">grid-template-areas</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-rows</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-grid-template-columns-rows">grid-template-columns</a></code>, and all the other sub-properties are set to their initial values. What you’re doing is specifying the line names and track sizes inline with their respective grid areas. This is easiest to describe with an example:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid: [row1-start] "header header header" 1fr [row1-end]
        [row2-start] "footer footer footer" 25px [row2-end]
        / auto 50px auto;
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s equivalent to this:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 1fr [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];
  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;    
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="Special-Units-&amp;-Functions">Special Units &amp; Functions</h2>


<div><h4 id="fr-units">fr units </h4>


<p id="h-">You’ll likely end up using a lot of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/">fractional units</a> in CSS Grid, like <code>1fr</code>. They essentially mean “portion of the remaining space”. So a declaration like:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;</code></pre>



<p>Means, loosely, <code>25% 75%</code>. Except that those percentage values are much more firm than fractional units are. For example, if you added padding to those percentage-based columns, now you’ve broken 100% width (assuming a <code>content-box</code> box model). Fractional units also much more friendly in combination with other units, as you can imagine:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: 50px min-content 1fr;</code></pre>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-sizing-keywords">Sizing Keywords</h4>


<p>When sizing rows and columns, you can use all the&nbsp;<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/">lengths</a>&nbsp;you are used to, like&nbsp;<code>px</code>, rem, %, etc, but you also have keywords:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>min-content</code>: the minimum size of the content. Imagine a line of text like “E pluribus unum”, the min-content is likely the width of the word “pluribus”.</li>



<li><code>max-content</code>: the maximum size of the content. Imagine the sentence above, the <code>max-content</code> is the length of the whole sentence.</li>



<li><code>auto</code>: this keyword is a lot like <code>fr</code> units, except that they “lose” the fight in sizing against <code>fr</code> units when allocating the remaining space.</li>



<li>Fractional units: see above</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-sizing-functions">Sizing Functions</h4>


<ul>
<li>The <code>fit-content()</code> function uses the space available, but never less than <code>min-content</code> and never more than <code>max-content</code>.</li>



<li>The <code>minmax()</code> function does exactly what it seems like: it sets a minimum and maximum value for what the length is able to be. This is useful for in combination with relative units. Like you may want a column to be only able to shrink so far. This is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/you-want-minmax10px-1fr-not-1fr/">extremely useful and probably what you want</a>:</li>
</ul>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: minmax(100px, 1fr) 3fr;</code></pre>



<ul>
<li>The <code>min()</code> function.</li>



<li>The <code>max()</code> function.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-the-repeat-function-and-keywords">The repeat() Function and Keywords</h4>


<p>The&nbsp;<code>repeat()</code>&nbsp;function can save some typing:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns:
  1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;

/* easier: */
grid-template-columns:
  repeat(8, 1fr);

/* especially when: */
grid-template-columns:
  repeat(8, minmax(10px, 1fr));</code></pre>



<p>But <code>repeat()</code> can get extra fancy when combined with keywords:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>auto-fill</code>: Fit as many possible columns as possible on a row, even if they are empty.</li>



<li><code>auto-fit:</code> Fit whatever columns there are into the space. Prefer expanding columns to fill space rather than empty columns.</li>
</ul>



<p>This bears the most famous snippet in all of CSS Grid and one of the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/flexible-grids/">all-time great CSS tricks</a>:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">grid-template-columns: 
  repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));</code></pre>



<p>The difference between the keywords is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/">spelled out in detail here</a>.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-masonry">Masonry</h4>


<p>An experimental feature of CSS grid is masonry layout. Note that there are <a href="https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/">lots of approaches to CSS masonry</a>, but mostly of them are trickery and either have major downsides or aren’t what you quite expect. </p>



<p><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#masonry-layout" rel="noopener">The spec has an official way</a> now, and this is behind a flag in Firefox:</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: masonry;
}</code></pre>



<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/native-css-masonry-layout-css-grid/" rel="noopener">See Rachel’s article</a> for a deep dive.</p>
</div>



<div><h4 id="h-subgrid">Subgrid</h4>


<p>Subgrid is an extremely useful feature of grids that allows grid items to have a grid of their own that inherits grid lines from the parent grid.</p>



<pre rel="CSS" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr);
}
.grid-item {
  grid-column: 2 / 7;

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
.child-of-grid-item {
  /* gets to participate on parent grid! */
  grid-column: 3 / 6;
}</code></pre>



<p>This is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid#browser_compatibility" rel="noopener">only supported in Firefox</a> right now, but it really <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/15/subgrids-considered-essential/" rel="noopener">needs</a> to get everywhere.</p>



<p>It’s also useful to know about <code>display: contents;</code>. This is <em>not</em> the same as subgrid, but it can be a useful tool sometimes in a similar fashion.</p>



<pre rel="HTML" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="grid-parent"&gt;

  &lt;div class="grid-item"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="grid-item"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;ul style="display: contents;"&gt;
    &lt;!-- These grid-items get to participate on

            <pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 16:18:45 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/guinea-worm-path-eradication">https://ourworldindata.org/guinea-worm-path-eradication</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38394383">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>In the late 1980s, there were near a million new cases of guinea worm disease recorded worldwide. In 2021, there were only 15. How was this achieved?</p><p><time>July 07, 2022</time></p></div><div>
<p>Guinea worm disease is a painful and debilitating disease that used to be common in Asia, the Middle East, and many countries in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s now close to being eradicated worldwide. This success is thanks to an eradication program that has focused on water treatment and filtration, public education, and providing safe sources of drinking water to reduce its spread.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-guinea-worm-disease">What is guinea worm disease?<a href="#what-is-guinea-worm-disease"></a></h4>
</div><div>
<p>The disease is caused by a parasite called guinea worm (<em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>). The worm’s larvae are carried by water fleas found in stagnant water in ponds, open wells, and freshwater lakes.</p>
<p>When someone drinks contaminated water, the larvae can invade their stomach and intestines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, they mature into adult worms – with female worms growing up to around a meter in length – and crawl through people’s connective tissue, joints, and bones. This growth leads to arthritic conditions, which can debilitate people for months. Around one in two hundred infected people develop a permanent disability from the disease.<a id="ref-1" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Around a year after the infection, the worm begins to emerge from the skin through a painful blister. This process also increases the risks of other infections.</p>
<p>People often try to find relief from the infection by putting their blisters in open water. This might bring some temporary relief for them, but makes it harder to eliminate the disease. In the water, the worm can release its own larvae and if the water contains water fleas, this restarts the life cycle of the guinea worm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disease can be treated with pain medication and antibiotics, and by carefully removing the worm when it emerges.<a id="ref-2" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div><div>
<p>
<h4 id="guinea-worm-disease-used-to-be-common">Guinea worm disease used to be common<a href="#guinea-worm-disease-used-to-be-common"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>This parasite has troubled humans for a long time. There are records of guinea worm disease dating back thousands of years.<a id="ref-3" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>It was endemic in Asia, the Middle East, and many countries in Africa in the early twentieth century.<a id="ref-4" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It was common in poor remote villages without <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access">access to clean drinking water</a>. This was because sources of stagnant water – such as large open wells and ponds – could be contaminated by water fleas that contained guinea worm larvae.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people do not develop immunity to the disease if they have been infected, which means it was common for people to be reinfected several times. For example, in the 1960s, in some villages in South India, more than 70% of adults infected once had been reinfected later on, and 10% had been infected at least 10 times.<a id="ref-5" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>By the 1980s, guinea worm disease was known to be endemic in 20 countries in South Asia and parts of Africa. We see this in the map, which shows the number of reported cases by country in 1989.</p>
<p>In 1986, around 35,000 cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). As surveillance improved, the number of detected cases increased to 890,000 in 1989.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-guinea-worm-disease-be-prevented">How can guinea worm disease be prevented?<a href="#how-can-guinea-worm-disease-be-prevented"></a></h4>
</p>

</div><div>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no vaccines against guinea worm disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the disease has several features that make it easy to prevent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, humans are the main ‘host’ of the disease, with only a few exceptions.<a id="ref-6" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> The worm larvae are unable to survive for more than a few weeks in water fleas.<a id="ref-7" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> This means the worms can easily die out if they are prevented from infecting humans.</p>
<p>That brings us to our second point: we know how to stop it from infecting people. When people avoid drinking contaminated water that contains water fleas and guinea worm larvae, they are prevented from being infected.</p>
<p>Third, the disease is seasonal. People infected in one season tend to release worms a year later, which restarts the seasonal cycle. In the past, when villages halted the spread of worms in a single season, the disease stopped entirely unless it was reintroduced from somewhere else.<a id="ref-8" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

</p>

</div><div>
<p>The world has made tremendous progress in reducing the burden of this disease with the knowledge of how to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<p>The campaign to eradicate guinea worm disease began in the 1980s. It was led by a number of organizations including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States (US CDC), the Carter Center, the WHO, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).<a id="ref-9" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Village volunteers have played a major role in the eradication program. They provide people with water filters and larvicides, educate them about where to drink clean water, record cases, help treat patients who are suffering from the disease, and prevent them from releasing worms into the water.<a id="ref-10" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Another key driver of progress is access to improved drinking water sources, which has become more common in many countries.</p>
<p>You can see the change since the start of the eradication campaign in the chart. Cases of guinea worm disease declined rapidly across many countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 890,000 cases were recorded worldwide in 1989. By 2021, there were just 15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost all of the 15 cases were recorded in Chad.</p>

</p>

</div><div>
<p>In many countries, guinea worm disease has been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Countries are certified as free of guinea worm disease if they have reported zero indigenous cases for at least three consecutive years while having active surveillance.<a id="ref-11" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On the map, you can see which countries are certified as being free of guinea worm disease. They are shown in blue. Using the timeline at the bottom of the chart you can see how each country’s status changed over time.</p>
<p>In 1996, 16 countries were known to be endemic for guinea worm disease. By 2021, only five countries remained endemic – Mali, Chad, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Angola.</p>

</p>

</div><div>
<p>To eradicate guinea worm disease globally, there are several challenges we need to overcome.</p>
<p>A general challenge is that it takes around a year after infection for the worm to emerge from a person’s body. This is why countries need to monitor for new cases for several years after they have reported zero cases, in order to achieve certification.</p>
<p>Another problem is that a few countries, such as Chad and Ethiopia, have recently had outbreaks linked to dogs infected with the worms, which had not been seen before. That means extra efforts have been needed in recent years to prevent infections in dogs in those regions.<a id="ref-12" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, it has been difficult to eliminate guinea worm disease in countries with violence and conflict, where healthcare workers are less able to treat and prevent infections.<a id="ref-13" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there has been a massive decline in guinea worm cases over time. Only 13 cases were reported globally in 2022. The world is so close to the goal and with dedicated effort, we may soon achieve it. After thousands of years, the entire world may soon be free of this debilitating disease.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/binance_ceo_settlement/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/binance_ceo_settlement/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38393264">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange just got a little smaller, with the US Department of Justice announcing Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have both pleaded guilty to a multitude of financial crimes. As a result Binance will fork out $10 billion to Uncle Sam in fines and settlements.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/21/usa-v-binance.pdf" rel="nofollow">criminal case</a> [PDF] unsealed Tuesday, Binance failed to register as a money services business in the United States, broke the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement and maintain an anti-money laundering program, and violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by allowing US users to transact with individuals in sanctioned countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those three crimes, prosecutors noted, were all done "knowingly" and "willfully," and included the transfer of nearly $1 billion to "persons [Binance] had reason to believe resided in Iran."&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history," Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution" rel="nofollow">said</a> during a press conference today. Binance also facilitated trades to users in Syria, Russia and Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine, it's said.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>The Justice Department noted Binance was chiefly interested in profiting from its customers, as opposed to ripping off or defrauding them, and that the biz conspired to operate as an unlicensed exchange to "gain market share and profit as quickly as possible."&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Better to ask forgiveness than permission</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outfit knew that it would lose market share if it was cut off from US users, and so acted to ensure that the VIP users moving the most cryptocurrency on its platform had access to its non-US platform, to which access in America was supposed to have been cut off in 2019 after the creation of Binance.us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Defendant chose not to comply with US legal and regulatory requirements because it determined that doing so would limit its ability to attract and maintain US users," the DoJ said in its court filings. According to a 2019 chat message sent by Zhao to the Binance team, he knew full well his company was violating the law, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If we blocked US users from day 1, Binance will be not [sic] as big as we are today," Zhao said in the chat, according to Uncle Sam. "Better to ask forgiveness than permission."&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Other internal communications made it clear Binance knew it was being used as a conduit to launder illicit funds, with a compliance employee quipping at one point that "we need a banner 'is washing drug money too hard these days - come to Binance we got cake for you.'"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance will cough up $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures to the Dept of Justice as part of its guilty plea.</p>
<p>The exchange also reached settlements Tuesday with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC). The CFTC will <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8825-23" rel="nofollow">extract</a> $1.35 billion from Binance, while the Treasury Department's enforcement arms have <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1925" rel="nofollow">settled</a> with Binance for a combined $4.4 billion - the largest haul in Treasury's history, Chair Janet Yellen said.</p>

        

<p>In addition to the monetary settlements, Binance is also being required to implement proper anti-money laundering capabilities and will have to report to US agencies for the next three years on its compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal," said Garland. The DoJ noted that Binance's total fine was reduced by 20 percent due to its cooperation with US investigations.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Zhao, meanwhile, will be paying penalties of his own, with $150 million owed to the CFTC. Zhao is also stepping down from his role as CEO of Binance, he confirmed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1727063503125766367" rel="nofollow">post</a> on X shortly after the DoJ press conference, announcing that Binance's former global head of regional markets, Richard Teng, would be immediately taking over.</p>
<p>The former chief will also keep his majority share of Binance, though won't be allowed be an executive within it.</p>
<p>Zhao's statement made little mention of the reason for his resignation, but he did note that the guilty pleas didn't include any allegations that Binance misappropriated customer funds or engaged in market manipulation (unlike some <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/03/sbfd_trial_insurance_lawsuit/">other crypto outfits</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance's <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/leadership/binance-announcement-reaching-resolution-with-us-regulators-2904832835382364558" rel="nofollow">statement</a> regarding the settlements makes the same statement about the safety of user funds while adding that the company is "taking responsibility for this past chapter" while now being "a much stronger company today than it was in the past."</p>
<p>Binance is still facing <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/05/binance_us_sec_lawsuit/">charges</a> from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was not party to the settlements.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I’ve been working on writing a zine about git so I’ve been thinking
about git branches a lot. I keep hearing from people that they find the way git
branches work to be counterintuitive. It got me thinking:  what might an
“intuitive” notion of a branch be, and how is it different from how git
actually works?</p>

<p>So in this post I want to briefly talk about</p>

<ul>
<li>an intuitive mental model I think many people have</li>
<li>how git actually represents branches internally (the “technically correct” definition)</li>
<li>how the “intuitive model” and the real way it works are actually pretty closely related</li>
<li>some limits of the intuitive model and why it might cause problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing in this post is remotely groundbreaking so I’m going to try to keep it pretty short.</p>

<h3 id="an-intuitive-model-of-a-branch">an intuitive model of a branch</h3>

<p>Of course, people have many different intuitions about branches. Here’s the one
that I think corresponds to the most closely to the physical “a branch of an
apple tree” metaphor.</p>

<p>My guess is that a lot of people think about a git branch like this: the 2
commits in pink in this picture are on a “branch”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/git-branch.png" width="200px"></p>

<p>I think there are two important things about this diagram:</p>

<ol>
<li>the branch has 2 commits on it</li>
<li>the branch has a “parent” (<code>main</code>) which it’s an offshoot of</li>
</ol>

<p>That seems pretty reasonable, but that’s not how git defines a branch – most
importantly, git doesn’t have any concept of a branch’s “parent”. So how does
git define a branch?</p>

<h3 id="in-git-a-branch-is-the-full-history">in git, a branch is the full history</h3>

<p>In git, a branch is the full history of every previous commit, not just the “offshoot” commits. So in our picture above both branches (<code>main</code> and <code>branch</code>) have 4 commits on them.</p>

<p>I made an example repository at <a href="https://github.com/jvns/branch-example">https://github.com/jvns/branch-example</a> which
has its branches set up the same way as in the picture above. Let’s look at the
2 branches:</p>

<p><code>main</code> has 4 commits on it:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --oneline main
70f727a d
f654888 c
3997a46 b
a74606f a
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>mybranch</code> has 4 commits on it too. The bottom two commits are shared
between both branches.</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --oneline mybranch
13cb960 y
9554dab x
3997a46 b
a74606f a
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>mybranch</code> has 4 commits on it, not just the 2 commits <code>13cb960</code> and <code>9554dab</code> that are “offshoot” commits.</p>

<p>You can get git to draw all the commits on both branches like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --all --oneline --graph
* 70f727a (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main) d
* f654888 c
| * 13cb960 (origin/mybranch, mybranch) y
| * 9554dab x
|/
* 3997a46 b
* a74606f a
</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-branch-is-stored-as-a-commit-id">a branch is stored as a commit ID</h3>

<p>Internally in git, branches are stored as tiny text files which have a commit ID in
them. That commit is the latest commit on the branch. This is the “technically correct” definition I was talking about at the beginning.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the text files for <code>main</code> and <code>mybranch</code> in our example repo:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat .git/refs/heads/main
70f727acbe9ea3e3ed3092605721d2eda8ebb3f4
$ cat .git/refs/heads/mybranch
13cb960ad86c78bfa2a85de21cd54818105692bc
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense: <code>70f727</code> is the latest commit on <code>main</code> and <code>13cb96</code> is the latest commit on <code>mybranch</code>.</p>

<p>The reason this works is that every commit contains a pointer to its parent(s),
so git can follow the chain of pointers to get every commit on the branch.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned before, the thing that’s missing here is any relationship at
all between these two branches. There’s no indication that <code>mybranch</code> is an
offshoot of <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve talked about how the intuitive notion of a branch is “wrong”, I
want to talk about how it’s also right in some very important ways.</p>

<h3 id="people-s-intuition-is-usually-not-that-wrong">people’s intuition is usually not that wrong</h3>

<p>I think it’s pretty popular to tell people that their intuition about git is
“wrong”. I find that kind of silly – in general, even if people’s intuition
about a topic is technically incorrect in some ways, people usually have the
intuition they do for very legitimate reasons! “Wrong” models can be super useful.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about 3 ways the intuitive “offshoot” notion of a branch matches
up very closely with how we actually use git in practice.</p>

<h3 id="rebases-use-the-intuitive-notion-of-a-branch">rebases use the “intuitive” notion of a branch</h3>

<p>Now let’s go back to our original picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/git-branch.png" width="200px"></p>

<p>When you rebase <code>mybranch</code> on <code>main</code>, it takes the commits on the “intuitive”
branch (just the 2 pink commits) and replays them onto <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>The result is that just the 2 (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) get copied. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git switch mybranch
$ git rebase main
$ git log --oneline mybranch
952fa64 (HEAD -&gt; mybranch) y
7d50681 x
70f727a (origin/main, main) d
f654888 c
3997a46 b
a74606f a
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>git rebase</code> has created two new commits (<code>952fa64</code> and <code>7d50681</code>) whose
information comes from the previous two <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> commits.</p>

<p>So the intuitive model isn’t THAT wrong! It tells you exactly what happens in a
rebase.</p>

<p>But because git doesn’t know that <code>mybranch</code> is an offshoot of <code>main</code>, you need
to tell it explicitly where to rebase the branch.</p>

<h3 id="merges-use-the-intuitive-notion-of-a-branch-too">merges use the “intuitive” notion of a branch too</h3>

<p>Merges don’t copy commits, but they do need a “base” commit: the way merges
work is that it looks at two sets of changes (starting from the shared base)
and then merges them.</p>

<p>Let’s undo the rebase we just did and then see what the merge base is.</p>

<pre><code>$ git switch mybranch
$ git reset --hard 13cb960  # undo the rebase
$ git merge-base main mybranch
3997a466c50d2618f10d435d36ef12d5c6f62f57
</code></pre>

<p>This gives us the “base” commit where our branch branched off, <code>3997a4</code>.
That’s exactly the commit you would think it might be based on our intuitive
picture.</p>

<h3 id="github-pull-requests-also-use-the-intuitive-idea">github pull requests also use the intuitive idea</h3>

<p>If we create a pull request on GitHub to merge <code>mybranch</code> into <code>main</code>, it’ll
also show us 2 commits: the commits <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. That makes sense and also
matches our intuitive notion of a branch.</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/gh-pr.png" width="300px"></p>

<p>I assume if you make a merge request on GitLab it shows you something similar.</p>

<h3 id="intuition-is-pretty-good-but-it-has-some-limits">intuition is pretty good, but it has some limits</h3>

<p>This leaves our intuitive definition of a branch looking pretty good actually!
The “intuitive” idea of what a branch is matches exactly with how merges and
rebases and GitHub pull requests work.</p>

<p>You do need to explicitly
specify the other branch when merging or rebasing or making a pull request (like <code>git rebase main</code>),
because git doesn’t know what branch you think your offshoot is based on.</p>

<p>But the intuitive notion of a branch has one fairly serious problem: the way
you intuitively think about <code>main</code> and an offshoot branch are very different,
and git doesn’t know that.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about the different kinds of git branches.</p>

<h3 id="trunk-and-offshoot-branches">trunk and offshoot branches</h3>

<p>To a human, <code>main</code> and <code>mybranch</code> are pretty different, and you probably have
pretty different intentions around how you want to use them.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty normal to think of some branches as being “trunk” branches,
and some branches as being “offshoots”. Also you can have an offshoot of an
offshoot.</p>

<p>Of course, git itself doesn’t make any such distinctions (the term “offshoot”
is one I just made up!), but what kind of a branch it is definitely affects how
you treat it.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>you might rebase <code>mybranch</code> onto <code>main</code> but you probably wouldn’t rebase <code>main</code> onto <code>mybranch</code> – that would be weird!</li>
<li>in general people are much more careful around rewriting the history on “trunk” branches than short-lived offshoot branches</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="git-lets-you-do-rebases-backwards">git lets you do rebases “backwards”</h3>

<p>One thing I think throws people off about git is – because git doesn’t
have any notion of whether a branch is an “offshoot” of another branch, it
won’t give you any guidance about if/when it’s appropriate to rebase branch X
on branch Y. You just have to know.</p>

<p>for example, you can do either:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout main
$ git rebase mybranch
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout mybranch
$ git rebase main
</code></pre>

<p>Git will happily let you do either one, even though in this case <code>git rebase main</code> is
extremely normal and <code>git rebase mybranch</code> is pretty weird. A lot of people
said they found this confusing so here’s a picture of the two kinds of rebases:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/backwards-rebase.png"></p>

<p>Similarly, you can do merges “backwards”, though that’s much more normal than
doing a backwards rebase – merging <code>mybranch</code> into <code>main</code> and <code>main</code> into
<code>mybranch</code> are both useful things to do for different reasons.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram of the two ways you can merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/merge-two-ways.png"></p>

<h3 id="git-s-lack-of-hierarchy-between-branches-is-a-little-weird">git’s lack of hierarchy between branches is a little weird</h3>

<p>I hear the statement “the <code>main</code> branch is not special” a lot and I’ve been
puzzled about it – in most of the repositories I work in, <code>main</code> <strong>is</strong>
pretty special! Why are people saying it’s not?</p>

<p>I think the point is that even though branches <strong>do</strong> have relationships
between them (<code>main</code> is often special!), git doesn’t know anything about those
relationships.</p>

<p>You have to tell git explicitly about the relationship between branches every
single time you run a git command like <code>git rebase</code> or <code>git merge</code>, and if you
make a mistake things can get really weird.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether git’s design here is “right” or “wrong” (it definitely has
some pros and cons, and I’m very tired of reading endless arguments about
it), but I do think it’s surprising to a lot of people for good reason.</p>

<h3 id="in-github-the-default-branch-is-special">in GitHub, the default branch is special</h3>

<p>Also, it’s worth mentioning that GitHub does have a “special branch”: every
github repo has a “default branch” (in git terms, it’s what <code>HEAD</code> points at),
which is special in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s what you check out when you <code>git clone</code> the repository</li>
<li>it’s the default destination for pull requests</li>
<li>github will suggest that you protect the default branch from force pushes</li>
</ul>

<p>and probably even more that I’m not thinking of.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>This all seems extremely obvious in retrospect, but it took me a long time to
figure out what a more “intuitive” idea of a branch even might be because I was
so used to the technical “a branch is a reference to a commit” definition.</p>

<p>I also hadn’t really thought aoout how git makes you tell it about the
hierarchy between your branches every time you run a <code>git rebase</code> or <code>git
merge</code> command – for me it’s second nature to do that and it’s not a big deal,
but now that I’m thinking about it, it’s pretty easy to see how somebody could
get mixed up.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/wyden_hemisphere_letter/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/wyden_hemisphere_letter/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38393237">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A senator has complained that American law enforcement agencies snoop on US citizens and residents, seemingly without regard for the privacy provisions of the Fourth Amendment, under a secret program called the Hemisphere Project that allows police to conduct searches of trillions of phone records.</p>
<p>According to Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), these searches "usually" happen without warrants. And after more than a decade of keeping people — lawmakers included — in the dark about Hemisphere, Wyden wants the Justice Department to reveal information about what he called a "long-running dragnet surveillance program."</p>
<p>"I have serious concerns about the legality of this surveillance program, and the materials provided by the DoJ contain troubling information that would justifiably outrage many Americans and other members of Congress," Wyden wrote in a letter [<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_hemisphere_surveillance_letter_112023.pdf">PDF</a>] to US Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p>

    

<p>Under Hemisphere, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) pays telco AT&amp;T to provide all federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies with the ability to request searches of trillions of domestic phone records dating back to at least 1987, plus the four billion call records added every day.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We are required by law to comply with subpoenas, warrants and court orders from government and law enforcement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T declined to answer any specific questions about Hemisphere, but a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>: "To be clear, any information referred to in Senator Wyden's letter would be compelled by subpoena, warrant, or court order."</p>
<p>"We defer to the Justice Department, to whom Senator Wyden's letter is addressed, for comment," the AT&amp;T spokesperson said. "Like all companies, we are required by law to comply with subpoenas, warrants and court orders from government and law enforcement agencies."</p>

        


        

<p>According to Wyden, federal and state law enforcement agencies can request a Hemisphere search with a subpoena — but many law enforcement agencies can issue these themselves. Additionally, any law enforcement agency across the country can request access to these searches, and they aren't limited to drug-related investigations, according to the Oregon senator.</p>
<p>Hemisphere first came to light in a 2013 New York Times <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/us/drug-agents-use-vast-phone-trove-eclipsing-nsas.html">report</a> that alleged the "scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the NSA's gathering of phone call logs under the Patriot Act."</p>
<h3>It's not classified, but that doesn't mean the Feds want you to see it</h3>
<p>Privacy advocates including the Electronic Frontier Foundations have filed Freedom of Information Act and state-level public records <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hemisphere">lawsuits</a> to learn more about the secret snooping program.</p>
<p>Few have made a dent: it appears that the Feds are doing everything they can to keep Hemisphere secret.</p>

        

<p>Although the program and its documents are not classified, the Justice Department has marked them as "Law Enforcement Sensitive," meaning their disclosure could hurt ongoing investigations. This designation also prevents the documents from being publicly released.</p>
<p>Senator Wyden wants the designation removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hemisphere is not subject to a federal <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-impact-assessments">Privacy Impact Assessment</a> due to its funding structure, it's claimed. The White House doesn't directly pay AT&amp;T - instead the ONDCP provides a grant to the Houston High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, which is a partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. And this partnership, in turn, pays AT&amp;T to operate this surveillance scheme.</p>

        

<p>In Wyden's letter, he quotes a law enforcement official who described Hemisphere as "AT&amp;T's Super Search Engine" and "Google on Steroids." He also cites ONDCP slides and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) emails disclosing that AT&amp;T searches records kept by its wholesale division, which carries communications on behalf of other telecom companies and their customers.</p>

</ul>
<p>Another ONDCP document purportedly states that Hemisphere "can be used to identify alternate numbers used by a target, obtain location data and 'two levels of call detail records for one target number'.” That provision means Hemisphere searches can pull in phone records of everyone who communicated with the target of an investigation.</p>
<p>In other words: there's some serious snooping happening.</p>
<p>This letter to DOJ comes as Wyden and other lawmakers from both parties, in the US Senate and House of Representatives, have introduced the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/section_702_reform_legislation/">Government Surveillance Reform Act</a>, which would, among other things, require an independent court order before allowing surveillance of Americans' phone records. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

  A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider.
  A library instead moves these costs to the users of the library.
<p>
  For any developer with limited resources,
  <!-- obviously everyone has limited resources, but I feel like this makes the sentence scan better, shrug -->
  this means a library (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user,
  at a lower cost to the developer than a service.
</p><p>
  By library, I mean any software that can be <a href="https://catern.com/run.html">run by the user</a>:
  shared objects, modules, servers, command line utilities, and others.
  By service, I mean any software which the user can't run on their own;
  anything which depends (usually through an API)
  on a service provider for its functionality.
</p><p>
  Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services.
  People say, "services are easy to write because you can upgrade them centrally,
  so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse."
</p><p>
  But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else.
  If one user can't have a negative impact on other users,
  then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade;
  they're only hurting themselves.
</p><p>
  You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users;
  in other words, <a href="https://catern.com/run.html">let users run the software</a>
  themselves, by writing libraries instead of services.
</p><p>
  "Write a library", in this sense, can still mean writing a standalone server reached through a network protocol.
  As long as the user runs the server themselves, you're still saving the administration costs.
  Both standalone servers and importable code are <a href="https://catern.com/schemas.html">equally expressive</a>,
  and equally cheap for you to administrate if you're not operating a service yourself.
</p><p>
  By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service,
  a library can afford to contain more functionality.
  That's good for both the developer and the user.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>My game - ΔV: Rings of Saturn (shameless <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/846030/V_Rings_of_Saturn/?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_campaign=gamedev-plug">plug</a>) - is out in Early Access for two years now, and as you can expect, there are bugs. But I did find that a disproportionally big amount of these bugs was reported by players using Linux to play. I started to investigate, and my findings did surprise me.</p>

<h2>Let’s talk numbers.</h2>

<p>Percentages are easy to talk about, but when I read just them, I always wonder - what is the sample size? Is it small enough for the percentage to be just noise? As of today, I sold a little over 12,000 units of ΔV in total. 700 of these units were bought by Linux players. That’s 5.8%. I got 1040 bug reports in total, out of which roughly 400 are made by Linux players. That’s one report per 11.5 users on average, and one report per 1.75 Linux players. That’s right, an average Linux player will get you 650% more bug reports.</p>

<p>A lot of extra work for just 5.8% of extra units, right?</p>

<h2>Wrong. Bugs exist whenever you know about them, or not.</h2>

<p>Do you know how many of these 400 bug reports were actually platform-specific? 3. Literally only 3 things were problems that came out just on Linux. The rest of them were affecting everyone - the thing is, the Linux community is exceptionally well trained in reporting bugs. That is just the open-source way. This 5.8% of players found 38% of all the bugs that affected everyone. Just like having your own 700-person strong QA team. That was not 38% extra work for me, that was just free QA!</p>

<h2>But that’s not all. The report quality is stellar.</h2>

<p>I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed.</p>

<p>And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps. Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem. You just don’t get that kind of engagement from anyone else.</p>

<h2>Worth it?</h2>

<p>Oh, yes - at least for me. Not for the extra sales - although it’s nice. It’s worth it to get the massive feedback boost and free, hundred-people strong QA team on your side. An invaluable asset for an independent game studio.</p>

to see, but if the failure rate was 5% then the odds of 2 requests failing
back to back is 1 in 400. 3 requests in a row is 1 in 8000. Retries allow you to
trade latency for reliability.</p><p>However, there's a subtle side-effect of behaving this way.

overloading and crashing. Then it restarts a few seconds later. This can happen
for all sorts of reasons in the real world, from the process running out of

created by the retries can make it difficult to recover. When it comes back up,
it might get quickly overwhelmed and crash again. This problem gets worse as you
scale. Let's add in even more <span>clients</span> and a few more <span>servers</span> to handle the new load.</p><failure-rate-control target="control2" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>What you're likely to see here is that the moment you switch from a 0% <span>failure</span> rate to 100%, traffic begins to ramp up as <span>clients</span> begin to retry. Eventually, one of the <span>servers</span> will crash. As soon as one <span>server</span> goes, the remaining two will be unable to handle
the new load.</p><p>You'll notice that setting the <span>failure</span> rate back to 0%
here will likely have no meaningful effect. You may eventually recover, but if
you're doing retries in a tight loop and you get into this overloaded state it
can be very hard to get back out. In practice, the quickest way to recover is to
add more <span>servers</span> to absorb the load. Once
stabilised, you can spin the extra <span>servers</span> back
down.</p><p>Give that a try in the next visualisation. It's tuned the same way as the
previous one, but this time there's an extra toggle that lets you control the
number of <span>servers</span>. Set the <span>failure</span> rate up to 100%, get into an overloaded state, then
set it back down to 0% and gradually add <span>servers</span>
until you're recovered. How many extra <span>servers</span> do
you need in order to stabilise?</p><failure-rate-control target="control2.1" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><h2 id="retrying-with-a-delay"><a href="#retrying-with-a-delay">Retrying with a delay</a></h2><p>So retrying in a tight loop is problematic and we've seen why. The next thing
people do is to add a delay between each retry. 10 retries with a <code>sleep(1000)</code>
between them. Let's see how that fares.</p><failure-rate-control target="control3" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>You should notice the same pattern here as with no delay between retries. When
you set the <span>failure rate</span> to 100%, the <span>server</span> will crash shortly after. It may take a bit longer,
but it will happen. If the rate at which your <span>clients</span> retry is not longer than the rate at which they
normally send <span>requests</span>, you will see an increase in
overall load.</p><p>To demonstrate, let's try a <code>sleep(10000)</code> to wait 10 seconds after a <span>failed</span> <span>request</span>. This wait
is about twice as long as <span>clients</span> usually wait
before sending their next <span>request</span>.</p><failure-rate-control target="control4" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>This "works" insofar as the <span>server</span> is unlikely to
get overloaded, and if it does it is able to recover with ease. But this will
lead to a bad user experience in practice. Users don't like waiting, and the
longer you sleep between retries, the more likely they are to refresh manually
or go and do something else. Both bad outcomes.</p><h2 id="so-whats-the-answer"><a href="#so-whats-the-answer">So what's the answer?</a></h2><p>We need a way of retrying that retries quickly in case the error is low
probability, thus protecting the user experience, but recognises when things are
really wrong and waits longer to prevent unrecoverable overload.</p><p>We need "<strong>exponential backoff.</strong>" There are lots of things you can configure
when calculating exponential backoff, but if you imagine we started off waiting
for 1 second and waited twice as long each retry, 10 retries would look like
this:</p><ul><li>1 second</li><li>2 seconds</li><li>4 seconds</li><li>8 seconds</li><li>16 seconds</li><li>32 seconds</li><li>1 minute and 4 seconds</li><li>2 minutes and 8 seconds</li><li>4 minutes and 16 seconds</li><li>8 minutes and 32 seconds</li></ul><p>This would be an enormous amount of time to wait, so in practice exponential
backoff is tuned to start lower than 1 second, and often has a lower multiplier.
Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-http-client/1.43.0/com.google.api.client.util.ExponentialBackOff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Java HTTP Client Library</a>, for example, starts at 0.5 seconds and
has a multiplier of 1.5. This yields the following retry intervals:</p><ul><li>0.5 seconds</li><li>0.75 seconds</li><li>1.125 seconds</li><li>1.687 seconds</li><li>2.53 seconds</li><li>3.795 seconds</li><li>5.692 seconds</li><li>8.538 seconds</li><li>12.807 seconds</li><li>19.210 seconds</li></ul><p>Enough mathematics, how does this look in practice? All of the following
examples use the Google HTTP library backoff defaults (0.5 second initial delay,
1.5 multiplier).</p><failure-rate-control target="control5" options="0 1"></failure-rate-control><p>As soon as you flip over to 100% <span>failure</span> rate you'll
notice the usual ramp up in <span>requests</span>, but as those <span>requests</span> are retried you will then notice that the
backoff kicks in and things calm down. The <span>server</span>
may crash but the <span>clients</span> give it space to recover.
When you flip back to 0% <span>failure</span> rate, the <span>server</span> is able to return to normal service quickly.</p><p>For fun, let's also see it in action at scale. I'm going to give you some more <span>failure</span> rates to play with, too. Go wild.</p><failure-rate-control target="control6" options="0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1"></failure-rate-control><p>You may have struggled to get any of the <span>servers</span> to
crash in this example, even at a 100% <span>failure</span> rate.
This is exponential backoff at work, helping your <span>clients</span> recognise trouble and getting them to give your <span>servers</span> space to recover.</p><h2 id="jitter"><a href="#jitter">Jitter</a></h2><p>We've seen the power of exponential backoff at work, but there's one last thing
we can do with our retries to make them truly best practice.</p><p>"Jitter" is the process of randomising how long we wait between retries to
within a specific range. To follow the Google HTTP client library example, they
add 50% jitter. So a retry interval can be between 50% lower and 50% higher than
the calculated figure. Here's how that affects our numbers from before:</p><ul><li>0.5 seconds, ± 0.25 seconds</li><li>0.75 seconds, ± 0.375 seconds</li><li>1.125 seconds, ± 0.5625 seconds</li><li>1.687 seconds, ± 0.8435 seconds</li><li>2.53 seconds, ± 1.265 seconds</li><li>3.795 seconds, ± 1.8975 seconds</li><li>5.692 seconds, ± 2.846 seconds</li><li>8.538 seconds, ± 4.269 seconds</li><li>12.807 seconds, ± 6.4035 seconds</li><li>19.210 seconds, ± 9.605 seconds</li></ul><p>This jitter helps prevent <span>clients</span> from synchronising
with each other and sending surges of <span>requests</span>.</p><h2 id="putting-this-in-to-code"><a href="#putting-this-in-to-code">Putting this in to code</a></h2><p>So you've read this post and realised you're either not making use of retries,
or you're doing them dangerously. Here's some example Go code that implements
the retry strategy we've built up to, exponential backoff with jitter, that you
can use in your own projects.</p><pre><div><p><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"encoding/json"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>

	<span>"github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4"</span>
)

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
	bo := backoff.NewExponentialBackOff()
	bo.InitialInterval = <span>500</span> * time.Millisecond
	bo.Multiplier = <span>1.5</span>
	bo.RandomizationFactor = <span>0.5</span>

	err := backoff.Retry(<span><span>func</span><span>()</span></span> <span>error</span> {
		resp, err := http.Get(<span>"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"</span>)
		<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span> err
		}
		<span>defer</span> resp.Body.Close()

		<span>var</span> result <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>interface</span>{}
		<span>if</span> err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&amp;result); err != <span>nil</span> {
			<span>return</span> err
		}

		fmt.Printf(<span>"%+v\n"</span>, result)
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
	}, bo)

	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		fmt.Println(<span>"Request failed:"</span>, err)
	}
}
</code></p></div></pre><h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</a></h2><p>I hope that this post has helped visually cement how different retry behaviours
work in practice, and given you a good, intuitive understanding of the failure
modes. We can't always prevent failure, but we can set ourselves up to have the
best chance of recovering when it does happen.</p><p>To recap what we've learned:</p><ul><li><strong>Retrying in a tight loop is dangerous.</strong> You risk getting into overload
situations that are difficult to recover from.</li><li><strong>Retrying with a delay</strong> helps a little bit but is still <strong>dangerous.</strong></li><li><strong>Exponential backoff</strong> is a much safer way of retrying, balancing user
experience with safety.</li><li><strong>Jitter</strong> adds an extra layer of protection, preventing clients from sending
synchronised surges of requests.</li></ul><p>If you have questions or feedback, please reach out on

<p>On the night of November 22, 1987, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a> signals of two stations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois, were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_signal_intrusion" title="Broadcast signal intrusion">hijacked</a>, briefly sending a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_broadcast" title="Pirate broadcast">pirate broadcast</a> of an unidentified person wearing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom" title="Max Headroom">Max Headroom</a> mask and costume to thousands of home viewers.<sup id="cite_ref-Knittel_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Knittel-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ross_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ross-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Schwoch_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Schwoch-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Forester_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Forester-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The first incident took place during the sports segment of independent TV station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN-TV" title="WGN-TV">WGN-TV</a>'s 9:00 p.m. newscast. Like the later signal intrusion, it featured a person wearing a mask swaying erratically in front of a swiveling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugated_galvanised_iron" title="Corrugated galvanised iron">corrugated metal</a> panel, apparently meant to resemble Max Headroom's animated geometric background. Unlike the later intrusion, the only sound was a loud buzz. This interruption went on for almost 17 seconds before engineers at WGN were able to regain control of their broadcast tower.
</p><p>The second incident occurred about two hours later during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> member station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTW" title="WTTW">WTTW</a>'s broadcast of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> serial <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_of_Fang_Rock" title="Horror of Fang Rock">Horror of Fang Rock</a></i>. With nobody on duty at the affected tower, this signal takeover was more sustained, and the masked figure could be heard making reference to the real Max Headroom's advertisements for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke" title="New Coke">New Coke</a>, the animated TV series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_Cargo" title="Clutch Cargo">Clutch Cargo</a></i>, WGN sportscaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Swirsky" title="Chuck Swirsky">Chuck Swirsky</a>, "Greatest World Newspaper nerds", and other seemingly unrelated topics. The video concluded with the masked figure’s bare buttocks being spanked by a woman with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyswatter" title="Flyswatter">flyswatter</a> while yelling "They're coming to get me!", with the woman responding "Bend over, bitch!" as the figure was crying and screaming. At that point, the hijackers ended the pirate transmission, and normal programming resumed after a total interruption of about 90 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>That same night, at about 11:20 pm, the signal of local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTW" title="WTTW">WTTW</a> was interrupted during an airing of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> serial <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_of_Fang_Rock" title="Horror of Fang Rock">Horror of Fang Rock</a></i>.

"Max" sang the phrase "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(I_Know)_I%27m_Losing_You" title="(I Know) I'm Losing You">Your love is fading</a>"; hummed part of the theme song to the 1959 animated series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_Cargo" title="Clutch Cargo">Clutch Cargo</a></i> and said, "I still see the X!"

The (unworn) Max Headroom mask was briefly held in view while the voice cried out, "Oh no, they're coming to get me! Ah, make it stop!" and the female figure began spanking "Max" with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyswatter" title="Flyswatter">flyswatter</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Gallagher_8-5"><a href="#cite_note-Gallagher-8">[8]</a></sup> The image faded briefly into static, and then viewers were returned to the <i>Doctor Who</i> broadcast after a total interruption of about 90 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-Gallagher_8-6"><a href="#cite_note-Gallagher-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Bellows_11-3"><a href="#cite_note-Bellows-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>Technicians at WTTW's studios could not counteract the signal takeover because there were no engineers on duty at that hour at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower" title="Willis Tower">Sears Tower (now known as the Willis Tower)</a>, where the station's broadcast tower was located. According to station spokesman Anders Yocom, technicians monitoring the transmission from WTTW headquarters "attempted to take corrective measures, but couldn't."<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Air director Paul Rizzo recalled that "as the content got weirder we got increasingly stressed out about our inability to do anything about it."<sup id="cite_ref-Shefsky_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-Shefsky-6">[6]</a></sup> The pirate broadcast ended when the hijackers unilaterally ended their transmission. "By the time our people began looking into what was going on, it was over," said Yocom.<sup id="cite_ref-Camper_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-Camper-12">[12]</a></sup> WTTW received numerous phone calls from viewers who wondered what had occurred.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>The broadcast intrusion was achieved by sending a more powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_transmission" title="Microwave transmission">microwave transmission</a> to the stations' broadcast towers than the stations were sending themselves, triggering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_effect" title="Capture effect">capture effect</a>. This was a difficult task in 1987 but was possible before American television stations switched from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition_in_the_United_States" title="Digital television transition in the United States">analog to digital signals</a> in 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-Haskins_9-2"><a href="#cite_note-Haskins-9">[9]</a></sup> Experts have said that the stunt required extensive technical expertise and a significant amount of transmitting power, and that the pirate broadcast likely originated from somewhere in the line of sight of both stations' broadcast towers, which were atop two tall buildings in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Chicago" title="Downtown Chicago">downtown Chicago</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Camper_12-2"><a href="#cite_note-Camper-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>No one has ever claimed responsibility for the stunt. Speculation about the identities of "Max" and his co-conspirators has centered on the theories that the prank was either an inside job by a disgruntled employee (or former employee) of WGN or was carried out by members of Chicago's underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture" title="Hacker culture">hacker community</a>. However, despite an official law enforcement investigation in the immediate aftermath of the incident and many unofficial investigations, inquiries, and online speculation in the ensuing decades, the identities and motives of the hijackers remain a mystery.<sup id="cite_ref-Shefsky_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-Shefsky-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Unruh_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-Unruh-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gallagher_8-7"><a href="#cite_note-Gallagher-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Haskins_9-3"><a href="#cite_note-Haskins-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wbur_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-wbur-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>Soon after the intrusion, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> official was quoted in news reporting that the perpetrators faced a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to a year in prison.<sup id="cite_ref-Knittel_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-Knittel-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Camper_12-3"><a href="#cite_note-Camper-12">[12]</a></sup> However, the five-year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a> was surpassed in 1992, so the persons responsible for the intrusion would no longer face criminal punishment should their identities be revealed.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>Though the incident only briefly caught the attention of the general public, it has been overtly or subtly referenced in a variety of media over the ensuing decades, with <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard_(website)" title="Motherboard (website)">Motherboard</a></i> claiming that it has been an influential "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk" title="Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> hacking trope".<sup id="cite_ref-Haskins_9-4"><a href="#cite_note-Haskins-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>The first reference came soon after the initial events when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAQ-TV" title="WMAQ-TV">WMAQ-TV</a>, another Chicago TV station, humorously inserted clips of the hijacking into a newscast during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Giangreco" title="Mark Giangreco">Mark Giangreco</a>'s sports highlights.

</figure><p>Nobody expected polio to be back.</p><p>It’s 2040, a decade since the disease was eradicated. The global health campaign that vanquished the virus has disbanded; immunization efforts have slackened. Then, one day, a sick child in a conflict-wracked country develops paralysis; the cause turns out to be polio. Scientists trace the origin of the virus to a laboratory on the other side of the world. A technician at the lab had handled a forgotten batch of polio-infected material — and then visited their family abroad.</p><p>As cases multiply, the World Health Organization (WHO) appeals for help to conduct emergency immunization campaigns, but stocks of vaccines are low and few members of staff have direct experience of polio outbreaks. Soon there are tens of thousands of cases: millions more people around the world who haven’t had the vaccine are at risk.</p><p>This is just one of many possible scenarios that could follow polio eradication. Although the world has not yet eliminated poliovirus, many observers think it could be gone within three years. The polio-eradication campaign has increased its intensity and funding in the past year in the hope of finally meeting a deadline that’s been postponed many times since efforts were launched in 1988.</p><p>The front lines are Afghanistan and Pakistan, where pockets of wild polio <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02577-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02577-7" data-track-category="body text link">persist but are shrinking</a> (see ‘Wild polio tamed’), and a swathe of Africa, where a polio vaccine that includes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02501-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02501-3" data-track-category="body text link">live virus has itself seeded outbreaks</a>.

</figure><p>The final steps towards eradication are formidable, and it’s not clear when — or whether — nations will reach this goal. Nonetheless, with the demise of the virus in sight, health authorities are planning what happens next.</p><p>That’s because eradication is not extinction. Polio could lurk in testing labs and manufacturing facilities — from which it has leaked in the past — and even in some people. Mistakes years after eradication could let polio into an unprotected population where it could “wreak havoc”, says virologist Konstantin Chumakov, former associate director of vaccine research at the FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p><p>The end of polio is only the beginning of another effort: developing the resilience to keep it away, says Liam Donaldson, a public-health specialist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, UK, and the lead author of a series of independent reports on the campaign’s progress (see go.nature.com/49hho4a). “People have signed up to polio eradication, but they’ve not signed up to the longer journey.”</p><h2><b>Stamping it out</b></h2><p>Only one human disease has so far been declared eradicated: smallpox, in 1980. Polio has been more complex, says David Heymann, who heads the WHO’s Containment Advisory Group. That’s because of a key difference: every smallpox infection produces symptoms, but polio can silently infect up to 1,000 people before causing a case of paralysis. The other snag is that polio can be caused not only by the wild virus, but also, in very rare cases, by the vaccines deployed to prevent it. Eradication means getting rid of both forms for good.</p><p>The main tool is vaccination. Industrialized, polio-free countries use an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which doesn’t prevent the virus infecting the body and being shed in stools, but does protect against paralysis. Provided that immunization levels with IPV remain high and sanitation is good, a rogue poliovirus will probably peter out, according to Concepcion Estivariz, a polio researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>But because the inactivated vaccine can’t block transmission, children in at-risk countries still receive another type: an oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) that contains an attenuated form of the live virus, and can stop polio’s spread — which is crucial for eradication. It’s also cheaper and easier to deliver than IPV, which is administered by injection. The oral campaign has been hugely successful. Since 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) estimates it has prevented 20 million cases of polio paralysis.</p><figure>

</figure><p>But OPV has some important downsides. There is a low risk that the vaccine itself can cause paralysis. And, on rare occasions, the weakened virus used in the vaccine can mutate sufficiently to regain virulence. This can lead to outbreaks of cases known as vaccine-derived polio among people who have not been vaccinated fully or at all. “If we continue OPV,” says Estivariz, “we never stop the circle.” Most countries are now using IPV in their routine immunization programmes alongside OPV, and the WHO recommends that IPV administration should continue for a decade after disease transmission has been stopped, to protect against any accidental releases or hidden pockets of the virus.</p><p>Polio will be certified as eradicated when no case has been observed for three years, and when there is no sign of it in environmental surveillance data — that is, in samples of waste water. A year after that, OPV must be withdrawn to prevent vaccine-derived polio. The problem, however, is that removing it will be an extraordinarily delicate manoeuvre. Done messily, this process could trigger the return of the virus.</p><p>In 2016, for instance, the withdrawal of an OPV across 150 countries went disastrously wrong. “The results were sobering”, says Kimberly Thompson, an epidemiologist at the research non-profit organization Kid Risk, in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>There are three strains of wild polio — types 1, 2 and 3. Type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015, and type 3 followed in 2019. The oral vaccine contained attenuated versions of all three strains, but after type 2 was eradicated, the aim was to withdraw vaccines containing that strain to minimize the risk of seeding vaccine-derived type 2 polio. So the GPEI orchestrated a two-week period in April 2016 in which all three-strain oral vaccines were switched for versions containing just types 1 and 3.</p><p>Swiftly, however, cases of vaccine-derived type 2 polio began to build — in two countries in 2016, spreading to 24 countries by 2020, with countries in Africa worst affected. A case popped up in the United States in 2022, and the United Kingdom found the virus in wastewater samples. The cumulative number of paralysis cases so far is just over 3,200; the yearly total peaked at more than 1,000 in 2020 and now seems to be declining, with 238 recorded so far this year (see ‘Rare and receding: vaccine-derived polio’). African countries are still running multiple emergency campaigns delivering oral type 2 vaccines to stamp these outbreaks out.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Why the rebound? First, populations in the regions affected weren’t sufficiently vaccinated beforehand with IPV, which would have protected them until any outbreaks could be controlled. This was partly owing to a gap in vaccine supply, says Ondrej Mach, who co-chairs a new GPEI group that will oversee future withdrawals of the oral vaccine.</p><p>What’s more, says Mach, just before the switch, vaccine-derived type 2 polio was detected in Nigeria. Transmission was probably already under way in Nigeria and other countries, adds Mach, and the emergency type 2 vaccine seeded further outbreaks.</p><p>Since 2021, however, this seeding has become much less likely: vaccination campaigns are controlling the outbreaks using a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03045-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03045-2" data-track-category="body text link">genetically engineered oral vaccine</a>, which has an even lower chance of becoming virulent than the OPVs used previously.</p><p>What risks does the post-polio world face if full oral withdrawal goes wrong? An analysis by Kid Risk and the CDC gave one answer (D. A. Kalkowska <i>et al. Risk Anal. </i>https://doi.org/k428; 2023). Their model considers what might happen if all OPV use stopped in 2027 but vaccine-derived polio was not completely eliminated beforehand and outbreak responses were weak. In one scenario, the model predicts that there could be as many as 40,000 cases of paralysis caused by vaccine-derived polio 8 years after OPV administration is discontinued. To avoid this, the authors suggest that population immunity in areas with polio cases today needs to be very high — about 90% — just before withdrawal. Thompson says that most countries have achieved this in the past, at least for short periods of time.</p><h2><b>Keeping a lookout</b></h2><p>Even after OPVs are successfully withdrawn, therefore, countries can’t let their guard down. They must put in place surveillance “to detect any poliovirus, no matter where in the world it appears and however fleetingly”, says a report by the Transition Independent Monitoring Board, an independent group of scientists that reports periodically on the polio endgame and is chaired by Donaldson.</p><p>Polio surveillance takes two main forms: searching for cases of paralysis that might be caused by polio; and monitoring waste water for any virus shed by carriers.</p><p>Both will be crucial for years, as an example from Malawi shows. The country had been free from wild polio for three decades when, in 2021, a stool sample from a three-year-old with paralysis arrived at the national laboratory to be sent abroad for testing. The sample sat for two months before it was shipped with others, says Jamal Ahmed, who coordinates polio eradication for the WHO in its African region, which comprises 47 countries. The result came back a month later: it was wild polio type 1, not seen in the continent since 2016.</p><p>Sequencing traced its origin to Pakistan, but also revealed that the virus had been circulating for two years undetected — possibly in Malawi, and possibly elsewhere. Because Malawi had no wastewater surveillance at the time, it was impossible to know.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Within 30 days of receiving the result, emergency immunizations began. Six campaign rounds later, says Ahmed, Malawi has seen no more cases of wild polio. And, with the WHO’s help, the country swiftly installed environmental surveillance sites.</p><p>The episode also showed that the emergency vaccination programme wasn’t up to the job, says Jay Wenger, who leads the polio programme at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. “We had to rebuild the polio infrastructure we had before” to get rid of the virus, he says.</p><p>Global wastewater surveillance has become a bigger priority since the COVID-19 pandemic, says Donaldson, because politicians are paying more attention to trends in disease. Ahmed says that 41 of the 47 member states of WHO Africa now have environmental polio surveillance, and that the rest will soon catch up.</p><p>Innovations are helping to speed up a process in which timeliness is crucial. One breakthrough is direct detection, a method that leapfrogs several of the conventional stages of the testing process; for example, by extracting RNA directly from samples without the need to culture them.</p><h2><b>The threat of escape</b></h2><p>No matter how successful the eradication effort is, the virus will remain in research institutes and vaccine-manufacturing facilities — and in an unknown number of routine diagnostic labs.</p><p>Escapes happen. Last year, a lab worker at a manufacturing facility in Utrecht, the Netherlands, picked up type 3 virus at the facility, and this was then detected in wastewater surveillance outside the plant. No cases of paralysis resulted. Vaccine manufacturing is “a huge containment nightmare”, says Mach.</p><p>The WHO has a plan for poliovirus containment that urges nations to minimize the number of facilities retaining poliovirus materials and to destroy any unnecessary stocks. At the moment, the WHO knows of 74 facilities that hold polio, in 22 countries.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The first step was for each country to set up a national authority for containment by 2018, to ensure that facilities comply with biosafety requirements. China and Romania have not yet done this, and other countries have missed subsequent deadlines.</p><p>Even for compliant facilities, forgotten samples remain a threat, says Andy Macadam at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar, UK. “All you have to do is mislabel the tube.” And polio might lurk in some facilities that are not even subject to the containment plan, says Heymann. This could include frozen stool samples taken for other reasons at a time when polio was circulating.</p><p>Since 2000, there have been 21 reported incidents of poliovirus release from laboratories and vaccine-production facilities in 8 countries, with 16 cases of polio as a result, according to Derek Ehrhardt, who heads the WHO’s poliovirus containment unit. Most cases have been in vaccine-manufacturing facilities, but five of them were in research labs in which workers discovered that vials containing poliovirus were mislabelled (none of those cross-contamination incidents led to paralysis). The solution, says Heymann, is better biosecurity in all labs.</p><p>To reduce the need for live virus, scientists are developing ways to produce the inactivated vaccine without it — for example, by using a non-infectious, genetically engineered starting material, or by designing vaccines from virus-like particles or messenger RNA.</p><h2><b>A surprising source</b></h2><p>There is yet another source of poliovirus, unforeseen 35 years ago when eradication efforts began.</p><p>In most people who receive the oral vaccine, the immune system generates antibodies that protect them against the virus. But in a small number of people born with particular immune deficiency disorders, the immune system allows the attenuated virus from the vaccine to live on, evolving as time goes by and emerging in their stools. No drugs have been proved to cure an ongoing polio infection.</p><p>Only some of the several hundred types of immunodeficiency lead to chronic retention of poliovirus. No one knows how many people are affected, and no such shedding is known to have triggered a polio outbreak, although it might have contributed to one in the Philippines in 2019–21.</p><p>But, says Mach, even one person retaining and shedding poliovirus is incompatible with eradication. “We have to do something.” An international — if patchy — search for people with these immune disorders who have chronic polio has produced a register of 200 individuals.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>One person with the condition lives in the United Kingdom and was vaccinated with OPV as a child. For more than 20 years, he asymptomatically carried — and shed — the attenuated virus, which evolved to its disease-causing form. His gut was “essentially a culture vessel”, says David Boyle at PATH, a non-profit medical-research organization based in Seattle, Washington.</p><p>That’s why scientists were surprised to learn that the person’s infection had gone.</p><p>It disappeared after he received the antiviral drug remdesivir for severe COVID-19 in August 2021. This could be coincidence, says Macadam, but it bolsters the case that antivirals could be used to treat polio infection (two such drugs are being explored as polio treatments). Monoclonal antibodies are also under development.</p><h2><b>Complacency and responsibility</b></h2><p>Keeping vaccination rates high for at least a decade after eradication will be the best protection — but there are fears that commitment to IPVs might wane once eradication has been declared. Routine immunization campaigns struggle to reach every child, especially during conflict, disasters or pandemics. COVID-19 drove the number of unvaccinated or undervaccinated children up to 23 million in 2020.</p><p>Added to this is the growing problem in some regions of vaccine scepticism and complacency, which grew worse because of activism against COVID-19 vaccines, says Peter Hotez, a vaccine specialist and public advocate at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>With so much to be done to maintain a polio-free world, Donaldson is asking who will be accountable once the GPEI disbands a year after eradication, handing its responsibilities to WHO departments, partners and national health programmes.</p><p>A transition has already begun in some countries, but many have struggled to find their own funding amid changing government priorities. Slackening efforts now could bring bigger problems in the future, says Aidan O’Leary, who directs polio eradication at the WHO. “If we collectively take our eye off the ball and don’t build the resilience of health systems going forward, then we face further problems down the line.”</p><p>But done well, says O’Leary, the post-polio world could bring wider health benefits for everyone: better surveillance and immunization measures, and more joined-up health services. “The last mile of the polio eradication programme”, he says, “is the first mile for global public-health security.”</p>

<p><strong>Sorry if this was slow to load before.</strong><br>It’s self hosted in my flat with a VDSL connection not designed for heavy traffic. I’ve swallowed my pride and ironically put this blog on a CDN.</p>



<h2>My ISP has never been amazing…</h2>



<p>Well, most aren’t. Browsing the Internet was getting worse and worse, but too unpredictable to see a clear pattern. Speed tests were fine, many websites loaded perfectly, but enough didn’t work, so it was worth investigating. Apple TV+ would crap out, but only if casting via AirPlay. BBC News wouldn’t load at all, but iPlayer would slowly.</p>



<h2>The network</h2>



<p>I have a VDSL2 line, Ubiquiti Wi-Fi and standard Catalyst switches. Nothing too weird.  I pay for a /29 block, so I have multiple usable IP addresses. Yes I host my own mail, and yes, I do DKIM, DMARC and SPF, and MXToolbox shows I’m not on any blocklists.</p>



<h2>The symptoms</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><mark>Working</mark></th><th><mark>Not working</mark></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>most websites load fine<br>(amazon.co.uk, halifax.co.uk)</td><td>but many not at all<br>(bbc.co.uk, farnell.com)</td></tr><tr><td>800Mbps iperf across the LAN</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stable 39 Mbps down / 7 Mbps up</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stable 6ms ping to 1.1.1.1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PPP is stable and not dropping</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AirPlay to LG TV works (via a Unifi AP)</td><td>but crashes once per show</td></tr><tr><td>AirPlay to LG TV works (TV wired in)</td><td>still crashes</td></tr><tr><td>Spotify can stream to a Bose Soundbar</td><td>but changing song takes 30sec+</td></tr><tr><td>DNS is fine</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>iOS app downloads take 3min to start</td></tr><tr><td>Swapping Cisco VDSL2 router for the ISP’s router makes some sites now work</td><td>but not all sites</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>The cause</h2>



<p>The freebie ISP router has IPv6 enabled by default, so would speak to the CDNs from the clean v6 range. <strong>When using my equipment without IPv6 configured, I can only speak on the IPv4 range</strong> that’s “shadow banned”.</p>



<h2>Proving my theory</h2>



<h3>Step 1: VPN egress traversing bad ISP’s network</h3>



<p>I set up a WireGuard tunnel to another site I have in the Isle of Man, supplied by another ISP. I forwarded all traffic from my workstation via this tunnel:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="219" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-1024x219.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-1024x219.png 1024w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-300x64.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-768x164.png 768w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12-1536x328.png 1536w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.png 1735w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I now pop out in the Isle of Man via ASN 42455’s network (www.infobyip.com to test):</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="259" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-1024x259.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-1024x259.png 1024w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-300x76.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771-768x195.png 768w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11-e1700657251771.png 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>and can surf and stream as normal:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="451" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-1024x451.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-1024x451.png 1024w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-300x132.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22-768x339.png 768w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-22.png 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Step 2: Wireshark deep-dive</h3>



<p>I took two captures of my workstation visiting bbc.co.uk in Chrome. The first without the WireGuard tunnel on, and the second with it on. Let’s look at <code>tcp</code> traffic:</p>



<p><strong>Without WireGuard:</strong></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="888" height="551" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19.png 888w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19-300x186.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-19-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"><figcaption>No meaningful TCP traffic makes it out. A lot of retransmissions and duplicate ACKs are happening</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>With WireGuard:</strong></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="888" height="520" src="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20.png 888w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20-300x176.png 300w, https://blog.abctaylor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-20-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"><figcaption>A nice healthy TCP session</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>(I disabled checksum verification in the screenshots above, as I’m capturing on the same machine having problems, which also has checksum offloading on the NIC.)</em></p>



<h2><em>Zen Broadband</em>, my ISP (for now)</h2>



<p>I’ll save my views on Zen for when this case is resolved. I’ve got so far through the support process I’m now dealing with their Network Ops team to investigate this. They can still redeem themselves by simply giving me a different /29 block as far away from 82.71.78.0/29 as possible 🙂</p>



<h2>Be more specific. What do you mean by “throttled”?</h2>



<p>The blocking is nondeterministic. Whilst Akamai (who offers a reputation check) returns one of my IPs as clean, websites of their customers like eBay have shown the throttling behaviour. Apple TV+ appears to be served by Akamai too (tv.apple.com), which has been the worst offender for “throttling” my streaming:</p>



<div data-code-block-pro-font-family="Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>PS</span><span> </span><span>C</span><span>:\</span><span>WINDOWS</span><span>\system32&gt; nslookup tv.apple.com</span></span>

<span><span>          itunes.apple.com.edgekey.net</span></span></code></pre></div>



<p>It’s also available with IPv6, explaining the freebie ISP router theory.</p>



<p>Fastly doesn’t offer a rep check on their website but bbc.co.uk right now won’t load at all. Cloudflare is opaque too about disclosing what IPs they’re throttling.</p>



<h2>Why would a range get throttled or “shadow banned”?</h2>



<p>This is extremely difficult to answer and I have no good theory. The same IP range handles my email and I generally have no trouble emailing major providers like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo!, and many other counterparties.</p>

<p>The oil and gas industry is banking on carbon capture as its “fix” for climate change. The IEA’s new report dispels that idea and offers real solutions.</p>



<p>The oil and gas sector currently accounts for just 1% of clean energy investment globally. A special report from the International Energy Agency (<a href="https://www.iea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEA</a>) released ahead of the COP28 climate summit explores how the fossil fuel industry “can take a more responsible approach and contribute positively to the new energy economy.”</p>



<p>In other words, the fossil fuel industry needs to get on the renewables bandwagon<em>&nbsp;now</em>, and not with large-scale carbon capture. The IEA provides a roadmap in its<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-oil-and-gas-industry-in-net-zero-transitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;new report</a>, “The Oil and Gas Industry in Net Zero Transitions.”</p>



<p>Global demand for both oil and gas is set to peak by 2030, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/10/23/iea-predicts-that-global-emissions-will-peak-by-2025/">if not by 2025</a>. If governments deliver in full on their national energy and climate pledges, demand will fall 45% below today’s level by 2050. In a pathway to reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, which is necessary to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C within reach, oil and gas use will decline by more than 75% by 2050.</p>



<p>Or, to spell it out in monetary terms, the report’s analysis finds that the current valuation of private oil and gas companies could fall by 25% from $6 trillion today if all national energy and climate goals are reached, and by up to 60% if the world gets on track to limit global warming to 1.5C.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-status-quo-is-impossible">The status quo is impossible</h2>



<p>Every oil and gas company’s transition strategy can and should include a plan to reduce emissions from its own operations, asserts the report – yet companies with targets to reduce their emissions account for less than 50% of global oil and gas output.</p>



<p>The IEA also points out that carbon capture can’t be used as a linchpin by the fossil fuel industry to maintain the status quo. If oil and natural gas consumption were to evolve as projected under today’s policy settings, limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C would require an “entirely inconceivable” 32 billion tonnes of carbon captured for utilization or storage by 2050, including 23 billion tonnes via direct air capture.</p>



<p>The amount of electricity needed to power these technologies would be greater than the&nbsp;<em>entire world’s electricity demand</em>&nbsp;today.</p>



<p>IEA executive director Fatih Birol said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible.</p>



<p>The [oil and gas] industry needs to commit to genuinely helping the world meet its energy needs and climate goals – which means letting go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-be-part-of-the-solution">How to be part of the solution</h2>



<p>The report finds that the oil and gas sector is well placed to scale up some crucial technologies for transitions to clean energy, such as offshore wind and geothermal energy. It’s going to have to change tack in many other aspects of its business, too. It needs to increase investment in EV charging facilities – turn the gas stations into EV stations. The sector can also move further into the plastics recycling industry as global bans on plastic continue to grow.</p>



<p>Further, the <em>production, transport, and processing</em> of oil and gas results in nearly 15% of global energy-related emissions – equal to the US’s entire energy-related emissions. The fossil fuel industry’s emissions must decline by 60% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C by 2050. The emissions intensity of oil and gas producers with the highest emissions is currently five to 10 times above those with the lowest, showing the vast potential for improvements. So it needs to boost efficiency and electrify its facilities across the sector. </p>



<p>Reducing emissions from methane, which accounts for half of the total emissions from oil and gas operations, would also provide a big win, as methane reduction strategies are well-known and inexpensive.</p>



<p>The oil and gas industry invested around $20 billion in clean energy in 2022, or roughly 2.5% of its total capital spending. It can and must do a lot better. To align with the Paris Agreement, the IEA says, it must put 50% of its capital expenditures towards clean energy projects by 2030, on top of the investment required to reduce emissions from its operations.</p>



<p>Not only is it imperative that the fossil fuel sector shifts gears to limit global warming – it’s also good business.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Pioneer of Google’s Data Centers Dies at 58" data-elid="2666322744" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/in-memoriam-nov-2023" data-authors="Amanda Davis" data-page-title="Pioneer of Google’s Data Centers Dies at 58 - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>Luiz André Barroso</strong></p><p>Data center pioneer</p><p>Senior member, 59; died 16 September</p><p>An engineer at <a href="https://about.google/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a> for more than 20 years, Barroso is credited with designing the company’s warehouse-size data centers. They house hundreds of thousands of computer servers and disk drives and have brought cloud computing, more powerful search engines, and faster Internet service. He died unexpectedly of natural causes. </p><p>Barroso was born in Brazil and earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 1989 in electrical engineering from <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/english/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro</a>. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he earned a Ph.D. in computer engineering in 1996 from the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>.</p><p>In 1995 he joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102750386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Research Laboratory</a>, in Palo Alto, Calif., as a researcher specializing in microprocessor design. While there, he investigated how to build hardware to run more modern business applications and Web services. Three years later, the company was acquired by <a href="https://www.compaq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Compaq</a> and his project was terminated.</p><p>He left Compaq in 2001 to join <a href="https://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google</a> in Mountain View, Calif., as a software engineer.</p><p>The company housed its servers at leased space in third-party data centers, which were basically cages in which a few racks of computing equipment were placed. As Google’s business expanded, its need for infrastructure increased. In 2004 Barroso was tasked with investigating ways to build more efficient data centers.</p><p>He devised a way to use low-cost components and energy-saving techniques to distribute Google’s programs across thousands of servers, instead of the traditional method of relying on a few powerful, expensive machines.</p><p>The company’s first data center designed by Barroso opened in 2006 in The Dalles, Ore. It implemented fault-tolerance software and hardware infrastructure to make the servers less prone to disruption. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> now has 35 data centers in 10 countries, all drawing from Barroso’s groundbreaking techniques.</p><p>In 2009 Barroso co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Datacenter-Computer-Introduction-Warehouse-Scale-Architecture/dp/159829556X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Data Center as a Computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines</em></a>, a seminal textbook.</p><p>He also led the team that designed Google’s AI chips, known as tensor processing units or TPUs, which accelerated machine-learning workloads. He helped integrate augmented reality and machine learning into Google Maps.</p><p>At the time of his death, Barroso was a Google Fellow, the company’s highest rank for technical staff.</p><p>He also was an executive sponsor of the company’s Hispanic and Latinx employee group and oversaw a program that awarded fellowships to doctoral students in Latin America.</p><p>For his contributions to computing architecture, he received the 2020 <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/barroso_UJ31885" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eckert-Mauchly Award</a>, an honor given jointly by IEEE and the <a href="https://www.acm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Association for Computer Machinery</a>.</p><p>He was a Fellow of the ACM and the <a href="https://www.aaas.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>.</p><p>He served on the board of <a href="https://www.rainforesttrust.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rainforest Trust</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting tropical lands and conserving threatened wildlife. Just weeks before he died, Barroso organized and led a weeklong trip to Brazil’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pantanal</a> wetlands.</p><p>Read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-visionary-designer-behind-googles-warehousescale-data-centers" target="_self"><em>The Institute’s</em> 2020 profile</a> of him to learn more about his career journey.</p><p><strong>Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao</strong></p><p>Former director of the Indian Statistical Institute </p><p>Honorary member, 102; died 23 August</p><p>Rao was onetime director of the <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indian Statistical Institute</a>, in Kolkata. The pioneering mathematician and statistician spent more than four decades at the organization, where he discovered two seminal estimators: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cramér–Rao bound</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao%E2%80%93Blackwell_theorem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rao–Blackwell theorem</a>. The two estimators—rules for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data—provided the basis for much of modern statistics.</p><p>For his discoveries, Rao received the 2023 <a href="https://statprize.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Prize in Statistics</a>. The award is presented every two years to an individual or team for “major achievements using statistics to advance science, technology, and human welfare.” </p><p>Rao began his career in 1943 as a technical apprentice at the Indian Statistical Institute. He was promoted the following year to superintending statistician. Two years later, he published a paper in the <a href="https://www.calmathsociety.co.in/cmsPublications.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society</em></a>, demonstrating two fundamental statistical concepts still heavily used in the field today. The Cramér-Rao bound helps statisticians determine the quality of any estimation method. The Rao-Blackwell theorem provides a means for optimizing estimates. </p><p>Rao’s work formed the basis of information geometry, an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of differential geometry to study probability theory and statistics.</p><p>Rao was a professor at the ISI’s research and training school before being promoted to director in 1964—a position he held for 12 years.</p><p>He moved to the United States in the 1980s to join the <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a> as a professor of mathematics and statistics. He left Pittsburgh eight years later to teach at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a> in State College, where in 2001 he became director of its multivariate analysis center. Multivariate statistics are data analysis procedures that simultaneously consider more than two variables.</p><p>After nine years at Penn State he moved to New York, where he was a research professor at the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Buffalo</a> until shortly before he died.</p><p>Rao authored more than 14 books and 400 journal articles during his career. He received several awards for his lifetime contributions, including 38 honorary doctoral degrees from universities in 19 countries.</p><p>In 2010 he was honored with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Science_Award" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India Science Award</a>, the highest honor given by the government of India in the scientific sector. He received the 2002 U.S. <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/od/honorary-awards/national-medal-of-science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Medal of Science</a>, the country’s highest award for lifetime achievement in scientific research.</p><p>He was nominated in 2013 for a <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-peace-prizes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his contributions to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-642-04898-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science</a>. Last year he was named an <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-honorary-membership/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">honorary member</a> of IEEE. </p><p>Rao received a master’s degree in mathematics in 1940 from <a href="https://www.andhrauniversity.edu.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Andhra University</a>, in Visakhapatnam. Three years later he earned a master’s degree in statistics from the <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Calcutta</a>. He went on to receive a Ph.D. in statistics from <a href="https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">King’s College Cambridge</a> in 1945 and a doctor of science degree from the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a> in 1965.</p><p><strong>Herbert William Zwack</strong></p><p>Former U.S. Naval Research Laboratory associate superintendent </p><p>Life member, 88; died 14 March</p><p>Zwack led electronic warfare research programs at the U.S. <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naval Research Laboratory</a>, in Washington, D.C., where he worked for more than two decades. </p><p>After receiving a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1955 from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York University Tandon School of Engineering</a>), in New York City, he joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazeltine_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hazeltine</a> (now <a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BAE Systems</a>).
