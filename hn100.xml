</p><div>
<p>A study of 26 years' worth of wolf behavioral data, and an analysis of the blood of 229 wolves, has shown that infection with the parasite <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a></em> makes wolves 46 times more likely to become a pack leader.</p>
<p>The research shows that the effects of this parasite in the wild have been horrendously understudied – and its role in ecosystems and animal behavior underestimated.</p>
<p>If you have a cat, you've probably heard of this parasite before. The microscopic organism can only sexually reproduce in the bodies of felines, but it can infect and thrive in pretty much all warm-blooded animals.</p>
<p>This includes humans, where it can cause a typically symptomless (but still <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00025/full">potentially fatal</a>) parasitic disease called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/faqs.html">toxoplasmosis</a>.</p>
<p>Once it's in another host, individual <em>T. gondii</em> parasites needs to find a way to get their offspring back inside a cat if it doesn't want to become an evolutionary dead-end. And it has a kind of creepy way of maximizing its chances.</p>
<p>Animals such as <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2000.1182">rats</a> infected with the parasite start taking more risks, and in some cases actually become fatally attracted to the scent of feline urine, and thus more likely to be killed by them.</p>
<p>For larger animals, such as <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01517-1">chimpanzees</a>, it means an increased risk of a run-in with a larger cat, such as a leopard. <span>Hyenas infected with </span><em>T. gondii</em><span> also are more likely to be <a href="https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cnso_bio_facarticles/1067/">killed by lions</a>.</span></p>
<p>Gray wolves (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf"><em>Canis lupus</em></a>) in the Yellowstone National Park aren't exactly cat prey. But sometimes their territory overlaps with that of cougars (<em>P<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar">uma concolor</a></em>), known carriers of <em>T. gondii</em>, and the two species both prey on the elk (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk"><em>Cervus canadensis</em></a>), bison (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison"><em>Bison bison</em></a>), and mule deer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_deer"><em>Odocoileus hemionus</em></a>) that also can be found there.</p>
<p>It's possible that wolves also become infected, perhaps from occasionally eating dead cougars, or ingesting cougar poo.</p><figure id="attachment_81780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81780"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-642x420.jpg" alt="" width="642" height="420" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-642x420.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-768x502.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-600x393.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop.jpg 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-81780">Diagram showing the hypothesized wolf-cougar-<em>T. gondii</em> feedback loop. (Meyer, Cassidy et al., <em>Communications Biology</em>, 2022)</figcaption></figure><p>Data collected on the wolves and their behavior for nearly 27 years offered a rare opportunity to study the effects of the parasite on a wild, <a href="https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/intermediate-host">intermediate</a> host.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by biologists Connor Meyer and Kira Cassidy of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, also took a look at blood samples from wolves and cougars to gauge the rate of <em>T. gondii</em> infection.</p>
<p>They found that wolves with a lot of territory overlap with cougars were more likely to be infected with <em>T. gondii</em>.</p>
<p>But there was a behavioral consequence, too, with significantly increased risk-taking.</p>
<p>Infected wolves were 11 times more likely to disperse from their pack, into new territory. Infected males had a 50 percent probability of leaving their pack within six months, compared with a more typical 21 months for the uninfected.</p>
<p>Similarly, infected females had 25 percent chance of leaving their pack within 30 months, compared with 48 months for those who weren't infected.</p>
<p>Infected wolves were also way more likely to become pack leaders. <em>T. gondii</em> may increase testosterone levels, which could in turn lead to heightened aggression and dominance, which are traits that would help a wolf assert itself as a pack leader.</p>
<p>This has a couple of important consequences. Pack leaders are the ones who reproduce, and <em>T. gondii</em> transmission can be congenital, passed from mother to offspring. But it can also affect the dynamics of the entire pack.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XSN_rXwqnNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""> frameborder="0″ allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>"Due to the group-living structure of the gray wolf pack, the pack leaders have a disproportionate influence on their pack mates and on group decisions," <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0">the researchers write in their paper</a>.</p>
<p>"If the lead wolves are infected with <em>T. gondii</em> and show behavioral changes … this may create a dynamic whereby behavior, triggered by the parasite in one wolf, influences the rest of the wolves in the pack."</p>
<p>If, for example, the pack leader seeks out <span>the scent of cougar pee <span>as they boldly push into new territory,</span> </span><span>they could face greater exposure to the parasite, thus a greater rate of </span><em>T. gondii</em><span> infection throughout the wolf population. This generates a sort of feedback loop of increased overlap and infection.</span></p>
<p>It's compelling evidence that tiny, understudied agents can have a huge influence on ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>"This study demonstrates how community-level interactions can affect individual behavior and could potentially scale up to group-level decision-making, population biology, and community ecology," the researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0">write</a>.</p>
<p>"Incorporating the implications of parasite infections into future wildlife research is vital to understanding the impacts of parasites on individuals, groups, populations, and ecosystem processes."</p>
<p>The research has been published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0">Communications Biology</a></em>.</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article was published in November 2022.</em></p>

<p>Today at Corky Gonzales branch of the Denver Public Library, Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) signed the “Consumer Right to Repair Digital Electronic Equipment,” which gives consumers a right to repair their own equipment including “​​cell phones, gaming systems, computers, and televisions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Under this bill, when an item is broken, it could be a cellphone like this, a dishwasher, a washing machine, or a laptop, Coloradans will have the information they need to repair their own equipment or use the repair provider of their own choice,” said Polis. “This doesn’t mean everybody, certainly, is suddenly going to know how to repair your own equipment but it allows for independent repair services to be offered, which can then compete and provide a lower price or better and quicker repairs than other established channels for doing that.”</p>



<p>Polis noted that this bill expands on the right-to-repair <a href="https://www.cohousedems.com/news/new-right-to-repair-agriculture-equipment-law-goes-into-effect#:~:text=Colorado%20is%20the%20first%20and,at%20fair%20and%20reasonable%20costs.">agricultural equipment law</a> passed last year. Due to the success of the law, he believes that this right-to-repair bill will succeed as well.</p>

<p>According to state Sen. Jeff Bridges (D-Greenwood Villiage), the bill’s prime sponsor, the federal government and other states around the country should use this piece of legislation as a model. He stated that this bill is the strongest repair bill in the country, overtaking laws passed in Oregon and California. Bridges stated that this is the only bill that Apple and Google claim works.</p>



<p>“Accidents happen, people drop their phones and break their screens every day, but because of ‘parts pairing’ and repair restrictions, owners aren’t allowed to fix their devices,” said Bridges in a press release. “Colorado has led the nation in expanding right-to-repair laws, from agricultural equipment to wheelchairs to now electronics. This legislation is good for consumers, small businesses, and our economy.”</p>

<p>State Rep. Brianna Titone (D-Arvada), a prime sponsor of this bill stated that Google worked alongside the Democratic leaders in searching for creating a bill that was in the best interest of consumers. This bill allows people the ability to fix their own devices at their leisure.</p>



<p>“Cell phones are a part of our daily lives, we should have more choices on how to fix them when they break,” said Titone in a press release. “This new law will give consumers more options to fix their broken electronics, saving them money and time on costly repairs. Right-to-repair laws, like this one, are important for empowering consumers and keeping e-waste out of our landfills. From tractors to mobility devices, I’m proud to carry another consumer-focused right to repair law through the legislature and save Coloradans money.”</p>



<p>State Rep. Steven Woodrow (D-Denver) stated in a press release that “consumers should have the right to fix their stuff — computers and cell phones included.” </p>



<p>Woodrow claims that this law will add to existing right-to-repair laws allowing consumers access to tools and technical devices that they may need. He noted that this legislation is vitally important in helping reduce pollution and waste.</p>

<p>According to the bill text,&nbsp; a manufacturer’s software tools are free for the consumer but they may charge for physical tools needed.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boulderufixitclinic.org/">The Boulder U-Fix-It Clinic</a>, which is an organization that teaches people how to rebuild their broken devices, was at the bill signing.</p>



<p>“Manufacturer-imposed repair restrictions affect a wide variety of products from tractors to cell phones, resulting in surging costs, monopolistic business practices, and thousands of electronic devices thrown out every day,” said Sen. Nick Hinrichsen (D-CO), a prime sponsor of the bill in a news release. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if you can’t repair something that’s yours, do you really own it? I would argue no, which is why this legislation is so important. Right-to-repair laws are essential for empowering consumers and ensuring a fair market.”</p>

A massive uptick in traffic to Fedora's package mirrors is causing problems for the Linux distribution. Some five million additional systems have started putting additional strain on Fedora's mirror resources since March and appear to be coming from Amazon's cloud.
</p><p>
Stephen Smoogen of Red Hat wrote a blog post today around 5+ million more EPEL-7 systems beginning in March. Fedora hosts the packaging mirrors for Extra Packages For Enterprise Linux (EPEL) to augment the package selection available on RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, etc. The past three months now there has been a 5+ million surge in Fedora/EPEL traffic and it's placed a strain on the systems. It's about doubling the number of unique IPs connecting to the mirror system.
</p><p>
The massive uptick in Fedora/EPEL activity puts additional pressure on Fedora web proxies for mirror data and then the mirrors themselves that tend to be volunteer run. Much of this new traffic is coming from the Amazon/AWS cloud.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=epel_unique_traffic" alt="EPEL unique IPs shown by Smoogen"></p>
<p>In today's <a href="http://smoogespace.blogspot.com/2024/05/where-did-5-million-epel-7-systems-come.html">blog post</a>, Smoogen describes it as "<em>I am not sure what changed in Amazon in March, but it has had a tremendous impact on parts of Fedora Infrastructure and the volunteer mirror systems which use it.</em>" With some extra publicity on the situation, hopefully whatever the underlying cause of the change in traffic pattern will hopefully be better handled now by Amazon.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce three new attention mechanisms that outperform standard multi-head attention in terms of efficiency and learning capabilities, thereby improving the performance and broader deployability of Transformer models. Our first contribution is Optimised Attention, which performs similarly to standard attention, but has 3/4 as many parameters and one matrix multiplication fewer per head. Next, we introduce Efficient Attention, which performs on par with standard attention with only 1/2 as many parameters as many parameters and two matrix multiplications fewer per head and is up to twice as fast as standard attention. Lastly, we introduce Super Attention, which surpasses standard attention by a significant margin in both vision and natural language processing tasks while having fewer parameters and matrix multiplications. In addition to providing rigorous mathematical comparisons, we evaluate the presented attention mechanisms on MNIST, CIFAR100, IMDB Movie Reviews, and Amazon Reviews datasets.

<p>Based on a new proposal by the Belgian Minister of the Interior, EU governments could endorse the much-criticised child sexual abuse regulation (CSAR or chat control) as early as June after all. This is what internal information leaked to Pirate Party MEP and shadow rapporteur Patrick Breyer reveals.</p>



<p>Specifically, according to the proposal, users of apps with a communication function would have to agree via terms and conditions or pop-up messages that all images and videos sent to others will be scanned automatically and possibly reported to the EU and the police. To this end, monitoring backdoors would need to be integrated into previously securely end-to-end encrypted messenger services, even though the Belgians claim that their proposed ‘upload moderation’ scheme differs from the much criticised ‘client-side scanning’. If a user does not agree to the scanning of their private photos and videos, they would still be able to use the service for sending text messages, but would no longer be able to share images and videos. The scanner algorithms are supposed to report known CSAM as well as unknown images and videos that are deemed potentially suspicious by ‘artificial intelligence’ technology. The scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which has hardly been used to date, would be removed from the draft legislation, as would the scanning of audio communication, which is not in use at all.</p>



<p>When the proposal was first presented on 8 May, several previously critical governments expressed their support and openness. The <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/184770/imfname_11373735.pdf">proposal is to be discussed again the day after tomorrow (24 May). </a>The EU interior ministers will meet directly after the European elections and could endorse the draft legislation.</p>



<p>‘The leaked Belgian proposal means that the essence of the EU Commission’s extreme and unprecedented initial chat control proposal would be implemented unchanged,’ warns MEP and most prominent opponent of chat control Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party). ‘Using messenger services purely for texting is not an option in the 21st century. And removing excesses that aren’t being used in practice anyway is a sham.</p>



<p>Millions of private chats and private photos of innocent citizens are to be searched using unreliable technology and then leaked without the affected chat users being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse – this would destroy our digital privacy of correspondence. Our nude photos and family photos would end up with strangers in whose hands they do not belong and with whom they are not safe. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side scanning would undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in order to turn our smartphones into spies – this would destroy secure encryption.</p>



<p>I am alarmed that EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged plans, which threatens to overturn the previous blocking minority. Not even a written opinion from the Council’s legal service on this obvious violation of fundamental rights has yet been requested. If the EU governments really do go into the trilogue negotiations with this radical position of indiscriminate chat control scanning, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises that put our online security at risk.</p>



<p>Now is the time to take to the barricades for privacy and secure encryption!’</p>

<p>Update of 23 May: netzpolitik.org has published the <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/internes-protokoll-belgien-will-nutzer-verpflichten-chatkontrolle-zuzustimmen/">document</a> which this analysis relies on in the meantime (in German).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107337921" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, speaks onstage during Vox Media's 2023 Code Conference in Dana Point, California, Sept. 27, 2023.</p><p>Jerod Harris | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner, who helped <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/openai-exec-addresses-ceo-sam-altmans-firing-in-note-to-employees-read-the-full-memo.html">oust CEO Sam Altman</a> in November, broke her silence when she spoke on a podcast released Tuesday about events inside the company leading up to Altman's firing.</p><p>One example she gave: When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the board was not informed in advance and found out about it on Twitter. Toner also said Altman did not tell the board he owned the OpenAI startup fund.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/openai-brings-sam-altman-back-as-ceo-days-after-ouster.html">Altman was renamed CEO</a> less than a week after he was fired, but Toner's comments give insight into the decision for the first time.</p><p>"The board is a nonprofit board that was set up explicitly for the purpose of making sure that the company's public good mission was primary, was coming first — over profits, investor interests, and other things," Toner said on "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4r127XapFv7JZr0OPzRDaI?si=KyTEonBbRQGN0YnEH7sCpQ&amp;amp;nd=1&amp;amp;dlsi=2e11b86f864d48e1" target="_blank">The TED AI Show</a>" podcast.</p><p>"But for years, Sam had made it really difficult for the board to actually do that job by withholding information, misrepresenting things that were happening at the company, in some cases outright lying to the board," she said.</p><p>Toner said Altman gave the board "inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place" on multiple occasions.</p><p>"For any individual case, Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous-sounding explanation of why it wasn't a big deal, or misinterpreted, or whatever," Toner said. "But the end effect was that after years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him came to the conclusion that we just couldn't believe things that Sam was telling us, and that's just a completely unworkable place to be in as a board — especially a board that is supposed to be providing independent oversight over the company, not just helping the CEO to raise more money."</p><p>Toner explained that the board had worked to improve issues. She said that, in October, a month before the ousting, the board had conversations with two executives who relayed experiences with Altman they weren't comfortable sharing before, including screenshots and documentation of problematic interactions and mistruths.</p><p>"The two of them suddenly started telling us ... how they couldn't trust him, about the toxic atmosphere he was creating," Toner said. "They used the phrase 'psychological abuse,' telling us they didn't think he was the right person to lead the company to AGI, telling us they had no belief that he could or would change."</p><p>Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a broad term that refers to a type of artificial intelligence that outperforms human abilities on various cognitive tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html">OpenAI disbanded</a> its team focused on the long-term risks of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/">AI</a>&nbsp;a year after the company announced the group. The news came days after both team leaders, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-says-he-will-leave-the-startup.html">announced their departures</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a>-backed startup. Leike, who has since announced he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/28/openai-safety-leader-jan-leike-joins-amazon-backed-anthropic.html">joining AI competitor Anthropic</a>, wrote on Friday that OpenAI's "safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products."</p><p>Toner's comments and the high-profile departures follow last year's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/heres-whos-on-openais-board-the-group-behind-sam-altmans-ouster.html">leadership crisis</a>.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/heres-whos-on-openais-board-the-group-behind-sam-altmans-ouster.html">OpenAI's board ousted Altman</a>, saying it had conducted "a deliberative review process" and that Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities."</p><p>"The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI," it said.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ilya-sutskever-the-openai-genius-who-told-sam-altman-he-was-fired-26a3381c" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>&nbsp;and other media outlets reported that while Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that artificial intelligence would not harm humans, others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.</p><p>Altman's removal prompted resignations and threats of resignations, including an open letter signed by virtually all of OpenAI's employees, and uproar from investors, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a>. Within a week, Altman was back and board members Toner and Tasha McCauley, who had voted to oust Altman, were out. Sutskever relinquished his seat on the board and remained on staff until he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-says-he-will-leave-the-startup.html">announced his departure</a> on May 14. Adam D'Angelo, who had also voted to oust Altman, remains on the board.</p><p>In March, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/08/sam-altman-rejoins-openai-board-company-adds-three-new-members.html">OpenAI announced its new board</a>, which includes Altman, and the conclusion of an internal investigation by law firm WilmerHale into the events leading up to Altman's ouster.</p><p>OpenAI did not publish the WilmerHale investigation report but summarized its findings.</p><p>"The review concluded there was a significant breakdown of trust between the prior board and Sam and Greg," OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said at the time, referring to president and co-founder Greg Brockman. The review also "concluded the board acted in good faith ... [and] did not anticipate some of the instability that led afterwards," Taylor added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Today we're excited to launch <a href="http://www.shotwithkino.com/" rel="noreferrer">Kino</a>, a powerful filmmaking app for beginners and experts alike. As say they say in screenwriting, "Show, Don't tell," so let's walk through a few of the tent-pole features in our huge 1.0 release.</p><h3 id="instant-grade">Instant Grade</h3><p>Aspiring filmmakers chase a "film look," but what does that even mean? Obviously there's the artistry that happens on a movie set, from lighting design to costuming, but let's focus on the camera itself. On a technical level, why does video shot on an iPhone look different than one shot on a big Hollywood camera?</p><p>For one, there are artists who sculpt the contrast and color of the image after it's shot, through a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading" rel="noreferrer">Color Grading</a>. These "colorists" play a big role in the most iconic images in cinema.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg" width="1536" height="1728" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg" width="1200" height="1546" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><p>While it's easy to spot bold color grades, colorists touch every film you see. Just as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ttG90raCNo" rel="noreferrer">no CGI is just invisible CGI</a>, some of the best color grades don't draw attention to themselves, and talented directors use them to convey emotion or subtext without spelling it out.</p><p>In the past, anyone who tried to grade iPhone videos… did not have a fun time. Setting aside the hundreds of hours it takes to get good at the job, iPhone video had technical limitations that made it even harder to work with than a normal Hollywood camera. Your iPhone throws out precious information about color and brightness to save drive space, which makes grading as hard as changing the ingredients of a cake after it's been baked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1976" height="1098" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 1976w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Last fall, everything changed when Apple introduced "Log" video support on the iPhone 15 Pro. When recording in this format, your iPhone saves a version of your video with most of the original information, and <em>before</em> any creative decisions have been applied. Using that cake analogy, it's like the iPhone now saves all the ingredients that make up a cake, but leaves you to do the baking.</p><p>That's great if you're a skilled baker… er… colorist… but it's challenging for most of us. Out of the box, Apple Log footage looks really flat. It's not meant to look good. It's meant to be edited later.</p><p>But what if you didn't have to edit? What if you could use all that powerful extra color data and get a cinematic look with one tap?</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2024/05/Preset-Preview-2_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

You can still preview the grade in your viewfinder, too — so you're not just looking at a washed-out image. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 2000w"></figure><p>We bundled Kino with a <a href="https://www.shotwithkino.com/presets" rel="noreferrer">handful of beautiful grades</a>. Some were contributed by top-notch creatives: Stu Maschwitz (Prolost), Evan Schneider (the LUT Company), Sandwich Video, Tyler Stalman, and Kevin Ong —&nbsp;and some we developed in-house. They all have beautiful artwork, just like a particular type of photographic film has on its box. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Presets.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1083" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Presets.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Presets.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Presets.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Presets.png 2000w"></figure><p>There's an exclusive set for Apple Log, but there's also a set for regular set iPhone footage - so everyone gets nice presets. Kino only shows presets compatible with the video format you're recording or reviewing.</p><p>But the story doesn't end there. Kino allows you to load your own grades! We support the <a href="https://resolve.cafe/developers/luts/" rel="noreferrer">industry-standard</a> "LUT" .cube files, which means there are plenty of free and commercial LUTs available. Or just ask your colorist friend to AirDrop, email, or iMessage you the .cube file, and Kino will know how to open and import it.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png" width="1530" height="3036" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png 1530w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png" width="1530" height="3036" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png 1530w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><h2 id="automotion">AutoMotion</h2><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2024/05/AutoMotion-Example_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2024/05/AutoMotion-Example_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Another major aspect of film-look is motion blur. By default, an iPhone tries to capture crisp images, which may be more sharp and realistic, but it loses the dreamlike feeling of a motion picture.</p><p>With AutoMotion, Kino automatically chooses the best exposure settings for cinematic motion blur. It accomplishes this without any sort of AI or computational photography. As they say in Hollywood, it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_effect" rel="noreferrer">practical effect</a>.</p><p>Now, it's not always possible for Kino to pick cinematic settings, such as when shooting in bright daylight. When AutoMotion can work its magic, the "Auto" label will light up green. When it's gray, it won't. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1609" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That also means that if you are shooting in bright daylight, and pop an ND filter on your iPhone, there's no need to fiddle with settings or do guesswork: you can just see 'Auto' turn green and you'll know you are in the sweet spot.</p><p>Of course, Kino also gives you access to manual exposure control in shutter speed or angle, for the professionals in the crowd. </p><h3 id="its-all-in-the-interface">It's All In The Interface</h3><p>We already have a successful app for still photography, <a href="http://halide.cam/" rel="noreferrer">Halide</a>, and the top request over the years has always been video support. From day one, we knew Halide would never record video, because filmmaking and photography are different art forms that call for vastly different interactions.</p><p>With Kino, we rethought our camera app design from the ground up, and we couldn't be happier with the result.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 2000w"></figure><p>While it's hard to make something that works for relative newcomers to video and directors alike, I think we've found a good balance. Our more technical audience will appreciate the exposure settings, audio meters, and available disk space all visible at a glance. Our more casual users will appreciate that it's relatively minimal compared to most video apps. </p><p>Everyone will appreciate, however, that we avoid obscuring the most important information, <em>the shot itself</em>. That informed much of our design: getting out of the way and never obscuring the viewfinder unnecessarily. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 2000w"></figure><p>You'll notice Kino's interactive elements that might require adjustment during filming are near the record button. The interface is designed to work great in portrait and landscape —&nbsp;no judgment here —&nbsp;and gives you everything at a thumb's reach.</p><p>Design is as much about how something feels as how something looks, so we put careful consideration into Kino's interactions. For example, we would hate to be in the middle of recording, accidentally tap the viewfinder, and ruin the shot as the camera fiddles with settings.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/image.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The dreaded reticle</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's why we made the deliberate decision to <em>not</em> support tap-to-expose. Instead, to access exposure, just swipe down on the viewfinder to reveal our exposure dial.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 2200w"></figure><p>Speaking of accidental taps, when gripping the side of your phone to keep things stable, we found it too easy to accidentally tap buttons. That's why we disable the grade-picker and video review buttons mid-recording, and shrink the record button a little bit. Notice that big red ring around the periphery of the phone? It gives extra confirmation that you're recording. </p><p>Finally, Kino packs a "Swipe to Lock" gesture. If you drag the record button sideways into its corner instead of tapping on it, you can only stop recording by swiping it across. No more accidental cuts. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="800" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg 1500w"></figure><h2 id="advanced-options-galore">Advanced Options Galore</h2><p>We decided that, by default, Kino should be as natural as possible if you're coming from the first-party camera app. However, you can easily reconfigure it to grow with you as a filmmaker.</p><p>While it's great to make one app that fits all, video is complex, and workflows vary tremendously. When you first unbox Kino (yes, you have to unbox it) and leaf through the brochure, we'll ask your experience level. For most, Kino's Starter settings offer a great balance of power while keeping things simple. But if you're more familiar, the second option lets you set up a few things right from the start. That way, we don't get in the way: Kino can adjust to you from the start.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 2000w"></figure><p>For most that means that out of the box, Kino saves videos to your photo library, but you don't want to co-mingle your project files and personal memories, it can also save movies to the Files folder on your iPhone. It also helps you avoid blowing through your iCloud storage because Apple Log files are <em>huge</em>. So huge that we also support external hard drives; just plug it in, and Kino automatically uses it for recordings. Or toggle iCloud backups in our settings. </p><p>And you can get into the nitty gritty: Kino can be used for much more than Apple Log. Just tap our format picker in the upper right to toggle between configurations.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/preset-pick.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1052" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/preset-pick.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/preset-pick.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/preset-pick.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/preset-pick.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>With our HDR preset, you end up with realistic video similar to what you get out of Apple's stock camera app.</p><p>Our SDR preset records video compatible with the most devices and online services, recording in Standard Dynamic Range with h.264 compression. We bet you could even load them on an iPod!</p><p>Want to customize a preset, like change the resolution?

Focus peaking and a long-throw, curved focus dial for extra precision. Lockable and easily-toggleable auto white balance and exposure. A grid with a built-in level. </p><p>And one of our most beloved features from Halide: free lessons to get familiar with the app and filmmaking, to help you unlock all that we have to offer.</p><h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><p>For the last seven years (seriously, Halide turns seven tomorrow!), we've run a successful business building apps using one simple principle: make good products and charge money for them.</p><p>We have never and will never subsidize our apps through advertising, selling your data, or using it to train AI.</p><p>We're making Kino's pricing extra simple. We are launching Kino as a pay-once app: Kino will cost $19.99, in honor of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/books/review/hollywoods-greatest-year-brian-raftery.html" rel="noreferrer">the best year of movies</a>.

Over the years, we've released several spinoffs apps, such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/12/apple-celebrates-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2019/#:~:text=iPhone%20App%20of%20the%20Year,take%20stunning%20long%2Dexposure%20photos." rel="noreferrer">Spectre</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#:~:text=Orion%2C%20with%20its%20fun%20design,Best%20New%20App%20of%202023." rel="noreferrer">Orion</a>, but we've always viewed them as side projects, whereas Halide was our full-time job.

Make no mistake, it is not shipping with everything we have planned, but features like manual white balance are on the roadmap.</p><p>We decided to release it now to gather feedback from people using Kino in the real world, to help us prioritize what to build out next. You can let us know through support@lux.camera, or just ping us on social media. We're on… all of them. </p><p>Finally, don't forget to tag your videos, #ShotWithKino for a chance to be featured on our socials. We can't wait to see what you make with this!</p><p>We want to thank our families for supporting us in building this over many long nights, our testers and colorists, and of course our fantastic users who let us do what we love for a living. Thanks so much —&nbsp;we hope you love Kino! </p>

<p>In November, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/wikipedia-2023-11-embed-multilingual-v3">Cohere released a dataset containing all of Wikipedia</a>, chunked and embedded to vectors with <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3">their multilingual-v3 model</a>. </p>



<p>Computing this many embeddings yourself would cost in the neighborhood of $5000, so the public release of this dataset makes creating <a href="https://www.datastax.com/guides/what-is-vector-search">a semantic, vector-based index</a> of Wikipedia practical for an individual for the first time.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’re building:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ydeHYk97v6Bza1GF0wbbHUEzxgCAJLfwbRcVnWvUP6QDPKKY5YQH00Dvi2n6VgkioW_PGqwckcCnQu9cJ2nOz2XSuL_27HNPAAbZdv2vXPOy_vUJ_Vcg-ii83E4jaqMycskzmzt8wBP1XsOYh5b7Cv4" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can try searching the completed index <a href="https://jvectordemo.com:8443/">on a public demo instance here</a>.</p>



<h2>Why this is hard</h2>



<p>Sure, the dataset is big (180GB for the English corpus), but that’s not the obstacle per se.&nbsp; We’ve been able to build full-text indexes on larger datasets for a long time.</p>



<p>The obstacle is that until now, off-the-shelf vector databases could not index a dataset larger than memory, because both the full-resolution vectors and the index (edge list) needed to be kept in memory during index construction.&nbsp; Larger datasets could be split into <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2703432/what-are-segments-in-lucene">segments</a>, but this means that at query time they need to search each segment separately, then combine the results, turning an O(log N) search per segment into O(N) overall.&nbsp; (In their latest release, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-lucene-vector-database-gains">Lucene attempts to mitigate this by processing segments in parallel with multiple threads</a>, but obviously (1) this only gives you a constant factor of improvement before you run out of CPU cores and (2) this does not improve throughput.)</p>



<p>Specifically, if you’re indexing 1536-dimension vectors (the size of ada002 or openai-v3-small), then you can fit about 5M vectors and their associated edge lists in a 32GB index construction RAM budget.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-BwVEUQqMIDekxlKXgiuOiQcycoM_fP3ncRjVNgRD7W7SzcsTigI4tjsmE-S4x35PIgEpwNxVioZxD50ah2PzQXuVCo22TXiI80EFpjpnCf4X-JjTPBb6FqVC4CJFdrYkoG6aLYxFNotM_MX_NoIpDk" alt=""></figure>



<p><a href="https://github.com/jbellis/jvector/">JVector</a>, the library that powers <a href="https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra">DataStax Astra</a> vector search, now supports indexing larger-than-memory datasets by performing construction-related searches with compressed vectors.&nbsp; This means that the edge lists need to fit in memory, but the uncompressed vectors do not, which gives us enough headroom to index Wikipedia-en on a laptop.</p>



<h2>Requirements</h2>



<ol>
<li>Linux or MacOS.&nbsp; It will not work on Windows because ChronicleMap, which we are going to use for the non-vector data, is limited to a 4GB size there.&nbsp; (If you are interested enough, you could shard the Map by vector id to keep each shard under 4GB and still have O(1) lookup times.)</li>



<li>About 180GB of free space for the dataset, and 90GB for the completed index.</li>



<li>Enough RAM to run a JVM with 36GB of heap space during construction (~28GB for the index, 8GB for GC headroom).</li>



<li>Disable swap before building the index.&nbsp; Linux will aggressively try to cache the index being constructed to the point of swapping out parts of the JVM heap, which is obviously counterproductive.&nbsp; In my test, building with swap enabled was almost twice as slow as with it off.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Building and searching the index</h2>



<ol>
<li>Check out the project:<br>$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector">https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector<br></a>$ cd coherepedia-jvector</li>



<li>Edit <em>config.properties</em> to set the locations for the dataset and the index.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Run <em>pip install datasets</em>.&nbsp; (Setting up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a> or conda environment first is recommended but not strictly necessary.)</li>



<li>Run <em>python download.py.&nbsp; </em>This downloads the 180 GB dataset to the location you configured.&nbsp; For me that took about half an hour.</li>



<li>Run <em>./mvnw compile exec:exec@buildindex.</em>&nbsp; This took about 5 and a half hours on my machine (with an i9-12900 CPU).</li>



<li>Run <em>./mvnw compile exec:exec@serve </em>and open a browser to <a href="http://localhost:4567/">http://localhost:4567</a>.&nbsp; Search away!</li>
</ol>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<p>We’re using <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/jvector">JVector</a> for the vector index and <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map">Chronicle Map</a> for the article data.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/issues/533">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/issues/537">things</a> I don’t love about Chronicle Map, but nothing else touches it for simple disk-based key/value performance.</p>



<p>The full source of the index construction class is <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/BuildIndex.java">here</a>.&nbsp; I’ll explain it next in pieces.</p>



<h2>Compression parameters</h2>



<p>JVector is based on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/diskann-fast-accurate-billion-point-nearest-neighbor-search-on-a-single-node/">DiskANN</a> vector index design, which performs an initial search using vectors compressed lossily with <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/similarity-search-product-quantization-b2a1a6397701">product quantization (PQ)</a> in memory, then reranks the results using high-resolution vectors from disk.&nbsp; However, while DiskANN stores full, uncompressed vectors to perform reranking, JVector is able to improve on that using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02044">Locally-Adaptive Quantization (LVQ)</a> compression.</p>



<p>To set this up, we’ll first load some vectors into a RandomAccessVectorValues (RAVV) instance.&nbsp; RAVV is a JVector interface for a vector container; it could be List or Map based, in-memory or on-disk.&nbsp; In this case we’ll use a simple List-backed RAVV.&nbsp; We’ll compute the parameters for both compressions (kmeans clustering for PQ, global mean for LVQ) from a single shard of the dataset.&nbsp; At about 110k rows, this is enough data to have a statistically valid sample.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/aN200b1SULDTwrg5inwDuNFKLCVyYstVuYOSXLqAos2D_psAoMp8V5CXjXDKCEKcCZc5JyM7U27qg7LPp14mfQh9nktRzXaXE4pteHFINO-HPS_xxW4ESxf1glxanb5gG2xoAmx1r2qaiReZXcFI--4" alt=""></figure>



<p>Next, we compute the PQ compression codebook; we’re compressing the vectors by a factor of 64, because the Cohere v3 embeddings can be PQ-compressed that much without losing accuracy, after reranking.&nbsp; <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-vector-size-matters/">Binary Quantization only gives us 32x compression and is less accurate</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PS0HlbtZNajjlTe9AFg1yoW7fvGyKeSpHGwfk3_k5dHs08QOkTphXeO03AO2Chx-mxw5lV2wD81xo3lNGB9raJojFYrg6z2-OTIA05fUfVHzpGIM12R-veeTPLirOhjGTvcM-Uch31c5SZmgGDbiIrM" alt=""></figure>



<p>Finally, we need to set up LVQ.&nbsp; LVQ gives us 4x compression while losing no measurable accuracy over the full uncompressed vectors, resulting in both a smaller footprint on disk and faster searches.&nbsp; (I thank the vector search team at Intel Research for pointing this out to us.)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XheHrYXEE6j_GaROcmgI_0-OFJx9GJes1uVcEGDcYFUvi0Gu3ZqXgpqV38iMbxL25JvCmIcFRsxG8EoqZ2aT332JWYAwSeRHnKPzY-un5LO2eun1Eio0ZTya312IXv_AV1xJ88HUT6Fxb96uNtFokGU" alt=""></figure>



<h2>GraphIndexBuilder</h2>



<p>Next, we need to instantiate and configure our GraphIndexBuilder.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/veV6oVgpkDyr-WLPIMzzTtHD0q8MIT3sQxOauqdXwzXExFBQ2FD9btPpVXf-DTuk0OEJAVWpHf6IduBDIiyGSyDwdsEICTyoTjUocG7PgkxIRiMIpIRPpGjiSFoKm9Z-B0vOU4uYRtPsew1Oi3f_bis" alt=""></figure>



<p>This instantiates a JVector GraphIndexBuilder and connects it to an OnDiskGraphIndexWriter, and tells it to use the PQ-compressed vectors list (which starts empty and will grow as we add vectors to the index) during construction (in the BuildScoreProvider).</p>



<h2>Chronicle Map and RowData</h2>



<p>We’ll store article contents in RowData records.&nbsp; This content is what has been encoded as the corresponding vector in the dataset, and is what we want to return to the user in our search results.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/veVvO8QUrY_k_YGDwavo_dBaIoM5ZGGfaN5dowCroJAgJv-37JZIWq0jX78rY0R8g6wvRO1QxvTv-dMuEVMJRvmrvdbmLAHlBJqUd9yoyIXD0DADDlZQXyZcyLPcp-F4zAcRb1obXtvJO6d4oXTGD7M" alt=""></figure>



<p>To turn the vector index’s search results (a list of integer vector ids) into RowData, we store the RowData in a Map keyed by the vector id.&nbsp; This will be a lot of data, so we use <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map">ChronicleMap</a> to store this on disk with a minimal in-memory footprint.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hFMjxcQstglWY0IjbgKqiHB9dk7KlKATQnBIBLZh_hGvdsuo6_UDQi8ydn3RA0ELYpJlng0HERqxUG1nmpj5HRNFPRhIHhhOtnC6vc7XHsIZnwI-fcyRK8gNnPeKpLUUQNVjGnK9EP1RHU6UPs0SLsw" alt=""></figure>



<p>We need to tell ChronicleMap how large it’s going to be, both in entry count and entry size.&nbsp; Undersizing these will cause it to crash (<a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/issues/533">my primary complaint</a> about ChronicleMap), so we deliberately use a high estimate.</p>



<p>We <em>do not</em> need to explicitly tell ChronicleMap how to read and write RowData objects, instead we just have RowData implement Serializable.&nbsp; While ChronicleMap supports custom de/serialize code, it’s perfectly happy to use simple out-of-the-box serialization and since profiling shows that’s not a bottleneck for us we’ll just leave it at that.</p>



<h2>Ingesting the data</h2>



<p>We use Java’s parallel Streams to process the shards in parallel.&nbsp; For each row in each shard, we</p>



<ol>
<li>Add it to <em>pqVectorsList</em></li>



<li>Call <em>writer.writeInline</em> to add the LVQ-compressed vector to disk</li>



<li>Call <em>builder.addGraphNode </em>– order is important because both (1) and (2) are used when we call addGraphNode</li>



<li>Call <em>contentMap.put</em> with the article chunk data.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/BuildIndex.java">the full source</a> if you’re curious about <em>forEachRow</em>, it’s just standard “pull data out of Arrow” stuff.</p>



<p>When the build completes, you should see files like this:</p>



<p>$ ls -lh ~/coherepedia</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan&nbsp; 48G May 20 15:53 coherepedia.ann</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan&nbsp; 36G May 20 18:05 coherepedia.map</p>

<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan 4.1K May 17 23:04 coherepedia.lvq</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan 1.1M May 17 23:04 coherepedia.pq</p>



<p>These are respectively</p>



<ul>
<li>ANN: the vector index, containing the edge lists and LVQ-compressed vectors for reranking.</li>



<li>MAP: the map containing article data indexed by vector id.</li>



<li>PQV: PQ-compressed vectors, which are read into memory and used for the approximate search pass.</li>



<li>LVQ: the LVQ global mean, used during construction.</li>



<li>PQ: the PQ codebooks, used during construction.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Loading the index (after construction)</h2>



<p>The code for serving queries is found in the <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/WebSearch.java">WebSearch</a> class.&nbsp; We’re using Spark (<a href="https://sparkjava.com/">the web framework</a>, not the big data engine) to serve a simple search form:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/a-y2F-t0K9ph-4-0ERwSLy7-xhLDMQZD1qz7FU8tDPvj6w1MUhkhznWEksElvPh_1twzn68B8nD6q6wheKlAqxUyyghNhPmxDEs69fYiKTKEtILwwuFhSPNmsDVhS395kDu3hlggzUQIKtG0S_PJxRw" alt=""></figure>



<p>Construction needed a relatively large heap to keep the edge lists in memory.&nbsp; With that complete, we only need enough to keep the PQ-compressed vectors in memory; <em>exec@serve </em>is configured to use a 4GB heap.</p>



<p>WebSearch (<a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/WebSearch.java">the class behind <em>exec@serve</em></a>) first has a static initializer to load the PQ vectors and open the ChronicleMap.&nbsp; We also create a reusable GraphSearcher instance:</p>

<h2>Performing a search</h2>



<p>Executing a search and turning it into RowData for the user looks like this:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-bY_lTq_EAXUwfuP_MEsLYcuwwdx13wKCCYAAL83KaxSQ1x8VBbAjlbqGWCxL998vVAlBfEmOxTXZIRkJp8-uTLb0FLXrvCdGICWggC13UKXPCjBq42D5guoHk5IvShjzgpf1IvD2JYcQiIJnyDKedo" alt=""></figure>



<p>There are four “paragraphs” of code here, containing</p>



<ol>
<li>The call to <em>getVectorEmbedding</em>.&nbsp; This calls Cohere’s API to turn the search query (a String) into a vector embedding.</li>



<li>Creating approximate and reranking score functions.&nbsp; Approximate scoring is done through our product quantization, and reranking is done with the LVQ vectors in the index.&nbsp; Since the LVQ vectors are encapsulated in the index itself, we never need to explicitly deal with LVQ decoding; the index does it for us.</li>



<li>The call to <em>searcher.search </em>that actually does the query, and finally</li>



<li>Retrieving the RowData associated with the top vector neighbors using <em>contentMap</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>That’s it!&nbsp; We’ve indexed all of Wikipedia with high performance, parallel code in about 150 loc, and created a simple search server in another 100.</p>



<p>On my machine, searches (which each run in a single thread) take about 50ms.&nbsp; We would expect it to take over twice as long if this were split across multiple segments.&nbsp; We would also expect it to lose significant accuracy if searches were performed only with compressed vectors without reranking.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Indexing the entirety of English Wikipedia on a laptop has become a practical reality thanks to recent advances in the JVector library that will be part of the imminent 3.0 release.&nbsp; (<a href="https://github.com/jbellis/jvector">Star the repo</a> and stand by!)&nbsp; This article demonstrates how to do exactly that using JVector in conjunction with Chronicle Map, while also showcasing the use of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02044">LVQ</a> to reduce index size while preserving <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-vector-size-matters/">accurate reranking</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-data-breach-shinyhunters-hack">https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-data-breach-shinyhunters-hack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40513875">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-autopogo="">
<p>To its critics, it seems Ticketmaster may be experiencing some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-statement" target="_self"><u>karma</u></a> lately for years of being the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/swifties-take-down-ticketmaster-eras-tour" target="_self"><u>bane of concertgoers' existence</u></a>. Unfortunately its latest hassle — a massive data leak — also negatively impacts consumers.</p><p>Just last week, the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-lawsuit-live-nation" target="_self"><u>filed an antitrust lawsuit</u></a> against the ticketing conglomerate. The DOJ is seeking to break up the alleged monopoly its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, holds over the live music and entertainment industry – potentially a good thing for consumers.</p><p>But Amid this nightmare for the company, a hacker group is now claiming to have stolen more than 500 million Ticketmaster customers' data in an attack.</p>
<p>Originally reported by cybersecurity outlets like <a href="https://www.hackread.com/hackers-ticketmaster-data-breach-560m-users-sale/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Hackread</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10632-hackers-claim-ticketmaster-live-nation-data-breach-more-than-500m-compromised" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Cyber Daily</u></a>, The "notorious hacker group" ShinyHunters is claiming responsibility for the breach affecting roughly 560 million Ticketmaster customers. The hacker group is selling the 1.3 terabyte-sized trove of data for a one-time price of $500,000 on a popular hacking forum.</p><h2><strong>What Ticketmaster data was stolen?</strong></h2><p>According to ShinyHunters, this is an immense trove of sensitive user data.&nbsp;</p><p>The group allegedly has Ticketmaster customers' full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and order history information including ticket purchase details and Ticketmaster event information.&nbsp;</p><section x-data="window.newsletter()" x-init="init()" data-ga-impression="" data-ga-category="newsletters" data-ga-module="incontent_nl_signup" data-ga-label="mashablelightspeed">

</p>


</section>
<p>In addition, hackers also allegedly have customers' partial payment data which includes names, the last four digits of their credit card numbers, and card expiration dates.</p><p>Again, this sensitive data is connected to roughly half a billion users.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to Ticketmaster and will update this piece when we hear back.</p><h2><strong>How did this happen?</strong></h2><p>As of the publishing of this article, it's unclear exactly how ShinyHunters carried out its attack. Ticketmaster has yet to comment on the situation or corroborate the hackers' claims.</p><p>However, Australia's Home Affairs Department has <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-29/ticketmaster-hack-allegedlyshinyhunter-customers-data-leaked/103908614" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>confirmed</u></a> a "cyber incident impacting Ticketmaster customers." Due to the time frame in which the hackers shared their breach, it appears Australian outlets were the first to cover the news.</p><p>Ticketmaster has struggled with bad actors online using bots and other methods to disrupt the ticketing service and scoop up tickets to resell. The company also has a history of being the bad actor itself when it comes to electronic data. In 2020, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206955/ticketmaster-songkick-crowdsurge-hacking-deferred-prosecution-fine" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>$10 million</u></a> to rival ticketing company SongKick after individuals on Ticketmaster's payroll obtained login credentials and gained unauthorized access to its competitors' computers.</p><p>As for ShinyHunters, Mashable has had a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mashable-data-security-issue" target="_self"><u>prior run-in</u></a> with the hacker group as the company was once a victim of its <a href="https://www.hackread.com/shinyhunters-hacker-leaks-mashable-database/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>attacks</u></a> in 2020. ShinyHunters was able to breach a database connected to a since-disabled Mashable feature that allowed readers to login to the site with their social media accounts from services like Facebook. The stolen data included information like email addresses but did not include more sensitive data like passwords or financial details.</p><p>According to ShinyHunters, the group attempted to contact Ticketmaster about the breach but have yet to receive a response.</p>

                        <p><strong>  05/29/2024</strong></p><div>
                                                                                                                        <section>
                                                    <p>Afnic, the association in charge of the .fr top-level domain and several other French overseas and generic TLDs, announced today the release as free software of its tool named IBDNS, standing for Intentionally Broken DNS.</p>

   
                                                </section>
                                                                                                                                                                                <section>
                                                    <p>On the Internet, applications using the DNS (Domain Name System) generally follow the protocol’s technical specifications. But when developing a testing tool or a resolver, it can be useful to verify its behaviour compared when faced with DNS servers that do not comply with these specifications. After all, a good DNS client must be able to handle poorly formed messages or incorrect behaviour of name servers without malfunctioning.</p>
<p>This is where IBDNS comes into play. IBDNS fills a gap in the universe of DNS test tools by offering the possibility of deviating intentionally and on demand from the DNS specifications, and thus simulating incorrect behaviour of authoritative name servers.</p>
<p>Afnic had initially developed IBDNS to cater to the needs of <a href="https://zonemaster.fr/en/run-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zonemaster</a>, its DNS zone health assessment tool designed in collaboration with their Swedish counterpart <a href="https://internetstiftelsen.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internetstiftelsen</a>. This begs the question: how to ensure that Zonemaster gives the right diagnosis in all circumstances. The test suite accompanying Zonemaster to this end relied on zones that were intentionally misconfigured, but hosted on standard servers. The method worked well for 90% of the anomalies detected, but the remaining 10% needed a more specific tool. By allowing the anomalies observed on the Internet to be faithfully replicated, which a standard DNS server cannot do, IBDNS further improves the reliability and accuracy of Zonemaster’s diagnostics.</p>
<p>In its initial use case as a testing tool for testing tools, IBDNS aims to comfort Zonemaster in its position as the benchmark DNS testing tool. Its release as free software reflects the determination to shift gears and have Zonemaster’s unit tests reach a coverage as close as possible to 100%.</p>
<p>Afnic invites anyone who’s interested – be they developers of DNS resolvers, DNS testing tools and more generally tools that interact with authoritative name servers, security auditors for this same category of software applications, researchers interested in the DNS and its implementation, or just people curious about the workings of the DNS – to discover the <a href="https://gitlab.rd.nic.fr/dns-testing-tools/ibdns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBDNS source code on Afnic Labs’ Gitlab server</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content-gate" data-sophi-feature="article body"><p><i>Kate Robertson is a senior research associate and Ron Deibert is director at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.</i></p><p>A federal cybersecurity bill, slated to advance through Parliament soon, contains secretive, encryption-breaking powers that the government has been loath to talk about. And they threaten the online security of everyone in Canada.</p><p>Bill C-26 empowers government officials to secretly order telecommunications companies to install backdoors inside encrypted elements in Canada’s networks. This could include requiring telcos to alter the<a href="https://www.3gpp.org/3gpp-groups/service-system-aspects-sa/sa-wg3"> 5G encryption standards</a> that protect mobile communications to facilitate government surveillance.</p><p>The government’s decision to push the proposed law forward without amending it to remove this encryption-breaking capability has set off alarm bells that these new powers are a feature, not a bug.</p><p>There are already many insecurities in today’s networks, reaching down to the infrastructure layers of communication technology. The Signalling System No. 7, developed in 1975 to route phone calls, has<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/"> become a major source of insecurity</a> for cellphones. In 2017, the CBC demonstrated how<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/hackers-cellphone-security-1.4406338"> hackers only needed a Canadian MP’s cell number</a> to intercept his movements, text messages and phone calls. Little has changed since: A<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/finding-you-teleco-vulnerabilities-for-location-disclosure/"> 2023 Citizen Lab report</a> details pervasive vulnerabilities at the heart of the world’s mobile networks.</p><p>So it makes no sense that the Canadian government would itself seek the ability to create more holes, rather than patching them. Yet it is pushing for potential new powers that would infect next-generation cybersecurity tools with old diseases.</p><p>It’s not as if the government wasn’t warned. Citizen Lab researchers<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12829919/br-external/CitizenLab-Combine-e.pdf"> presented the 2023 report’s findings</a> in parliamentary hearings on Bill C-26, and <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12566103/br-external/Jointly1-e.pdf">leaders and experts in civil society</a> and in Canada’s<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/documentviewer/en/44-1/SECU/meeting-94/evidence#Int-12577753"> telecommunications industry</a> warned that the bill must be narrowed to prevent its broad powers to compel<a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-26/second-reading#:~:text=telecommunications%20service%20provider.-,Order,-(2)"> technical changes</a> from being used to compromise the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12566103/br-external/Jointly1-e.pdf">”confidentiality, integrity, or availability”</a> of telecommunication services. And yet, while government MPs maintained that their intent is not to expand surveillance capabilities, MPs pushed the bill out of committee without this critical amendment last month. In doing so, the government has set itself up to be the sole arbiter of when, and on what conditions, Canadians deserve security for their most confidential communications – personal, business, religious, or otherwise.</p><p>The new powers would only make people in Canada more vulnerable to malicious threats to the privacy and security of all network users, including<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/imsi-cellphones-spying-ottawa-1.4050049"> Canada’s most senior officials</a>. Encryption of 5G technology safeguards a web of connection points surrounding mobile communications, and protects users from man-in-the-middle attacks that intercept their text and voice communications or location data. The law would also impact <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-security-considerations-5g-networks-itsap80116?ref=busrides.ghost.io">cloud-connected smart devices like cars, home CCTV, or pacemakers</a>, and<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/satellite-communications-itsap80029"> satellite-based services like Starlink</a> – all of which could be compromised by any new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Unfortunately, history is rife with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security"> government backdoors</a> exposing individuals to deep levels of cyber-insecurity. Backdoors can be exploited by law enforcement, criminals and foreign rivals alike. For this reason, past heads of<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-hayden-encryption-apple-2016-2"> the CIA, the NSA</a> and<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/former-national-security-officials-see-the-peril-of-weakening-encryption/399848/"> the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, as well as Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/07/10/former_gchq_wades_into_encryption_debate/"> (GCHQ</a>) and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/11/ex-mi5-chief-warns-against-crackdown-encrypted-messaging-apps"> MI5</a>, all oppose measures that would weaken encryption. Interception equipment relied upon by governments<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/"> has also often been shown</a> to have<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/05/root-backdoor-found-in-surveillance-gear-used-by-law-enforcement/"> significant security weaknesses</a>.</p><p>The bill’s new spy powers also reveal incoherence in the government’s cybersecurity strategy. In 2022, Canada announced it would be blocking telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, citing the “<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2022/05/policy-statement--securing-canadas-telecommunications-system.html">cascading economic and security impacts</a>” that a supply-chain breach would engender. The government cited concerns that the Chinese firms might be “<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2022/05/policy-statement--securing-canadas-telecommunications-system.html">compelled to comply with extrajudicial directions from foreign governments</a>.” And yet, Bill C-26 would quietly provide Canada with the same authority that it publicly condemned. If the bill passes as-is, all telecom providers in Canada would be compellable through secret orders to weaken encryption or network equipment. It doesn’t just contradict Canada’s own<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/08/canadas-new-and-irresponsible-encryption-policy-how-the-government-of-canadas-new-policy-threatens-charter-rights-cybersecurity-economic-growth-and-foreign-policy/"> pro-encryption policy</a> and<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/satellite-communications-itsap80029#:~:text=Ensure%20SATCOM%20equipment"> expert guidance</a> – authoritarian governments abroad would also be able to point to Canada’s law to justify their own repressive security legislation.</p><p>Now, more than ever, there is no such thing as a safe backdoor. The GCHQ<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/commercial-cyber-proliferation-assessment"> reports</a> that the threat from commercial hacking firms will be “transformational on the cyber landscape,” and that cyber mercenaries wield capabilities rivalling that of state cyber-agencies. If the Canadian government compels telcos to undermine security features to accommodate surveillance, it will pave the way for<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/"> cyberespionage firms</a> and other adversaries to find<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/"> more ways</a> into<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/03/bad-traffic-sandvines-packetlogic-devices-deploy-government-spyware-turkey-syria/"> people’s communications</a>. A shortcut that provides a narrow advantage for the few at the expense of us all is no way to secure our complex digital ecosystem.</p><p>Against this threat landscape, a pivot is crucial. Canada needs cybersecurity laws that explicitly recognize that uncompromised encryption is the backbone of cybersecurity, and it must be mandated and protected by all means possible.</p></article></div>]]></description>

I wasn’t ready to sell, but I wanted to understand the path to an exit.</p><p>FE initially seemed interested. Then, after a few email exchanges and seeing my financials, they gave me a soft brushoff:</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the current set up of two main SKUs generating roughly 98% of your revenue, this would not be a good fit for most buyers. Buyers typically want to see that a business has a minimum of 10 SKUs, and that none of these SKUs generate more than 30% of revenue.</p><p>At this time we would advise, in preparation for a sale to start to consider increasing your product offering. These don’t always have to be completely new products, and this could also be USB-C cables, wall plugs, ethernet cables, servers, display ports, HDMI cables etc, this would also help to increase your AOV.</p></blockquote><p>After FE’s rejection, I felt trapped and panicked.</p><p>I had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into software and hardware engineering to make just one product, and I was barely scraping by. According to FE, I had no chance of selling unless I did <em>ten times</em> as much as I was currently doing?</p><h3 id="if-you-cant-get-out-get-comfortable">If you can’t get out, get comfortable<a href="#if-you-cant-get-out-get-comfortable" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I didn’t want to shut down the company and lay everyone off, but I also didn’t want to carry the stress of running TinyPilot for the rest of my life. So, I looked for ways to make the business less stressful.</p><p>One of the most difficult parts of TinyPilot was hardware revisions. We were always redesigning TinyPilot’s hardware to make improvements, but that meant constantly finding new suppliers and rethinking our manufacturing pipeline. In 2023, I decided to keep the design we had and stop fiddling with the hardware.</p><p>The other source of complexity was TinyPilot’s office. We were still doing everything in-house: managing inventory, assembling devices, and fulfilling orders. I worked with TinyPilot’s in-person team to migrate the office’s core functions to external vendors. It was a major challenge to outsource so many delicate processes, but it eliminated an enormous amount of management overhead and stress.</p><p>The happy side-effect of making TinyPilot easier to manage was that it also made the company more attractive to potential buyers. When I stopped pouring $100k/year into hardware improvements, the company became <a href="https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-6/#tinypilot-became-20x-more-profitable">substantially more profitable</a>. And without an office and custom in-house manufacturing, a prospective owner could run TinyPilot from anywhere in the world.</p><h2 id="part-2-starting-the-sales-process">Part 2: Starting the sales process<a href="#part-2-starting-the-sales-process" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="the-strategic-acquirer">The strategic acquirer<a href="#the-strategic-acquirer" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>With the company in stronger shape, I decided to restart my search for a buyer.

Most ignored me or gave polite brushoffs, but one company showed immediate interest. I’ll call them ServerCo.</p><p>ServerCo was an attractive buyer. They were bootstrapped as well, they seemed culturally aligned with TinyPilot, and we sold complementary products to similar customers. Having never participated in an acquisition before, they were cautious but enthusiastic about buying TinyPilot.</p><p>ServerCo would email me a list of detailed questions about TinyPilot’s finances and risks, I’d answer in a day or two, and then there’d be weeks of silence. Finally, they’d respond with a new round of questions, and we’d start the cycle again.</p><p>After four months of intermittent discussions, ServerCo finally presented me with an offer:</p><ul><li>$150k cash</li><li>$100k employment contract for 12 months of full-time work</li><li>25% of TinyPilot’s profit the first year after closing</li><li>10% of TinyPilot’s profit the second year after closing</li></ul><p>They didn’t intend it to be an insultingly bad offer, but it was a pretty bad offer.</p><p>eCommerce companies typically sell for 2.5-3.5x earnings. The cash portiton of ServerCo’s offer was 0.9x TinyPilot’s earnings.</p><p>As for the salary, $100k/year is roughly what a software developer makes fresh out of college in the US. And that’s without a 12-month commitment.</p><p>I politely told ServerCo we were too far apart on price to continue negotiating, but we both agreed to keep the door open in case things changed.</p><h3 id="attending-microconf-and-meeting-quiet-light-brokerage">Attending Microconf and meeting Quiet Light Brokerage<a href="#attending-microconf-and-meeting-quiet-light-brokerage" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>In 2023, I attended <a href="https://microconf.com/">Microconf</a>, a small conference for bootstrapped founders. I hoped that to either find a potential buyer there or at least get advice from other founders about what to do with TinyPilot.</p><p>One of the sponsors of the conference was a brokerage I’d never heard of, <a href="https://quietlight.com/">Quiet Light</a>. They piqued my interest because not only did they cater to bootstrapped founders, they worked with a lot of eCommerce companies.</p><p>At the event, I spoke with Chris Guthrie, an advisor at Quiet Light. He seemed optimistic about selling TinyPilot, so after the conference, he began working with me on a sales package. It was a set of documents and financial reports to show prospective TinyPilot buyers. It included a profit and loss statement for the past two years, a detailed questionnaire about the company, and a brief video interview with me.</p><p>Chris recommened presenting TinyPilot mainly as an eCommerce business with an asking price of around 3x the last twelve months of earnings.

Chris received a handful of inquiries, but they were from buyers who either wanted me to stay on as a co-founder or wanted me to finance the majority of the purchase.</p><h3 id="serious-buyers-finally-appear">Serious buyers finally appear<a href="#serious-buyers-finally-appear" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Finally, in January, two attractive buyers appeared around the same time.</p><p>The first buyer was Scott, who worked a corporate job in media production but had grown disilussioned with big company culture, much like I had. He’d read my <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/">public retrospectives about building TinyPilot</a> and saw potential to bring the product to a broader customer base.</p><p>The other offer was from a pair of founders. They were initially TinyPilot customers and had reached out to me about building a managed services company on top of the product. When I told them I was selling the company, they were interested in buying.</p><h3 id="soliciting-lois">Soliciting LOIs<a href="#soliciting-lois" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The sales process officially starts with the letter of intent (LOI). The LOI lays out the high-level details of the sale, the most important being the purchase price.</p><p>Crucially, the LOI isn’t binding. The document that really matters is the asset purchase agreement (APA), which you sign when the deal closes. But the LOI officially kicks off due diligence and the drafting of the APA.</p><p>When we started LOI discussions, I was in an excellent negotiation position. I had two serious buyers competing against each other. Since listing on Quiet Light, TinyPilot’s annual earnings had increased by $10k, and we received pre-qualification for an SBA loan, which meant buyers who didn’t have $599k in cash could now get a government-backed loan to buy the business.</p><p>Chris told the two prospective buyers that we were planning to re-launch on Quiet Light at $625k but that I’d honor the original price if they made an offer within the next two weeks.</p><h3 id="price-negotiations">Price negotiations<a href="#price-negotiations" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Scott made the first formal offer, but it was for $500k, a steep $99k drop from my asking price. At that point, I had several attractive alternatives, so I declined.</p><p>We awaited an offer from the founder duo, who had sounded eager to move forward. Two days later, they backed out without making an offer at all.</p><p>Uh oh. Did I blow the deal? What if $500k was the best I was going to get, and I just rejected it? I still had the option of re-launching on Quiet Light, but seeing both buyers reject the asking price shook my confidence.</p><p>Fortunately, the next day, Scott sent a new LOI for my $599k asking price, and I accepted.</p><p>It was great to bump the price by $99k, but that was the last point in the process that felt like I was negotiating from a position of strength.</p><h2 id="part-3-closing">Part 3: Closing<a href="#part-3-closing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="due-diligence-makes-me-weaker-by-the-day">Due diligence makes me weaker by the day<a href="#due-diligence-makes-me-weaker-by-the-day" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>One of the biggest surprises in this process was how much closing time matters.</p><p>Chris from Quiet Light had recommended selling, if at all possible, to a buyer with cash on hand rather than someone who needs a loan. When the buyer finances the purchase with a bank loan, due diligence takes longer, and there are more decision-makers who can kill the deal.</p><p>At the time, I thought, “Faster would be better, but I’m a patient person. What’s an extra two months?”</p><p>I quickly learned that a slower closing isn’t about a few months of patience — it’s about how much additional risk and work the seller absorbs with each passing week of due diligence.</p><p>When you sell a house, the buyer has to put down a deposit of 1-5% to hold their claim on the house. If financing falls through or the buyer changes their mind, the seller keeps the money as compensation for the time they lost.</p><p>When you sell a business at TinyPilot’s scale, there’s no deposit. You can invest hundreds of hours into preparing reports for due diligence, reveal all your confidential business secrets, and spend thousands of dollars negotiating legal documents and still walk away with nothing if the buyer backs out.</p><p>As due diligence stretched on, my negotiating position became markedly weaker. Before signing the LOI, I could easily move on to the next buyer. By month two of due diligence, walking away from the deal meant restarting this costly and time-consuming process from zero. I’d also risk TinyPilot’s sales slipping after so many months being distracted from the business.</p><p><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/due-diligence.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 1600px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/due-diligence_hu1dfd9cb7b73d57c6fe3bcd530cd22ae5_257278_300x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos_2.webp 300w,

I didn’t know what to do with myself.</p><p>The only thing I could find motivation for was ruminating about all the things that might go wrong. What if the buyer got cold feet? What if Google announced an identical product and gave it away for free?

                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic didn’t just reshape how children learn and see the world. It transformed the shape of their eyeballs.</p><p>As real-life classrooms and playgrounds gave way to virtual meetings and digital devices, the time that children spent focusing on screens and other nearby objects surged — and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00027-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00027-4" data-track-category="body text link">time they spent outdoors dropped precipitously</a>. This shift led to a notable change in children’s anatomy: their eyeballs lengthened to better accommodate short-vision tasks.</p><p>Study after study, in regions ranging from Europe to Asia, documented this change. One analysis from Hong Kong even reported a near doubling in the incidence of pathologically stretched eyeballs among six-year-olds compared with pre-pandemic levels<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>This elongation improves the clarity of close-up images on the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. But it also makes far-away objects appear blurry, leading to a condition known as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-020-00231-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-020-00231-4" data-track-category="body text link">myopia</a>, or short-sightedness. And although corrective eyewear can usually address the issue — allowing children to, for example, see a blackboard or read from a distance — severe myopia can lead to more-serious complications, such as retinal detachment, macular degeneration, glaucoma and even permanent blindness.</p><p>Rates of myopia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/519276a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/519276a" data-track-category="body text link">were booming well before the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Widely cited projections in the mid-2010s suggested that myopia would affect half of the world’s population by mid-century (see ‘Rising prevalence’), which would effectively double the incidence rate in less than four decades<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> (see ‘Affecting every age’). Now, those alarming predictions seem much too modest, says Neelam Pawar, a paediatric ophthalmologist at the Aravind Eye Hospital in Tirunelveli, India. “I don’t think it will double,” she says. “It will triple.”</p><figure>

</figure><p>So instead, researchers are working on ways to bring the outside in — glass classrooms, special lighting rigs, nature-themed wallpapers and light-emitting spectacles — interventions that do not demand overhauls in child behaviour, educational systems or parenting techniques. They are also exploring other light-based and pharmaceutical interventions.</p><p>Some of these approaches are showing promise. But there’s a stumbling block when it comes to testing them: researchers don’t fully comprehend what it is about outdoor exposure that helps to prevent myopia. Clinical trials are still preliminary and many animal studies remain inconclusive.</p><p>A firmer understanding would help scientists to develop better treatments, says Christine Wildsoet, an optometrist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Because once we know the key features,” she says, “then we can bring some of them indoors.”</p><h2><b>Stop signals</b></h2><p>As the eye develops, it constantly fine-tunes its shape in response to certain visual cues. If those cues indicate that the eye is too short, it stretches to bring objects into focus. Conversely, if the eye becomes too long, it will receive ‘stop’ signals, which are crucial for preventing myopia.</p><p>The source of these stop signals has been a subject of much debate in the myopia research community. Studies in monkeys, tree shrews and chickens — all common animal models for myopia research — have pointed to the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the back of the eye as a likely trigger. The neurotransmitter is thought to increase in response to high ambient-light levels found in sunlit surroundings.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>But an alternative theory holds that the protective benefits of outdoor exposure might be less related to light and more associated with the patterns of blur experienced across the retina in different visual environments.</p><p>The visual landscape outdoors is rich and textured, and elements of it are typically viewed at such great distances that the vast array of details merge into a more uniform image. This uniformity of focus is what tells the eye to stop growing, contends Ian Flitcroft, a paediatric ophthalmologist at the Centre for Eye Research Ireland in Dublin. “An effective stop signal is where the whole retina is seeing a clear image,” he says.</p><p>By contrast, interior spaces are filled with jumbles of objects at varying distances, surrounded by flat walls that typically lack detail. Such conditions require constant adjustments of focus, which, according to Flitcroft, deprives the retina of the necessary stop signals for regulating healthy eye growth.</p><p>Going outside offers the benefit both of bright sunlight and the enriched visual experience of wide-open spaces — with the bonus of physical activity and improved well-being to boot. But only a few places have managed to encourage children to go outside more.</p><p>In 2010, public-health officials in Taiwan introduced a programme called Tian-Tian 120, meaning everyday 120, which encourages a minimum of two hours of outdoor activity daily. It is widely credited with having curbed the rapidly increasing rates of myopia in the region<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>And although there was a minor increase in myopia cases in Taiwan during the pandemic, this uptick was substantively smaller than those observed in other parts of East Asia at the time, according to data compiled by Pei-Chang Wu, a retinal surgeon and myopia specialist at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. What’s more, the outdoor programme does not seem to have hurt students’ test scores in mathematics, reading or science, which remain among the highest in the world.</p><p>For some, the message is clear: when it comes to promoting more outdoor time, “wide-scale implementation now seems feasible and likely to succeed”, says Ian Morgan, a myopia researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra — if only more governments were willing to recalibrate their educational agendas to do so.</p><p>Until then, however, Taiwan stands as an exception. Other regions in Asia, where myopia rates are among the highest in the world, have not seen similar broad-scale successes, and most regions continue to prioritize treating myopia over public-health measures to prevent it. “There is certainly a lot of emphasis on clinical interventions at the moment,” says Morgan.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>This has led many eye specialists to search for workarounds that mimic the benefits of the outdoors in indoor settings.</p><p>Many strategies centre on light. A 2015 study found that equipping classrooms with brighter-than-usual ceiling light fixtures, along with souped-up blackboard lamps, significantly reduced the incidence of myopia among primary- and middle-school students in north-eastern China — from a 10% onset rate down to just 4% in a single year<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>.</p><p>Other approaches focus on letting more natural light into learning environments, using glass and steel to create ‘bright classrooms’. These earned high praise from students and teachers<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup>. But according to Congdon, who led one such effort in southern China, the high costs associated with construction, coupled with stringent building codes enacted after a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/459153a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/459153a" data-track-category="body text link">devastating 2008 earthquake that collapsed numerous school buildings</a>, rendered the concept impractical.</p><h2><b>Lighting the way</b></h2><p>An alternative method involves delivering light directly into the eyeball — although researchers disagree on what wavelength of light is most beneficial, and why.</p><p>In Australia, researchers have run pilot studies with specialized ‘light therapy’ glasses that emit blue–green light, a portion of the natural sunlight spectrum. Although marketed to alleviate jet lag and enhance sleep quality, these devices — reminiscent of the visor-like eyewear from Star Trek — have shown early promise in addressing short-sightedness as well, inducing transient changes in certain eye measurements linked to reduced myopia risk. The long-term benefits aren’t clear yet, notes Scott Read, an optometrist at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who led one of the studies<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup>. But, he says, “there’s certainly potential there”.</p><p>Elsewhere, the medical-device company Dopavision, based in Berlin, is trialling a virtual-reality headset that delivers short-wavelength blue light to the ‘blind spot’ — the point in the retina where the optic nerve connects. In rabbit eyes, this therapy prompts a significant increase in dopamine levels — a molecular effect that could explain why, in pilot clinical testing, the treatment has shown promise at constraining eyeball elongation in people. A larger clinical trial of the platform is ongoing in Europe, in which children wear the headsets while playing video games.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Some research points to even shorter wavelengths of light as being the key mediator of myopia development. Laboratory studies have found that exposure to violet light could slow or prevent myopia progression in mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup> and chicks<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. Ophthalmologists at the Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo tested this idea in a pair of randomized trials in which children with myopia aged 6–12 years wore specialized eyeglasses equipped with frames that emitted violet light for several hours every day. But even after months to years of wearing the kitted-out spectacles, the treatment had little effect on the growth trajectory of children’s eyeballs<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>.</p><p>Richard Lang, a biologist at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Ohio who studies the visual system, and who has previously collaborated with the Keio team, thinks that he knows why the glasses failed to make a difference.</p><p>The Keio researchers’ wavelength of choice — between 360 and 400 nanometres — was based on studies in mice, but the human eye might not respond to that part of the spectrum at all. Lang and his collaborator Rafael Grytz, a bioengineer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, studied the tree shrew (<i>Tupaia belangeri</i>), which has more human-like vision than the mouse does, and found that it filters out most violet light with a wavelength shorter than 400 nanometres.</p><p>If the human eye filters light in the same way, that could explain why the Keio team’s violet-light glasses had little impact. At just slightly longer wavelengths — around 420 nanometres — Lang and Grytz could replicate the protective benefits of violet light in their tree shrews, and they anticipate observing similar effects in people.</p><p>“There’s this exquisite wavelength sensitivity,” says Grytz, of the unpublished tree shrew data. “I think violet light might be the key for this problem and might change myopia treatment and prevention forever,” he adds. Grytz is so convinced of this potential that he built a lamp that emits violet light to help safeguard his eight-year-old daughter against myopia development. Lang and his colleagues at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital are testing a similar lighting system in an ongoing randomized trial.</p><h2><b>Seeing red</b></h2><p>Yet, the light-based intervention that is gaining the most traction around the world centres on wavelengths at the opposite end of the visible-light spectrum. Known as repeated low-level red-light therapy, the treatment involves use of a tabletop device that looks similar to a microscope, and which emits a low-intensity, long-wavelength laser directly into the user’s eyes.</p><p>Originally developed for a different eye condition, it is thought to work by enhancing blood flow in the eyeball — a mechanism that would be completely distinct from dopamine-inducing natural sunlight exposure.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Trial data from China have demonstrated the therapy’s promise for controlling and preventing myopia as well. In a year-long study conducted at ten primary schools in Shanghai, researchers found that children at high risk of developing myopia who received red-light therapy for three minutes twice per day, five days per week were half as likely to develop it as were those who didn’t receive the therapy<sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>.</p><p>“If we do this red-light intervention, the prevalence of myopia will reduce substantially over time,” says Mingguang He, an ophthalmologist at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, who co-led the study. He is also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Eyerising International, a leading manufacturer of red-light therapy machines based in South Yarra, Australia.</p><p>Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of children in China — and smaller numbers elsewhere — regularly look into red-light-emitting instruments for three minutes each morning and evening to alleviate their short-sightedness. “It’s just like brushing your teeth twice daily,” says Kaikai Qiu, an ophthalmologist at the Fuzhou South East Eye Hospital in China.</p><p>Families typically rent the device for a couple of dollars per day and administer the therapy at home. But for red-light therapy to truly become a viable public-health option for widespread myopia prevention, the technology must become more accessible, says Congdon. “We need a school-based solution,” he says. “If it can’t be implemented in schools, it’s not going to address the social problem.”</p><p>Myopia specialists have raised concerns about the safety of red-light therapy devices, after a 12-year-old girl experienced retinal damage after using one<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>. “The technical specifications are worrying,” says Lisa Ostrin, a vision scientist at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Texas, who co-authored a report earlier this year highlighting the potential for thermal injuries to the eye caused by the therapy<sup><a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">14</a></sup>.</p><p>But proponents that <i>Nature</i> spoke to argue that it is safe — and Congdon and his collaborators plan to pilot the intervention in classrooms. Trials are due to commence for preschoolers in Singapore and for primary-school students in Hong Kong.</p><p>There is one other preventive measure gaining momentum: a drug called atropine. Similar to some light-based therapies, the treatment also targets dopamine. Last year, researchers in Hong Kong reported that eye drops containing atropine can reduce the incidence of myopia<sup><a href="#ref-CR15" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">15</a></sup>. The drug is already widely used to help control the progression of myopia, and generally has minimal side effects. Still, for a preventive treatment, even mild tolerability issues could be greater than some are willing to accept.</p><h2><b>Eyes on the horizon</b></h2><p>Meanwhile, research with primary-school students in Yunnan province, in the south-western corner of China, points to a wholly different way of emulating the outdoors. The approach doesn’t rely on light but instead recreates naturalistic visual environments that promote retinal focus.</p><p>In nine classrooms in the city of Lijiang, a team led by ophthalmologist Weizhong Lan at the Aier Eye Hospital in Changsha, China, introduced into classrooms custom-made wallpaper that replicated the visual complexity and spatial properties of a natural parkland, complete with trees, jumping dogs, flapping sparrows and the occasional butterfly. The ceiling was painted to resemble a blue sky, featuring white clouds, flocks of gulls, floating balloons and a kite<sup><a href="#ref-CR16" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">16</a></sup>. “I just tried to make it as fun as possible,” says Lan.</p><figure>

</figure><p>In unpublished research that Lan plans to present at the International Myopia Conference later this year in Sanya, China, he and his colleagues found that children who spent a year inside these ‘outdoor scene classrooms’ had much less eye elongation than did those who were taught in standard white-walled classrooms. It also has the bonus of being easy to implement, he says, and shows that “light is not the only reason” that outdoor exposures are beneficial.</p><p>As evidence for numerous interventions mounts, researchers are left with a choice of which approach to prioritize. Or they could opt for the one non-clinical option already known to be cheap and effective: encourage more outdoor time.</p><p>Researchers and public-health officials will need to decide whether to spend resources on simulating the outdoors, says Kevin Frick, a health economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who is co-chairing a consensus study committee on myopia for the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. “Or do we want to take a much simpler route,” he asks, “and find ways that are useful to engage children to go outside?”</p><p>“Society has a fundamental choice to make,” Frick says — and the health of children’s eyesight hangs in the balance.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We introduce Codestral, our first-ever code model. Codestral is an
open-weight generative AI model explicitly designed for code generation
tasks. It helps developers write and interact with code through a shared
instruction and completion API endpoint. As it masters code and English,
it can be used to design advanced AI applications for software
developers.</p><h4 id="a-model-fluent-in-80-programming-languages">A model fluent in 80+ programming languages</h4><p>Codestral is trained on a diverse dataset of 80+ programming languages,
including the most popular ones, such as Python, Java, C, C++,
JavaScript, and Bash. It also performs well on more specific ones like
Swift and Fortran. This broad language base ensures Codestral can assist
developers in various coding environments and projects.</p><p>Codestral saves developers time and effort: it can complete coding
functions, write tests, and complete any partial code using a
fill-in-the-middle mechanism. Interacting with Codestral will help level
up the developer’s coding game and reduce the risk of errors and bugs.</p><h4 id="setting-the-bar-for-code-generation-performance">Setting the Bar for Code Generation Performance</h4><p><strong>Performance.</strong> As a 22B model, Codestral sets a new standard on the

models used for coding.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral/General_table.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Figure 1: With its larger context window of 32k (compared to 4k, 8k or 16k for
competitors), Codestral outperforms all other models in RepoBench, a
long-range eval for code generation..</p><p>We compare Codestral to existing code-specific models with higher
hardware requirements.</p><p><strong>Python.</strong> We use four benchmarks: HumanEval pass@1, MBPP sanitised
pass@1 to evaluate Codestral’s Python code generation ability, CruxEval
to evaluate Python output prediction, and RepoBench EM to evaluate
Codestral’s Long-Range Repository-Level Code Completion.</p><p><strong>SQL.</strong> To evaluate Codestral’s performance in SQL, we used the Spider
benchmark.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral/HumanEval_table.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Additional languages. Additionally, we evaluated Codestral's performance in multiple HumanEval pass@1 across six different languages
in addition to Python: C++, bash, Java, PHP, Typescript, and C#, and
calculated the average of these evaluations.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral/FIM_table.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>FIM benchmarks. Codestral's Fill-in-the-middle performance was assessed using HumanEval pass@1 in Python, JavaScript, and Java and

despite being based on an older codebase.”</em></p><p>– Jerry Liu, CEO and co-founder of LlamaIndex</p><p><em>“Code generation is one of the most popular LLM use-cases, so we are
really excited about the Codestral release. From our initial testing,
it's a great option for code generation workflows because it's fast,
has favorable context window, and the instruct version supports tool
use. We tested with LangGraph for self-corrective code generation using
the instruct Codestral tool use for output, and it worked really well
out-of-the-box (see our <a href="https://youtu.be/zXFxmI9f06M">video detailing this</a>).”</em></p><p>– Harrison Chase, CEO and co-founder of LangChain</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-441774">


<h3>from the <i>crystal-clear-priorities</i> dept</h3>

<p>The U.S. yet yet to pass even a basic internet-era privacy law — or regulate data brokers. And while there’s a lot of misdirection and pretense to the contrary, the primary reason is (1) because the U.S. government is too corrupt; and (2)<strong> </strong>because the U.S. government really enjoys being able to purchase massive amounts of sensitive citizen data from data brokers without having to get a pesky warrant. </p>
<p>The end result has been just a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">parade of dangerous scandals</a> in which dodgy companies hoover up oceans of sensitive user data, then sell access to any nitwit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">with two nickels to rub together</a>. Given foreign intelligence can easily buy this data, our corruption poses a severe national security threat; but instead of fixing it, Congress likes to distract folks with endless hysteria about a single app: TikTok. </p>
<p>But it’s amusing to see the government work quickly when they think it’s something that <em>might impact the affluent personally</em>. Case in point: Congress is too corrupt to protect consumer privacy, but they <strong>did</strong> manage to <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/tracking-private-jets/">pass a new privacy law specifically designed to protect the privacy of affluent jet owners</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/boeing-faa-audit/">Federal Aviation Administration</a>&nbsp;reauthorization bill contains a pointed amendment within it—the government is making it much more difficult to monitor and track private aircraft travel. The new law passed last week will almost exclusively benefit the nation’s wealthiest flyers and obscure public attempts to hold them accountable for their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/airport-private-plane-ban/">disproportionate carbon emissions</a>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/147/1">new law</a> lets private jet owners censor most meaningful travel details (call signs, flight numbers, travel patterns) through a new application process in which they claim the data must remain confidential due to ambiguous “safety or security” needs. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pwnallthethings.bsky.social/post/3ktb2joryq22i">Folks over at Bluesky</a> dug into the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/147/1">specific language of the reauthorization bill</a> and found it was inserted by Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas. </p>
<p>Jack Sweeney, the jet tracking student who made Elon Musk cry like a baby, says the law won’t <strong>completely</strong> block the tracking of jets, given they can still glean a lot of detail from general contextual clues. But it’s still amusing how quickly and easily Congress is able to shore up lax U.S. privacy safeguards when it’s to the specific benefit of the rich. </p>
<p>The thing is, letting dodgy, unregulated data brokers monetize everybody’s sensitive movement and behavior data harms poor people, rich people, and everybody in between. Right now most members of Congress view these privacy issues as somebody <strong>else’s</strong> problem, but at some point there’s going to be an unprecedented privacy scandal tied to data brokers that shatters that delusion in very painful ways.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly made the choice to prioritize making money over consumer and market health, public safety, and national security. And eventually, an event is going to come along that makes the kind of scandals we’ve seen so far (from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/03/11/apparently-easy-to-pretend-to-be-cop-grab-location-data-cellular-carriers/">stalkers abusing cellular location data</a> to right wing activists abusing abortion clinic visitor data <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">to send targeted misinformation</a>) look like a grade school picnic.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx">Back in 2021, the Elixir community started an effort to bring Elixir and Machine Learning together</a>. We have exciting updates to share since our <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/elixir-and-machine-learning-q3-roundup">last roundup</a>, including: MLIR support, rich Arrow types, traditional machine learning, structured LLM, and more.</p>
<h2>
Numerical Elixir (Nx)</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx">Nx</a> is the project that started it all. It plays a similar role as Numpy within the Elixir community, with support for just-in-time compilation to both CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>
Since we started working on Numerical Elixir, the Machine Learning landscape changed considerably, and one of such changes was driven by the introduction of <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/">MLIR</a>. With the recent release of Nx v0.7, we have ported our Google XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) bindings to MLIR, which will hopefully open up the Numerical Elixir to several new exciting possibilities, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Support for Metal on Apple Silicon  </li>
  <li>
Support for quantization  </li>
  <li>
Support for cross-compilation to embedded devices, including mobile (such as Android and iOS)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We thank <a href="https://github.com/polvalente">Paulo Valente</a> and <a href="https://dockyard.com/">Dockyard</a> for driving this effort!</p>
<h2>
Explorer</h2>
<p>
Another key project is <a href="https://github.com/elixir-explorer/explorer">Explorer</a>, which provides series and dataframes for Elixir. While playing a similar role as Pandas, its biggest inspiration is <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse’s dplyr</a>.</p>
<p>
With Explorer v0.8, we have now full compatibility with Arrow numeric types. We also added support for list and struct types, alongside a collection of functions to work with these types, such as <code>split</code>ting strings into a list, <code>join</code>ing a list of strings into a single string, functions for checking membership, computing lengths, JSON decoding, and much more.</p>
<p>
On top of that, we have improved our support for streaming data in and out of S3-compatible storage for several formats, including <code>.parquet</code>. Overall, these changes make Explorer a more fluent tool for data analysts and engineers.</p>
<h2>
Scholar</h2>
<p>
While deep learning was a major driver behind Nx, <a href="https://github.com/msluszniak">Mateusz Słuszniak</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krstopro">Krsto Proroković</a> have been focused on traditional machine learning techniques with the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/scholar">Scholar</a> project (akin to scikit-learn).</p>
<p>
Scholar v0.3 introduces several new features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00370">LargeVis</a> for visualization of large-scale and high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional (typically 2D or 3D) space  </li>
  <li>
KDTree and RandomForestTree as algorithms k-nearest neighbours classification and regression  </li>
  <li>
Hierarchical clustering with average, complete, single, and weighted linkage  </li>
  <li>
New dimensionality reduction and manifold algorithms, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00204">TriMap</a>  </li>
  <li>
Optimizations and new functions to existing algorithms and metrics  </li>
</ul>
<p>
These features bring Numerical Elixir and its ability to setup distributed model serving, over CPUs and GPUs, to traditional meachine learning algorithms, allowing developers and data practitioners to tackle a wider number of problems within the Elixir ecosystem.</p>
<h2>
New projects and learning resources</h2>
<p>
While I have covered the main projects inside the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx">Numerical Elixir</a> organization, the #machinelearning community continues working on and publishing exciting projects.</p>
<p>
A special shoutout goes to <a href="https://github.com/thmsmlr/instructor_ex"><code>instructor_ex</code></a>, from <a href="https://github.com/thmsmlr">Thomas Millar</a>, which supports structured prompting for LLMs, based on Elixir’s <a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto">Ecto data toolkit</a>. <a href="https://github.com/brainlid/langchain">Elixir’s langchain</a> has also received updates, including support for more third-party APIs as well as models implemented in Elixir via <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee/">Bumblebee</a>.</p>
<p>
On the content production and learning side, <a href="https://x.com/ac_alejos">Andrés Alejos</a> has been publishing a lot of content on <a href="https://livebook.dev/">Livebook</a>, including a recent article on <a href="https://www.thestackcanary.com/elixirs-secret-weapon/">Livebook being Elixir’s secret weapon</a>.</p>
<p>
Finally, don’t forget to checkout Sean Moriarity’s <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/smelixir/machine-learning-in-elixir/">Machine Learning in Elixir</a> book for a deep dive into the ecosystem, regardless if you are new to Elixir or machine learning. And if you are not sure what to gain from machine learning in Elixir, check out Chris Grainger’s talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP86Svk4hzI">A Year in Production with Machine Learning on the BEAM </a>.</p>
<p>
It has been a joy to see the ecosystem grow and tackle a whole new problem space with Elixir. Until next time!</p>

<p>29th May 2024</p>

<p>I’m beginning to suspect that one of the most common <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/llm-misconceptions/">misconceptions about LLMs</a> such as ChatGPT involves how “training” works.</p>
<p>A common complaint I see about these tools is that people don’t want to even try them out because they don’t want to contribute to their training data.</p>
<p>This is by no means an irrational position to take, but it does often correspond to an incorrect mental model about how these tools work.</p>
<p>Short version: ChatGPT and other similar tools <strong>do not directly learn from and memorize everything that you say to them</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be quite unintuitive: these tools imitate a human conversational partner, and humans constantly update their knowledge based on what you say to to them. Computers have much better memory than humans, so surely ChatGPT would remember every detail of everything you ever say to it. Isn’t that what “training” means?</p>
<p>That’s not how these tools work.</p>
<h4 id="llms-are-stateless-functions">LLMs are stateless functions</h4>
<p>From a computer science point of view, it’s best to think of LLMs as stateless function calls. Given this input text, what should come next?</p>
<p>In the case of a “conversation” with a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude or Google Gemini, that function input consists of the current conversation (everything said by both the human and the bot) up to that point, plus the user’s new prompt.</p>
<p>Every time you start a new chat conversation, you clear the slate. Each conversation is an entirely new sequence, carried out entirely independently of previous conversations from both yourself and other users.</p>
<p>Understanding this is key to working effectively with these models. Every time you hit “new chat” you are effectively wiping the short-term memory of the model, starting again from scratch.</p>
<p>This has a number of important consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no point at all in “telling” a model something in order to improve its knowledge for future conversations. I’ve heard from people who have invested weeks of effort pasting new information into ChatGPT sessions to try and “train” a better bot. That’s a waste of time!</li>
<li>Understanding this helps explain why the “context length” of a model is so important. Different LLMs have different context lengths, expressed in terms of “tokens”—a token is about 3/4s of a word. This is the number that tells you how much of a conversation the bot can consider at any one time. If your conversation goes past this point the model will “forget” details that occurred at the beginning of the conversation.</li>
<li>Sometimes it’s a good idea to start a fresh conversation in order to deliberately reset the model. If a model starts making obvious mistakes, or refuses to respond to a valid question for some weird reason that reset might get it back on the right track.</li>
<li>Tricks like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/rag/">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Feb/14/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/">ChatGPT’s “memory”</a> make sense only once you understand this fundamental limitation to how these models work.</li>
<li>If you’re excited about local models because you can be certain there’s no way they can train on your data, you’re mostly right: you can run them offline and audit your network traffic to be absolutely sure your data isn’t being uploaded to a server somewhere. But...</li>
<li>... if you’re excited about local models because you want something on your computer that you can chat to and it will learn from you and then better respond to your future prompts, that’s probably not going to work.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="so-what-is-training-then-">So what is “training” then?</h4>
<p>When we talk about model training, we are talking about the process that was used to build these models in the first place.</p>
<p>As a big simplification, there are two phases to this. The first is to pile in several TBs of text—think all of Wikipedia, a scrape of a large portion of the web, books, newspapers, academic papers and more—and spend months of time and potentially millions of dollars in electricity crunching through that “pre-training” data identifying patterns in how the words relate to each other.</p>
<p>This gives you a model that can complete sentences, but not necessarily in a way that will delight and impress a human conversational partner. The second phase aims to fix that—this can incorporate instruction tuning or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) which has the goal of teaching the model to pick the best possible sequences of words to have productive conversations.</p>
<p>The end result of these phases is the model itself—an enormous (many GB) blob of floating point numbers that capture both the statistical relationships between the words and some version of “taste” in terms of how best to assemble new words to reply to a user’s prompts.</p>
<p>Once trained, the model remains static and unchanged—sometimes for months or even years.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1c3f1yc/comment/kzj7n4s/">a note</a> from Jason D. Clinton, an engineer who works on Claude 3 at Anthropic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The model is stored in a static file and loaded, continuously, across 10s of thousands of identical servers each of which serve each instance of the Claude model. The model file never changes and is immutable once loaded; every shard is loading the same model file running exactly the same software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These models don’t change very often!</p>
<h4 id="reasons-to-worry-anyway">Reasons to worry anyway</h4>
<p>A frustrating thing about this issue is that it isn’t actually possible to confidently state “don’t worry, ChatGPT doesn’t train on your input”.</p>
<p>Many LLM providers have terms and conditions that allow them to improve their models based on the way you are using them. Even when they have opt-out mechanisms these are often opted-in by default.</p>
<p>When OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/">say</a> “We may use Content to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services” it’s not at all clear what they mean by that!</p>
<p>Are they storing up everything anyone says to their models and dumping that into the training run for their next model versions every few months?</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s that simple: LLM providers don’t want random low-quality text or privacy-invading details making it into their training data. But they are notoriously secretive, so who knows for sure?</p>
<p>The opt-out mechanisms are also pretty confusing. OpenAI try to make it as clear as possible that they won’t train on any content submitted through their API (so you had better understand what an “API” is), but lots of people don’t believe them! I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/">the AI trust crisis</a> last year: the pattern where many people actively disbelieve model vendors and application developers (such as Dropbox and Slack) that claim they don’t train models on private data.</p>
<p>People also worry that those terms might change in the future. There are options to protect against that: if you’re spending enough money you can <a href="https://twitter.com/therealadamg/status/1794693810204909729">sign contracts with OpenAI</a> and other vendors that freeze the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>If your mental model is that LLMs remember and train on all input, it’s much easier to assume that developers who claim they’ve disabled that ability may not be telling the truth. If you tell your human friend to disregard a juicy piece of gossip you’ve mistakenly passed on to them you know full well that they’re not going to forget it!</p>
<p>The other major concern is the same as with any cloud service: it’s reasonable to assume that your prompts are still logged for a period of time, for compliance and abuse reasons, and if that data is logged there’s always a chance of exposure thanks to an accidental security breach.</p>

<h4 id="memory-features">What about “memory” features?</h4>

<p>To make things even more confusing, some LLM tools are introducing features that attempt to work around this limitation.</p>

<p>ChatGPT recently added a <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq">memory feature</a> where it can “remember” small details and use them in follow-up conversations.</p>

<p>As with so many LLM features this is a relatively simple prompting trick: during a conversation the bot can call a mechanism to record a short note—your name, is a preference you have expressed—which will then be invisibly included in the chat context passed in future conversations.</p>

<p>You can review (and modify) the list of remembered fragments at any time, and ChatGPT shows a visible UI element any time it adds to its memory.</p>

<h4 id="bad-policy-based-on-bad-mental-models">Bad policy based on bad mental models</h4>
<p>One of the most worrying results of this common misconception concerns people who make policy decisions for how LLM tools should be used.</p>
<p>Does your company ban all use of LLMs because they don’t want their private data leaked to the model providers?</p>
<p>They’re not 100% wrong—see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/29/training-not-chatting/#reasons-to-worry-anyway">reasons to worry anyway</a>—but if they are acting based on the idea that everything said to a model is instantly memorized and could be used in responses to other users they’re acting on faulty information.</p>
<p>Even more concerning is what happens with lawmakers. How many politicians around the world are debating and voting on legislation involving these models based on a science fiction idea of what they are and how they work?</p>
<p>If people believe ChatGPT is a machine that instantly memorizes and learns from everything anyone says to it there is a very real risk they will support measures that address invented as opposed to genuine risks involving this technology.</p>

                <p><h2>Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p><h3>Why TSL?</h3><a id="user-content-why-tsl" aria-label="Permalink: Why TSL?" href="#why-tsl"></a></p>
<p>Creating shaders has always been an advanced step for most developers, many game creators have never created GLSL code from scratch. The shader graph solution adopted today by the industry has allowed developers more focused on dynamics to create the necessary graphic effects to meet the demands of their projects.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use, even if for this we need to create complexity behind, this happened initially with <code>Renderer</code> and now with the <code>TSL</code>.</p>
<p>Other benefits that TSL brings besides simplifying shading creation is keeping the <code>renderer agnostic</code>, while all the complexity of a material can be imported into different modules and use <code>tree shaking</code> without breaking during the process.</p>
<p><h3>Example</h3><a id="user-content-example" aria-label="Permalink: Example" href="#example"></a></p>
<p>A <code>detail map</code> makes things look more real in games. It adds tiny details like cracks or bumps to surfaces, like walls. In this example we will scale uv to improve details when seen up close and multiply with a base texture.</p>
<p><h4>Old</h4><a id="user-content-old" aria-label="Permalink: Old" href="#old"></a></p>
<p>This is how we would achieve that using <code>.onBeforeCompile()</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial();
material.map = colorMap;
material.onBeforeCompile = ( shader ) => {

	shader.uniforms.detailMap = { value: detailMap };

	let token = '#define STANDARD';

	let insert = /* glsl */`
		uniform sampler2D detailMap;
	`;

	shader.fragmentShader = shader.fragmentShader.replace( token, token + insert );

	token = '#include <map_fragment>';

	insert = /* glsl */`
		diffuseColor *= texture2D( detailMap, vMapUv * 10.0 );
	`;

	shader.fragmentShader = shader.fragmentShader.replace( token, token + insert );

<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p>Any simple change from this makes the code increasingly complicated using <code>.onBeforeCompile</code>, the result we have today in the community is that we have countless types of parametric materials that do not communicate with each other, and that need to be updated periodically to be operating, limiting the creativity to create unique materials reusing modules in a simple way.</p>
<p><h4>New</h4><a id="user-content-new" aria-label="Permalink: New" href="#new"></a></p>
<p>With <code>TSL</code> the code would look like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import { texture, uv } from 'three/tsl';

const detail = texture( detailMap, uv().mul( 10 ) );

const material = new MeshStandardNodeMaterial();
material.colorNode = texture( colorMap ).mul( detail );"><pre><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>texture</span><span>,</span> <span>uv</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'three/tsl'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>detail</span> <span>=</span> <span>texture</span><span>(</span> <span>detailMap</span><span>,</span> <span>uv</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>mul</span><span>(</span> <span>10</span> <span>)</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MeshStandardNodeMaterial</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>material</span><span>.</span><span>colorNode</span> <span>=</span> <span>texture</span><span>(</span> <span>colorMap</span> <span>)</span><span>.</span><span>mul</span><span>(</span> <span>detail</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p><code>TSL</code> is also capable of encoding code into different outputs such as <code>WGSL</code>/<code>GLSL</code> - <code>WebGPU</code>/<code>WebGL</code>, in addition to optimizing the shader graph automatically and through codes that can be inserted within each <code>Node</code>. This allows the developer to focus on productivity and leave the graphical management part to the <code>Node System</code>.</p>
<p>Another important feature of a graph shader is that we will no longer need to care about the sequence in which components are created, because the <code>Node System</code> will only declare and include it once.</p>
<p>Let's say that you import <code>positionWorld</code> into your code, even if another component uses it, the calculations performed to obtain <code>position world</code> will only be performed once, as is the case with any other renderer component such as: <code>normalWorld</code>, <code>modelPosition</code>, etc.</p>
<p><h3>Architeture</h3><a id="user-content-architeture" aria-label="Permalink: Architeture" href="#architeture"></a></p>
<p>All <code>TSL</code> component is created from a <code>Node</code>. The <code>Node</code> allows it to communicate with any other, value conversions can be automatic or manual, a <code>Node</code> can receive the output value expected by the parent <code>Node</code> and modify its own output snippet.</p>
<p>Since they are all components are extended from the <code>Node</code> class, it is possible to modulate them using <code>tree shaking</code>. In the shader construction process, the <code>Node</code> will have important information such as <code>geometry</code>, <code>material</code>, <code>renderer</code> as well as the <code>backend</code>, which can influence the type and value of output.</p>
<p>The build process is based on three pillars: <code>setup</code>, <code>analyze</code> and <code>generate</code>.</p>

<p><h3><code>tslFn( function )</code></h3><a id="user-content-tslfn-function-" aria-label="Permalink: tslFn( function )" href="#tslfn-function-"></a></p>
<p>It is possible to use classic JS functions or a <code>tslFn()</code> interface. The main difference is that <code>tslFn()</code> creates a controllable environment, allowing the use of <code>stack</code> where you can use <code>assign</code> and <code>conditional</code>, while the classic function only allows inline approaches.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// tsl function

<p>To create a variable from a node use <code>.toVar()</code>.</p>
<p>The first parameter is used to add a name to it, otherwise the node system will name it automatically, it can be useful in debugging or access using <code>wgslFn</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const uvScaled = uv().mul( 10 ).toVar();

material.colorNode = texture( map, uvScaled );"><pre><span>const</span> <span>uvScaled</span> <span>=</span> <span>uv</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>mul</span><span>(</span> <span>10</span> <span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toVar</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p>Let's suppose you want to optimize some calculation in the <code>vertex stage</code> but are using it in a slot like <code>material.colorNode</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// multiplication will be executed in vertex stage
const normalView = varying( modelNormalMatrix.mul( normalLocal ) );

// normalize will be executed in fragment stage
// because .colorNode is fragment stage slot as default
material.colorNode = normalView.normalize();"><pre><span>// multiplication will be executed in vertex stage</span>
<span>const</span> <span>normalView</span> <span>=</span> <span>varying</span><span>(</span> <span>modelNormalMatrix</span><span>.</span><span>mul</span><span>(</span> <span>normalLocal</span> <span>)</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>// normalize will be executed in fragment stage</span>
<span>// because .colorNode is fragment stage slot as default</span>
<span>material</span><span>.</span><span>colorNode</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalView</span><span>.</span><span>normalize</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p>The first parameter of <code>varying</code> <code>modelNormalMatrix.mul( normalLocal )</code> will be executed in <code>vertex stage</code>, and the return from <code>varying()</code> will be a <code>varying</code> as we are used in WGSL/GLSL, this can optimize extra calculations in the <code>fragment stage</code>. The second parameter allows you to add a custom name to <code>varying</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>varying()</code> is added only to <code>.positionNode</code>, it will only return a simple variable and varying will not be created.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every American knows what the CIA is. I would guess that maybe 1 in 1,000 have ever heard of INR — the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, American diplomats’ in-house intelligence agency.</p><p>But if you do know about INR, you probably know two things:</p><div><ol><li><span>It has gotten big stuff right when the CIA and others screwed up.</span></li><li><span>When it got that big stuff right, no one listened to it.</span></li></ol></div><p>INR is the Cassandra of American intelligence, and it earned that reputation the hard way.</p><p>As early as 1961, <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/mouse-roared">INR analysts were warning</a> that South Vietnam’s battle against the North and the Viet Cong insurgency was failing, and would ultimately fail because the Viet Cong had the support of villagers in the South. Their analyses prompted <a href="https://shfg.wildapricot.org/resources/Documents/FH%208%20(2016)%20Reinstein.pdf#page=7">furious rebukes</a> from the likes of then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. But they were right.</p><p>In 2002, it happened again. The <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/index.htm">CIA</a>, the <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/15947-document-33-defense-intelligence-agency-defense">Defense Intelligence Agency</a> (DIA), and the rest of the intelligence community had concluded that Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was trying to build nuclear weapons, which became one of the ostensible motivations for the US invasion. <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2005/01/01/analyze-this-2/">INR thought their evidence was nonsense</a>. It was right.</p><p>In 2022, it happened <em>again</em>. The intelligence community <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/kyiv-russia-ukraine-us-intelligence/index.html">predicted that Russia would win its war on Ukraine easily</a>, cruising into Kyiv in a matter of days. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/us-intelligence-review-ukraine/index.html">INR dissented</a>, arguing that Ukraine would put up a spirited fight and prevent Russia from getting anywhere near the capital. It was right. (Brett Holmgren, INR’s current chief, took pains to tell me that INR was not the only dissenter&nbsp;but confirmed that the bureau thought Ukraine would put up a strong fight.)</p><p>“You can get other intel agencies really upset about this when you point this out,” says Ellen McCarthy, who led the bureau from 2019 to 2021 after many years in other parts of the intelligence community. “But I've got to tell you, INR is almost always right.”</p><p>The bureau’s stellar track record seems, on paper, inexplicable. INR is tiny, with fewer than 500 employees total. The DIA has over 16,500, and while the CIA’s headcount is classified, it was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-budget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html">21,575</a> in 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked it.&nbsp;</p><p>You could fit over 47 INRs in the CIA, and even if you exclude the non-analysts on the CIA's payroll, Langley’s analytic headcount is far greater than INR’s. Tom Fingar, who led the bureau from 2000 to 2001 and 2004 to 2005, once told a reporter its budget was “<a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2005/01/01/analyze-this-2/">decimal dust</a>.” In 2023, it came to only <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FY-2025-CBJ-A-1.pdf#page=322">$83.5 million</a>, or 0.1 percent of <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2023/3734-dni-releases-appropriated-budget-figure-for-2023-national-intelligence-program">overall US intelligence spending</a>.</p><p>On top of that, INR has no spies abroad, no satellites in the sky, no bugs on any laptops. But it reads the same raw intel as everyone else, and in at least a few cases, was the only agency to get some key questions right.</p><p>Saying “INR does a better job than DIA or CIA,” as a general matter, would go too far, not least because making a judgment like that in a responsible way would require access to classified information that the press and public can’t read. But it clearly is doing something different, which in a few key cases has paid off. And at least some policymakers have noticed. Bill Clinton <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Without_Precedent/SO9fqnNBaigC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA187&amp;printsec=frontcover">told the 9/11 Commission</a> he found memos by INR more helpful than the President’s Daily Brief, then prepared by the CIA.</p><p>I spoke to 10 veterans of the bureau, including six former assistant secretaries who led it. While no single ingredient seems to explain its relative success, a few ingredients together might:</p><div><ol><li><span>INR analysts are true experts. They are heavily recruited from PhD programs and even professorships, and have been on their subject matter (a set of countries, or a thematic specialty like trade flows or terrorism) for an average of 14 years. CIA analysts typically switch assignments every two to three years.</span></li><li><span>INR’s small size means that analyses are written by individuals, not by committee, and analysts have fewer editors and managers separating them from the policymakers they’re advising. That means less groupthink, and clearer individual perspectives.</span></li><li><span>INR staff work alongside State Department policymakers, meaning they get regular feedback on what kind of information is most useful to them.</span></li></ol></div><p>Intelligence analysis is a notoriously difficult craft. Practitioners have to make predictions and assessments with limited information, under huge time pressure, on issues where the stakes involve millions of lives and the fates of nations. If this small bureau tucked in the State Department’s Foggy Bottom headquarters has figured out some tricks for doing it better, those insights may not just matter for intelligence, but for any job that requires making hard decisions under uncertainty.</p><div><p><h3>The little bureau that could</h3></p></div><p>INR began life as the research and analysis (R&amp;A) section of the Office of Strategic Services, the US’s World War II-era spy agency. When its parent office was dissolved after the war, the R&amp;A section was given to the State Department.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not an easy marriage at first. “They were distrusted by the [State] Department's regulars who considered the newcomers too liberal in their views and unable to offer anything that could not be provided through traditional diplomatic methods,” historian Lawrence Freedman <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691638218/us-intelligence-and-the-soviet-strategic-threat">wrote</a> in 1977. The division was then disbanded in 1946, before being reconstituted in 1947 as the bureau that still exists today. INR vets note with pride that its founding predates that of the CIA.</p><p>“The unit is handicapped by its small size,” Freedman noted of INR, “and has only made an impact through the quality of its personnel.” Indeed, early in the Vietnam war there was <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB121/prados.htm">only one analyst at INR for North Vietnam and another analyst for the South</a>; by 1968, at the war's apex, that grew to four South Vietnam and two North Vietnam analysts. Six people, for a war that was tearing a whole region and, increasingly, American society itself, apart.</p><p>Luckily, the quality of that personnel was very high. The key analyst on North Vietnam was a woman named <a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/theday/name/dorothy-avery-obituary?id=22236641">Dorothy Avery</a>, a former CIA analyst who had a master’s degree in Far Eastern Studies from Harvard University. Fingar, the former INR chief, overlapped with Avery at the bureau when she was a senior presence, and he a very junior one. “We joked about Dottie Avery — she didn't like it — but that Dottie Avery started doing Vietnam when Ho Chi Minh wore short pants,” he recalls.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB121/prados.htm">Almost as soon as Avery arrived at INR</a> in 1962, she and her supervisor Allen Whiting proved their mettle by predicting that China and India would engage in border clashes, then pause, then resume hostilities, then halt. All of that happened.</p><p>But INR also had messages that the Kennedy and Johnson administrations of the time didn’t want to hear. In 1963, the bureau prepared a report of statistics on the war effort: the number of Viet Cong attacks and the number of prisoners, weapons, and defectors collected by the South. All of the trendlines were negative. The report prompted a furious protest from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who argued that the South Vietnamese were succeeding. Defense Secretary McNamara echoed their protest.</p><div><p><img alt="Men dressed in Army gear walk through the forest." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 600px" srcset="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-615207036.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.1743379571248%2C0%2C97.65132408575%2C100&amp;w=2400"></p></div><p>But INR stayed pessimistic, and because of that, stayed accurate. Avery pushed back on the military's assessment that "the application of force would induce Hanoi to make concessions," arguing instead that "Hanoi felt it was on a roll and held the advantage in South Vietnam," <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB121/prados.htm">historian John Prados writes</a>. That led her and INR to "predict accurately that North Vietnam would up the ante in the South, increase its support to the NLF [the National Liberation Front, the political arm of the Viet Cong] and perhaps send its own troops to fight."&nbsp;</p><p>The bureau accurately predicted that in 1965, China would send thousands of troops to North Vietnam to support its ally; they insisted that bombing could not break North Vietnamese supply lines, and were right about that too.</p><p>In 1969, after over 30,000 American troops had died — along with hundreds of thousands, if not more, Vietnamese soldiers and civilians had died — INR commissioned <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/intelligence-vietnam/2020-12-27/intelligence-vietnam-ii-return-top-secret-1969-state-department-study">an internal review</a> by Avery and two colleagues documenting, in clinical detail, that they had seen this all coming.</p><p>Decades later, as the US began preparations for the Iraq war, INR would see arguably its finest moment. Its leader was Carl Ford, a veteran of the CIA and DIA who hadn’t previously served at INR. But he was fiercely loyal to his team, and his team had an unusual perspective on Saddam Hussein and nuclear weapons.</p><p>The evidence that Hussein was reconstituting Iraq’s nuclear program — a contention that fueled Bush administration officials’ arguments for war, like national security adviser <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2003/US/01/10/wbr.smoking.gun/">Condoleezza Rice’s famous quip</a>, “We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud” —&nbsp;had two primary components. One was a finding that the Iraqi military had been purchasing a number of high-strength aluminum tubes, which the CIA and DIA thought could be used to build centrifuges for enriching uranium.</p><p>On September 6, 2001, five days <em>before</em> the 9/11 attacks, INR issued a report disagreeing with that finding. For one thing, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=101">scientists at the Department of Energy had looked into the matter</a> and found that Iraq had already disclosed in the past that it used aluminum tubes of the same specifications to manufacture artillery rockets, going back over a decade. Moreover, the new tubes were to be “anodized,” a treatment that renders them much less usable for centrifuges.</p><p>“You <em>can</em> make a centrifuge out of these things, but no one in his right mind <em>would</em>,” as Ford explained to me.</p><p>The other major evidence offered for the claim that Iraq was pursuing nukes was an allegation that they had tried to buy “yellowcake” uranium from Niger; this is a partially processed form of mined uranium that could in theory be processed further and used for a bomb. When the claim first emerged in late 2001, INR was immediately skeptical, per an ensuing Senate investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>INR found the claim "highly suspect" because French businesses controlled the Nigerien uranium sector, and the French government was unlikely to actively assist Iraq in getting uranium. As more information came in, the CIA and DIA "were more impressed," while INR "continued to doubt the accuracy of the reporting" given that Iraq was "bound to be caught" if it followed through.</p><p>About a year later, an Italian journalist leaked to the US Embassy in Rome a purported Nigerien government document detailing the purchase. Fingar showed the document to an INR analyst who had served as a foreign service officer in Niger. “He looked at the putative document and he says, ‘That's a forgery. It's an obvious forgery,’” Fingar says. “How do you know it's an obvious forgery? ‘In Niger, when they sign, the line is on a diagonal. This is horizontal. It's obviously not an official document.’”</p><p>In 2004, a <a href="https://irp.fas.org/congress/2004_rpt/ssci_iraq.pdf#page=96">Senate committee</a> reviewing the colossal intelligence failure behind the Iraq war concluded that "only INR disagreed with the assessment that Iraq had begun reconstituting its nuclear program." It was perhaps the biggest success in the bureau’s history, and it managed to become publicly known, winning the bureau glowing profiles from the <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2005/01/01/analyze-this-2/">Washington Monthly’s Justin Rood</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2004/05/02/spy-world-success-story/17c8eeb1-9642-4a17-805f-72aa62eefcc7/">Washington Post’s David Ignatius</a>.</p><div><p><img alt="A photograph presented by US Secretary of State Colin Powell to the UN Security Council on February 5, 2003, showing aluminum tubes that he argued were evidence of Iraq's nuclear program.

They agreed with other agencies that Iraq still had biological and chemical weapons, and they got that wrong.</p><p>And INR’s broader track record is far from spotless. To name one since-declassified example, <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/18190-national-security-archive-doc-01-state">a 1977 report on Iran</a> predicting “the prospects are good that Iran will have relatively clear sailing until at least the mid-1980s” has not aged well, coming just two years before the Shah was deposed in a mass popular uprising and three years before the beginning of the devastating Iran-Iraq war. INR also got egg on its face in 2009 when longtime analyst Kendall Myers was revealed to have been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-state-department-official-sentenced-life-prison-nearly-30-year-espionage-conspiracy">spying for Cuba for decades</a> (though INR was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_James_Nicholson">far</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen">only</a> agency penetrated by spies).&nbsp;</p><p>But the successes appear to outweigh the misses. Even on Iran, <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/02684529708432403">INR was earlier</a> than the CIA or DIA in warning amid 1978’s protests that there was a real chance the Shah would be forced out. In May 1973, <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB415/">INR analyst Roger Merrick argued</a> that there was a “better than even bet” that Egypt would start a war with Israel “by autumn.” Egypt launched the Yom Kippur War in October.&nbsp;</p><p>Rood noted in 2000 and 2001, the CIA thought North Korea would soon test an intercontinental ballistic missile. INR doubted they'd get there in the next decade. As it happens, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/experts-north-koreas-missile-was-a-real-icbm--and-a-grave-milestone/2017/07/04/554bb81e-60da-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.html">the first North Korea ICBM test was in 2017</a>, sixteen years later.</p><p>Philip Goldberg, who ran INR from 2010 and 2013 and now serves as US ambassador to South Korea, recalls the bureau’s terrorism section being able to tell him, in real time, the ideological motivation behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks">2011 Norway massacres</a> and the perpetrators of the 2012 attack on a US compound in Benghazi. In the former case, there was <a href="https://www.aei.org/foreign-and-defense-policy/terrorism/norway-and-al-qaeda/">widespread speculation</a> that al-Qaeda was responsible — but the INR team correctly identified it as a neo-Nazi attack.</p><p>Fingar told me yet another favorite win. "The specific issue was, would Argentina send troops to the multinational force in Haiti?" in 1994, as the US assembled a coalition of nations, under the banner of the UN, to invade and restore Haiti’s democratically elected president to office. "Our embassy had reported they'd be there. Argentine embassy in Washington: they'll be there. The State Department, the Argentine desk: they'll be there. [The CIA]: they'll be there.” But, “INR said, no, they won't.” The undersecretary running the meeting, Peter Tarnoff, asked which analyst at INR believed this. He was told it was Jim Buchanan.</p><p>At that point, as Fingar remembers it, Tarnoff ended the meeting, because Buchanan’s opinion settled the matter. That’s how good Buchanan’s, and INR’s, reputation was. And sure enough, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/08/05/argentina-wont-join-invasion/a77a91b0-b513-4a92-be14-c16a8b57a1ca/">Argentina backed out on its promise to send troops</a>.</p><div><p><h3>How INR works</h3></p></div><p>INR veterans describe their bureau in glowing terms, and some outsiders tend to agree. In <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850607.2016.1177393">one essay</a>, the veteran CIA analyst John A. Gentry went so far as to recommend as a reform measure for the rest of the intelligence community to “model strategic, all-source analysts after the stereotypical INR analyst.”</p><p>But the agency’s reputation as contrarian sticks out too. “Gadflies of the intelligence community” is how <a href="https://www.albany.edu/cehc/faculty/stephen-coulthart">Stephen Coulthart</a>, a professor at the University at Albany and one of the few academics to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2016.1140327">study INR</a>, puts it. “We had this reputation of being kind of … I guess they called this the red-haired stepchild. Being kind of snitty,” recalls Bowman Miller, former Europe chief at INR.</p><p>They’re informal; one alum told me you’d “put your coat and tie on” if you had to meet with the Secretary of State, but not otherwise. They’re the only intelligence agency that does not require polygraph tests — which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Polygraph_Protection_Act">private sector employers are banned from using</a> for the simple reason that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/14/5999119/polygraphs-lie-detectors-do-they-work">they do not work at all</a> — in hiring.</p><p>Rod Schoonover, who worked in the bureau analyzing climate change and related issues from 2009 to 2019, told me about a commemorative "challenge coin" made for INR that he received. It depicts a tiny numeral 1 in superscript above the R, designating a footnote.&nbsp;</p><p>In intelligence argot, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/static/Intel-Role-for-Footnote.pdf">"footnote" has another meaning</a>: It means a dissent or a major disagreement with a broader assessment made by colleagues. INR dissented so much that it threw a joke about it onto its coin. “They’re proud of dissent and particularly proud of dissent when they get it right,” he recalls.</p><div><p><img alt="INR challenge coin" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 600px" srcset="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/g-dosbir.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></p></div><p>The most important factor in building this culture, every veteran I spoke to stated, is the unusual way that INR selects and uses analysts. The CIA and DIA tend to favor generalists. Analysts rotate between roles every two to three years, often changing countries or even regions. At INR, the average analyst has been on their topic for <a href="https://www.state.gov/inrfact-sheet/">over 14 years</a>. “At most of the other intel organizations you rotate out of your portfolio every two to three years,” McCarthy says. “At INR, they die at their desks.”</p><p>INR, like the rest of the State Department, employs many foreign service officers, who <em>do</em> rotate between roles every three years. That helps the bureau stay current on particular countries’ cultures, enabling victories like their Niger analyst recognizing the yellowcake documents as a forgery. A past FSO working as a Russia analyst, John Evans, <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2005/01/01/analyze-this-2/">came to the role after a job at the US consulate in St. Petersburg</a> in the 1990s, where he talked regularly with the office of mayor Anatoly Sobchak. His contact was Sobchak’s deputy, Vladimir Putin. Once Putin moved into a somewhat bigger job, that background came in handy.</p><p><a href="https://www.state.gov/inrfact-sheet/">Sixty-nine percent</a> of INR employees are in the civil service, not the foreign service. That means no rotation. They are hired specifically for INR, and are meant to stay there for a long time. Many of them are recruited from academia. Miller came after earning his doctorate in Germanic languages and literatures at Georgetown. Tom Fingar was a political scientist at Stanford researching China when he joined. Schoonover was a tenured professor of chemistry at Cal Poly.</p><p>McCarthy notes that INR analysts tended to earn less than their CIA analogues, but Fingar argues that retention was no problem. “I asked my admin people, why do people leave? What’s the number one reason people leave? Retirement. Number two, death.”</p><p>Once hired, analysts enjoyed a quite flat organization. There weren’t many layers of hierarchy, and even managers made time to work on their own analyses. That could sort out some particularly ambitious people; Mark Stout, a former analyst, says he left for the CIA in part because there was little room for promotion and advancement within INR. It was a somewhat more staid place, whereas the CIA felt more fast-paced and dynamic. “The problem with [INR] bureaucratically is people don’t get promoted,” Miller says. Daniel Bennett Smith, who led the bureau from 2014 to 2018, told me he fought to create a new senior analyst role that would be paid at GS-15 scale (minimum <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2024/DCB.pdf">$164,000 a year</a>) rather than GS-13 (minimum $118,000), so longtimers had some means of promotion.</p><p>But the flat structure, combined with the agency’s tiny size, means analysts get a great deal of freedom. Vic Raphael, who retired in 2022 as INR’s deputy in charge of analysis, notes that analysts’ work “would only go through three or four layers before we released it. The analyst, his peers, the office director, the analytic review staff, I’d look at it, and boom it went.” Very little separates a rank-and-file analyst from their ultimate consumer, whether that’s an assistant secretary or even the secretary of state.&nbsp;</p><p>By contrast, CIA and DIA analysts have to deal not only with more hierarchy above them, but a greater number of fellow analysts working on their topic. They have to coordinate with their fellow analysts before moving forward. At INR, however, most countries have only one analyst assigned to them, and that analyst probably has other countries in their portfolio too. As a result, that analyst gets a lot of influence.</p><p>This helps explain why INR has sometimes been able to stake out positions at odds with the rest of the intelligence community: its writing process emphasizes individuality rather than groupthink.</p><p>The bureau also stands out as unusually embedded with policymakers. Analysts at other agencies aren’t working side by side with diplomats actually implementing foreign policy; INR analysts are in the same building as their colleagues in State Department bureaus managing policy toward specific countries, or on nonproliferation or drug trafficking, or on human rights and democracy. Goldberg, who led INR under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, notes that “we could respond much more quickly than farming it out to another part of the intelligence community, because on a day-to-day basis, we had an idea of what was on her mind.”</p><p>INR has another key tool in its kit: polling. Its Office of Opinion Research (INR/OPN) conducts public polls of populations around the world to gauge public sentiment. Raphael notes that Pew Research Center has recruited from OPN because “it’s like Pew on steroids.”&nbsp;</p><p>INR’s successful call on the 2022 Ukraine invasion reportedly came because <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/us-intelligence-review-ukraine/index.html">OPN’s polling</a> found that residents of eastern Ukraine were more anti-Russian and more eager to fight an invasion than previously suspected. The polling, Assistant Secretary Brett Holmgren says, has “allowed us to observe consistently, quarter over quarter, overwhelming Ukrainian will to fight across the board and willingness to continue to defend their territory and to take up arms against Russian aggression.”</p><div><p><h3>The future of INR</h3></p></div><p>INR alums are incredibly proud of their history, of their record of dissent and vindication on Vietnam, Iraq, and so much more.</p><div><p><img alt="A group of State intelligence workers pose near cherry blossoms" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 600px" srcset="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/0820OFFICE-1.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=2400"></p></div><p>But the bureau is also evolving. When McCarthy came in as assistant secretary in 2019, she recalls that the group had fallen behind on IT.&nbsp; “There was this thing called the internet,” she said. “And INR was not necessarily a big user of it.”&nbsp;</p><p>INR had also shrunk to a size where, as much as its nimbleness could be an asset, it was struggling “to keep up with requirements,” as McCarthy put it. She pushed to grow the bureau, and its staff of federal employees (excluding contractors) <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FY21-CBJ-Appendix-1-FINAL-for-GPA-Mar-26-2020.pdf#page=264">rose from 315 to 336 between 2019 and 2020</a>.</p><p>“We were so used to getting onesies and twosies each year,” Raphael recalls, referring to hiring one or two more analysts. “With her we got maybe up to 10, and for us that was like, holy cow!”</p><p>Holmgren, who has led the bureau under President Biden and Secretary Antony Blinken, has invested heavily in IT improvements, and created a new product called the “Secretary’s Intelligence Brief,” modeled on the President’s Daily Brief but more targeted for what Blinken, or any future Secretary, needs to know. His vision is for the bureau to serve an analogous role for diplomats to that served by military intelligence for soldiers, a “diplomatic support agency” providing granular knowledge that ambassadors and foreign service officers need.</p><p>But he also wants the bureau to retain the spirit it’s had since 1947. “There's a handwritten note that is framed in INR's front office, from Secretary [Madeleine] Albright,” he says. “She wrote it on January 20th of 2001, her last day as secretary of state. I want to read you the quote because it's something that's resonated with me since I joined INR. It says, ‘This is my last summary from INR. And I cannot imagine how I will have any idea about what is really going on without you.’”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A trove of leaked Google documents has given us an unprecedented look inside Google Search and revealed some of the most important elements Google uses to rank content.</p>



<p><strong>What happened.</strong> Thousands of documents, which appear to come from Google’s internal Content API Warehouse, were released <a href="https://github.com/yoshi-code-bot/elixir-google-api/commit/d7a637f4391b2174a2cf43ee11e6577a204a161e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 13 on Github</a> by an automated bot called yoshi-code-bot. These documents were shared with Rand Fishkin, SparkToro co-founder, earlier this month.</p>



<ul>
<li>Read on to discover what we’ve learned from Fishkin, as well as Michael King, iPullRank CEO, who also reviewed and analyzed the documents (and plans to provide further analysis for Search Engine Land soon).</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Why we care.</strong> We have been given a glimpse into how Google’s ranking algorithm may work, which is invaluable for SEOs who can understand what it all means. In 2023, we got an <a href="https://searchengineland.com/yandex-leak-learnings-392393">unprecedented look at Yandex Search ranking factors</a> via a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/yandex-search-ranking-factors-leak-392323">leak</a>, which was one of the biggest stories of that year.</p><!-- /1038259/SEL_Post-text -->



<p>This Google document leak? It will likely be one of the biggest stories in the history of SEO and Google Search.</p>



<p><strong>What’s inside. </strong>Here’s what we know about the internal documents, thanks to Fishkin and King:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Current: </strong>The documentation indicates this information is accurate as of March.</li>



<li><strong>Ranking features:</strong> 2,596 modules are represented in the API documentation with 14,014 attributes.</li>



<li><strong>Weighting:</strong> The documents did not specify how any of the ranking features are weighted –&nbsp;just that they exist.</li>



<li><strong>Twiddlers:</strong> These are re-ranking functions that “can adjust the information retrieval score of a document or change the ranking of a document,” according to King.</li>



<li><strong>Demotions:</strong> Content can be demoted for a variety of reasons, such as:
<ul>
<li>A link doesn’t match the target site.</li>



<li>SERP signals indicate user dissatisfaction.</li>



<li>Product reviews.</li>



<li>Location.</li>



<li>Exact match domains.</li>



<li>Porn</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Change history:</strong> Google apparently keeps a copy of every version of every page it has ever indexed. Meaning, Google can “remember” every change ever made to a page. However, Google only uses the last 20 changes of a URL when analyzing links.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Links matter.</strong> Shocking, I know. Link diversity and relevance remain key, the documents show. And PageRank is still very much alive within Google’s ranking features. PageRank for a website’s homepage is considered for every document.</p>



<ul>
<li>This doesn’t prove Google spokespeople have lied about <a href="https://searchengineland.com/links-google-search-ranking-factor-gary-illyes-432422">links not being a “top 3 ranking factor”</a> or <a href="https://searchengineland.com/links-may-be-less-important-to-the-google-search-ranking-algorithm-in-the-future-389364">links mattering less for ranking</a>. Two things can be true at once. Again, we don’t know how any of these features are weighted. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Successful clicks matter.</strong> This should not be a shocker, but if you want to rank well, you need to keep creating great content and user experiences, based on the documents. Google uses a variety of measurements, including&nbsp;<strong>badClicks</strong>, <strong>goodClicks</strong>, <strong>lastLongestClicks</strong> and <strong>unsquashedClicks</strong>.</p>



<p>Also, longer documents may get truncated, while shorter content gets a score (from 0-512) based on originality. Scores are also given to Your Money Your Life content, like health and news.</p>



<p>What does it all mean? According to King:</p>



<ul>
<li>“[Y]ou need to drive more&nbsp;<em>successful&nbsp;</em>clicks using a broader set of queries and earn more link diversity if you want to continue to rank. Conceptually, it makes sense because a very strong piece of content will do that. A focus on driving more qualified traffic to a better user experience will send signals to Google that your page deserves to rank.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Documents and testimony from the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-antirust-trial-hearing-updates-431977">U.S. vs. Google antitrust trial</a> confirmed that Google uses clicks in ranking – especially with its Navboost system, “one of the important signals” Google uses for ranking. See more from our coverage:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-ranking-documents-434141">7 must-see Google Search ranking documents in antitrust trial exhibits</a></li>



<li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-google-search-ranking-works-pandu-nayak-435395">How Google Search and ranking works, according to Google’s Pandu Nayak</a></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Brand matters.</strong> Fishkin’s big takeaway? Brand matters more than anything else:</p>



<ul>
<li>“If there was one universal piece of advice I had for marketers seeking to broadly improve their organic search rankings and traffic, it would be: ‘Build a notable, popular, well-recognized brand in your space, outside of Google search.'”</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Entities matter.</strong> <a href="https://searchengineland.com/authorship-dead-long-live-authorship-217209">Authorship lives</a>. Google stores author information associated with content and tries to determine whether an entity is the author of the document.</p>



<p><strong>SiteAuthority:</strong> Google uses something called “siteAuthority”. </p>



<ul>
<li>Google told us something like this existed in 2011, after the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-panda-update-guide-381104">Panda update</a> launched, stating publicly that “low quality&nbsp;content&nbsp;on part of a site can impact a site’s ranking as a whole.” </li>



<li>However, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-no-website-authority-score-22874.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google has denied having a website authority score</a> in the years since then.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chrome data.</strong> A module called <strong>ChromeInTotal</strong> indicates that Google uses data from its Chrome browser for ranking.</p>



<p><strong>Whitelists.</strong> A couple of modules indicate Google whitelist certain domains related to elections and COVID – <strong>isElectionAuthority</strong> and <strong>isCovidLocalAuthority</strong>. Though we’ve long known <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-bing-have-whitelistsexception-lists-for-algorithms-67732">Google (and Bing) have “exception lists”</a> when “specific algorithms inadvertently impact websites.”</p>



<p><strong>Small sites.</strong> Another feature is <strong>smallPersonalSite</strong> – for a small personal site or blog. King speculated that Google could boost or demote such sites via a Twiddler. However, that remains an open question. Again, we don’t know for certain how much these features are weighted.</p>



<p><strong>Other interesting findings. </strong>According to Google’s internal documents:</p>



<ul>
<li>Freshness matters – Google looks at dates in the byline (<strong>bylineDate</strong>), URL (<strong>syntacticDate</strong>) and on-page content (<strong>semanticDate</strong>).</li>



<li>To determine whether a document is or isn’t a core topic of the website, Google vectorizes pages and sites, then compares the page embeddings (<strong>siteRadius</strong>) to the site embeddings (<strong>siteFocusScore</strong>). </li>



<li>Google stores domain registration information (<strong>RegistrationInfo</strong>).</li>



<li>Page titles still matter. Google has a feature called <strong>titlematchScore</strong> that is believed to measure how well a page title matches a query. </li>



<li>Google measures the average weighted font size of terms in documents (<strong>avgTermWeight</strong>) and anchor text.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The articles. </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secrets from the Algorithm: Google Search’s Internal Engineering Documentation Has Leaked</a> by King on iPullRank</li>



<li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Anonymous Source Shared Thousands of Leaked Google Search API Documents with Me; Everyone in SEO Should See Them</a> by Fishkin on SparkToro</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Quick clarification. </strong>There is some dispute as to whether these documents were “leaked” or “discovered.” I’ve been told it’s likely the internal documents were accidentally included in a code review and pushed live from Google’s internal code base, where they were then discovered.</p>



<p><strong>The source.</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erfanazimi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erfan Azimi</a>, CEO and director of SEO for digital marketing agency EA Eagle Digital, posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEb8_rbfFVw">a video</a>, claiming responsibility for sharing the documents with Fishkin. Azimi is not employed by Google.</p>

            <link>https://www.nikolasgoebel.com/2024/05/28/duckdb-doesnt-need-data.html</link>

            <pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 09:13:47 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.nikolasgoebel.com/2024/05/28/duckdb-doesnt-need-data.html">https://www.nikolasgoebel.com/2024/05/28/duckdb-doesnt-need-data.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40509987">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          

<p>One of the many enjoyable things about databases is that they generally try to separate how
data is represented internally (say on disk) from how it is used. To the point that it has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaggregated_storage">become the norm</a> to not even store the
data on the same hardware that is running the queries.</p>

<p>Data<em>bases</em> have gotten so good at this, that the term is almost misleading now. “Base”
suggests something rigid, without which the data would slip away. But the data is always
there, just bits on a nameless hard disk. The structure and the accessibility that a modern
database provides exist completely independently from that hard disk. That’s right –&nbsp;most
databases no longer have any data in them.</p>

<p><a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> is a database built for this age, and a particularly lovely
one at that.</p>

<p>Say you run a robotaxi service. And you’re maintaining a growing dataset of interesting ride
patterns in blob storage, that you’d like to understand better. The data is split into a
separate Parquet file for each day. How do you share that dataset with an analyst?</p>

<p>You could just mail them everything, but the dataset is getting way too big for that. Plus
it’d be out of date instantly. If this was a blogpost you would just send a link, but there
isn’t really a single thing to link to here. And sending someone a hundred links to raw
blobs in S3 can sour any working relationship.</p>

<p>Instead you whip up a little database, just for them:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Send
</span><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>"weird_rides.db"</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span><span>(</span><span>"""
    CREATE VIEW weird_rides
    AS SELECT pickup_at, dropoff_at, trip_distance, total_amount
    FROM 's3://robotaxi-inc/daily-ride-data/*.parquet'
    WHERE fare_amount &gt; 100 AND trip_distance &lt; 10.0
"""</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This produces a tiny file called <code>weird_rides.db</code>. It contains none of the actual data. What
it does contain are the above instructions for how to work with this pile of blobs, as if it
were a single table of relevant data points.</p>

<p>You publish this database file to blob storage as well, right next to your data. Now you
have a single thing to link to: <code>s3://robotaxi-inc/virtual-datasets/weird_rides.db</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of opening a web browser, the receipient of the link starts their own local DuckDB
session, and
<a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/network_cloud_storage/duckdb_over_https_or_s3">attaches</a> to
the referenced database.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Receive
</span><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>conn</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>()</span>
<span>conn</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span><span>(</span><span>"""
ATTACH 's3://robotaxi-inc/virtual-datasets/weird_rides.db'
AS rides_db (READ_ONLY)
"""</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>conn</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span><span>(</span><span>"SELECT * FROM rides_db.weird_rides LIMIT 5"</span><span>)</span>
<span># ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┐

<p>This query is the first time that any data has to be downloaded from S3. DuckDB supports
<a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/data/parquet/overview.html#partial-reading">partial reading</a>, which
means that only the columns used in the definition of the <code>weird_rides</code> view have to be
fetched, and that filters like <code>fare_amount &gt; 100</code> can be used to discard even more
irrelevant data during the download.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the receiver, this way of accessing the data will remain working
unchanged, almost no matter what happens to the underlying data. Changes in
<a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json/overview">format</a>, different <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/data/multiple_files/overview#parquet">partitioning
strategies</a>, schema changes
–&nbsp;through all of it the receiver’s view remains the same.</p>

<p>With DuckDB as a browser for the data cloud, relational datasets are always just a hyperlink
away.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/blob/master/slip_scroll.gif"><img src="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/raw/master/slip_scroll.gif" alt="" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some properties of slipshow, in no specific orders:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fix some of the issues with slides by bringing back features of a blackboard presentation: keep some content while erasing the rest!</li>
<li>Easy to write and readable syntax (markdown with few extensions). What you see is what you mean!</li>
<li>Open the possibility for a more dynamic presentation, with annotations and animations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Slipshow compiles files written in an extension of markdown, to a standalone html file viewable offline in any web browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to see it in action, go to the <a href="#examples">example section</a>. If you want to start writing your presentation, go to <a href="#quick-start">Quick start</a>. Click for the <a href="#tutorial-api-documentation">full documentation and API</a>, or continue reading to know more about this project!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The issue with traditional slides</h2><a id="user-content-the-issue-with-traditional-slides" aria-label="Permalink: The issue with traditional slides" href="#the-issue-with-traditional-slides"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When using traditional slides, you are given a rectangle of white space to express your thought. When this rectangle is full, you have no other choice than erasing everything, and start again with a new white rectangle.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can be a problem both for the viewer and the presenter. If the viewer took some time understanding the beginning of the slide, they might miss the last part of a slide: everything will be erased before they have a chance to read it and catch up. And indeed, there is an obvious asymetry: the last part of a slide will be visible much shorter than the first part!</p>
<p dir="auto">The presenter might want to show three information (<code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>), each requiring the previous one to be visible on screen. However, all three information might not fit in one screen! When the first two are visible, it is necessary to... start again with a fresh slide, while we would like to keep information <code>2</code> visible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, for many kind of presentation, with very few content in the slide, this is not a problem at all. However, for some of them, it can be quite an issue! Having had many courses on various technical subjects (mostly math and computer science), I can see how slides degraded the experience from a blackboard presentation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of starting of with a fresh slide, a slipshow presentation "scrolls down" to reveal new space usable by the presenter, without hiding everything. This is much closer to what happens with a blackboard: the presenter can erase half of it, and continue with the new free space! And a viewer a little bit late still has a chance to catch up, since half of the information is still there.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find several example of slip presentation, from different versions of slip. As they were from early stage of developpement, looking at the source code can be helpful but many things may have changed. Only the official example, tutorial and documentation are kept up to date.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://choum.net/panglesd/slides/slides-js/slides.html" rel="nofollow">The slips of my thesis</a>, the very first presentation that used (a very early version of) slipshow,</li>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">Use the arrows to navigate in the presentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tutorial, API and Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-tutorial-api-and-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Tutorial, API and Documentation" href="#tutorial-api-and-documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find an extensive documentation, with a tutorial at the readthedocs <a href="https://slipshow.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">For using slipshow offline, you'll need to install the slipshow tool. Currently, there are several ways to get it. The best is to download the precompiled binary from the <a href="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/releases/latest">latest release</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Slipshow is also package in some package manager:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# For opam users. TODO: Update once it has been released to opam.
$ opam pin slipshow git@github.com/panglesd/slipshow.git

# For npm users
$ npm install -g slipshow"><pre><span><span>#</span> For opam users. TODO: Update once it has been released to opam.</span>
$ opam pin slipshow git@github.com/panglesd/slipshow.git

<span><span>#</span> For npm users</span>
$ npm install -g slipshow</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, you can use the <code>slipshow</code> binary to compile a <code>.md</code> file to a slipshow presentation:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Compile file.md into file.html:
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md

# Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling:
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md --watch

# Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling and hot-reloadind the opened presentation:

<span><span>#</span> Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling and hot-reloadind the opened presentation:</span>

<p><b>Analysis: Organisations that impose return-to-office mandates face the catastrophic possibility of losing their most valuable workers</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> pandemic upended the workplace in many surprising ways. Many organisations were forced to abandon the traditional arrangement of having employees come to the office five days a week in favour of a variety of schemes for <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0216/1408426-learning-on-the-job-remote-working/">remote work</a> or working from home.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, remote workers appear to <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4110598-remote-employees-work-longer-and-harder-studies-show/">work harder and more productively</a> than workers in traditional offices. Remote workers were not only more productive they were <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">more satisfied</a> with remote work than they had been with working in a traditional office. This finding is not unexpected. Once you let workers do away with the commute to and from the office, office politics, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0410/1442669-workplace-bullying-harrassment-toxic-behaviour-bystanders/">workplace bullying</a>, boring meetings, the need to wear and take care of business suits and other costly and often uncomfortable attire, you should not be surprised that they will feel happier.</p>
<p>Since the end of the pandemic, there has been a growing push to encourage, and sometimes compel workers to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0115/1426497-survey-remote-working/">return to the office</a>. This movement has become so widespread that it has generated the acronym RTO, or Return to the Office. As I have noted in <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2023/0904/1402957-offices-workers-bosses-managers-executives-psychology/">earlier columns</a>, the rationale for RTO mandates is often murky, and it is hard to resist the conclusion that the push to get people back to the office is in part an effort to reduce the embarrassment of executives sitting in near-empty office buildings (building they often purchased or built) with <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0319/1438645-middle-managers-job-role-organisations-workplace/">nobody to manage</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>From RTÉ Radio 1's The Business, Is your boss watching you?</b></i></p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that RTO mandates can be counterproductive. In particular, several organisations that have attempted to coerce workers back to the office have found that they are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/12/rto-microsoft-apple-spacex">losing experienced managers</a> and top performers at disproportionate rates. The dynamic here is clear, and potentially alarming. Organisations that impose RTO mandates face the possibility of losing their most valuable workers. Turnover is often costly for organisations, but turnover of your most experienced and most valuable workers can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>I believe the pandemic shook things up in the world of work in ways that are still poorly understood. The great political philosopher Edmund Burke noted that "custom reconciles us to every thing", and I think this applies to all sorts of workplace norms and practices. If we were used to the way things were done in organisations, we were willing to put up with all sorts of organisational policies that were burdensome (e.g., dress codes) or even abusive (e.g., the expectation that we should work beyond normal working hours if asked to do this.)</p>

<p>A year or two away from the office has opened a lot of eyes, and things that were once widely accepted (e.g., office politics) are now barely tolerated, if they are accepted at all. More important, time away from the office seems to have upset the traditional balance of power between employers and employees. Once you realise that you do not need the office and that you do not need to be tightly monitored or supervised, it is hard to go back.</p>
<p>Some employees, of course, <i>do</i> go back. First, there are some employees who believe that being in the office will benefit their careers. They are probably right; workers who return to the office are more likely to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/ceos-data-agree-workers-promotion-office-4-days-week.html">receive promotions</a>.<i> </i>Whether organisations <i>should</i> promote the careerists who come back to the office in hopes that their loyalty (or submissiveness to RTO mandates) will win them promotions that their performance and effectiveness would not, is an open question. Second, there are employees who are <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0304/1435778-bad-jobs-workplace-change-inertia-organisations/">trapped in their jobs</a>, either because of family or community obligations or because they lack the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0108/1411961-ireland-2024-upskilling-reskilling-training-courses-new-jobs-career-development/">skills, knowledge, and abilities</a> to move to other jobs. Executives who force RTO mandates down the throats of their employees run the risk of changing their organisation into a set of lapdog careerists and people who are stuck working for you, and it is hard to believe that this will benefit their organisation.</p>
<h2><b>Read more: <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0115/1426555-coffee-badging-return-to-office-work-from-home-employers-employees/">Is 'coffee badging' the new return to office/work from home trend?</a></b></h2>
<p>Executives who are pushing employees to come back to the office are most likely to succeed if they can make a convincing case for <i>why </i>coming back to the office benefits employees and the organisation. The typical explanation that coming back to the office is important for the culture of the organisation is unfounded at best, and hogwash at worse. Second, the carrot works better than the stick. If you want employees to come back to the office, recognise that this comes at considerable costs to employees and give them incentives that more than offset these costs.</p>
<p>It is time for executives to recognise that the old power balance is unlikely to come back, and that mandates from on high that don't seem to make sense or that impose significant costs on employees will not be accepted by employees who have the skills, knowledge, experience, and abilities that give them ample opportunities to seek employment elsewhere. The RTO movement has, in the end, provided opportunities to executives who are smart enough and willing enough to read the new world of work to poach talent from their competitors. If this trend continues, we could see the old breed of all-powerful executives push themselves toward extinction. I can hardly wait!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On November 17th, 2023, OpenAI’s board shocked everyone by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired">suddenly ousting</a> co-founder and CEO Sam Altman. </p><p>He had been overseeing one of the fastest-growing app launches in history with ChatGPT, so what happened? Former board member Helen Toner is filling in blank spaces in an interview on <a href="https://www.ted.com/podcasts/the-ted-ai-show"><em>The TED AI Show</em></a> podcast, providing her perspective on the events that caused board members to stop trusting Altman, as well as how he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094885/openai-sam-altman-investigation-board-results">eventually returned</a>. </p><p>In her telling, once the board decided they needed to bring in a new CEO, they felt the only way to make it happen was to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984818/openai-microsoft-altman-nadella-firing-newyorker">go behind his back.</a> “[I]t was very clear to all of us that as soon as Sam had any inkling that we might do something that went against him, he would pull out all the stops, do everything in his power to undermine the board, to prevent us from even getting to the point of being able to fire him,” Toner said.</p><p>Toner says that one reason the board stopped trusting Altman was his failure to tell the board that he owned the OpenAI Startup Fund; another was how he gave inaccurate info about the company’s safety processes “on multiple occasions.” Additionally, Toner says she was personally targeted by the CEO after she published a research paper that angered him. “Sam started lying to other board members in order to try and push me off the board,” she says.</p><p>After two executives spoke directly to the board about their own experiences with Altman, describing a toxic atmosphere at OpenAI, accusing him of “psychological abuse,” and providing evidence of Altman “lying and being manipulative in different situations,” the board finally made its move.</p><p>Toner cites the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23488017/openai-chatbot-chatgpt-ai-examples-web-demo">launch of ChatGPT</a> itself as an example of how the board didn’t have real oversight over the company. “[W]hen ChatGPT came out November 2022, the board was not informed in advance. We learned about ChatGPT on Twitter,” says Toner.</p><div><p>The podcast doesn’t go into the details of what happened in the days following Altman’s firing. OpenAI rapidly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23968848/openai-new-ceo-emmett-shear-twitch-co-founder-hiring">shuffled through</a> interim CEOs, employees <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028">including at least one of the board members who fired Altman</a> pushed for his return, and OpenAI’s lead investor, Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984818/openai-microsoft-altman-nadella-firing-newyorker">put its support behind Altman</a>, too. </p></div><p>However, Toner points out three reasons she believes the pressure to restore Altman was so strong. She claims employees were presented with only two options about how things could go (ditching the board to restore Altman or seeing the company destroyed), and since people didn’t want the company to fall apart, they supported the other one. She also says many people were scared of going against Altman after watching him retaliate against others.</p><p>Her last reason is Altman’s track record prior to OpenAI:</p><div><blockquote><p>And I guess the last thing I would say about this is that this actually isn’t a new problem for Sam. And if you look at some of the reporting that that has come out since November. It’s come out that he was actually fired from his previous job at Y Combinator, which was hushed up at the time. And then at, you know, his job before that, which was his only other job in Silicon Valley, his startup Loopt, apparently the management team went to the board there twice and asked the board to fire him for what they called deceptive and chaotic behavior. If you actually look at his track record, he doesn’t exactly have a glowing trail of references. This wasn’t a problem specific to the personalities on the board, as much as he would love to portray it that way.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>The podcast also includes a response from current OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor:</p><div><blockquote><p>We are disappointed that Ms. Toner continues to revisit these issues. An independent committee of the board worked with the law firm Wilmer Hale, to conduct an extensive review of the events of November. The review concluded that the prior board’s decision was not based on concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners. Additionally, over 95 percent of employees, including senior leadership, asked for Sam’s reinstatement as CEO and the resignation of the prior board. Our focus remains on moving forward and pursuing OpenAI’s mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></description>

One said it was in effect “on the shelf” – but Khan’s office disputes this and says it established a dedicated investigative team to take the inquiry forward.</p><p>In Israel, the government’s top lawyers regarded Khan – who had previously defended warlords such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/audio/2009/jul/15/charles-taylor-war-crimes-liberia-hague-icc" data-link-name="in body link">former Liberian president Charles Taylor</a> – as a more cautious prosecutor than Bensouda. One former senior Israeli official said there was “lots of respect” for Khan, unlike for his predecessor. His appointment to the court was viewed as a “reason for optimism”, they said, but they added that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/10/law-israel-hamas-international-criminal-court-icc" data-link-name="in body link">7 October attack “changed that reality”</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/israel-darkest-day-24-hours-of-terror-hamas-gaza" data-link-name="in body link">Hamas assault on southern Israel</a>, in which Palestinian militants killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped about 250 people, clearly involved brazen war crimes. So, too, in the view of many legal experts, has Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/25/call-to-prosecute-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-exposes-the-wests-moral-doublethink" data-link-name="in body link">subsequent onslaught on Gaza</a>, which is estimated to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/12/fierce-battles-in-gaza-as-israeli-forces-attack-hamas-militants" data-link-name="in body link">killed more than 35,000 people</a> and brought the territory to the brink of famine through Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/israeli-soldiers-and-police-tipping-off-groups-that-attack-gaza-aid-trucks" data-link-name="in body link">obstruction of humanitarian aid</a>.</p><p>By the end of the third week of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, Khan was on the ground at the Rafah border crossing. He subsequently made visits to the West Bank and southern Israel, where he was invited to meet survivors of the 7 October attack and the relatives of people who had been killed.</p><p>In February 2024, Khan issued a strongly worded statement that Netanyahu’s legal advisers interpreted as an ominous sign. In the post on X, he in effect warned Israel against launching an assault on Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, where more than 1 million displaced people were sheltering at the time.</p><p>“I am deeply concerned by the reported bombardment and potential ground incursion by Israeli forces in Rafah,” he wrote. “Those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my office takes action.”</p><figure id="36c24e20-8592-4e44-85f9-a7273b1a9c4e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-14"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Children standing amid the rubble of a building" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35342755a297f784784f3bda3a96e123a5e8f67f/0_508_7619_4574/master/7619.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.1518571991075" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Children standing amid the rubble of a building in Rafah that was destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in February.</span> Photograph: Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The comments stirred alarm within the Israeli government as they appeared to deviate from his previous statements about the war, which officials had viewed as reassuringly cautious. “That tweet surprised us a lot,” a senior official said.</p><p>Concerns in Israel over Khan’s intentions escalated last month when the government briefed the media that it believed the prosecutor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-concerned-over-possible-icc-arrest-warrants-related-gaza-war-2024-04-29/" data-link-name="in body link">was contemplating arrest warrants</a> against Netanyahu and other senior officials such as Yoav Gallant.</p><p>Israeli intelligence had intercepted emails, attachments and text messages from Khan and other officials in his office. “The subject of the ICC climbed the ladder of priorities for Israeli intelligence,” one intelligence source said.</p><p>It was via intercepted communications that Israel established that Khan was at one stage considering entering Gaza through Egypt and wanted urgent assistance doing so “without Israel’s permission”.</p><p>Another Israeli intelligence assessment, circulated widely in the intelligence community, drew on surveillance of a call between two Palestinian politicians. One of them said Khan had indicated that a request for arrest warrants of Israeli leaders could be imminent, but warned he was “under tremendous pressure from the United States”.</p><p>It was against this backdrop that Netanyahu made a series of public statements warning a request for arrest warrants could be imminent.

An ICC spokesperson said Khan’s office had been subjected to “several forms of threats and communications that could be viewed as attempts to unduly influence its activities”.</p><p>Khan recently disclosed in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/20/middleeast/icc-israel-hamas-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-intl/index.html" data-link-name="in body link">an interview with CNN</a> that some elected leaders had been “very blunt” with him as he prepared to issue arrest warrants. “‘This court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin,’ is was what a senior leader told me.”</p><p>Despite the pressure, Khan, like his predecessor in the prosecutor’s office, chose to press ahead. Last week, Khan announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant alongside three Hamas leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>He said Israel’s prime minister and defence minister stood accused of responsibility for extermination, starvation, the denial of humanitarian relief supplies and deliberate targeting of civilians.</p><p>Standing at a lectern with two of his top prosecutors – one American, the other British – at his side, Khan said he had repeatedly told Israel to take urgent action to comply with humanitarian law.</p><p>“I specifically underlined that starvation as a method of war and the denial of humanitarian relief constitute Rome statute offences. I could not have been clearer,” he said. “As I also repeatedly underlined in my public statements, those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my office takes action. That day has come.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>It’s an exciting time to build with large language models (LLMs). Over the past year, LLMs have become “good enough” for real-world applications. The pace of improvements in LLMs, coupled with a parade of demos on social media, will fuel an estimated $200B investment in AI by 2025. LLMs are also broadly accessible, allowing everyone, not just ML engineers and scientists, to build intelligence into their products. While the barrier to entry for building AI products has been lowered, creating those effective beyond a demo remains a deceptively difficult endeavor.</p>



<p>We’ve identified some crucial, yet often neglected, lessons and methodologies informed by machine learning that are essential for developing products based on LLMs. Awareness of these concepts can give you a competitive advantage against most others in the field without requiring ML expertise! Over the past year, the six of us have been building real-world applications on top of LLMs. We realized that there was a need to distill these lessons in one place for the benefit of the community.</p>



<p>We come from a variety of backgrounds and serve in different roles, but we’ve all experienced firsthand the challenges that come with using this new technology. Two of us are independent consultants who’ve helped numerous clients take LLM projects from initial concept to successful product, seeing the patterns determining success or failure. One of us is a researcher studying how ML/AI teams work and how to improve their workflows. Two of us are leaders on applied AI teams: one at a tech giant and one at a startup. Finally, one of us has taught deep learning to thousands and now works on making AI tooling and infrastructure easier to use. Despite our different experiences, we were struck by the consistent themes in the lessons we’ve learned, and we’re surprised that these insights aren’t more widely discussed.</p>



<p>Our goal is to make this a practical guide to building successful products around LLMs, drawing from our own experiences and pointing to examples from around the industry. We’ve spent the past year getting our hands dirty and gaining valuable lessons, often the hard way. While we don’t claim to speak for the entire industry, here we share some advice and lessons for anyone building products with LLMs.</p>



<p>This work is organized into three sections: tactical, operational, and strategic. This is the first of three pieces. It dives into the tactical nuts and bolts of working with LLMs. We share best practices and common pitfalls around prompting, setting up retrieval-augmented generation, applying flow engineering, and evaluation and monitoring. Whether you’re a practitioner building with LLMs or a hacker working on weekend projects, this section was written for you. Look out for the operational and strategic sections in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Ready to <s>dive</s> delve in? Let’s go.</p>



<h2><strong>Tactical</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we share best practices for the core components of the emerging LLM stack: prompting tips to improve quality and reliability, evaluation strategies to assess output, retrieval-augmented generation ideas to improve grounding, and more. We also explore how to design human-in-the-loop workflows. While the technology is still rapidly developing, we hope these lessons, the by-product of countless experiments we’ve collectively run, will stand the test of time and help you build and ship robust LLM applications.</p>



<h3><strong>Prompting</strong></h3>



<p>We recommend starting with prompting when developing new applications. It’s easy to both underestimate <em>and</em> overestimate its importance. It’s underestimated because the right prompting techniques, when used correctly, can get us very far. It’s overestimated because even prompt-based applications require significant engineering around the prompt to work well.</p>



<h4><strong>Focus on getting the most out of fundamental prompting techniques</strong></h4>



<p>A few prompting techniques have consistently helped improve performance across various models and tasks: n-shot prompts + in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and providing relevant resources.</p>



<p>The idea of in-context learning via n-shot prompts is to provide the LLM with a few examples that demonstrate the task and align outputs to our expectations. A few tips: </p>



<ul><li>If n is too low, the model may over-anchor on those specific examples, hurting its ability to generalize. As a rule of thumb, aim for n ≥ 5. Don’t be afraid to go as high as a few dozen.</li><li>Examples should be representative of the expected input distribution. If you’re building a movie summarizer, include samples from different genres in roughly the proportion you expect to see in practice.</li><li>You don’t necessarily need to provide the full input-output pairs. In many cases, examples of desired outputs are sufficient.</li><li>If you are using an LLM that supports tool use, your n-shot examples should also use the tools you want the agent to use.</li></ul>



<p>In chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, we encourage the LLM to explain its thought process before returning the final answer. Think of it as providing the LLM with a sketchpad so it doesn’t have to do it all in memory. The original approach was to simply add the phrase “Let’s think step-by-step” as part of the instructions. However, we’ve found it helpful to make the CoT more specific, where adding specificity via an extra sentence or two often reduces hallucination rates significantly. For example, when asking an LLM to summarize a meeting transcript, we can be explicit about the steps, such as:</p>



<ul><li>First, list the key decisions, follow-up items, and associated owners in a sketchpad.</li><li>Then, check that the details in the sketchpad are factually consistent with the transcript.</li><li>Finally, synthesize the key points into a concise summary.</li></ul>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">some doubt</a> has been cast on whether this technique is as powerful as believed. Additionally, there’s significant debate about exactly what happens during inference when chain-of-thought is used. Regardless, this technique is one to experiment with when possible.</p>



<p>Providing relevant resources is a powerful mechanism to expand the model’s knowledge base, reduce hallucinations, and increase the user’s trust. Often accomplished via retrieval augmented generation (RAG), providing the model with snippets of text that it can directly utilize in its response is an essential technique. When providing the relevant resources, it’s not enough to merely include them; don’t forget to tell the model to prioritize their use, refer to them directly, and sometimes to mention when none of the resources are sufficient. These help “ground” agent responses to a corpus of resources. </p>



<h4><strong>Structure your inputs and outputs</strong></h4>



<p>Structured input and output help models better understand the input as well as return output that can reliably integrate with downstream systems. Adding serialization formatting to your inputs can help provide more clues to the model as to the relationships between tokens in the context, additional metadata to specific tokens (like types), or relate the request to similar examples in the model’s training data. </p>



<p>As an example, many questions on the internet about writing SQL begin by specifying the SQL schema. Thus, you may expect that effective prompting for Text-to-SQL should include structured schema definitions; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371223615_SQL-PaLM_Improved_Large_Language_ModelAdaptation_for_Text-to-SQL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="indeed (opens in a new tab)">indeed</a>.</p>



<p>Structured output serves a similar purpose, but it also simplifies integration into downstream components of your system. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instructor (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/jxnl/instructor" target="_blank">Instructor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Outlines</a> work well for structured output. (If you’re importing an LLM API SDK, use Instructor; if you’re importing Huggingface for a self-hosted model, use Outlines.) Structured input expresses tasks clearly and resembles how the training data is formatted, increasing the probability of better output.</p>



<p>When using structured input, be aware that each LLM family has their own preferences. Claude prefers <code>xml</code> while GPT favors Markdown and JSON. With XML, you can even pre-fill Claude’s responses by providing a <code>response</code> tag like so.</p>



<pre>                                                     <code>&lt;/&gt; python
messages=[     
    {         
        "role": "user",         
        "content": """Extract the &lt;name&gt;, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;price&gt;, and &lt;color&gt; </code>

   },     
   {

        "content": "&lt;response&gt;&lt;name&gt;"     
   } 
]</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Have small prompts that do one thing, and only one thing, well</strong></h4>



<p>A common anti-pattern/code smell in software is the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="God Object (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object" target="_blank">God Object</a>,” where we have a single class or function that does everything. The same applies to prompts too.</p>



<p>A prompt typically starts simple: A few sentences of instruction, a couple of examples, and we’re good to go. But as we try to improve performance and handle more edge cases, complexity creeps in. More instructions. Multi-step reasoning. Dozens of examples. Before we know it, our initially simple prompt is now a 2,000 token frankenstein. And to add injury to insult, it has worse performance on the more common and straightforward inputs! GoDaddy shared this challenge as their <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/llm-from-the-trenches-10-lessons-learned-operationalizing-models-at-godaddy#h-1-sometimes-one-prompt-isn-t-enough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="No. 1 lesson from building with LLMs (opens in a new tab)">No. 1 lesson from building with LLMs</a>.</p>



<p>Just like how we strive (read: struggle) to keep our systems and code simple, so should we for our prompts. Instead of having a single, catch-all prompt for the meeting transcript summarizer, we can break it into steps to:</p>



<ul><li>Extract key decisions, action items, and owners into structured format</li><li>Check extracted details against the original transcription for consistency</li><li>Generate a concise summary from the structured details</li></ul>



<p>As a result, we’ve split our single prompt into multiple prompts that are each simple, focused, and easy to understand. And by breaking them up, we can now iterate and eval each prompt individually.</p>



<h4><strong>Craft your context tokens</strong></h4>



<p>Rethink, and challenge your assumptions about how much context you actually need to send to the agent. Be like Michaelangelo, do not build up your context sculpture—chisel away the superfluous material until the sculpture is revealed. RAG is a popular way to collate all of the potentially relevant blocks of marble, but what are you doing to extract what’s necessary?</p>



<p>We’ve found that taking the final prompt sent to the model—with all of the context construction, and meta-prompting, and RAG results—putting it on a blank page and just reading it, really helps you rethink your context. We have found redundancy, self-contradictory language, and poor formatting using this method. </p>



<p>The other key optimization is the structure of your context. Your bag-of-docs representation isn’t helpful for humans, don’t assume it’s any good for agents. Think carefully about how you structure your context to underscore the relationships between parts of it, and make extraction as simple as possible.</p>



<h3><strong>Information Retrieval/RAG</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond prompting, another effective way to steer an LLM is by providing knowledge as part of the prompt. This grounds the LLM on the provided context which is then used for in-context learning. This is known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Practitioners have found RAG effective at providing knowledge and improving output, while requiring far less effort and cost compared to finetuning.RAG is only as good as the retrieved documents’ relevance, density, and detail</p>



<h4><strong>The quality of your RAG’s output is dependent on the quality of retrieved documents, which in turn can be considered along a few factors.</strong></h4>



<p>The first and most obvious metric is relevance. This is typically quantified via ranking metrics such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank" target="_blank">Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (opens in a new tab)">Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)</a>. MRR evaluates how well a system places the first relevant result in a ranked list while NDCG considers the relevance of all the results and their positions. They measure how good the system is at ranking relevant documents higher and irrelevant documents lower. For example, if we’re retrieving user summaries to generate movie review summaries, we’ll want to rank reviews for the specific movie higher while excluding reviews for other movies.</p>



<p>Like traditional recommendation systems, the rank of retrieved items will have a significant impact on how the LLM performs on downstream tasks. To measure the impact, run a RAG-based task but with the retrieved items shuffled—how does the RAG output perform?</p>



<p>Second, we also want to consider information density. If two documents are equally relevant, we should prefer one that’s more concise and has lesser extraneous details. Returning to our movie example, we might consider the movie transcript and all user reviews to be relevant in a broad sense. Nonetheless, the top-rated reviews and editorial reviews will likely be more dense in information.</p>



<p>Finally, consider the level of detail provided in the document. Imagine we’re building a RAG system to generate SQL queries from natural language. We could simply provide table schemas with column names as context. But, what if we include column descriptions and some representative values? The additional detail could help the LLM better understand the semantics of the table and thus generate more correct SQL.</p>



<h4><strong>Don’t forget keyword search; use it as a baseline and in hybrid search.</strong></h4>



<p>Given how prevalent the embedding-based RAG demo is, it’s easy to forget or overlook the decades of research and solutions in information retrieval.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, while embeddings are undoubtedly a powerful tool, they are not the be all and end all. First, while they excel at capturing high-level semantic similarity, they may struggle with more specific, keyword-based queries, like when users search for names (e.g., Ilya), acronyms (e.g., RAG), or IDs (e.g., claude-3-sonnet). Keyword-based search, such as BM25, are explicitly designed for this. And after years of keyword-based search, users have likely taken it for granted and may get frustrated if the document they expect to retrieve isn’t being returned. </p>



<blockquote><p>Vector embeddings <em>do not</em> magically solve search. In fact, the heavy lifting is in the step before you re-rank with semantic similarity search. Making a genuine improvement over BM25 or full-text search is hard. </p><cite>— <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1737886080555446552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Aravind Srinivas, CEO Perplexity.ai</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We’ve been communicating this to our customers and partners for months now. Nearest Neighbor Search with naive embeddings yields very noisy results and you’re likely better off starting with a keyword-based approach.</p><cite>— <a href="https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1767330006999720318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Beyang Liu, CTO Sourcegraph</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Second, it’s more straightforward to understand why a document was retrieved with keyword search—we can look at the keywords that match the query. In contrast, embedding-based retrieval is less interpretable. Finally, thanks to systems like Lucene and OpenSearch that have been optimized and battle-tested over decades, keyword search is usually more computationally efficient.</p>



<p>In most cases, a hybrid will work best: keyword matching for the obvious matches, and embeddings for synonyms, hypernyms, and spelling errors, as well as multimodality (e.g., images and text). <a href="https://www.shortwave.com/blog/deep-dive-into-worlds-smartest-email-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Shortwave shared how they built their RAG pipeline (opens in a new tab)">Shortwave shared how they built their RAG pipeline</a>, including query rewriting, keyword + embedding retrieval, and ranking.</p>



<h4><strong>Prefer RAG over fine-tuning for new knowledge</strong></h4>



<p>Both RAG and fine-tuning can be used to incorporate new information into LLMs and increase performance on specific tasks. Thus, which should we try first?</p>



<p>Recent research suggests that RAG may have an edge. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="One study (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05934" target="_blank">One study</a> compared RAG against unsupervised fine-tuning (a.k.a. continued pre-training), evaluating both on a subset of MMLU and current events. They found that RAG consistently outperformed fine-tuning for knowledge encountered during training as well as entirely new knowledge. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="another paper (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08406" target="_blank">another paper</a>, they compared RAG against supervised fine-tuning on an agricultural dataset. Similarly, the performance boost from RAG was greater than fine-tuning, especially for GPT-4 (see Table 20 of the paper).</p>



<p>Beyond improved performance, RAG comes with several practical advantages too. First, compared to continuous pretraining or fine-tuning, it’s easier—and cheaper!—to keep retrieval indices up-to-date. Second, if our retrieval indices have problematic documents that contain toxic or biased content, we can easily drop or modify the offending documents.</p>



<p>In addition, the R in RAG provides finer grained control over how we retrieve documents. For example, if we’re hosting a RAG system for multiple organizations, by partitioning the retrieval indices, we can ensure that each organization can only retrieve documents from their own index. This ensures that we don’t inadvertently expose information from one organization to another.</p>



<h4><strong>Long-context models won’t make RAG obsolete</strong></h4>



<p>With Gemini 1.5 providing context windows of up to 10M tokens in size, some have begun to question the future of RAG. </p>



<blockquote><p>I tend to believe that Gemini 1.5 is significantly overhyped by Sora. A context window of 10M tokens effectively makes most of existing RAG frameworks unnecessary—you simply put whatever your data into the context and talk to the model like usual. Imagine how it does to all the startups/agents/LangChain projects where most of the engineering efforts goes to RAG 😅 Or in one sentence: the 10m context kills RAG. Nice work Gemini.</p><cite>— <a href="https://x.com/Francis_YAO_/status/1758935954189115714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Yao Fu</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>While it’s true that long contexts will be a game-changer for use cases such as analyzing multiple documents or chatting with PDFs, the rumors of RAG’s demise are greatly exaggerated.</p>



<p>First, even with a context window of 10M tokens, we’d still need a way to select information to feed into the model. Second, beyond the narrow needle-in-a-haystack eval, we’ve yet to see convincing data that models can effectively reason over such a large context. Thus, without good retrieval (and ranking), we risk overwhelming the model with distractors, or may even fill the context window with completely irrelevant information.</p>



<p>Finally, there’s cost. The Transformer’s inference cost scales quadratically (or linearly in both space and time) with context length. Just because there exists a model that could read your organization’s entire Google Drive contents before answering each question doesn’t mean that’s a good idea. Consider an analogy to how we use RAM: we still read and write from disk, even though there exist compute instances with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/high-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="RAM running into the tens of terabytes (opens in a new tab)">RAM running into the tens of terabytes</a>.</p>



<p>So don’t throw your RAGs in the trash just yet. This pattern will remain useful even as context windows grow in size.</p>



<h3><strong>Tuning and optimizing workflows</strong></h3>



<p>Prompting an LLM is just the beginning. To get the most juice out of them, we need to think beyond a single prompt and embrace workflows. For example, how could we split a single complex task into multiple simpler tasks? When is finetuning or caching helpful with increasing performance and reducing latency/cost? In this section, we share proven strategies and real-world examples to help you optimize and build reliable LLM workflows.</p>



<h4><strong>Step-by-step, multi-turn “flows” can give large boosts.</strong></h4>



<p>We already know that by decomposing a single big prompt into multiple smaller prompts, we can achieve better results. An example of this is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AlphaCodium (opens in a new tab)">AlphaCodium</a>: By switching from a single prompt to a multi-step workflow, they increased GPT-4 accuracy (pass@5) on CodeContests from 19% to 44%. The workflow includes:</p>



<ul><li>Reflecting on the problem</li><li>Reasoning on the public tests</li><li>Generating possible solutions</li><li>Ranking possible solutions</li><li>Generating synthetic tests</li><li>Iterating on the solutions on public and synthetic tests.</li></ul>



<p>Small tasks with clear objectives make for the best agent or flow prompts. It’s not required that every agent prompt requests structured output, but structured outputs help a lot to interface with whatever system is orchestrating the agent’s interactions with the environment.</p>



<p>Some things to try</p>



<ul><li>An explicit planning step, as tightly specified as possible. Consider having predefined plans to choose from (c.f. https://youtu.be/hGXhFa3gzBs?si=gNEGYzux6TuB1del).</li><li>Rewriting the original user prompts into agent prompts. Be careful, this process is lossy!</li><li>Agent behaviors as linear chains, DAGs, and State-Machines; different dependency and logic relationships can be more and less appropriate for different scales. Can you squeeze performance optimization out of different task architectures?</li><li>Planning validations; your planning can include instructions on how to evaluate the responses from other agents to make sure the final assembly works well together.</li><li>Prompt engineering with fixed upstream state—make sure your agent prompts are evaluated against a collection of variants of what may happen before.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Prioritize deterministic workflows for now</strong></h4>



<p>While AI agents can dynamically react to user requests and the environment, their non-deterministic nature makes them a challenge to deploy. Each step an agent takes has a chance of failing, and the chances of recovering from the error are poor. Thus, the likelihood that an agent completes a multi-step task successfully decreases exponentially as the number of steps increases. As a result, teams building agents find it difficult to deploy reliable agents.</p>



<p>A promising approach is to have agent systems that produce deterministic plans which are then executed in a structured, reproducible way. In the first step, given a high-level goal or prompt, the agent generates a plan. Then, the plan is executed deterministically. This allows each step to be more predictable and reliable. Benefits include:</p>



<ul><li>Generated plans can serve as few-shot samples to prompt or finetune an agent.</li><li>Deterministic execution makes the system more reliable, and thus easier to test and debug. Furthermore, failures can be traced to the specific steps in the plan.</li><li>Generated plans can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) which are easier, relative to a static prompt, to understand and adapt to new situations.</li></ul>



<p>The most successful agent builders may be those with strong experience managing junior engineers because the process of generating plans is similar to how we instruct and manage juniors. We give juniors clear goals and concrete plans, instead of vague open-ended directions, and we should do the same for our agents too. </p>



<p>In the end, the key to reliable, working agents will likely be found in adopting more structured, deterministic approaches, as well as collecting data to refine prompts and finetune models. Without this, we’ll build agents that may work exceptionally well some of the time, but on average, disappoint users which leads to poor retention.</p>



<h4><strong>Getting more diverse outputs beyond temperature</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose your task requires diversity in an LLM’s output. Maybe you’re writing an LLM pipeline to suggest products to buy from your catalog given a list of products the user bought previously. When running your prompt multiple times, you might notice that the resulting recommendations are too similar—so you might increase the temperature parameter in your LLM requests.</p>



<p>Briefly, increasing the temperature parameter makes LLM responses more varied. At sampling time, the probability distributions of the next token become flatter, meaning that tokens which are usually less likely get chosen more often. Still, when increasing temperature, you may notice some failure modes related to output diversity. For example,Some products from the catalog that could be a good fit may never be output by the LLM.The same handful of products might be overrepresented in outputs, if they are highly likely to follow the prompt based on what the LLM has learned at training time.If the temperature is too high, you may get outputs that reference nonexistent products (or gibberish!)</p>



<p>In other words, increasing temperature does not guarantee that the LLM will sample outputs from the probability distribution you expect (e.g., uniform random). Nonetheless, we have other tricks to increase output diversity. The simplest way is to adjust elements within the prompt. For example, if the prompt template includes a list of items, such as historical purchases, shuffling the order of these items each time they’re inserted into the prompt can make a significant difference. </p>



<p>Additionally, keeping a short list of recent outputs can help prevent redundancy. In our recommended products example, by instructing the LLM to avoid suggesting items from this recent list, or by rejecting and resampling outputs that are similar to recent suggestions, we can further diversify the responses. Another effective strategy is to vary the phrasing used in the prompts. For instance, incorporating phrases like “pick an item that the user would love using regularly” or “select a product that the user would likely recommend to friends” can shift the focus and thereby influence the variety of recommended products.</p>



<h4><strong>Caching is underrated.</strong></h4>



<p>Caching saves cost and eliminates generation latency by removing the need to recompute responses for the same input. Furthermore, if a response has previously been guardrailed, we can serve these vetted responses and reduce the risk of serving harmful or inappropriate content.</p>



<p>One straightforward approach to caching is to use unique IDs for the items being processed, such as if we’re summarizing new articles or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/amazon-is-using-generative-ai-to-summarize-product-reviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="product reviews (opens in a new tab)">product reviews</a>. When a request comes in, we can check to see if a summary already exists in the cache. If so, we can return it immediately; if not, we generate, guardrail, and serve it, and then store it in the cache for future requests.</p>



<p>For more open-ended queries, we can borrow techniques from the field of search, which also leverages caching for open-ended inputs. Features like autocomplete and spelling correction also help normalize user input and thus increase the cache hit rate.</p>



<h4><strong>When to fine-tune</strong></h4>



<p>We may have some tasks where even the most cleverly designed prompts fall short. For example, even after significant prompt engineering, our system may still be a ways from returning reliable, high-quality output. If so, then it may be necessary to finetune a model for your specific task. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, while fine-tuning can be effective, it comes with significant costs. We have to annotate fine-tuning data, finetune and evaluate models, and eventually self-host them. Thus, consider if the higher upfront cost is worth it. If prompting gets you 90% of the way there, then fine-tuning may not be worth the investment. However, if we do decide to fine-tune, to reduce the cost of collecting human annotated data, we can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="generate and finetune on synthetic data (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/synthetic/" target="_blank">generate and finetune on synthetic data</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bootstrap on open-source data (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">bootstrap on open-source data</a>.</p>



<h3><strong> Evaluation &amp; Monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>Evaluating LLMs can be a minefield. The inputs and the outputs of LLMs are arbitrary text, and the tasks we set them to are varied. Nonetheless, rigorous and thoughtful evals are critical—it’s no coincidence that technical leaders at OpenAI <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work on evaluation and give feedback on individual evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1701692908074873036" target="_blank">work on evaluation and give feedback on individual evals</a>. </p>



<p>Evaluating LLM applications invites a diversity of definitions and reductions: it’s simply unit testing, or it’s more like observability, or maybe it’s just data science. We have found all of these perspectives useful. In the following section, we provide some lessons we’ve learned about what is important in building evals and monitoring pipelines.</p>



<h4><strong>Create a few assertion-based unit tests from real input/output samples</strong></h4>



<p>Create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="unit tests (i.e., assertions) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#level-1-unit-tests" target="_blank">unit tests (i.e., assertions)</a> consisting of samples of inputs and outputs from production, with expectations for outputs based on at least three criteria. While three criteria might seem arbitrary, it’s a practical number to start with; fewer might indicate that your task isn’t sufficiently defined or is too open-ended, like a general-purpose chatbot. These unit tests, or assertions, should be triggered by any changes to the pipeline, whether it’s editing a prompt, adding new context via RAG, or other modifications. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="write-up has an example (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#step-1-write-scoped-tests" target="_blank">write-up has an example</a> of an assertion-based test for an actual use case.</p>



<p>Consider beginning with assertions that specify phrases or ideas to either include or exclude in all responses. Also consider checks to ensure that word, item, or sentence counts lie within a range. For other kinds of generation, assertions can look different. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Execution-evaluation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Execution-Based-Evaluation-for-Open-Domain-Code-Wang-Zhou/1bed34f2c23b97fd18de359cf62cd92b3ba612c3" target="_blank">Execution-evaluation</a> is a powerful method for evaluating code-generation, wherein you run the generated code and determine that the state of runtime is sufficient for the user-request. </p>



<p>As an example, if the user asks for a new function named foo; then after executing the agent’s generated code, foo should be callable! One challenge in execution-evaluation is that the agent code frequently leaves the runtime in slightly different form than the target code. It can be effective to “relax” assertions to the absolute most weak assumptions that any viable answer would satisfy.</p>



<p>Finally, using your product as intended for customers (i.e., “dogfooding”) can provide insight into failure modes on real-world data. This approach not only helps identify potential weaknesses, but also provides a useful source of production samples that can be converted into evals.</p>



<h4><strong>LLM-as-Judge can work (somewhat), but it’s not a silver bullet</strong></h4>



<p>LLM-as-Judge, where we use a strong LLM to evaluate the output of other LLMs, has been met with skepticism by some. (Some of us were initially huge skeptics.) Nonetheless, when implemented well, LLM-as-Judge achieves decent correlation with human judgements, and can at least help build priors about how a new prompt or technique may perform. Specifically, when doing pairwise comparisons (e.g., control vs. treatment), LLM-as-Judge typically gets the direction right though the magnitude of the win/loss may be noisy.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions to get the most out of LLM-as-Judge:</p>



<ul><li>Use pairwise comparisons: Instead of asking the LLM to score a single output on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Likert (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert</a> scale, present it with two options and ask it to select the better one. This tends to lead to more stable results.</li><li>Control for position bias: The order of options presented can bias the LLM’s decision. To mitigate this, do each pairwise comparison twice, swapping the order of pairs each time. Just be sure to attribute wins to the right option after swapping!</li><li>Allow for ties: In some cases, both options may be equally good. Thus, allow the LLM to declare a tie so it doesn’t have to arbitrarily pick a winner.</li><li>Use Chain-of-Thought: Asking the LLM to explain its decision before giving a final preference can increase eval reliability. As a bonus, this allows you to use a weaker but faster LLM and still achieve similar results. Because frequently this part of the pipeline is in batch mode, the extra latency from CoT isn’t a problem.</li><li>Control for response length: LLMs tend to bias toward longer responses. To mitigate this, ensure response pairs are similar in length.</li></ul>



<p>One particularly powerful application of LLM-as-Judge is checking a new prompting strategy against regression. If you have tracked a collection of production results, sometimes you can rerun those production examples with a new prompting strategy, and use LLM-as-Judge to quickly assess where the new strategy may suffer.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#automated-evaluation-w-llms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">simple but effective approach</a> to iterate on LLM-as-Judge, where we simply log the LLM response, judge’s critique (i.e., CoT), and final outcome. They are then reviewed with stakeholders to identify areas for improvement. Over three iterations, agreement with human and LLM improved from 68% to 94%!</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Picture1.png" alt="" width="800" height="229"></figure>



<p>LLM-as-Judge is not a silver bullet though. There are subtle aspects of language where even the strongest models fail to evaluate reliably. In addition, we’ve found that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="conventional classifiers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">conventional classifiers</a> and reward models can achieve higher accuracy than LLM-as-Judge, and with lower cost and latency. For code generation, LLM-as-Judge can be weaker than more direct evaluation strategies like execution-evaluation.</p>



<h4><strong>The “intern test” for evaluating generations</strong></h4>



<p>We like to use the following “intern test” when evaluating generations: If you took the exact input to the language model, including the context, and gave it to an average college student in the relevant major as a task, could they succeed? How long would it take?</p>



<p>If the answer is no because the LLM lacks the required knowledge, consider ways to enrich the context.</p>



<p>If the answer is no and we simply can’t improve the context to fix it, then we may have hit a task that’s too hard for contemporary LLMs.</p>



<p>If the answer is yes, but it would take a while, we can try to reduce the complexity of the task. Is it decomposable? Are there aspects of the task that can be made more templatized?</p>



<p>If the answer is yes, they would get it quickly, then it’s time to dig into the data. What’s the model doing wrong? Can we find a pattern of failures? Try asking the model to explain itself before or after it responds, to help you build a theory of mind. </p>



<h4><strong>Overemphasizing certain evals can hurt overall performance</strong></h4>



<blockquote><p>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” </p><cite>— Goodhart’s Law</cite></blockquote>



<p>An example of this is the Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) eval. The original eval helped quantify model recall as context sizes grew, as well as how recall is affected by needle position. However, it’s been so overemphasized that it’s featured as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Figure 1 for Gemini 1.5's report (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530" target="_blank">Figure 1 for Gemini 1.5’s report</a>. The eval involves inserting a specific phrase (“The special magic {city} number is: {number}”) into a long document which repeats the essays of Paul Graham, and then prompting the model to recall the magic number.</p>



<p>While some models achieve near-perfect recall, it’s questionable whether NIAH truly reflects the reasoning and recall abilities needed in real-world applications. Consider a more practical scenario: Given the transcript of an hour-long meeting, can the LLM summarize the key decisions and next steps, as well as correctly attribute each item to the relevant person? This task is more realistic, going beyond rote memorization and also considering the ability to parse complex discussions, identify relevant information, and synthesize summaries.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="practical NIAH eval (opens in a new tab)" href="https://observablehq.com/@shreyashankar/needle-in-the-real-world-experiments" target="_blank">practical NIAH eval</a>. Using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="transcripts of doctor-patient video calls (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/wyim/aci-bench/tree/main/data/challenge_data" target="_blank">transcripts of doctor-patient video calls</a>, the LLM is queried about the patient’s medication. It also includes a more challenging NIAH, inserting a phrase for random ingredients for pizza toppings, such as “<em>The secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza are: Espresso-soaked dates, Lemon and Goat cheese.</em>” Recall was around 80% on the medication task and 30% on the pizza task.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Picture2.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Tangentially, an overemphasis on NIAH evals can lead to lower performance on extraction and summarization tasks. Because these LLMs are so finetuned to attend to every sentence, they may start to treat irrelevant details and distractors as important, thus including them in the final output (when they shouldn’t!)</p>



<p>This could also apply to other evals and use cases. For example, summarization. An emphasis on factual consistency could lead to summaries that are less specific (and thus less likely to be factually inconsistent) and possibly less relevant. Conversely, an emphasis on writing style and eloquence could lead to more flowery, marketing-type language that could introduce factual inconsistencies.</p>



<h4><strong>Simplify annotation to binary tasks or pairwise comparisons</strong></h4>



<p>Providing open-ended feedback or ratings for model output on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Likert scale (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert scale</a> is cognitively demanding. As a result, the data collected is more noisy—due to variability among human raters—and thus less useful. A more effective approach is to simplify the task and reduce the cognitive burden on annotators. Two tasks that work well are binary classifications and pairwise comparisons.</p>



<p>In binary classifications, annotators are asked to make a simple yes-or-no judgment on the model’s output. They might be asked whether the generated summary is factually consistent with the source document, or whether the proposed response is relevant, or if it contains toxicity. Compared to the Likert scale, binary decisions are more precise, have higher consistency among raters, and lead to higher throughput. This was how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Doordash setup their labeling queues (opens in a new tab)" href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/08/28/overcome-the-cold-start-problem-in-menu-item-tagging/" target="_blank">Doordash setup their labeling queues</a> for tagging menu items though a tree of yes-no questions.</p>



<p>In pairwise comparisons, the annotator is presented with a pair of model responses and asked which is better. Because it’s easier for humans to say “A is better than B” than to assign an individual score to either A or B individually, this leads to faster and more reliable annotations (over Likert scales). At a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Llama2 meetup (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzR3OrOkM9w" target="_blank">Llama2 meetup</a>, Thomas Scialom, an author on the Llama2 paper, confirmed that pairwise-comparisons were faster and cheaper than collecting supervised finetuning data such as written responses. The former’s cost is $3.5 per unit while the latter’s cost is $25 per unit.</p>



<p>If you’re starting to write labeling guidelines, here are some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="reference guidelines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/labeling-guidelines/" target="_blank">reference guidelines</a> from Google and Bing Search.</p>



<h4><strong>(Reference-free) evals and guardrails can be used interchangeably </strong></h4>



<p>Guardrails help to catch inappropriate or harmful content while evals help to measure the quality and accuracy of the model’s output. In the case of reference-free evals, they may be considered two sides of the same coin. Reference-free evals are evaluations that don’t rely on a “golden” reference, such as a human-written answer, and can assess the quality of output based solely on the input prompt and the model’s response.</p>



<p>Some examples of these are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="summarization evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/#summarization-consistency-relevance-length" target="_blank">summarization evals</a>, where we only have to consider the input document to evaluate the summary on factual consistency and relevance. If the summary scores poorly on these metrics, we can choose not to display it to the user, effectively using the eval as a guardrail. Similarly, reference-free <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="translation evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/#translation-statistical--learned-evals-for-quality" target="_blank">translation evals</a> can assess the quality of a translation without needing a human-translated reference, again allowing us to use it as a guardrail.</p>



<h4><strong>LLMs will return output even when they shouldn’t</strong></h4>



<p>A key challenge when working with LLMs is that they’ll often generate output even when they shouldn’t. This can lead to harmless but nonsensical responses, or more egregious defects like toxicity or dangerous content. For example, when asked to extract specific attributes or metadata from a document, an LLM may confidently return values even when those values don’t actually exist. Alternatively, the model may respond in a language other than English because we provided non-English documents in the context.</p>



<p>While we can try to prompt the LLM to return a “not applicable” or “unknown” response, it’s not foolproof. Even when the log probabilities are available, they’re a poor indicator of output quality. While log probs indicate the likelihood of a token appearing in the output, they don’t necessarily reflect the correctness of the generated text. On the contrary, for instruction-tuned models that are trained to respond to queries and generate coherent response, log probabilities may not be well-calibrated. Thus, while a high log probability may indicate that the output is fluent and coherent, it doesn’t mean it’s accurate or relevant.</p>



<p>While careful prompt engineering can help to some extent, we should complement it with robust guardrails that detect and filter/regenerate undesired output. For example, OpenAI provides a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="content moderation API (opens in a new tab)" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation" target="_blank">content moderation API</a> that can identify unsafe responses such as hate speech, self-harm, or sexual output. Similarly, there are numerous packages for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="detecting personally identifiable information (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/topics/pii-detection" target="_blank">detecting personally identifiable information</a> (PII). One benefit is that guardrails are largely agnostic of the use case and can thus be applied broadly to all output in a given language. In addition, with precise retrieval, our system can deterministically respond “I don’t know” if there are no relevant documents.</p>



<p>A corollary here is that LLMs may fail to produce outputs when they are expected to. This can happen for various reasons, from straightforward issues like long tail latencies from API providers to more complex ones such as outputs being blocked by content moderation filters. As such, it’s important to consistently log inputs and (potentially a lack of) outputs for debugging and monitoring.</p>



<h4><strong>Hallucinations are a stubborn problem.</strong></h4>



<p>Unlike content safety or PII defects which have a lot of attention and thus seldom occur, factual inconsistencies are stubbornly persistent and more challenging to detect. They’re more common and occur at a baseline rate of 5 – 10%, and from what we’ve learned from LLM providers, it can be challenging to get it below 2%, even on simple tasks such as summarization.</p>



<p>To address this, we can combine prompt engineering (upstream of generation) and factual inconsistency guardrails (downstream of generation). For prompt engineering, techniques like CoT help reduce hallucination by getting the LLM to explain its reasoning before finally returning the output. Then, we can apply a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="factual inconsistency guardrail (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">factual inconsistency guardrail</a> to assess the factuality of summaries and filter or regenerate hallucinations. In some cases, hallucinations can be deterministically detected. When using resources from RAG retrieval, if the output is structured and identifies what the resources are, you should be able to manually verify they’re sourced from the input context.</p>

<p>Noise-canceling headphones have gotten very good at creating an auditory blank slate. But allowing certain sounds from a wearer’s environment through the erasure still challenges researchers. The latest edition of Apple’s AirPods Pro, for instance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/airpods-pro-usb-c-hands-on-adaptive-audio-and-conversation-awareness.html">automatically adjusts sound levels</a> for wearers — sensing when they’re in conversation, for instance — but the user has little control over whom to listen to or when this happens.</p>
<p>A University of Washington team has developed an artificial intelligence system that lets a user wearing headphones look at a person speaking for three to five seconds to “enroll” them. The system, called “Target Speech Hearing,” then cancels all other sounds in the environment and plays just the enrolled speaker’s voice in real time even as the listener moves around in noisy places and no longer faces the speaker.</p>
<p>The team presented <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/147319">its findings</a> May 14 in Honolulu at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The <a href="https://github.com/vb000/LookOnceToHear">code for the proof-of-concept device</a> is available for others to build on. The system is not commercially available.</p>
<p>“We tend to think of AI now as web-based chatbots that answer questions,” said senior author <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/">Shyam Gollakota</a>, a UW professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. “But in this project, we develop AI to modify the auditory perception of anyone wearing headphones, given their preferences. With our devices you can now hear a single speaker clearly even if you are in a noisy environment with lots of other people talking.”</p>
<p>To use the system, a person wearing off-the-shelf headphones fitted with microphones taps a button while directing their head at someone talking. The sound waves from that speaker’s voice then should reach the microphones on both sides of the headset simultaneously; there’s a 16-degree margin of error. The headphones send that signal to an on-board embedded<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer"> computer</a>, where the team’s machine learning software learns the desired speaker’s vocal patterns. The system latches onto that speaker’s voice and continues to play it back to the listener, even as the pair moves around. The system’s ability to focus on the enrolled voice improves as the speaker keeps talking, giving the system more training data.</p>

<p>The team tested its system on 21 subjects, who rated the clarity of the enrolled speaker’s voice nearly twice as high as the unfiltered audio on average.</p>
<p>This work builds on the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/11/09/ai-noise-canceling-headphones/">team’s previous “semantic hearing” research</a>, which allowed users to select specific sound classes — such as birds or voices — that they wanted to hear and canceled other sounds in the environment.</p>
<p>Currently the TSH system can enroll only one speaker at a time, and it’s only able to enroll a speaker when there is not another loud voice coming from the same direction as the target speaker’s voice. If a user isn’t happy with the sound quality, they can run another enrollment on the speaker to improve the clarity.</p>
<p>The team is working to expand the system to earbuds and hearing aids in the future.</p>
