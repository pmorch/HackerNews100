<h2>Apollo 11 Guidance Computer (AGC) vs USB-C Chargers</h2>
<p>
I think it is healthy to compare historical and modern computing. Let's
see how the CPUs contained in recent USB-C wall chargers compare to the
power of the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer (AGC). The Apollo 11 spacecraft carried 3 humans to the moon and back in 1969.

<h2>Interpretation</h2>
The most powerful CPU in the table is from the Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2 (CYPD4225).  Compared with the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer it runs at ~48 times the clock speed with 1.8x the program space. It's very tempting to claim that the Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2 could fly me to the moon.  But we need more analysis.  What if the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer contains dedicated hardware which missing in the CYPD4225 and cannot be replicated in software? Let's compare the CYPD4225 to the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer.  I'll be using the excellent <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/assembly_language_manual.html">Virtual AGC documentation as a reference.</a> 
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>
The Apollo 11 Guidance Computer has a master clock frequency of 1.024MHz. Instructions need
at least 12 clock cycles (11.72uS). It operates using <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/hrst/archive/1029.pdf">one's compliment integer</a> arithmetic. There is no floating point. There is a single accumulator register to perform arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
The Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2 uses a CYPD4225, containing an ARM Cortex-M0 CPU.  Luckily
for this analysis both the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer and the Cortex-M0 CPUs are very
predictable compared to more sophisticated modern CPUs.  They
have no cache and memory access happens at a constant speed. Instructions execute in-order.
They have no hardware floating point. They have no vector/matrix hardware (like
AVX, SSE, or NEON). Therefore we can learn a lot by just comparing
the cycles of roughly equivalent instructions.</p>

</tbody></table>
From the table we see that instructions are usually a proportionate number
of low clock cycles. Most of the time each Apollo 11 Guidance
Computer instruction takes 12 times more clock cycles than the
Cortex-M0. Given that the Cortex-M0 runs at 46.9x
the clock speed and
that they are otherwise comparable (no cache, no vectors) I claim,
for most applications:
<p>
<b>The Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2 USB-C Wall Charger CPU is 563 times faster than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer.</b></p><p>
563 = (12 Cortex-M0 instructions per 1 Apollo 11 Guidance Computer instruction) * (48 MHz Cortex-M0) / (1.024 MHz Apollo 11 Guidance Computer).
</p><p>
After
skimming though the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer instruction set, the
only important missing Cortex-M0 instruction seems to be division.
But
each division on the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer takes 72 cycles *
(1/1.024MHz)
= 70.3
uS. In 70.3uS the CYPD4225
can
execute 70.3uS * 48 MHz = 3374 arithmetic instructions. Branches are
not too expensive (3 cycles). Hopefully that is enough to implement
software division. 
</p>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<h3>Program Storage Space</h3>
<p>
This is worth looking at. The Apollo programmers wrote a virtual machine/interpreter for the Guidance Computer because they were struggling with program space. It mattered enough to them to trade speed for increased storage.</p>
<p>
The Apollo 11 Guidance Computer stores 36,864 15-bit words. The CYPD4225 stores 128KB in flash. It's easy to calculate that the CYPD4225 can store 1.90 times more information than a Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. 
</p>
<p>
But does one computer have an advantage in instruction encoding? The Apollo 11 Guidance Computer instructions are 15-bit fixed width instructions. The Cortex-M0 implements the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001m/QRC0001_UAL.pdf">THUMB2 instruction set</a> which has 16-bit instructions and 32-bit instructions. The 16-bit instructions cover most common operations, such as arithmetic, branching, load/store. So it seems most programs can be encoded in mostly 16-bit instructions. How many instructions can a CYPD4225 store?  128KB / 16-bits = 65,536 instructions. The Apollo 11 Guidance computer can store 36,864 instructions. <b>Naively, the Anker PowerPort Atom PD2 can store at most 1.78x more instructions than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer.</b>
</p>
Perhaps not all instructions used will be 16-bit. Let's go a bit extreme and say half the instructions will be 32-bit and half the instructions will be 16-bit. Using the following equations where x=16-bit instructions and y=32-bit instructions:<br>
<pre><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+x+%2B+4+*+y+%3D+128*1024%2C+x%3Dy">2x + 4y = 128*1024, x = y</a></pre><br>
We get 21,845 32-bit and 16-bit instructions which is 43,690 instructions total -- 1.19x more than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer.

<p>The THUMB2 instruction set used by the Cortex-M0 is designed to be compact. The Cortex-M0 has 12 general purpose registers which can hold arithmetic results compared the single accumulator on the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. The Apollo 11 Guidance Computer has the advantage that it can do arithmetic and store the result directly to a memory location while the Cortex-M0 requires a separate store instruction. The Cortex-M0 has the advantage that the memory is simpler and requires no bank switching. But the bank switching means that more memory addresses can be encoded directly into arithmetic instructions. This is not straightforward to compare. However, given that the CYPD4225 can hold 1.19x - 1.78x  the instructions, I claim that the CYPD4225 should be able to hold an equivalent Apollo 11 Guidance Computer program.
</p>
<p>
Notice that other USB-C chargers have less program capacity than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. Going to the moon on 8KB sounds hard. The Apollo 11 Guidance Computer was originally designed with less program storage space but it had to be increased - conditions were not cozy.  Therefore, I will not consider other USB-C charger CPUs as candidates for taking me to the moon.
</p>
<h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
<p>
The Apollo 11 Guidance Computer can store 2,048 15-bit words. The CYPD4225 has 8KB of RAM. <b>The Anker PowerPort Atom PD2 has a little over twice the RAM of the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer.</b> One caveat is that the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer mostly computes in terms of 15-bit words. The equivalent Cortex-M0 computations are done in 16-bit words. So in terms of equivalent computational units the CYPD4225 has 4,096 16-bit words vs the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer's 2,048 15-bit words. So exactly twice the words.</p>
<h2>To The Moon and Back</h2>
We have our rockets, our modules, some <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/jonny-kim/biography">Jonny Kims</a>, and our Anker PowerPort Atom PD2 - are we going to the moon or what?
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Launch_Vehicle_Digital_Computer">Wikipedia claims</a> the Apollo 11 spacecraft contains 4 computers:
<ul>
<li>2x Apollo 11 Guidance Computers (examined

<li>1x Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer

<p>
Is there a possibility that we can replace multiple computers with a single CYPD4225? I don't think so
because the 4 computers were in separate parts of the spacecraft. So
we will assume that we need 4 computers to fly an Apollo 11 without significantly altering the design.</p>
<p>
All the computers on Apollo 11 are less powerful and have less memory than an Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2.  I'm going to assume that the LVDC and the AGS do not use any exciting instructions that would be difficult for a Cortex-M0 to perform - besides division. I will hand-wave this away by saying that division probably takes longer than multiplication. And I have listed the multiplication times above. The CYPD4225 can comfortably execute thousands of arithmetic instructions in the time it takes any Apollo 11 computer to execute a single multiply.</p>
<p>
<strong>I claim that we would only need the compute power of 4 Anker PowerPort Atom PD 2 USB-C chargers to get to the moon with the following caveats:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>The CYPD4225 is definitely not rated for space. I have no idea if it would work in space.</li>
<li>I did not examine the peripherals used by the Apollo 11 computers. The CYPD4225 has 30 GPIO signals and talks UART, I2C, and SPI. However, how many peripherals did the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer support? 100? 10? More Googling is needed. And probably the voltage levels from the 1960s are too high to connect to a CYPD4225.</li>
<li>Ron Burkey, Owen Smith, and others point out that the LVDC actually contains triply-redundant logic. The logic gives 3 answers and the voting mechanism picks the winner. So it may be fair to claim that you in fact need 3 USB-C chargers to compare against the LVDC. However, I think the redundancy was for reliability and I completely ignoring reliability. And in fact I think any attempt to emulate this voting scheme with 3x microcontrollers with a 4th to tally votes will not make the system any more reliable. But this is proving controversial and it may soon get its own full paragraph summarizing different viewpoints!</li>
</ul>

<h2>What does it mean?</h2>
I was responsible for the overall firmware for <a href="https://structure.io/">Structure Sensor</a>. It used USB charger detection present on most USB chargers at that time - some resistor network between the USB D+ / D- signals. There was no digital communication. The firmware portion was implemented by Evan Fletcher and I think he reported it was easy to do. That was 2012-2013. Now in 2020 USB-C is here. Many USB chargers have a microcontroller with a CPU. Some are less capable than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. Some are more capable than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. Most of them with at least ~10x faster clock speed. USB-C Power Delivery solves problems and gives us new capabilities. But it is another step toward increasing complexity. It is another firmware and chip to handle during manufacturing. I don't have an alternate proposal for power delivery that:
<ul>
<li>Uses 1 wire in the cable</li>
<li>Lets USB-C chargers present arbitrary charge current and voltages</li>
</ul>

Thanks my father for looking at this. And thanks to Ron Burkey who looked at a small piece of info I emailed and provided more context. Thanks to Sean Barrett for the correction that Cortex-M0s are pipelined.

<p>Learning is necessary for software developers. Change is perpetual: New technologies are frequently invented, and old technologies are repeatedly updated. Thus, developers do not learn to program just once—over the course of their careers they will learn many new programming languages and frameworks.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<p><img alt="ins01.gif" src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/ins01.gif"></p>
<p>Just because we learn does not mean we understand how we learn. One survey in the U.S. found that the majority of beliefs about memory were contrary to those of scientific consensus: People do not intuitively understand how memory and learning work.<sup><a href="#R37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>As an example, consider learning styles. Advocates of learning styles claim that effective instruction matches learners' preferred styles—visual learners look, auditory learners listen, and kinesthetic learners do. A 2020 review found that 89% of people believe that learners' preferred styles should dictate instruction, though researchers have known for several decades that this is inaccurate.<sup><a href="#R28">28</a></sup> While learners have preferred styles, effective instruction matches the content, not learning styles. A science class should use graphs to present data rather than verbal descriptions, regardless of visual or auditory learning styles, just like cooking classes should use hands-on practices rather than reading, whether learners prefer a kinesthetic style or not.</p>
<p>Decades of research into cognitive psychology, education, and programming education provide strong insights into how we learn. The next 10 sections of this article provide research-backed findings about learning that apply to software developers and discuss their practical implications. This information can help with learning for yourself, teaching junior staff, and recruiting staff.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>1. Human Memory Is Not Made of Bits</h3>
<p>Human memory is central to learning. As Kirschner and Hendrick put it, "Learning means that there has been a change made in one's long-term memory."<sup><a href="#R20">20</a></sup> Software developers are familiar with the incredible power of computer memory, where we can store a series of bits and later retrieve that exact series of bits. While human memory is similar, it is neither as precise nor as reliable.</p>
<p>Due to the biological complexity of human memory, reliability is a complicated matter. With computer memory, we use two fundamental operations: read and write. Reading computer memory does not modify it, and it does not matter how much time passes between writes and reads. Human long-term memory is not as sterile. Human memory seems to have a "read-and-update" operation, wherein fetching a memory can both strengthen and modify it—a process known as <em>reconsolidation.</em> This modification is more likely on recently formed memories. Because of this potential for modification, a fact does not exist in a binary state of either definitively known or unknown; it can exist in intermediate states. We can forget things we previously knew, and knowledge can be unreliable, especially when recently learned.</p>
<p>Another curious feature of human memory is "spreading activation."<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> Our memories are stored in interconnected neural pathways. When we try to remember something, we activate a pathway of neurons to access the targeted information. However, activation is not contained within one pathway. Some of the activation energy spreads to other connected pathways, like heat radiating from a hot water pipe. This spreading activation leaves related pathways primed for activation for hours.<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Spreading activation has a negative implication for memory<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> and a positive implication for problem-solving.<sup><a href="#R32">32</a></sup> Spreading activation means that related, but imprecise, information can become conflated with the target information, meaning our recall of information can be unreliable. However, spreading activation is also associated with insight-based problem solving, or "aha moments." Because pathways stay primed for hours, sometimes stepping away from a problem to work on a different one with its own spreading activation causes two unrelated areas to connect in the middle. When two previously unrelated areas connect, creative and unique solutions to problems can arise. This is why walks, showers, or otherwise spending time away from a problem can help you get unstuck in problem solving.</p>
<p>In summary, human memory does not work by simply storing and retrieving from a specific location like computer memory. Human memory is more fragile and more unreliable, but it can also offer great benefits in problem solving and deep understanding by connecting knowledge together. We will elaborate further on this in later sections, especially on retrieving items from memory and strengthening memories.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>2. Human Memory Is Composed of One Limited and One Unlimited System</h3>
<p>Human memory comprises two main components that are relevant to learning: <em>long-term memory</em> and <em>working memory.</em> Long-term memory is where information is permanently stored and is functionally limitless;<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> in that sense, it functions somewhat like a computer's disk storage. Working memory, however, is used to consciously reason about information to solve problems;<sup><a href="#R2">2</a></sup> it functions like a CPU's registers, storing a limited amount of information in real time to allow access and manipulation.</p>
<p>Working memory is limited, and its capacity is roughly fixed at birth.<sup><a href="#R2">2</a></sup> While higher working-memory capacity is related to higher general intelligence, working-memory capacity is not the be-all and end-all for performance.<sup><a href="#R22">22</a></sup> Higher capacity enables faster learning, but our unlimited long-term memory removes limitations on how much we could ultimately learn in total.<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> Expert programmers may have low or high working memory capacity but it is the contents of their long-term memory that make them experts.</p>
<p>As people learn more about a topic, they relate information together into <em>chunks.</em><sup><a href="#FNA">a</a></sup> Chunking allows the multiple pieces of information to act as one piece of information in working memory. For example, when learning an email address, a familiar domain, such as gmail.com, is treated as one piece of information instead of a random string of characters, like <a href="http://xvjki.wmt/">xvjki.wmt</a>. Thus, the more information that is chunked, the larger working memory is functionally.<sup><a href="#R38">38</a></sup> Using our computer analogy, our working memory/CPU registers may only let us store five pointers to chunks in long-term memory/disk, but there is no limit on the size of the chunks, so the optimal strategy is to increase the size of the chunks by practicing using information and solving problems.</p>
<p>When learning new tools or skills, it is important to understand the <em>cognitive load</em>, or amount of working memory capacity, demanded by the task. Cognitive load has two parts: <em>intrinsic load</em> and <em>extraneous load.</em> Intrinsic load is how many pieces of information or chunks are inherently necessary to achieve the task; it cannot be changed except by changing the task. In contrast, extraneous cognitive load is unnecessary information that, nevertheless, is part of performing the task. Presentation format is an example of how extraneous cognitive load can vary. If you are implementing a database schema, it is easier to use a diagram with tables and attributes than a plain English description—the latter has higher extraneous load because you must mentally transform the description into a schema, whereas the diagram can be mapped directly (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/f1.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1550,height=560'); return false;">Figure 1</a>). Extraneous load is generally higher for beginners because they cannot distinguish between intrinsic and extraneous information easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/f1.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1550,height=560'); return false;"><img alt="f1.jpg" height="150" src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/f1.jpg" width="415"></a><br>
<strong>Figure 1. Two ways of presenting the same database schema description with differing extraneous cognitive load.</strong></p>
<p>When faced with a task that seems beyond a person's abilities, it is important to recognize that this can be changed by reorganizing the task. Decomposing the problem into smaller pieces that can be processed and chunked will ultimately allow the person to solve complex problems. This principle should be applied to your own practice when facing problems at the edge of or beyond your current skills, but it is especially relevant when working with junior developers and recruits.</p>

<h3>3. Experts Recognize, Beginners Reason</h3>
<p>One key difference between beginners and experts is that experts have seen it all before. Research into chess experts has shown that their primary advantage is their ability to <em>remember and recognize</em> the state of the board. This allows them to decide how to respond more quickly and with less effort.<sup><a href="#R15">15</a></sup> Kahneman<sup><a href="#R19">19</a>,<a href="#FNB">b</a></sup> describes cognition as being split into "system 1" and "system 2" (thus proving that not only developers struggle with naming things). System 1 is fast and driven by recognition, relying upon pattern recognition in long-term memory, while system 2 is slower and focused on reasoning, requiring more processing in working memory. This is part of a general idea known as dual-process theories.<sup><a href="#R34">34</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Expert developers can reason at a higher level by having memorized common patterns in program code, which frees up their cognition.</em></p>

<hr>
<p>Expert developers can reason at a higher level by having memorized (usually implicitly, from experience) common patterns in program code, which frees up their cognition.<sup><a href="#R4">4</a></sup> One such instance of this is "design patterns" in programming, similar to previously discussed chunks. An expert may immediately recognize that a particular piece of code is carrying out a sorting algorithm, while a beginner might read line by line to try to understand the workings of the code without recognizing the bigger picture.</p>
<p>A corollary to this is that beginners can become experts by reading and understanding a lot of code. Experts build up a mental library of patterns that let them read and write code more easily in the future. Seeing purely imperative C code may only partially apply to functional Haskell code, so seeing a variety of programming paradigms will help further. Overall, this pattern matching is the reason that reading and working with more code, and more types of code, will increase proficiency at programming.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>4. Understanding a Concept Goes from Abstract to Concrete and Back</h3>
<p>Research shows that experts deal with concepts in different ways than beginners. Experts use generic and abstract terms that look for underlying concepts and do not focus on details, whereas beginners focus on surface details and have trouble connecting these details to the bigger picture. These differences affect how experts reason but also how they learn.</p>
<p>For example, when explaining a variadic function in Python to someone new to the concept, experts might say that it is a function that can take a varying number of arguments. A beginner may focus on details such as the exact syntax for declaring and calling the function and may think that passing one argument is a special case. An expert may more easily understand or predict the details while having the concept explained to them.</p>
<p>When you are learning a new concept, you will benefit from both forms of explanation: abstract features and concrete details with examples. More specifically, you will benefit from following the <em>semantic wave</em>, a concept defined by Australian scientist Karl Maton,<sup><a href="#R25">25</a></sup> as illustrated by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/f2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1022,height=597'); return false;">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/f2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no,width=1022,height=597'); return false;"><img alt="f2.jpg" height="242" src="https://dl.acm.org/cms/attachment/html/10.1145/3584859/assets/html/f2.jpg" width="415"></a><br>
<strong>Figure 2. The semantic wave for variadic functions.</strong></p>
<p>Following the semantic wave, you continuously switch between the abstract definition and several diverse examples of the concept. The more diverse the examples are, the better. Even wrong examples are beneficial when compared to correct examples to understand why they are wrong,<sup><a href="#R23">23</a></sup> such as seeing a mutable variable labeled as non-constant when trying to learn what a constant is. This process is called unpacking.</p>
<p>With these diverse examples, you can then (re)visit the abstract definition and construct a deeper understanding of the concept. Deeper understanding stems from recognizing how multiple details from the examples connect to the one abstract concept in the definition, a process called <em>repacking.</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Problem-solving is (incorrectly) conceived as a generic skill. However, this is not how problem-solving works in the brain.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Programming frequently involves learning about abstract concepts. Faced with an abstract concept to learn, such as functions, people often reach for concrete instantiations of the concept to examine, for example, the <code>abs</code> function that returns the absolute value of a number.<sup><a href="#R17">17</a></sup> One challenge is that as concepts get more abstract (from values to variables/objects to functions/classes to higher-order functions/metaclasses and eventually category theory), the distance to a concrete example increases. The saving grace is that as we learn abstract concepts, they become more concrete to us. Initially, a function is an abstract concept, but after much practice, a function becomes a concrete item (or chunk) to us and we can learn the next level of abstraction.</p>

<h3>5. Spacing and Repetition Matter</h3>
<p>How often have you heard that you should not cram for an exam? Unless, of course, you want to forget everything by the next day. This advice is based on one of the most predictable and persistent effects in cognitive psychology: the spacing effect.<sup><a href="#R10">10</a></sup> According to the spacing effect, humans learn problem-solving concepts best by spacing out their practice across multiple sessions, multiple days, and ideally, multiple weeks.</p>
<p>The reason spacing works is due to the relationship between long-term and working memory previously described in this article. When learners practice solving problems, they practice two skills. First, matching the information in the problem to a concept that can solve it (such as a filtering loop), and second, applying the concept to solve the problem (such as writing the loop). The first skill requires activating the correct neural pathway to the concept in long-term memory.<sup><a href="#R5">5</a></sup> If learners repeatedly solve the same kind of problem, such as for-each loop problems, then that pathway to long-term memory stays active, and they miss practicing the first skill. A common result of un-spaced practice is that people can solve problems, but only when they are told which concept to use.<sup><a href="#R5">5</a></sup> While interleaving different types of problems, such as loop and conditional problems, can help, pathways take time to return to baseline, making spacing necessary to get the most out of practice time.<sup><a href="#R10">10</a></sup> In addition, the brain needs rest to consolidate the new information that has been processed so that it can be applied to new problems.</p>
<p>Going against this time-tested principle, intensive coding boot-camps require learners to cram their problem-solving practice into un-spaced sessions. While this is not ideal, researchers of the spacing effect have known from the beginning that most learners still prefer to cram their practice into as little time as possible.<sup><a href="#R10">10</a></sup> For people whose only viable option to learn programming is intensive bootcamps, we can apply the spacing research to maximize their outcomes.</p>
<p>To structure a day of learning, learners should limit learning bouts to 90 minutes or less.<sup><a href="#R21">21</a></sup> The neuro-chemical balance in the brain makes concentration difficult after this point.<sup><a href="#R21">21</a></sup> After each learning bout, take at least 20 minutes to rest.<sup><a href="#R21">21</a></sup> Really rest by going for a walk or sitting quietly—without working on other tasks, idly browsing the Internet, or chatting with others. Rest speeds up the consolidation process, which also happens during sleep.</p>
<p>Within a learning bout, there are a couple of strategies to maximize efficiency. First, randomize the order of the type of problem being solved so that different concepts are being activated in long-term memory.<sup><a href="#R5">5</a></sup> Be forewarned, though, that randomizing the order improves learning outcomes but requires more effort.<sup><a href="#R6">6</a></sup> The second strategy is to take short breaks at random intervals to enhance memory consolidation. A 10-second break every 2–5 minutes is recommended.<sup><a href="#R18">18</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>6. The Internet Has Not Made Learning Obsolete</h3>
<p>The availability of programming knowledge changed with the advent of the Internet. Knowledge about syntax or APIs went from being buried in reference books to being a few keystrokes away. Most recently, AI-powered tools such as ChatGPT, Codex, and GitHub Copilot will even fill in these details (mostly accurately) for you. This raises an obvious question: Why is it worth learning details—or anything at all—if the knowledge is available from the Internet within seconds?</p>
<p>We learn by storing pieces of knowledge in our long-term memory and forming connections between them.<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> If the knowledge is not present in the brain, because you have not yet learned it well, the brain cannot form any connections between it, so higher levels of understanding and abstraction are not possible.<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> If every time you need a piece of code to do a database join you search online for it, insert it, and move on, you will be unlikely to learn much about joins. The wisdom of relying on the Internet or AI differs between beginners and experts: There is a key distinction between a beginner who has never learned the details and thus lacks the memory connections, and an expert who has learned the deeper structure but searches for the forgotten fine details.<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There is even some evidence to suggest that searching the Internet is less efficient for remembering information. One study found that information was remembered less well if it was found via the Internet (compared to a physical book).<sup><a href="#R11">11</a></sup> Another found that immediately searching the Internet led to worse recall of the same information later, compared to first trying to think of the answer before resorting to searching.<sup><a href="#R14">14</a></sup> It seems that searching may rob the brain of the benefits of the memory-strengthening effect of recalling information.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of cognitive load discussed earlier. An Internet search requires a form of context switching for the brain; its limited attention and working memory must be switched from the task at hand (programming) to a new cognitive task (searching the Internet and selecting a result or evaluating an AI-generated result). If the required knowledge is instead memorized, then not only is access much faster (like using a cache versus fetching from a hard disk), but it also avoids the cognitive drain of context switching and filtering out extraneous information from the search. So there are multiple reasons to memorize information, despite it being available on the Internet.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>7. Problem-Solving Is Not a Generic Skill</h3>
<p>Problem-solving is a large part of programming. One common (but incorrect) idea in software development is to directly teach problem-solving as a specific skill, which can then be applied to different aspects of development (design, debugging, and so on). Thus, problem-solving is (incorrectly) conceived as a generic skill. However, this is not how problem-solving works in the brain.</p>
<p>While humans do have some generic problem-solving skills, they are much less efficient than domain-specific problem-solving skills, such as being able to debug programs. While we can learn to reason, we do not learn how to solve problems in general. Instead, we learn how to solve programming problems, or how to plan the best chess move, or how to create a knitting pattern. Each of these skills is separate and does not influence the others. Research into chess found little or no effect of learning it on other academic and cognitive skills, and the same is true for music instruction and cognitive training.<sup><a href="#R36">36</a></sup> This inability to transfer problem-solving skills is why "brain training" is ineffective for developing general intelligence.<sup><a href="#R29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The one exception to this rule appears to be spatial skills. Spatial skills allow us to visualize objects in our mind, like a Tetris shape, and mentally manipulate those objects, like rotating a Tetris shape. Training these generic skills can improve learning in other disciplines. This phenomenon is so unusual that it has caused much consternation in cognitive and learning sciences.<sup><a href="#R24">24</a></sup> Yet, spatial training improves performance on a range of non-verbal skills regardless of initial ability, age, or type of training task.<sup><a href="#R40">40</a></sup> Recent work has even demonstrated that spatial training can improve efficiency for professional software developers, likely because they are still learning new concepts.<sup><a href="#R30">30</a></sup> Even with this strange exception, the best way to learn how to solve programming problems is still to practice solving programming problems rather than looking for performance benefits from learning chess or other cognitive training.</p>
<p>There is a secondary implication here for recruitment. One popular idea for screening programming candidates was to give brain-teaser puzzles, such as how to weigh a jumbo jet. As Google worked out by 2013, this is a waste of time<sup><a href="#R7">7</a></sup>—there is no reliable correspondence between problem-solving in the world of brain teasers and problem-solving in the world of programming. If you want to judge programming ability, assess programming ability.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>8. Expertise Can Be Problematic in Some Situations</h3>
<p>We have discussed many ways in which expertise benefits learning and performance. However, being an expert can also lead to problems.</p>
<p>Programmers use tools and aids to be more effective, such as version control systems or IDEs. Such tools can have different effects on beginners and experts. Beginners may get overwhelmed by the amount of options available in professional tools (due to increased cognitive load) and may benefit from beginner-friendly hints on how to use the tool. However, experts find the same hints more distracting than useful because they already know what to do. This is known as the expertise-reversal effect: Hints and guides that help beginners can get in the way of experts and make them less productive.</p>
<p>Programmers usually learn multiple programming languages throughout their careers. Knowing multiple languages can be beneficial once they have been mastered, but sometimes transferring knowledge from one programming language to another can lead to faulty knowledge. For example, a programmer may learn about inheritance in Java, where one method overrides a parent method as long as the signatures match, and transfer this knowledge to C++, where overriding a parent method additionally requires that the parent method is declared virtual. These kinds of differences—where features are similar in syntax but different in semantics between languages—specifically hinder the transfer of knowledge.<sup><a href="#R39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>Experts often help to train beginners, but experts without experience in training others often do not realize that beginners think differently. Thus, they fail to tailor their explanations for someone with a different mental model. This is known as the expert blind-spot problem: difficulty in seeing things through the eyes of a beginner once you have become an expert. It can be overcome by listening carefully to beginners explain their current understanding and tailoring explanations accordingly.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, knowledge becomes so automated that it is difficult for experts to verbalize it.<sup><a href="#R1">1</a></sup> This automated knowledge is why experts have intuitions about how to solve problems or explain their process as, "I just know." In these cases of tacit knowledge, beginners might better learn from instructional materials designed to support beginners, often called scaffolded instruction, or from a peer rather than an expert. A more knowledgeable (but still relatively novice) peer is a highly valuable resource to bridge the gap between beginners and experts. They can help the beginner develop new knowledge and the expert to rediscover automated knowledge.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>9. The Predictors of Programming Ability Are Unclear</h3>
<p>The success of learning programming, like most activities, is built on a mix of inherent aptitude and practice. Some people believe it is purely about aptitude—the "you're born with it" view—and some believe it is almost entirely about practice—the "10,000 hours" idea that only sufficient practice is required for expertise. Both extreme views are wrong, and in this section, we will explore the evidence for the differing effects of aptitude and practice.</p>
<p>There has been much research to try to predict programming aptitude but few reliable results. Attempts to produce a predictive test for programming ability have generally come to naught. Research has found that all of the following fail to predict programming ability: gender, age, academic major, race, prior performance in math, prior experience with another programming language, perceptions of CS, and preference for humanities or sciences.<sup><a href="#R35">35</a></sup> There was an industry of aptitude tests for programming that began in the 1960s, but as Robins<sup><a href="#R33">33</a></sup> summarizes, the predictive accuracy was poor and the tests fell out of use.</p>
<p>There is mixed evidence for the importance of years of experience, which relates to practice. There is a correlation between the reputation of programmers on Stack Overflow and their age: Older people have a higher reputation.<sup><a href="#R27">27</a></sup> However, a recent study found only a weak link between years of experience and success on a programming task among programmers who were relatively early in their careers,<sup><a href="#R31">31</a></sup> suggesting that aptitude may have a stronger effect than experience, at least early in programmers' careers.</p>
<p>As in most domains, two factors that weakly predict success in early programming are general intelligence and working memory capacity.<sup><a href="#R4">4</a></sup> These factors roughly represent reasoning skills and how much information a learner can process at once. As such, they predict the <em>rate of learning</em> rather than absolute ability. A sub-measure of these two factors, <em>spatial reasoning</em>, is a stronger predictor of success in programming, though still quite moderate.<sup><a href="#R30">30</a></sup> Spatial reasoning also predicts success in other science and math fields,<sup><a href="#R24">24</a></sup> so this is not programming-specific. Further, these weak-to-moderate correlations largely disappear with increased experience for various reasons. Thus, intelligent people will not always make good programmers, and good programmers need not be high in general intelligence.</p>
<p>In short, it is very hard to predict who will be able to program, especially in the long term. Programmers could come from any background or demographic, and links to any other factors (such as intelligence) are generally fleeting in the face of experience. Therefore, in recruiting new programmers, there are no shortcuts to identifying programming ability, nor are there any reliable "candidate profiles" to screen candidates for programming ability.</p>

<p><a href="#PageTop">Back to Top</a></p>


<h3>10. Your Mindset Matters</h3>
<p>There is a long-standing idea of a binary split in programming ability: You either can program or you cannot. There have been many competing theories behind this. One of the more compelling theories is the idea of learning edge momentum,<sup><a href="#R33">33</a></sup> that each topic is dependent on previous topics, so once you fall behind you will struggle to catch up. A less compelling theory is the idea of a "geek gene" (you are born with it or not), which has little empirical evidence.<sup><a href="#R26">26</a></sup> As discussed in the previous section, we have recently come to understand differences in programming ability as differences in prior experience.<sup><a href="#R16">16</a></sup> Learners who might seem similar (for example, in the same class, with the same degree, completing the same bootcamp) can have vastly different knowledge and skills, putting them ahead or behind in terms of learning edge momentum or, within a snapshot of time, making them seem "born with it" or not. A similar effect is found in any highly technical field that is optionally taught before university (for example, CS, physics, and engineering).<sup><a href="#R9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The binary split view, and its effects on teaching and learning, have been studied across academic disciplines in research about fixed versus growth mindsets.<sup><a href="#R12">12</a></sup> A fixed mindset aligns with an aptitude view that people's abilities are innate and unchanging. Applied to learning, this mindset says that if someone struggles with a new task, then they are not cut out for it. Alternatively, a growth mindset aligns with a practice view—that people's abilities are malleable. Applied to learning, this mindset says that if someone struggles with a new task, they can master it with enough practice.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Attempts to produce a predictive test for programming ability have generally come to naught.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As described in Cheryan et al.,<sup><a href="#R9">9</a></sup> neither extreme view is true. For example, practically everyone can learn some physics, even if they are not initially good at it. However, practically no one can earn the Nobel Prize in Physics, no matter how much they practice. Between these extremes, we are often trying to figure out the boundaries of our abilities. When teachers and learners approach new tasks with a growth mindset, they tend to persist through difficulties and overcome failure more consistently.<sup><a href="#R12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>While the evidence for this effect is strong and intuitive, research suggests it can be difficult to change someone's mindset to be more growth-oriented.<sup><a href="#R8">8</a></sup> In particular, there are two common misconceptions about how to promote a growth mindset that prove ineffective. The first misconception is to reward effort rather than performance because a growth mindset favors practice over aptitude. But learners are not stupid; they can tell when they are not progressing, and teachers praising unproductive effort is not helpful. Instead, effort should be rewarded only when the learner is using effective strategies and on the path to success.<sup><a href="#R13">13</a></sup> The second misconception is that when someone approaches a task with a growth mindset, they will maintain that mindset throughout the task. In reality, as we face setbacks and experience failure, people skew toward a fixed mindset because we are not sure where the boundaries of our abilities lie. Thus, we must practice overcoming setbacks and failures to maintain a growth-mindset approach.<sup><a href="#R13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>A related concept to fixed and growth mindsets is goal orientation. This is split into two categories: approach and avoidance. The "approach" goal orientation involves wanting to do well, and this engenders positive and effective learning behaviors: working hard, seeking help, and trying new and challenging topics. In contrast, the "avoidance" goal orientation involves avoiding failure. This leads to negative and ineffective behaviors: disorganized study, not seeking help, anxiety over performance, and avoiding challenge. It is important that learners can make mistakes without severe penalties if they are to be directed toward "approach" rather than "avoidance."</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Intelligent people will not always make good programmers, and good programmers need not be high in general intelligence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When learning a new skill or training someone in a new skill, remember that approaching tasks with a growth mindset is effective but also a skill to be developed. Unfortunately, we cannot simply tell people to have a growth mindset and reap the benefits. Instead, nurture this skill by seeking or providing honest feedback about the process of learning and the efficacy of strategies. For mentors, praise areas where a men-tee is making progress and accept that they will make mistakes without chastising them. For learners, reflect on how skills have improved in the past weeks or months when you are doubtful about your progress. Further, expect that a growth mindset will shift toward a fixed mindset in the face of failure, but it can also be redeveloped and made stronger with practice. Feeling discouraged is normal, but it does not mean that you will always feel discouraged. If you feel like quitting, take a break, take a walk, consider your strategies, and then try again.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Software developers must continually learn in order to keep up with the fast-paced changes in the field. Learning anything, programming included, involves committing items to memory. Human memory is fascinatingly complex. While it shares some similarities with computer architecture, there are key differences that make it work quite differently. In this article, we have explained the current scientific understanding of how human memory works, how learning works, the differences between beginners and experts, and related it all to practical steps that software developers can take to improve their learning, training, and recruitment.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations.</strong> We have split up our recommendations into those for recruiting and those for training and learning.</p>
<p>For recruiting, we make the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no good proxies for programming ability. Stereotypes based on gender, race, or other factors are not supported by evidence. If you want to know how well candidates program, look at their previous work or test them on authentic programming tasks. To emphasize a specific point: Do not test candidates with brain-teaser puzzles.</li>
<li>At least among young developers, years of experience may not be a very reliable measure of ability.</li>
<li>A related recommendation from Behroozi et al.<sup><a href="#R3">3</a></sup> is to get candidates to solve interview problems in a room on their own before presenting the solution, as the added pressure from an interviewer observing or requiring talking while solving it adds to cognitive load and stress in a way that impairs performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For learning and training, we make the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading a lot of code will help someone become a more efficient programmer.</li>
<li>Experts are not always the best at training beginners.</li>
<li>Learning takes time, including time <em>between</em> learning sessions. Intense cramming is not effective, but spaced repetition is.</li>
<li>Similarly, spending time away from a problem can help to solve it.</li>
<li>Just because you can find it through an Internet search or generative AI tool does not mean learning has become obsolete.</li>
<li>Use examples to go between abstract concepts and concrete learnable facts.</li>
<li>Seeking to succeed (rather than avoid failure) and believing that ability is changeable are important factors in resilience and learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further reading.</strong> Many books on learning center around formal education; they are aimed at school teachers and university lecturers. However, the principles are applicable everywhere, including professional development. We recommend three books:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why Don't Students Like School?</em> by Daniel T. Willingham provides a short and readable explanation of many of the principles of memory and how the brain works.</li>
<li><em>The Programmer's Brain</em> by Felienne Hermans et al.<sup><a href="#FNC">c</a></sup> relates these concepts to programming and describes how techniques for learning and revision that are used at school can still apply to professional development.</li>
<li><em>How Learning Happens: Seminal Works in Educational Psychology and What They Mean in Practice</em> by Paul A. Kirschner and Carl Hendrick<sup><a href="#R20">20</a></sup> provides a tour through influential papers, explaining them in plain language and the implications and linkages between them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The papers cited can also serve as further reading. If you are a software developer you may not have access to all of them; ACM members with the digital library option will have access to the ACM papers, although many of our references are from other disciplines. For more recent papers, many authors supply free PDFs on their websites; you may wish to try searching the Web for the exact title to find such PDFs. Many authors are also happy to supply you with a copy if you contact them directly.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/26/24015595/amazon-prime-video-ads-coming-january-29">https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/26/24015595/amazon-prime-video-ads-coming-january-29</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38777516">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Earlier this year, Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23885242/amazon-prime-tv-movies-streaming-ads-subscription-date">announced plans to start incorporating ads</a> into movies and TV shows streamed from its Prime Video service, and now the company has revealed a specific date when you’ll start seeing them: it’s January 29th. “This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time,” the company said in an email to customers about the pending shift to “limited advertisements.” </p><p>“We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required from you, and there is no change to the current price of your Prime membership,” the company wrote. Customers have the option of paying an additional $2.99 per month to keep avoiding advertisements. </p><p>The rest of the email summarizes the many benefits of a Prime subscription — no doubt an attempt to keep customers from cancelling over this decision. <em>Verge</em> readers were none too pleased about the initial news back in September: </p><p>Amazon Prime currently costs $14.99 each month or $139 annually. (Prime Video can be subscribed to individually for $8.99/month.) The new charge for ad-free streaming would bring Prime to just under $18, and would push standalone Prime Video to just under $12. </p><p>Amazon also operates Freevee, a free, ad-sponsored streaming service. The company’s email notes that “live event content such as sports, and content offered through Amazon Freevee will continue to include advertising.”</p><p>The move comes as competing streaming services <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/28/23934629/streaming-price-hikes-netflix-hulu-disney-plus-expensive">continue to raise subscription rates across the board</a> and push ads upon customers on their cheapest monthly plans. Disney Plus, Hulu, Max, Netflix, and Paramount Plus all include ads on their most affordable tiers. The monthly cost of Amazon Prime itself isn’t changing, but if you want to preserve the same experience you have today starting on January 29th, you’ll end up paying more. </p><p>Amazon’s full email follows below.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear Prime member,&nbsp;</p><p>We are writing to you today about an upcoming change to your Prime Video experience. Starting January 29, Prime Video movies and TV shows will include limited advertisements. This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="info_collapse">
            <p>2nd City Zoning is an interactive map that lets you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                find out <strong>how your building is zoned</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                learn <strong>where to locate your business</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                explore <strong>zoning patterns</strong> throughout the city
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To make Chicago's zoning code digestible by humans, we took inspiration from one of our favorite games: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000">Sim City 2000</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It started with the color scheme: <strong>green</strong>
              for residential, <strong>blue</strong>
              for commercial and <strong>yellow</strong>
              for industrial. (This oversimplifies things a bit, <a href="https://secondcityzoning.org/about#zoning-categories">read the full story</a>.)
            </p>
            <p>From there we got a little carried away. Graphics, sounds, music, oh my.</p>
            <p>We had a lot of fun making this, so dive in and explore!</p>

<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/clown-dmca.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/clown-dmca.png" alt="clown-dmca" width="220" height="225" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20220%20225'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/clown-dmca.png"></a>There’s no question that content creators should have the ability and means to protect their work. </p>
<p>Those who rely on easily copied images to generate income face a stark choice; allow third-parties to illegally profit from illicit copies that may even outrank the originals in Google search, or spend time and money fighting back. </p>
<p>For an increasing number of OnlyFans and Instagram models, hiring companies that offer cut-price DMCA takedown services may seem like the perfect solution. The reality is that cheap can come at a cost.</p>
<p>Reckless takedown practices, with creators’ names necessarily associated with them, are punishing other innocent creators by demanding that all record of their work is deindexed from Google search.</p>
<p><em>[NSFW] The takedown notices below contain explicit language</em></p>
<h2>Artemis: Goddess of the Moon</h2>
<p>As the crew of Artemis 2 prepare to become the first humans to fly to the moon since 1972, the possibilities of space travel are once again igniting imaginations globally. More than 92% of internet users who want to learn more about this <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">historic mission</a> and the program in general are statistically likely to use Google search. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, however, the ability to find relevant content is under attack. Blundering DMCA takedown notices sent by a company calling itself DMCA Piracy Prevention Inc. claim to protect the rights of an OnlyFans/Instagram model working under the name ‘Artemis’. </p>
<p>Instead, keyword-based systems that fail to discriminate between copyright-infringing content and that referencing the word Artemis in any other context, are flooding towards Google. They contain demands to completely deindex non-infringing, unrelated content, produced by innocent third parties all over the world.</p>
<h2>A Typically Abusive Google Deindexing Demand</h2>
<p>A recent deindexing demand dated December 13, 2022, lists DMCA Piracy Prevention Inc. of Canada as the sender. The name of the content owner is redacted but the notice itself states that the company represents a content creator performing under the name Artemis. </p>

<p>The notice demands the removal of 3,617 URLs from Google search. If successful, those URLs would be completely unfindable by more than 92% of the world’s population who use that search engine. We don’t have the resources to check every URL so let’s begin by looking at a sample of the first 20 URLs in the notice and the content they relate to.</p>
<p><em>• Artemis 1 is (probably) a go on Saturday, 3 September (<a href="https://stuff.co.za/2022/09/01/artemis-1-is-probably-a-go-on-saturday-3-september/">link</a>)<br>
• Light Start: Artemis 1 delayed (<a href="https://stuff.co.za/2022/10/03/light-start-artemis-1-delayed-again-new-razer-hardware-coming-ubisoft-to-stadia-fans-rescue-and-twitch-wants-more-money/">link</a>)<br>
• Light Start: Darth Vader retires, Artemis 1 (still) grounded (<a href="https://stuff.co.za/2022/09/26/light-start-darth-vader-retires-artemis-1-still-grounded-alleged-gta-6-hacker-arrested-and-starlink-slows-down/">link</a>)<br>
• LEGO puts the Artemis space program in the spotlight in its latest sets (<a href="https://www.clubic.com/mag/sciences/conquete-spatiale/actualite-411651-lego-met-le-programme-spatial-artemis-a-l-honneur-dans-ses-derniers-sets.html">link</a>)<br>

<p>At least 9 of the first 20 URLs in the notice demand the removal of non-infringing articles and news reports referencing the Artemis space program. None have anything to do with the content the sender claims to protect.</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1.png" alt="artemis-dmca-1" width="650" height="608" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1.png 700w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20608'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1.png 700w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1-300x281.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/artemis-dmca-1.png"></a></center>
<p>From a human perspective the demand for Google to deindex the third URL in the list is almost beyond words.</p>
<p>Published by <a href="https://cseinstitute.org/project-artemis-how-microsoft-is-using-ai-technology-to-prevent-disrupt-and-circumvent-traffickers/">The Villanova Law Institute</a>, the article reports on Project Artemis, a Microsoft AI initiative that aims to prevent the grooming and exploitation of vulnerable children.</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1.png" alt="Project Artemis-1" width="650" height="776" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1.png 754w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1-300x358.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20776'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1.png 754w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1-300x358.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Project-Artemis-1.png"></a></center>
<h2>Other Abusive Takedowns</h2>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-DMCA-2.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-DMCA-2.png" alt="Artemis DMCA-2" width="150" height="181" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20181'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-DMCA-2.png"></a>Sadly, the blunders detailed above just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Other publications also wrongfully targeted in this single notice include very well-known ones. Arguably, most if not all of these domains should be whitelisted; none are ever likely to publish images of an adult performer.</p>
<p><em>The BBC, Clubic, Coinmarket, AvaxGFX, Le Monde, El Pais, The Verge, The Star, The Street, La Presse, Rappler, Zeit, Globo, ORF, Astro Space, UK Government (gov.uk), YLE, Hackaday, Golem, CP24, Iowa College, Mars Society, New Atlas, and Global Fairs.</em> </p>
<p>After a while, long lists of URLs can lose some of their impact so to demonstrate that real articles are being targeted for deindexing, a small visual sample of the articles published under the URLs in the takedown notice can be seen below.</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns.png" alt="" width="650" height="391" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns.png 850w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20391'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns.png 850w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns-300x180.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/Artemis-takedowns.png"></a></center>
<p>Even more worrying is that the above examples were taken from the first 600 URLs in a single notice, leaving another 3,000 URLs to go in that notice alone. <em>(Link to the notice courtesy of Lumen Database <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/29908720?access_token=OGeWLonv5VmETW7TP5G6eA">here</a>)</em></p>
<h2>DMCA Piracy Prevention Inc.</h2>
<p><a href="https://m.gfy.com/fucking-around-and-business-discussion/1344895-dmca-piracy-prevention-inc.html">Theories</a> as to who might own and/or operate DMCA Piracy Prevention Inc. aren’t hard to find but the company does exist and is registered as a <a href="https://www.registreentreprises.gouv.qc.ca/RQAnonymeGR/GR/GR03/GR03A2_19A_PIU_RechEnt_PC/PageEtatRens.aspx?T1.JetonStatic=61cce860-7703-4978-8825-cbedf0a014dc&amp;T1.CodeService=S00436">corporate entity</a> in Canada.</p>

<p>Registered at the same address is a company with remarkably similar details. BranditScan is a <a href="https://www.registreentreprises.gouv.qc.ca/RQAnonymeGR/GR/GR03/GR03A2_19A_PIU_RechEnt_PC/PageEtatRens.aspx?T1.JetonStatic=61cce860-7703-4978-8825-cbedf0a014dc&amp;T1.CodeService=S00436">corporate entity</a> operating in exactly the same market offering similar if not identical services.</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan.png" alt="branditscan" width="650" height="126" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan.png 868w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20126'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan.png 868w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan-300x58.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/branditscan.png"></a></center>
<p>BranditScan has sent DMCA takedown notices to Google under three different notifier accounts. </p>
<p><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/reporters/341014">One account</a> sent takedown notices that requested the removal of 33,875 URLs, across 1,452 domains, on behalf of 53 copyright holders. <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/reporters/341018">A second account</a>, 30,781, 1,328, and 28 respectively. <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/reporters/341017">A third account</a> requested removal of 8,153 URLs, across 662 domains, on behalf of 28 copyright holders.</p>
<p>DMCA Piracy Prevention Inc., on the other hand, is listed under at least 60 accounts in Google’s transparency report, with most accounts sending between 1,000 and 4,500 takedown notices each. The main account for the company has sent massively more; over 51.6 million URLs requested for removal, across 58,431 domains, on behalf of 7,179 copyright holders.</p>
<h2>No Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/star-trek-fan-blog-triggers-new-entry-in-automatics-dmca-hall-of-shame-231120/">reported</a> in November 2023, DMCA Piracy Prevention began sending takedown notices to Tumblr at the beginning of the year and has since submitted over 300 complaints.</p>
<p>Unable to differentiate between copyright-infringing images of a model using the name ‘La Sirena’ and anything else using that name, the monitoring company demanded the removal of 90 Tumblr posts that matched a keyword search of “la sirena.” All of those posts were non-infringing and completely unrelated to the original content. </p>
<p>Tumblr’s takedown team rejected the notices, kept all the posts online, and added DMCA Piracy Protection to its ‘Hall of Shame’ instead.</p>
<p>“Copyright monitoring services should not flippantly report content entirely irrelevant to their clients’ content; that is an abuse of the DMCA,” Automattic noted at the time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, DMCA abuse rarely has consequences for those behind it.</p>

<p>After announcing the change in September, Amazon has today confirmed in an email to Prime members that Amazon Prime Video will begin showing ads alongside content unless customers pay an additional fee starting in January 2024.</p>



<p>Amazon Prime Video is a perk of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3POI0c0">overall Prime subscription</a> which is best known for offering free shipping from Amazon. Prime Video has historically offered its library of content ad-free, but that will change in about one month.</p>



<p>In an email to customers, Amazon confirms that ads will begin showing on Prime Video starting on January 29, 2024. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/09/22/amazon-prime-video-ads/">Previously, Amazon said the change would take place in “early” 2024</a>. Customers can avoid ads by paying an additional $2.99/month on top of their monthly or yearly Amazon Prime subscription. </p>



<p>Amazon’s email reads in part:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are writing to you today about an upcoming change to your Prime Video experience. Starting January 29, Prime Video movies and TV shows will include limited advertisements. This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required from you, and there is no change to the current price of your Prime membership.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email goes on to list the other benefits of Prime, as well as teasing “additional features and programs added in the future.” </p>



<p>As of today, Amazon is also opening up “pre-orders” for the ad-free subscription. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/acquisition/workflow?ref_=dvah&amp;workflowType=SubsPreOrderConsent&amp;ref_=pe_70187950_790552310&amp;tag=schoon0f-20">Through Amazon’s website, customers can pre-emptively sign up for the $2.99/month subscription</a> before the change actually takes place. </p>



<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3POI0c0">Amazon Prime currently costs $139/year when billed annually</a>, or $14.99/month. <a href="https://amzn.to/458GYff">Prime Video on its own runs $8.99/month</a>.</p>

As a matter of fact, the Game Boy brand covers two generations. Within the 4th generation we find the monochrome Game Boy and its revisions, and in the next generation resides the Game Boy Color (shipped after the demise of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/">Virtual Boy</a>). The good news is that this article covers both ends. So, in the end, you’ll get a good understanding of how the Game Boy works and how its technology subsequently evolved to become the Game Boy Color.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Instead of placing many off-the-shelf chips on the motherboard, Nintendo opted for a <strong>single-chip design</strong> to house (and hide) most of the components, including the CPU. This type of chip is called <strong>System On Chip</strong> (SoC) and, in this case, it’s been specifically crafted for this console, enabling Nintendo to tailor it to their needs (power efficiency, anti-piracy and extra I/O, among other things). At the same time, this chip can’t be found in any retail catalog, meaning competitors back then had a harder time cloning it.</p><p>That being said, the SoC found on the Game Boy is referred to as <strong>DMG-CPU</strong> or <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-realboy" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup> and, as the name indicates, it’s manufactured by <strong>Sharp Corporation</strong>. This company, along with Ricoh (the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#a-bit-of-context">NES’ CPU supplier</a>), enjoyed a close relationship with Nintendo.</p><h3 id="the-cpu-core">The CPU core</h3><p>Within DMG-CPU, the main processor is a <strong>Sharp SM83</strong> <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-gekkio" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup> and it’s a mix between the Z80 (the same CPU used on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#cpu">Sega Master System</a>) and the Intel 8080. It runs at <strong>~4.19 MHz</strong>, which is faster than the average 1-MHz CPU, but remember clock speeds <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#relative-comparison">can be deceiving</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/dmg_cpu.018e810ee7d690ab8ff9978bd7853a2b348121ca85d64214c259c5875026524e.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="300" height="238" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/dmg_cpu.018e810ee7d690ab8ff9978bd7853a2b348121ca85d64214c259c5875026524e.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>The DMG-CPU, found on the Game Boy’s motherboard.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, back when I did the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/">analysis of the Master system</a>, I explained the Z80 is itself a superset of the 8080. So, what does the SM83 actually have and lack from those two? <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-steil" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup></p><ul><li>Neither the Z80’s <code>IX</code> or <code>IY</code> registers nor the 8080’s <code>IN</code> or <code>OUT</code> instructions are included. This means that <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#accessing-the-rest-of-the-components">I/O ports</a> are not available. I’m not certain if that’s just a measure to reduce costs, but one thing for sure is that components will have to be <strong>completely memory-mapped</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-fayzullin" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>.</li><li>Only Intel 8080’s set of registers are implemented.

One example is the new <code>LDH</code> instruction (meaning ‘load from high RAM’ <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-ldh" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup>), which has been specifically included to operate the second half of the memory map (where addresses start at <code>$ff</code>) and, most importantly, fits in a single byte (instead of requiring two or more).</p><h4 id="the-color-effect">The Color effect</h4><p>Almost 10 years later, after the abandonment of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/">Virtual Boy</a> and its <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/virtual-boy/#cpu">cutting-edge hardware</a>, a humble successor arrived: the <strong>Game Boy Color</strong>. Inside it, there’s a new SoC named <strong>CPU CGB</strong> that carries a few additions. However, its SM83 CPU core remains the same, except for its doubled clock speed (now running at <strong>~8.38 MHz</strong>).</p><p>It’s hard to think that after a decade Nintendo would still bundle the same CPU, but such decision does come with the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Developers can re-use their current skills to program the new console.</li><li>There’s a cost saving by not having to re-design their system to work for a new architecture.</li><li>Backwards compatibility becomes possible without considerable effort.

Again, the PPU arbitrates access to VRAM.</figcaption></figure><p>Later on, with the Color variant, Nintendo enlarged WRAM to <strong>32 KB</strong>. However, since the CPU remained unchanged (particularly its addressing capabilities), it’s not possible to connect all the new memory without first overflowing the available address space. To tackle this, Nintendo’s engineers implemented <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#going-beyond-existing-capabilities">bank switching</a>. Originally found in <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#cartridgegame-data">NES cartridges</a>, the Game Boy Color uses the same principle to access those 32 KB only using 8 KB of memory space. The trick is simple: the last 4 KB can be swapped using eight different banks. Consequently, the CPU bundles an extra register (called <code>SVBK</code>) acting as the bank switcher, this is what developers must use to examine the extended memory.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>All graphics calculations are done by the CPU, and then the <strong>Picture Processing Unit</strong> or ‘PPU’ renders them. This is another component found inside DMG-CPU and it’s based on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">predecessor’s graphics chip</a> (of the same name).</p><p>The picture is displayed on an integrated LCD screen, it has a resolution of <strong>160×144 pixels</strong> and, in the case of the monochrome Game Boy, shows <strong>4 shades of grey</strong> (white, light grey, dark grey and black). Since the original Game Boy has a green LCD, the picture will look <em>greenish</em>.</p><p>If you’ve read the NES article before, you may remember that the PPU was designed to follow the CRT beam. However (and for obvious reasons), we got an LCD screen in the Game Boy. Well, the new PPU also follows that methodology as LCDs require to be refreshed too. In doing so, this console will enjoy <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/##tab-5-4-background-split">CRT-based effects</a> that previously enabled NES developers to come up with imaginative content.</p><h3 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h3><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu.0adaeb84d076416fb4cbeb3f70d69c81ec850b2ed5ca17b6873d80e6eda47542.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="644" height="332" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu.0adaeb84d076416fb4cbeb3f70d69c81ec850b2ed5ca17b6873d80e6eda47542.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>Memory architecture of the PPU.</figcaption></figure><p>The PPU is connected to <strong>8 KB of VRAM</strong> or ‘Display RAM’. In doing so, it also provides arbitrated access to the CPU. Those 8 KB will contain most of the data the PPU will need to render graphics. The remaining materials will instead be stored inside the PPU, as they require faster access rates.</p><p>The game is in charge of populating the different areas with the correct type of data. Moreover, the PPU exposes registers so the game can instruct the PPU on how that data is organised.

You will see now what are the additions of the so-called ‘Color’ model of this brand.</p><h4 id="modes-of-operation">Modes of operation</h4><p>To begin with, for compatibility reasons, the new PPU has <strong>two modes of operation</strong>. Yet, Nintendo wanted Color users to see enhancements even with the monochrome-only games. Consequently, the two modes of operation are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>CGB mode</strong>: Extended PPU mode with all the visual improvements that comprise the new Game Boy Color games.</li><li><strong>DMG mode</strong>: Traditional mode with all the extras disabled. However, you’ll see in the ‘Operating System’ section that monochrome games are nonetheless enhanced with colour palettes.</li></ul><h4 id="organising-the-new-content">Organising the (new) content</h4><p>The CGB motherboard now houses <strong>16 KB of VRAM</strong> instead, which is double the original VRAM amount. Due to the CPU’s addressing limitations, this new arrangement is implemented in the form of <strong>two 8 KB banks</strong>, with a new register (called <code>VBK</code>) acting as a switcher. On the other side, the PPU can access the two banks at the same time. At the end of the day, this means programmers only need to fill the VRAM banks with the help of <code>VBK</code>, and then specify in the tile map the bank where the tile is found, so the PPU can take care of the rest.</p><p>That being said, what can you do with the extra VRAM? Many things:</p><ul><li>Store more tiles.</li><li>Store more palettes, especially <em>coloured</em> ones.</li><li>Extend the tile metadata space to encode more effects and address extra palettes.</li></ul><h5 id="the-visuals">The visuals</h5><p>Thanks to the new PPU, programmers can now define colour palettes with <strong>32,768 colors</strong> to choose from.</p><p>Firstly, developers must now populate a new area called <strong>Palette Memory</strong>, which stores up to <strong>eight colour palettes</strong> that encode <strong>four colours</strong> <sup id="bibref:10"><a href="#bib:cpu-nintendo" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></sup>. Each entry fits in a 16-bit value (2 bytes) and only 15 bits are used. Palette Memory is not addressed by the CPU, however, a new register is used as a buffer to write over this memory. This is what the CPU follows to define the palettes.</p><p>Having said that, Background and Window tiles can reference any of those eight palettes. The same happens with Sprite tiles, except they are constrained to three-colour palettes, as one entry is reserved for the ‘transparent’ colour.</p><p>Moving on, <strong>Tile sets are now twice as big</strong>. Thus, programmers can store double the amount of tiles in VRAM. <strong>Background/Window Tile maps have been extended</strong> as well, resulting in extra meta-data being encoded. Consequently, expanding the capabilities of these layers. For instance, their tiles can now be <strong>horizontally and vertically flipped</strong>, saving the game from storing duplicated graphics in VRAM (which, in turn, can be exploited to draw more unique content).</p><p>Furthermore, CPU CGB also bundles <strong>two extra DMA units</strong>, both can copy the contents of the Game Pak or WRAM to VRAM, but their timings differ <sup id="bibref:11"><a href="#bib:cpu-nintendo" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>General-purpose DMA</strong>: The transfer will happen at any time and the DMA will get priority over any other memory access.

This made it possible to exchange data wirelessly between Game Boy Colors, as seen in games like Pokemon Gold and similar. However, you will find that the system doesn’t implement any communication protocol, only a single register (<code>RP</code>) that encodes the IR sensor’s action (emit or receive), the single bit (<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) being transferred and the last bit received.

				"It's like visiting an old friend for the holidays," <a href="https://thenewstack.io/donald-knuths-2023-christmas-lecture-make-the-cells-dance/">according to this article</a>:

<i>Approaching his 86th birthday, Donald Knuth — Stanford's beloved computer science guru — honored what's become a long-standing tradition. He gave <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/donald-e-knuth-lectures">a December "Christmas lecture</a>" that's also <a href="https://youtu.be/622iPkJfYrI">streamed online</a> for all of his fans...<p> 

More than 60 years ago, back in 1962, a 24-year-old Donald Knuth first started writing <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> — a comprehensive analysis of algorithms which, here in 2023, he's still trying to finish. And <a href="https://youtu.be/0TOK73ij7C0?list=PLoROMvodv4rOAvKVR_dyCigSBMcYjevYB">30 years ago</a> Knuth also began making rare live appearances each December in front of audiences of Stanford students...</p><p> 
Recently Stanford <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOAvKVR_dyCigSBMcYjevYB">uploaded several decades</a> of Knuth's past Christmas lectures, along with a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNbeodV7vqxxxWpe4s_SFty">22 videos of Knuth from 1985</a> titled "the 'Aha' Sessions'" (courses in mathematical problem-solving). There are also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rN1PKcXvzjor-Bl6o6eSNTN">two different</a> sets of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNrDaAftaqMRQEmsARSpLHi">five videos</a> from 1981 showing Knuth introducing his newly-created typesetting system TeX. There are even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rM2JuHk3qBhQDxY9QGrLrYE">12 videos</a> from 1982 of what Knuth calls "an intensive course about the internal details."</p><p> 

And on Dec. 6, wearing his traditional brown holiday sweater, Knuth gave yet another live demonstration of the beautifully clear precision that's made him famous.</p></i><br>

            <pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 20:13:48 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t">https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/fuse-t</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38775579">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Abstract</h2>
<p dir="auto">FUSE-T is a kext-less implementation of FUSE for macOS that uses NFS v4 local server instead of a kernel extension.<br>
The main motivation is to replace 'macfuse' project (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://osxfuse.github.io/</a>) that implements its own kext to make fuse work.
With each version of macOS it's getting harder and harder to load kernel extensions. Apple strongly discourages it thus making software distributions that use 'macfuse' difficult to install. Additionally, the 'macfuse' kext is unstable, may cause frequent system crashes and kernel lock-ups. Given those limitations many software publishers are unable to use 'macfuse' project anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">FUSE-T doesn't make use of kernel extension, it implements its own userspace server that converts between FUSE protocol and NFS and let macOS mount NFS volume instead of a kernel filesystem.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The main features of FUSE-T</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Drop-in replacement for 'macfuse' (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://osxfuse.github.io/</a>). API headers in libfuse are unchanged so there's no need to change anything in filesystem implementation. The APIs are compatible with 'macfuse' but differ from the Linux version of libfuse and this is because the 'macfuse' project was not updated in sync with the Linux version</li>
<li>Kext-less, no kernel extensions needed</li>
<li>NFSv4 protocol to better support macOS features such as extended attributes, file locks and others</li>
<li>Stable, easy to mount and unmount volumes with macOS built-in tools, no need for proprietary fusermount</li>
<li>Performance, FUSE-T offers much better performance and this is due to excellent macOS client side NFSv4 implementation</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How FUSE-T works</h2>
<p dir="auto">When a filesystem issues a mount API call, libfuse launches a FUSE-T NFS server that exposes a local TCP port to the macOS mount proccess and another communication channel to libfuse. After that a macOS mount_nfs command is executed and NFS rpcs are getting called on the server.
The server converts NFS rpc calls into FUSE requests that emulate original kernel-libfuse protocol. Those requests are executed in libfuse and corresponding FUSE filesystem, then the result is converted back to the macOS NFS client.
After the filesystem process dies the NFS server terminates as well and it also unmounts the NFS folder mounted previously.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other details</h2>
<p dir="auto">See wiki for more information.</p>

They might then administer another treatment, such as chemo or radiation therapy, to kill any cancer cells they missed.</p><p>Even if a person is cancer-free after this, there’s always a chance of the melanoma coming back, and certain types are considered <a href="https://www.aimatmelanoma.org/after-treatment/what-is-recurrence/">high-risk for recurrence</a>, including ones that are particularly thick or that had metastasized (spread to other parts of the body) prior to treatment.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p> “This is a pretty significant improvement, a pretty dramatic improvement over standard of care.”</p>
<cite>Stephen Hoge</cite></blockquote><p><strong>The </strong><strong>cancer vaccine</strong><strong>:</strong> Moderna and pharma giant Merck are developing an mRNA-based cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157 (V940), for people who’ve had high-risk melanomas removed.</p><p>The vaccine works by instructing the body to make up to 34 “neoantigens.” These are proteins found only on the cancer cells, and Moderna personalizes the vaccine for each recipient so that it carries instructions for the neoantigens on <em>their</em> cancer cells.</p><p>The idea behind the vaccine is that, by prompting the body to make these proteins, it can prepare the immune system to quickly identify and attack any new cancer cells bearing them, preventing recurrence.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s new? </strong>In the ongoing phase 2b KEYNOTE-942 study, Moderna and Merck are comparing the cancer vaccine’s ability to prevent melanoma recurrence or death when combined with Keytruda, Merck’s FDA-approved cancer treatment, to Keytruda alone.</p><p>In 2022, they reported that the <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/mrna-cancer-vaccine">combo therapy</a> reduced high-risk patients’ risk of recurrence or death by 44% compared to only Keytruda in the two years after treatment.</p><p>They’ve now <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Moderna-And-Merck-Announce-mRNA-4157-V940-In-Combination-with-KeytrudaR-Pembrolizumab-Demonstrated-Continued-Improvement-in-Recurrence-Free-Survival-and-Distant-Metastasis-Free-Survival-in-Patients-with-High-Risk-Stage-IIIIV-Melanoma-Following-Comple/default.aspx">announced</a> that people who received both therapies were 49% less likely to experience recurrence or death a median of three years after treatment compared to people in the Keytruda-only group. They were also 62% less likely to experience distant metastasis or death.</p><p>“The durability of the responses is really strong — they’re essentially rock solid through this time,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/benefits-moderna-merck-melanoma-vaccine-plus-keytruda-extend-three-years-2023-12-14/">told Reuters</a>. “This is a pretty significant improvement, a pretty dramatic improvement over standard of care with just Keytruda alone.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>“We think that in some countries the product could be launched under accelerated approval by 2025.”</p><cite>Stephane Bancel</cite></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> The KEYNOTE-942 study is relatively small, with just 157 participants, but Moderna and Merck have already <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Merck-and-Moderna-Initiate-Phase-3-Study-Evaluating-V940-mRNA-4157-in-Combination-with-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-Adjuvant-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Resected-High-Risk-Stage-IIB-IV-Melanoma/default.aspx">launched a phase 3 trial</a> for the combination cancer therapy that will include more than 1,000 people with high-risk melanoma.</p><p>The companies are also looking beyond melanoma, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2023/Merck-and-Moderna-Initiate-INTerpath-002-a-Phase-3-Study-Evaluating-V940-mRNA-4157-in-Combination-with-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-for-Adjuvant-Treatment-of-Patients-with-Certain-Types-of-Resected-Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer-/default.aspx">launching</a> a phase 3 trial testing the cancer vaccine in people with non-small cell lung cancer — and if these trials go well, it might not be long before the personalized therapy reaches patients.</p><p>“We think that in some countries the product could be launched under accelerated approval by 2025,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/moderna-ceo-says-melanoma-vaccine-could-be-available-by-2025-32ee9605">told AFP</a>.</p><p><em>We’d love to hear from you!

    </div><p>The reintroduction of wolves in Colorado this month will proceed as planned after a federal judge on Friday 15 Dec. denied ranchers' request to stop the state's efforts to allow for further environmental analysis.</p>


										      
																																	<p>U.S. District Judge Regina Rodriguez denied a request by the Colorado Cattlemen's Association and Gunnison County Stockgrowers' Association to halt the reintroduction of the controversial canines, finding it "contrary to the public's interest in seeing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gray+wolves/" rel="tag">gray wolves</a> released in Colorado."</p>
<p>Voters approved the reintroduction in 2020, and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wolves/" rel="tag">wolves</a> could be on the ground in Colorado as early as Monday.</p>
<p>The request for the delay was filed as part of a federal <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lawsuit/" rel="tag">lawsuit</a> the two ranching groups filed Monday against Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The lawsuit alleges the government agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement about the wolves while renewing a cooperative agreement between the two agencies about conserving <a href="https://phys.org/tags/endangered+species/" rel="tag">endangered species</a>.</p>
<p>But Rodriguez found the agencies did comply with the National Environmental Policy Act through "extensive public involvement," including several opportunities for public comment and peer review.</p>
<p>"While the Petitioners who have lived and worked on the land for many years are understandably concerned about possible impacts of this reintroduction, neither these possible impacts nor their assertions under the Administrative Procedures Act are sufficient for this Court to grant the extraordinary relief they seek," Rodriguez wrote in the ruling, which was published late Friday.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The lawsuit and subsequent filings by the livestock groups asked to halt the reintroduction, which is mandated to take place by the end of 2023. The cattlemen's lawsuit alleges the reintroduction could harm the endangered Gunnison sage grouse populations and kill or stress cattle.</p>
<p>Andrew Spann, president of the Gunnison County Stockgrowers' Association, testified during a court hearing Thursday that he wants to see an analysis of how the eventual population of hundreds of wolves would affect the lands, recreation and economies of Colorado.</p>
<p>"This issue is not just producers worried about their cows being killed. … This about what are the impacts and how are we going to address those going forward," Spann said.</p>
<p>But potential harm to sage grouse or cattle does not rise to the level of irreparable harm that would cause the court to intervene, Rodriguez wrote in the ruling.</p>
<p>"To satisfy its burden of proving irreparable harm, the party seeking injunctive relief must show that the harm is 'certain and great' and not speculative," Rodriguez wrote. "Here, Petitioners have not presented evidence demonstrating that harm will occur if their requested relief is not granted, nor have they demonstrated such harm, if it did occur, would be irreparable."</p>
<p>During the Thursday hearing, Lisa Reynolds, attorney for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said the ranchers' lawsuit was a "last-ditch effort" to halt the reintroduction, which has been in the works since voters in 2020 approved the reintroduction.</p>

																																			<p>"Now, at the eleventh hour they want to put a halt to the three-year plan for reintroduction under the guise of a need for more study and analysis," Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the Fish and Wildlife Service on Thursday argued that they did not need to conduct an environmental impact review to renew the cooperative agreement, which has been in place for decades. The federal agency has never prepared an environmental impact statement when renewing similar legal agreements across the country, said Brian Herman, attorney for the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>Further, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did conduct an environmental impact review for the reintroduction of wolves, although under a different federal process, Herman said. The service analyzed the environmental impact of reintroducing wolves while preparing the federal 10(j) rule that will allow for the killing or hazing of wolves in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Wildlife advocacy groups slammed the lawsuit, calling it "ridiculous," "flimsy" and a "red herring."</p>
<p>"For the past three years, the concerns of ranchers and livestock owners have been elevated in painstaking and deliberate state and federal processes," Lindsay Larris, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wildlife/" rel="tag">wildlife</a> program director for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. "Government officials have bent over backward to accommodate this special interest, but apparently, nothing but the complete absence of wolves on the landscape will be enough."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Although Rodriguez denied the request to delay the reintroduction, the lawsuit will proceed in federal court, along with another lawsuit filed against the reintroduction.</p>
<p>Conservation groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife, praised the court order in statements Friday.</p>
<p>"I'm relieved that the court saw right through the livestock industry's self-serving and meritless arguments," said Alli Henderson, southern Rockies director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. "Both science and Colorado voters have very clearly told us that wolves belong here. Once wolves are reintroduced, they'll help restore balance to our state's ecosystems."</p>
<p>Colorado Conservation Alliance and two of its <a href="https://phys.org/tags/board+members/" rel="tag">board members</a> on Thursday sued the Fish and Wildlife Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife in federal court alleging the environmental impact statement completed for the 10(j) rule was insufficient. The analysis did not look at potential impacts to the endangered Mexican wolf and did not adequately look at how wolves might affect deer, elk and other prey, the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The lawsuit asks the judge to halt the reintroduction until a more thorough environmental impact statement is completed. A hearing has not yet been set in that lawsuit, nor have the two <a href="https://phys.org/tags/government+agencies/" rel="tag">government agencies</a> filed legal responses to the lawsuit.</p>

<span></span>It can display your digital&nbsp;calendar.</h4>
<h4>And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;open for your custom&nbsp;content.</h4>

<p>A beautiful e-paper screen that syncs with your Google account and displays your Google calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also an API for building applications, which you can keep for yourself or share with others.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Stay on top of things<br>
</h3>
<div><p>Get a feel for the week, without opening your computer or scrolling through your phone. The electronic ink display doesn't clamor for your attention, but it's there when you need it. And the hand-finished wooden frame looks good on the wall and on the desk.</p></div>
<h3>Set and forget</h3>
<div><p>Use your smartphone to configure. Connect to your Google account and select which calendars to display. Choose a layout and tweak it to your needs. From then on, it will update when things change - day for day, week for week.</p></div>
<h3>For the home...</h3>
<div><p>Unlike a paper-based family planner, the Invisible Calendar is up-to-date with what's in everyone's phones. Even the kids can catch a glance at the weekend - and know when to schedule that sleepover.</p></div>
<h3>... and for the office.</h3>
<p><br data-mce-fragment="1">Feel free to ignore your emails for a little longer. If a meeting pops up, you will see it on the calendar. And on Monday morning, it gives you a feel for the week: Which days are busy? When will be time to dive deep? Maybe let's block some time on Wednesday?</p>

                                                                                                                                    <p>The research, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2023.23147?guestAccessKey=e0cef9be-d55c-4bcf-8892-412af8f24355">published</a> Dec. 26 in <i>JAMA</i>, is among a handful of recent nationwide analyses of how <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/private+equity/" rel="tag">private equity</a> takeovers affect the quality of patient care in hospitals. The increases are seen in conditions or outcomes deemed preventable and are key measures of hospital safety and quality.</p>
<p>The findings come amid growing concerns about private <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/equity/" rel="tag">equity</a>'s increasing role in U.S. health care, with <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care">$1 trillion invested in the past decade</a>.</p>
<p>"We had previously found that private equity acquisitions led to higher charges, prices, and societal spending," said Zirui Song, associate professor of health care policy and medicine in the Blavatnik Institute and director of research in the Center for Primary Care at HMS. "Now, we're learning that there are also downstream concerns for the clinical quality of care delivered to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital+patients/" rel="tag">hospital patients</a>."</p>
<p>The researchers said the findings are alarming because they may reflect bottom-line incentives overshadowing patient care and safety.</p>
<p>"Hospital success is measured not only in dollars or the number of patients who pass through the doors, but also in lives saved, complication rates, patient satisfaction, and a number of other quality and safety metrics," said HMS research fellow Sneha Kannan, a physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. "We need to make sure we fully understand the costs and benefits of this prominent new force in health care."</p>
<p>The economic repercussions of private equity acquisitions are not a new concern. Previous studies by Song and co-author Joseph Dov Bruch of the University of Chicago indicate that this high-debt, for-profit financial model of hospital ownership may also lead <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769549">to increased spending</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2795946">other economic implications</a>. Many have expressed concerns about hospital bankruptcies under private equity ownership that often leave underserved populations with limited access to care. But up until now, the effects of private equity deals on <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2023-075244">patient health and quality of care</a> have remained understudied and poorly understood.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Why private equity is different</h2>
<p>"When health systems buy hospitals, they generally do not use borrowed money," said Song, who is also an internal medicine physician at Mass General. "In contrast, the classic private equity buyout uses a small amount of cash, but a large amount of debt."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/private+equity+firm/" rel="tag">private equity firm</a> raises some capital from investors and borrows the rest, putting debt on the acquired hospital with its physical assets, such as land and buildings, as collateral for the loan. The acquired hospital must then generate revenue to pay down that debt.</p>
<p>Private equity generates revenue by charging management fees to its investors—commonly, pension funds, endowments, and other institutions or individuals—as well as by focusing on high-revenue procedures, cost-cutting, reorganization, and financial engineering.</p>
<p>One argument in favor of private equity investments is that many struggling hospitals need capital and management expertise. However, most private equity buyouts are of successful operations. Private equity firms want to buy going concerns that are able to take on debt and generate revenue in the short run. These <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/financial+pressures/" rel="tag">financial pressures</a> can create perverse incentives favoring profit over patients, the researchers say.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Private equity and quality of care</h2>
<p>For this study, the researchers examined insurance claims data for all fee-for-service Medicare hospitalizations from 2009 to 2019, totaling more than 600,000 hospitalizations at 51 private equity hospitals and more than 4 million hospitalizations at 259 similar hospitals not acquired by private equity. The hospitals not acquired by private equity served as the control group to control for other factors that may have affected outcomes.</p>
<p>The researchers compared how often patients experienced certain outcomes before and after the hospital was acquired by private equity. For example, they looked at how often patients fell while in the hospital or how often they developed an infection after a procedure or a surgery. The team also analyzed the makeup of the patient populations and various other outcomes such as how often patients died, how long they stayed at the hospital, and how often they ended up readmitted after leaving the hospital.</p>
<p>After a hospital was acquired by private equity, admitted Medicare patients had a 25% increase in hospital-acquired complications, compared with patients admitted before acquisition. Patients also had 27% more falls and 38% more bloodstream infections caused by central lines, which are temporary surgically inserted ports that allow easy intravenous access for patients receiving repeated drug infusions or other treatments.</p>
<p>The increase was seen despite private equity hospitals' placing 16% fewer central lines than before the buyout. All of these results were calculated while taking into account changes, trends, and patterns over the same period of time at peer hospitals not owned by private equity to isolate the differences that were due to the change in ownership.</p>
<p>Curiously, the study found a small drop in hospital deaths at private equity hospitals. This, the researchers said, may be due to social and demographic factors—private equity patients were younger and less disadvantaged than those at peer hospitals not owned by private equity. It may also be due to patients getting transferred more often out of private equity hospitals. When the researchers followed patients longer after discharge, the small decrease in deaths dissipated within a month after leaving the hospital.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Framework for policy solutions</h2>
<p>Policymakers, insurance companies, and public sector bodies have grown increasingly concerned about protecting patients and societal resources from the effects of private equity transactions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Song and Christopher Cai, a HMS clinical fellow in medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, outlined <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2804025">such a policy framework</a> in a <i>JAMA</i> viewpoint article, which included regulating fraud and abuse, increasing antitrust oversight, reducing moral hazard (such as by lowering the debt used in acquisitions), protecting against inflated prices, and transparency in reporting of private equity acquisitions.</p>
<p>Currently, only private equity acquisitions over $111.4 million must be reported. This threshold may capture many hospital acquisitions but leaves out most acquisitions of physician practices.</p>
<p>"Private equity firms have historically operated in the shadows in health care," Kannan said. "Going forward, it's important to lift the veil and increase transparency."</p>
<p>And both researchers and policymakers should be rigorous in their efforts to understand how private equity changes health care operations and the downstream consequences, the authors cautioned.</p>
<p>"Patients and providers, investors and taxpayers, employers and insurers, all have a stake in this," Song said. "Understanding what the corporatization of health care delivery means is a goal shared by many across society."</p>

<p>Apple is banned from selling the Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 in the US after President Joe Biden’s administration refused to grant a reprieve from a trade tribunal’s decision that it had infringed another company’s patents.</p>
<p>Apple confirmed on Tuesday it had appealed against the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/apple-watch-facing-potential-ban-after-losing-masimo-patent-case/">earlier ruling from the US International Trade Commission</a>, which stems from a patent dispute with health technology company Masimo.</p>
<p>Biden’s administration had 60 days from the ITC decision, which was handed down in October, to decide whether to allow it to take effect. The authority to decide whether to intervene was delegated by the White House to the US trade representative, Katherine Tai.</p>
<p>“After careful consultations, Ambassador Tai decided not to reverse the ITC’s determination and the ITC’s decision became final on December 26 2023,” Tai’s office said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Apple said it strongly disagreed with the ITC’s decision and exclusion order and was “taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the US as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Ahead of a final decision from the White House, Apple had said it would preemptively halt sales of the affected models in the US on its website from December 21, and in physical stores from December 24.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It is exceptionally rare for the White House to wade into such cases, although the Obama administration vetoed a patent ban on iPhones and iPads in 2013 during the company’s legal dispute with Samsung.</p>
<p>The ruling deals a blow to Apple, which is already facing a slowdown in hardware sales this year. Earlier models of the Apple Watch remain available in the US, and Apple says the ban will have no impact on service for customers who have already bought the new models.</p>
<p>The case stems from a legal dispute between Apple and Irvine, California-headquartered Masimo over patents on the technology for measuring blood oxygen levels on the devices. The method, known as pulse oximetry, measures oxygen in the blood by shining light into the wrist.</p>
<p>Apple first introduced the technology in 2020, in an effort to draw in more consumers and give them the incentive to upgrade with new features on the device. Masimo said Apple copied its patented technology.</p>
<p>The US International Trade Commission ruled in Masimo’s favor, issuing a “limited exclusion order” against Apple’s products.</p>
<p>Masimo has separately sued Apple in federal court alleging trade secret violations. A trial in that case ended with a hung jury in May.</p>
<p>Apple is similarly embroiled in litigation with medical wearables company AliveCor over the heart rate monitoring technology on its watches. In December 2022 the ITC upheld a judge’s ruling that Apple violated AliveCor’s patents.</p>
<p>But that same month, the US Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidated the AliveCor patents at the center of the dispute, putting any potential ban on hold pending appeals.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/26/thermal_management_is_changing/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/26/thermal_management_is_changing/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38772980">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Analysis</span> As Moore's Law slowed to a crawl, chips, particularly those used in AI and high-performance computing (HPC), have steadily gotten hotter. In 2023 we saw accelerators enter the kilowatt range with the arrival of Nvidia's GH200 Superchips.</p>
<p>We've known these chips would be hot for a while now – Nvidia has been teasing the CPU-GPU <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/09/nvidia_gracehopper_hbm3e/">franken-chip</a> for the better part of two years. What we didn't know until recently is how OEMs and systems builders would respond to such a power-dense part. Would most of the systems be liquid cooled? Or, would most stick to air cooling? How many of these accelerators would they try to cram into a single box, and how big would the box be?</p>
<p>Now that the first systems based on the GH200 make their way to market, it's become clear that form factor is very much being dictated by power density than anything else. It essentially boils down to how much surface area you have to dissipate the heat.</p>

    

<p>Dig through the systems available today from Supermicro, Gigabyte, QCT, Pegatron, HPE, and others and you'll quickly notice a trend. Up to about 500 W per rack unit (RU) – 1 kW in the case of Supermicro's MGX <a target="_blank" href="https://www.supermicro.com/en/accelerators/nvidia/mgx" rel="nofollow">ARS-111GL-NHR</a> – these systems are largely air cooled. While hot, it's still a manageable thermal load to dissipate, working out to about 21-24 kW per rack. That's well within the power delivery and thermal management capacity of modern datacenters, especially those making use of rear door heat exchangers.</p>

        


        

<p>However, this changes when system builders start cramming more than a kilowatt of accelerators into each chassis. At this point most of the OEM systems we looked at switched to direct liquid cooling. Gigabyte's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/High-Density-Server/H263-V11-rev-LAW1" rel="nofollow">H263-V11</a>, for example, offers up to four GH200 nodes in a single 2U chassis.</p>
<p>That's two kilowatts per rack unit. So while a system like Nvidia's air-cooled DGX H100 with its eight 700 W H100s and twin Sapphire Rapids CPUs has a higher TDP at 10.2 kW, it's actually less power dense at 1.2 kW/RU.</p>

        

<p>There are a couple advantages to liquid cooling beyond a more efficient transfer of heat from these densely packed accelerators. The higher the system power is, the more static pressure and air flow you need to remove the heat from the system. This means using hotter, faster fans that use more power – potentially as much as 20 percent of system power in some cases.</p>
<p>Beyond about 500 W per rack unit, most of the OEMs and ODMs seem to be opting for liquid cooled chassis as fewer, slower fans are required to cool lower-power components like NICs, storage, and other peripherals.</p>
<p>You only have to look at HPE's Cray EX254n blades to see just how much a liquid-cooled chassis has. That platform can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/press-release/2023/11/hewlett-packard-enterprise-and-nvidia-accelerate-ai-training-with-new-turnkey-solution.html" rel="nofollow">support</a> up to four GH200s. That's potentially 4 kW in a 1U compute blade and that's not even counting the NICs used to keep the chips fed with data.</p>

        

<p>Of course, the folks at HPE's Cray division do know a thing or two about cooling ultra-dense compute components. It does, however, illustrate the amount of thought systems builders put into their servers, not just at a systems level but at the rack level.</p>
<h3>Rack level takes off</h3>
<p>As we mentioned before with the Nvidia DGX H100 systems, cooling a multi-kilowatt server on its own is something OEMs are well acquainted with. But as soon as you try and fill a rack with these systems, things become a bit more complicated with factors like rack power and facility cooling coming into play.</p>
<p>We dove into the challenges that datacenter operators like Digital Reality have had to overcome in order to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/05/30/mgx-nvidia-standardizes-multi-generation-server-designs/">support dense deployments of these kinds of systems</a> over on our sibling publication <em>The Next Platform</em>.</p>
<p>In many cases, the colocation provider needed to rework its power and cooling infrastructure to support 40-plus kilowatts of power and heat required to pack four of these DGX H100 systems into a single rack.</p>
<p>But if your datacenter or colocation provider can't supply that kind of power rack or contend with the heat, there's not much sense in trying to make these system's this dense when most of the rack is going to sit empty.</p>

</ul>
<p>With the launch of the GH200, we've seen Nvidia focus less on the individual systems and more on rack-scale deployments. We caught our first glimpse of this during Computex this spring with its DGX GH200 cluster.</p>
<p>Rather than a bunch of dense GPU-packed nodes, the system is actually <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/29/nvidia_dgx_gh200_nvlink/">comprised</a> of 256 2U nodes each with a single GH200 accelerator inside. Combined, the system is capable of pumping out an exaFLOPS of FP8 performance, but should be much easier to deploy at a facilities level. Instead of 1.2 kW/RU now you're looking at closer to 500 W/RU, which is right about where most OEMs are landing with their own air-cooled systems.</p>
<p>More recently we've seen Nvidia condense a smaller version of this down to a single rack with the GH200-NVL32 <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/one-giant-superchip-for-llms-recommenders-and-gnns-introducing-nvidia-gh200-nvl32/" rel="nofollow">announced</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/28/aws_graviton_trainium/">collaboration with AWS at Re:Invent this fall</a>.</p>
<p>That system packs 16 1U chassis, each equipped with two GH200 nodes, into a single rack and meshes them together using nine NVLink switch trays. Needless to say, at 2 kW/RU of compute these are dense little systems and thus were designed to be liquid cooled from the get-go.</p>
<h3>Hotter chips on the way</h3>
<p>While we've focused on Nvidia's Grace Hopper Superchips, the chipmaker is hardly the only one pushing TDPs to new limits in pursuit of performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, AMD <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/06/amd_mi300_gpu/">spilled</a> the tea on its latest AI and HPC GPUs and APUs, which see the company's Instinct accelerators jump from 560 W last gen to as high as 760 W. That's still not the kilowatt of power demanded by the GH200, but it's a sizable increase.</p>
<p>More importantly, AMD CTO Mark Papermaster <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/amd_cto_interview/">told</a> <em>The Register</em> that there's still plenty of headroom to push TDPs even higher over the next few years.</p>
<p>Whether this will eventually drive chipmakers to mandate liquid cooling for their flagship parts remains unanswered. According to Papermaster, AMD is going to support air and liquid cooling on their platforms. But as we've seen with AMD's new MI300A APU, continuing to opt for air cooling will almost certainly mean performance concessions.</p>
<p>The MI300A is nominally rated for 550 W. That's far less than the 850 W we'd been led to believe it'd suck down under load, but given adequate cooling, it can run even hotter. In an HPC-tuned system, like those developed by HPE, Eviden (Atos), or Lenovo, the chip can be configured to run at 760 W.</p>
<p>Intel, meanwhile, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/intel_liquid_cooling/">exploring</a> novel methods for cooling 2 kW chips using two-phase coolants and coral-inspired heatsinks designed to promote the formation of bubbles.</p>
<p>The chipmaker has also announced extensive partnerships with infrastructure and chemical vendors to expand the use of liquid cooling technologies. The company's latest collab aims to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vertiv.com/en-us/about/news-and-insights/corporate-news/vertiv-collaborates-with-intel-on-liquid-cooled-solution-for-the-intel-gaudi3-ai-accelerator-platform/" rel="nofollow">develop</a> a cooling solution for Intel's upcoming Guadi3 AI accelerator using Vertiv's pumped two-phase cooling tech. ®</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The first step in building my text editor is to implement the core API. If you’re wondering why I want to do this, the original article is <a href="https://www.averylaird.com/programming/2017/09/22/the-text-editor/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I researched several data types, and I tried to be <em>language agnostic</em>. I wanted my decision to not be influenced by any particular language, and first see if there was a “best way” out there, solely based on operations. Of course, a “best way” rarely exists. However, in the case of text manipulation and storage, there are some clear “worst ways” and “better ways.”</p>

<h2 id="the-worst-way">The Worst Way</h2>

<p>The worst way to store and manipulate text is to use an array. Firstly, the entire file must be loaded into the array first, which raises issues with time and memory. Even worse still, every insertion and deletion requires each element in the array to be moved. There are more downsides, but already this method is clearly not practical. The array can be dismissed as an option rather quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way: this isn’t a challenge. Please don’t try to find worse ways to manipulate text.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-good-way">A Good Way</h2>

<p>Another option is a binary tree structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a>. Skip to the <a href="#a-rope">next section</a> if binary trees aren’t your thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are unfamiliar with binary trees, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">this</a> as a starting point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the string is split into sections, and stored in the leaves. The weight of each leaf is the length of the string segment. The weight of each non-leaf node is the total length of the strings on its left subtree. For example, in the diagram<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> below, node \(E\) is a leaf with a string segment \(6\) characters long. Therefore, it has a weight of \(6\), as well as its parent node. However, node \(B\) has a weight of \(9\), because nodes \(E\) and \(F\) together have a length of \(9\).</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8986fc0e21194eb3f0a009ef73b3ebffc159ee68/2bf14/static/rope-data-structure.png" alt="Source: Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)"></p>

<p>This is a lot more efficient than an array. A rope has two main operations, <code>Split</code> and <code>Concat</code> (concatenation). <code>Split</code> splits one string into two strings at a given index, and <code>Concat</code> concatenates two strings into one. You can preform either an insert or delete with either of these two basic operations. To insert characters, you can split the string once (where you want to insert the content) and concatenate it twice (on either side of the inserted content). Deletions work similarly, by splitting the string twice, and concatenating them again without including the deleted content.</p>

<p>There’s a big downside. Using a rope is quite confusing and complicated. It’s difficult to explain even in an abstract manner. Working out the kinks in real life, while still making the code maintainable and readable, seems like a nightmare. What’s more, it still uses a lot of space. It didn’t seem like the best option yet, so I kept looking.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-way">A Better Way</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">Gap Buffer</a> is much simpler than the rope. The idea is this: operations on text are often localized. Most of the time, we’re not jumping all over the document. So, we create a “gap” between characters stored in an array. We keep track of how large the gap is by using pointers or array indices. Let’s examine two cases (using pointers):</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Insertion</strong></dt>
  <dd>The gap is a certain size to begin with. We copy over the inserted content, and if it exceeds the size of the gap, we expand the gap.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Deletion</strong></dt>
  <dd>We shift the pointers of the gap to include the deleted content.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This is makes a lot of sense. We are plagued somewhat by the same issues as an array; under certain circumstances, if we move too far from the gap, every element in the array will have to be moved. However, it’s most likely that this is a rare occurrence for the average user. It is quite possible that the speed gained with most operations will outweigh the inefficiency of certain edge cases. In fact, the editor I’m writing this in – <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> – uses a gap buffer, and it’s probably the fastest editor I’ve ever used. That fact alone is a pretty convincing argument to use a gap buffer. But if I’m starting from scratch, I want every aspect of the software to be the best option there is. And maybe there’s a better(est) way.</p>

<h2 id="the-betterest-way">The Better(est) Way</h2>

<p>A couple months ago, <a href="https://www.rosslaird.com/">my Dad</a> asked me for help with a problem. He was converting one of <a href="https://www.rosslaird.com/stones-throw/">his books</a> to markdown, and there was an issue with the footnotes. In markdown, footnotes do not automatically number themselves<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; they need to be labelled with either a number or some text, like this: <code>[^1]</code> or <code>[^footnote]</code>. The definition is the same, with a colon at the end.</p>

<p>He had used pandoc to mostly convert the document, but every footnote had the format <code>[^#]</code>. It was my job to make a script to replace every <code>#</code> with a number, starting from \(1\).</p>

<p>Easy, right?</p>

<p>Well, that’s what I thought. I whipped up a regex, scanned through the document, and replaced all occurrences of the pattern with an increasing integer. And, it spat out garbage.</p>

<p>Why? Because I had made a really, really obvious mistake. The counter doesn’t always take up the same amount of space. The script kept overwriting content, and the offset grew larger the more footnotes were replaced. There’s a simple fix: keep track of how much more space you take up, and add that to your current position in the document. I made that one simple change, and everything worked perfectly. Without knowing it at the time, I had used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">Piece Table</a>.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page for the Piece Table is only 8 lines long (Yikes!) Even more concerning, it mentions Microsoft Word among the examples of editors that use piece tables. However, the piece table is a very promising structure. What’s more, at its conception Word was lightning fast with infinite redo/undo, as explained in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308183811/http://1017.songtrellisopml.com/whatsbeenwroughtusingpiecetables">this interesting article</a> by a Microsoft developer. If you have the time, it’s a cool read.</p>

<p>In 1998, Charles Crowley wrote <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf">a paper</a> investigating the pros and cons of various data structures used in text editors. His paper includes the structures we covered, like gap buffers, arrays, and ropes. He concluded that – from a basis of speed, simplicity, and structure – the piece table was the leading method. From my point of view, the piece table is also the most elegant solution.</p>

<p>We need two buffers: the original file (read-only), and a new file that will contain all of our added text (append-only). Lastly, we have a table that has three columns: file, start, length. This is which file to use (original or new), where the text segment starts in each file (pre-edit), and the length of the segment. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><pre><code>Original File: A_large_span_of_text   (underscores denote spaces)
New File:      English_

File           Start         Length
-----------------------------------
Original           0              2
Original           8              8
New                0              8
Original          16              4

Sequence: A_span_of_English_text
</code></pre></div>

<p>Keep in mind that the <code>Start</code> index is <em>not relative</em> to previous edits. This is something that gets handled at runtime by adding the length of each previous edit (like what I did to fix my footnote script). Since the length is already included in the table, this is a trivial step.</p>

<p>I like this solution the most because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s <strong>elegant</strong>. Only the minimal amount of information is recorded.</li>
  <li>It’s <strong>simple</strong>. We run through the table, and do the necessary operations. We don’t need to re-balance or traverse a binary tree.</li>
  <li>It’s <strong>fast</strong>. This solution has the <em>potential</em> to be lightning fast. There are some additional optimizations to take into account, which are explained in detail <a href="http://www.catch22.net/tuts/piece-chains">here</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The piece table method certainly has its complications, and there are different variations in implementation. It is certainly a daunting task. I’m going to see how far I get. Another article will accompany my attempts to implement the piece table method.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
			<h2>Shiny new things</h2>
<p>Introducing a brand new editor for Markdown tables. Table rows and columns are now easier to create, edit, sort, reorder, select, copy, and paste. These new table features can also be accessed via context menu, command palette, and hotkeys. Tables are still saved to plain text Markdown.</p>

<p>To add a table to a note, right click and choose <em>Insert → Table</em>, or use the command palette.</p>
<p>Once you insert a table, you can add new columns and rows by clicking on the sides of the table. Add text with inline formatting. Press <code>tab</code> to navigate between cells.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Properties can now be renamed globally. Renaming will cause the property to be modified in each corresponding file and the search is case-insensitive.</li>
<li>Global Search: Search now works with non-string property values. Search for boolean values <code>[property:TRUE]</code> or <code>[property:FALSE]</code> or empty values <code>[property:EMPTY]</code>. You can also use inequality operators to search for things like <code>[some_property:&gt;10]</code>.</li>
<li>Global properties view can now be filtered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Editing experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>New formatting menu. You can now right click in the editor to change text formatting, paragraph styles, and insert elements such as lists and tables.</li>
<li>Right-click on a callout to quickly change the callout type from a list of default callout type options.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Tab</code> when the <code>#</code> autocomplete is active will autocomplete the highlighted suggestion. If the highlighted suggestion has a <code>/</code> in it, like "#projects/in-review", <code>Tab</code> will autocomplete by <em>segment</em>, so "#projects" then press again to get "/in-review".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sync</h3>
<ul>
<li>When viewing the version history for a file, changes made by the same user on the same device will now be grouped together. And Markdown will be rendered to more closely match reading mode.</li>
<li>Number of vaults has increased from 5 to 10</li>
<li>Maximum file size has increased from 100MB to 200MB</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help/assets/10565871/bf2334dd-6add-4dfa-9adb-67ff183746ec" alt="Sync version history"></p>
<h3>Quality of life</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Outline view now has a "collapse all" button as well as a search field for filtering the list of headings in the file.</li>
<li>Files from outside Obsidian can now be dropped anywhere in the File Explorer pane instead of on top of the vault name. Similarly, dropping a file on top of any item in a folder will cause the file to get imported into that particular folder.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Ctrl/Command-F</code> in any view with a search input (including Backlinks or Properties) will now focus the search input.</li>
<li>Menu options within the <code>...</code> pane menu (the <code>...</code> in the tab header) as well as the tab menu (right clicking on a tab) have been cleaned up and should now show more relevant options.</li>
<li>Copy, cut, and paste items in the Bookmarks view (works via hotkey only currently).</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Removed the "Bookmark this block..." context menu item.</li>
<li>Added new "Show trash" command to open the .trash folder in filesystem.</li>
<li>The Appearance section in settings has been reordered for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Onboarding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian will now use the system setting for light or dark mode by default, you can change this in Appearance settings.</li>
<li>Improved the experience when creating a new vault from scratch. If you select "Create new vault," the created vault will include a <code>welcome.md</code> file and show a side-by-side view with the Graph view.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The active context menu is now automatically dismissed when the view navigates away or a modal appears.</li>
<li>Clicking 'New file' on an empty tab should open the new file in the current tab instead of creating a new one.</li>
<li>Properties: Fixed issue where properties view sometimes displayed a stale value when switching between files.</li>
<li>Properties: Fixed bug where pressing the left arrow key (<code>←</code>) the start the input would cause the input to blur.</li>
<li>Word count and character count status bar items now ignore frontmatter.</li>
<li>Bookmarks: Fixed several edge cases where drag and drop would fail to work, including dragging an item to the bottom of the bookmark list.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where canceling a drag would not cause the actively hovered element to remove its styling.</li>
<li>Unclosed <code>[[</code> will no longer cause the next line to get rendered as a link.</li>
<li>Updated "Auto pair brackets" behavior so that <code>[[link]]'s</code> can be typed without the apostrophe getting paired.</li>
<li>Hover preview is no longer positioned on top of the cursor or target element if there isn't enough room to display the preview box.</li>
<li>Editor selection is no longer blurred when resizing a tab group.</li>
<li>Search: Minor tweak to avoid the content shifting a lot as the search counter ticks upward.</li>
<li>Vim: Fixed issue with character movements not respective atomic ranges.</li>
<li>Vim: Fixed issue where <code>O</code> on the first line of a file with properties would put the cursor in the wrong position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>As of 1.5.0, the <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/goodbye-legacy-editor/">Legacy editor has been completely removed</a> from Obsidian.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Table">New CSS table variables for selection and dragging</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>File Explorer and Tags pane both received a small code refactor. This might affect some plugins that rely on the internal JS structure. Themes should not be affected.</li>
<li>Tags can no longer end in a <code>/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wouldn't mind this <strong>huge</strong> ad so much if the pancake mix was made with lentil flour...on second thought, that doesn't sound good:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-1.png" alt="walmart search result showing ads instead of results">

<p>And if I complain about not being able to sort by price/quality (or weight), I assume some people will point out that choice adds complexity. But it's hard to understand what value this choice is adding:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-2.png" alt="facet with a single option">

<p>Since we're talking about facets, I'm curious what category those other 632 products fall under:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/walmart-3.png" alt="category facets showing 16 total products despite having 648 results">

<p>At costco, a search for "rice" yields this amazing facet:</p>

<img src="https://www.openmymind.net/assets/forposts/website-catalogs/costco-1.png" alt="Each facet contains all the products">

<p>Surprise, the search returned 25 results (seriously).</p>

<p>I'm particularly intrigued by rice that isn't vegan, lactose free, or gluten free:</p>

<p>The sorting made me check wiki to see how much revenue they have ($242 billion):</p>

<p>There must be a term in information theory that describes what's going on here:</p>

<p>You can't tell, but the 2nd result <em>is also</em> alcohol free (the first 10 results are). For any Singaporean thinking that Alibaba ruined Lazada who ruined Redmart: no.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone would be offended if I said e-commerce in the Philippines has a lot of catching up to do. But this first page search result is something else (yes, they sell a lot of other laundry detergent):</p>

<p>The inspiration for this post is that nintendo.com lets you filter for <code>2+</code> players, but that includes single system, local wireless and online. So there's no way to get a list of games that supports couch coop. Unless you want to check 1680 games that is:</p>

<p>Haha, J/K. The search won't return more than 1000 records.</p>

<p>And while we're talking about nintendo.com, if you goto Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games:</p>

<p>You'll get 120 games and only 120 games. Of course the list of switch games isn't under Games &gt; Nintendo Switch Games that would be silly. But, for days I've tried and failed to figure out what these 120 games have in common and why they get this special treatment. I can't sleep.</p>

<p>A pretty major milestone has been achieved: Britain has become the first major country to halve its carbon emissions. The rapid pace of UK environmental progress means that our output is now below 319 million tonnes&nbsp;– half the 652 million tonnes at our 1970 peak. This is in spite of Britain now having a far larger population and economy than 50 years ago.</p>

  <p><time>25 December, 2023</time>

</header>



<p>The Thanksgiving long weekend (23-26 November) in 2023 was an interesting one for OpenZFS, that I managed to land myself in the middle of. The short version of events is that an apparent silent data corruption bug was discovered, which is kind of the worst case scenario for a data storage system.</p>
<p>It was a pretty intense few days for me, initially one of a few people looking into the bug, and then later being involved in working out a fix, talking to downstream vendors, responding to private and public messages with users, my own customers and the press, and doing damage control. It was mostly done with by the end of the weekend, though took a couple of weeks to mop up, and overall I’d rate it a qualified success for the project.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing this post on and off since then. A lot happened, and I have a lot of thoughts, and I wanted to get them all down, but it got too much. So this post just covers the bug itself, and I’m hoping to write more about the fuzzier stuff soon. If you’re reading this months later and I still haven’t, maybe <a href="https://despairlabs.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fe7eae3e3e0cfebeafcffeee6fde3eeedfca1ece0e2">ping me</a> and remind me that I promised!</p>
<h2 id="free-filesystem-lesson">Free filesystem lesson</h2>
<p>To understand what happened, you need to know a little bit about OpenZFS internals. If you have been paying attention to <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526">the whole kerfuffle</a>, then you might recognise some of the moving parts as we go along!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-file-really">What is a file, really?</h3>
<p>If you lift the lid on a OpenZFS filesystem (or volume!) you’ll find that OpenZFS is an object store. The top-level object is called an “object set” (or just “objset”), and can be thought of as just a giant array of objects. In turn, each object has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “dnode”, which is a kind of metadata header that describes the object’s type, size, etc, and carries a pointer to its first data block</li>
<li>the object data, which is a tree of blocks, either an “indirect” block that just points to more blocks, or a “data” block, which is, well, data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we can consider a simplified view of the world, with the objset at the top, a list of dnodes, each with a count of attached data blocks, and then a list of data blocks.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnodes.png" alt="">
    


<p>There isn’t more to it in concept. Higher-level filesystem concepts are just built out of more objects, for example, a directory is just a special kind of object (internally called a “ZAP”) that is just a dictionary of name → object index.</p>
<h3 id="not-all-data-is-data">Not all data is data</h3>
<p>If a data block contains all zeroes, we can use a little optimisation. Instead of allocating real space on the disk just to store a whole bunch of zeroes, we can instead keep a note to say “this block is all zeroes”. We don’t have to store anything then, because we can recreate it on request. This note is called a “hole”, and is what gives a “sparse file” its “sparseness”.</p>
<p>So here are our files again, with some holes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/holes.png" alt="">
    


<p>In every way, these look like they did before: the dnode still reports how many blocks they have. All that changes is that if something tries to read from one of the hole blocks, OpenZFS will create a data buffer as normal, but instead of actually going to disk and getting the data to put in the buffer, it will just zero the buffer. Less space required, fewer IO operations to spend. Lovely!</p>
<h3 id="the-fastest-disks-are-memory">The fastest disks are memory</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, disks are slow, even very fast ones. Memory, however, is very fast. So, when you make a change to a file, say, write some new data to the end of it, OpenZFS makes that change in memory only, and later writes it (and any other changes) down to disk. This is fast, because it only touches memory, and can make the later disk part even faster, eg your program may have written over part of a file, then written over the same part again, so when it comes to to write the change to disk, it only has to write the final state, not both changes.</p>
<p>Of course, keeping changes in memory means we need extra housekeeping information to know that we have changes to write out when the time comes. We call the changed things “dirty”, and to track this, we keep some lists.</p>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>There is one crucially important detail, of course: until that data is written to disk, the version in memory is the latest, and what the application believes exists (applications don’t really know a whole lot about this disk stuff). So anything inside OpenZFS that wants to consider the current state of an object has to look at the dirty information as well, to know if its looking at the latest or not.</p>
<h3 id="data-first">Data first</h3>
<p>When it comes time to write everything out, first the blocks are written:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/data-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>And then the dnodes go out, and everything is on disk.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-written.png" alt="">
    


<p>I’ve of course left out a million tiny details, not least of which is the whole copy-on-write thing. This is a useful conceptual model though; in this part of the code you can largely take for granted that the layers below you will take care of all that.</p>
<h2 id="beware-of-holes">Beware of holes</h2>
<p>The crux of this bug is around hole detection.</p>
<p>Sometimes an application wants to know where the holes in a file are. A file copying program is a good example: its whole job is to read all the data from one file, and write it to another. If it can find out that there’s a hole, then it saves itself the trouble of reading that block, and it also tell the filesystem to make a hole in the copy too. Even less space and fewer IO operations to think about. Extra lovely!</p>
<p>For a program to find out about holes, it can call <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html"><code>lseek()</code></a> with the <code>SEEK_HOLE</code> or <code>SEEK_DATA</code> options, which say “tell me the position of the next hole” or “next data”.</p>
<p>Holes are actually stored on disk in OpenZFS as a zero-length block pointer. There’s also a clever optimisation, which is that if a program writes a full list of zeroes, the compression system will notice and “compress” it down to a hole. However, block pointers and compression belong to the IO layer, which is quite a way away from the object layer (the DMU).</p>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-dirt">Hidden dirt</h3>
<p>So now we come to the actual bug: the dirty check. Recall how we track dirty things:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>Before <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571">we fixed it</a>, the dirty check for <code>lseek()</code> used to be “is this dnode on the dirty list?”. Note that this is a subtly different question from what we actually want to know, which is “is this dnode dirty?”.</p>
<p>And there’s the bug. There is a moment in the dnode write process where the dnode is taken off the “dirty” list, and put on the “synced” list. This happens before the data blocks are written out, so there is a moment where the dnode looks like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dirty-gap.png" alt="">
    


<p>This gap is <em>tiny</em>. Hard to estimate, but we’re talking tens of CPU instructions. But if <code>lseek()</code> comes along in that moment, the dirty check fails, so it goes into the “search for data/holes” stage. And because that only sees fully allocated and written blocks, it actually sees something more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/not-clean.png" alt="">
    


<p>And so, if a program asks about holes, it may well end up wrongly finding them in the last couple of blocks of the file.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea-of-data">The idea of data</h3>
<p>Of course, the data is there, and if the program had only read it, it would have found this, but OpenZFS gave it reason to believe that it wasn’t there, so it didn’t bother.</p>
<p>This whole madness started because <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823575126">someone posted an attempt at a test case</a> for a different issue, and then that <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1823633960">test case started failing</a> on versions of OpenZFS that didn’t even have the feature in question. The key part of that test was that it used the <code>/bin/cp</code> program from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html">GNU Coreutils</a>, which is almost ubiquitous on Linux systems. In v9.2 it started using <code>lseek()</code> to discover holes in source files.</p>
<p>When a new file is created, it starts life as:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-file.png" alt="">
    


<p>That is, just the metadata, no data.</p>
<p>When we add some data, it becomes:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-dirty.png" alt="">
    


<p>If we manage to catch it just right though, it looks like:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/new-hole.png" alt="">
    


<p><code>cp</code>’s opening move is <code>lseek(…, 0, SEEK_DATA)</code>, which is to say, “find the first data item from position 0”. When it works, it returns <code>0</code>, because that’s where the data is. If it fails, it sets error <code>ENXIO</code>, that is: no data here. So <code>cp</code> doesn’t read, and it writes zeroes (or a hole!) to the output.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that’s why this isn’t “corruption” in the traditional sense (and why a scrub doesn’t find it): no data was lost. <code>cp</code> didn’t read data that was there, and it wrote some zeroes which OpenZFS safely stored.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-way-home">The long way home</h2>
<p>In the course of exploring the problem, we found that setting the config parameter <code>zfs_dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> defanged the reproducer. This quickly became the recommended workaround. It also brought some confusion of its own, as it appeared to improve performance, leading some to wonder if they should just leave it off permanently. It also turns out that it doesn’t actually stop the bug from occurring, just makes it vastly more difficult to hit. All this has been extremely difficult to explain, which naturally means I should expect success if I have one more go at it.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-pipeline">Transaction pipeline</h3>
<p>To understand this part we need to know a little about the transaction pipeline.</p>
<p>At any point in time, OpenZFS has three transactions in flight.</p>
<ul>
<li>The OPEN transaction, which receives new changes as they arrive.</li>
<li>The QUIESCING transaction, where the changes are combined and prepared to be written to disk.</li>
<li>The SYNCING transaction, which is being written out to disk right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the SYNCING transaction is written, everything is moved along. QUIESCING becomes the new SYNCING, OPEN moves to QUIESCING, and a new OPEN transaction is created. There’s more details of course, but this is the basic idea.</p>
<p>Changes are only added to the OPEN transaction. Once it moves to the next state, it can’t be modified again. So a busy object can end up with changes on multiple transactions. And this means that when we ask “is this object dirty?”, what we’re actually asking is “is this object dirty on transaction N?” or “is this object dirty on any transaction?”</p>
<h3 id="diary-of-a-change">Diary of a change</h3>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of how changes flow through the transaction pipeline. This is conceptual, of course - “clean” objects are not on any transaction, but then again, “transactions” are not a real thing either.</p>
<p>So lets imagine a nice normal clean object, on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg0.png" alt="">
    


<p>We append a block to it, which makes it dirty in memory in memory on the current transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg1.png" alt="">
    


<p>On the next transaction, we append another block to it. Yellow here shows the changes that aren’t on disk yet but are considered “unchanged” on this transaction.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg2.png" alt="">
    


<p>This time we don’t make any modifications, so this object is “clean” on the OPEN transaction. The first change we made is now on the SYNCING transaction, and starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg3.png" alt="">
    


<p>The transactions move along again and the second change starts getting written out.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg4.png" alt="">
    


<p>All changes are are now written.</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/txg5.png" alt="">
    


<h3 id="everywhere-is-dirty">Everywhere is dirty</h3>
<p>Earlier I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objset has a list of dirty dnodes, and each dnode has a list of dirty blocks. So after our write, we have some nice linked lists of dirty things, ready to be written out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with multiple transactions in flight, we actually need a dirty dnode list and a dirty block list for each transaction, which means things actually look more like this:</p>



    <img src="https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2023-12-25-openzfs-data-corruption-bug/dnode-lists.png" alt="">
    


<p>This of course means the dirty check is more complex too. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, there’s no way currently to discover if a dirty block will eventually be stored as a hole. For this reason, <code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user’s view of the object (via system calls like <code>lseek()</code> is whatever is on the OPEN transaction. Because looking for holes means looking at the on-disk state, that means we have to wait until <em>all</em> pending changes are on disk. So our dirty check here has to be “is this object dirty on any transaction?”, which means checking if the dnode is on <em>any</em> dirty list.</p>
<h3 id="wait-for-service">Wait for service</h3>
<p>Recall that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>lseek()</code> checks if the dnode is dirty, and if so, it waits for it to be written out before it goes looking for holes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the object is dirty only on a single transaction, that wait can be long if the pool is very busy. So OpenZFS has a config option, <code>dmu_offset_next_sync</code> which controls what the <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> function (one of the work functions implementing <code>lseek()</code>) does when the dnode is dirty.</p>
<p>If set to <code>0</code>, and the object is dirty, then instead of waiting, the function simply returns an error, which causes <code>lseek()</code>  to return “data here”. This is allowed; its always safe to say there’s data where there’s a hole, because reading a hole area will always find “zeroes”, which is valid data. It can mean a loss of efficiency, because the application can’t do special things for holes, but at least the data is always intact. And because its a simple dirty check, its fast.</p>
<p>If its set to <code>1</code> (the default), it will wait instead. Specifically, it will do a dirty check, and if its dirty, it will wait until the currently-syncing transaction is written out. Then it will do another dirty check; if the object is still dirty, it will return an error (and so <code>lseek()</code> returns “data here”), and if clean, it will go into hole detection as normal.</p>
<p>So now we understand the apparent performance gain with <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code> (it just never waits). But why does that also appear to mitigate the bug?</p>
<h3 id="doubly-dirty">Doubly dirty</h3>
<p>Recall that the bug occurs in the moment where the dnode is taken off the dirty list, but not yet put on the syncing list, and in that moment its not a list, so its erroneously considered to be clean.</p>
<p>Since there’s actually multiple lists, but this gap only occurs on the SYNCING list, it gives some idea of where the window you have to hit is. Its not a change “just made”, but actually made two transactions ago (from the perspective of the user). On a quiet system that can be whole seconds ago. On a busy object, with changes on multiple in-flight transactions, a single dirty check (ie <code>dmu_offset_next_sync=0</code>) is always going to result in “dirty”, and so <code>lseek()</code> returning “data here”, because even if there’s a gap on the SYNCING list, the dnode will also be on the OPEN or QUIESCING dirty lists, and so still be dirty. So the only time we can hit a gap is for the “some time later” case. Not out of the question, but incredibly difficult for any non-contrived workload (or even contrived - to my knowledge its <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526#issuecomment-1826104073">only been seen on a quite large and unusual ARM64 system</a>, and even then its hard to hit).</p>
<p>In the “wait for sync” mode (<code>dmu_offset_next_sync=1</code>), we have two dirty checks, and either of them can go wrong. For the first check to fail its the same as above, the “some time later” case. Its the second that is more interesting, with a wait in between.</p>
<p>To get the wrong answer, the dnode must only be on the SYNCING list, so that when its removed, its not on any other lists. The two dirty checks are one transaction apart, so for the second to <em>incorrectly</em> return “clean”, the dnode must be dirty on two consecutive transactions. That’s not hard to arrange of course, but that alone isn’t really going to make much difference.</p>
<p>The difference is just the timing. The first (or only) dirty check can happen any time; whenever <code>lseek()</code> is called. The second however is always called just the after the transaction has synced and the next one is beginning sync. The object in question is dirty there, and is removed from the dirty list and added to the syncing list before it starts syncing, which means there’s a better-than-usual chance that its happening just as <code>dmu_offset_next()</code> loops and does the dirty check. Overall, it raises the chances of hitting the gap and getting the wrong answer.</p>

<p>The original bug appeared to point to block cloning as being the cause of the problem, and it was treated as such until the problem was reproduced on an earlier version of OpenZFS without block cloning. This didn’t end up being the case, and it initially being blamed is perhaps a symptom of a deeper problem, but that’s for another post.</p>
<p>However some people did report that disabling block cloning entirely appeared to helped. So far we haven’t really found any reason why it would make a difference, other than at a distance by changing the timing - its faster to apply a clone than a write, because there’s no actual data to copy or write, so that allows more dirty dnodes and/or more transactions to be processed in a shorter amount of time. This alone means nothing, as the gap is still the same amount of time, but with other variables like hardware and workload, it could change it in the right way.</p>
<p>Another reason cloning was implicated was that the bug had been seen on FreeBSD. Its <code>/bin/cp</code> is not the Coreutils one, and doesn’t look for holes, but does call <code>copy_file_range()</code>, which hands off copying to the kernel to do the copy however it would like. This function has become known as “the cloning function” because the kernel might choose to service the copy via clones. However on FreeBSD it will also use <code>lseek()</code> under the hood to try to replicate holes in the file, and so can run into the same problem. <code>copy_file_range()</code> on Linux doesn’t do this, and that’s most peoples experience of cloning, leading to confusion.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there isn’t problems with block cloning at all - there’s a few known, which is why its currently disabled by default in OpenZFS releases. The upcoming 2.2.3 release will fix some significant issues with block cloning, and a comprehensive test suite is coming together. How block cloning became the whole thing it is, and the interaction with this and other issues in the public perception, is something I want to write more about, but this has gone on long enough.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-a-bug">History of a bug</h2>
<p>This bug has a long history, as can be seen by reading multiple earlier patches that made changes around it. All had seen <em>something</em> wrong, but hadn’t fully understood it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nov 2021: <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/de198f2d9507b6dcf3d0d8f037ba33940208733e"><code>de198f2</code></a> Fix lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE) mmap consistency</li>

</ul>
<p>The proto-bug seems to go back even further, to <a href="https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/c543ec060d#diff-9a7602b987a5c727d34def47076cc6fce32bdd5bdb114eb3c05c413595cc6116L1641">a 2006 commit</a> in early Sun ZFS. Among other changes, we see:</p>

That alone is not a bug; it might be that there’s something else preventing the off-list gap being hit (eg another lock), so maybe the bug was never in this version of ZFS. What has changed is that its no longer possible to understand the dirty state directly; its now reliant on what’s happening elsewhere in the system.</p>
<p>I’m not really blaming anyone - complex problems sometimes require complex solutions! Its just one of those things that the details of are long forgotten, so its on the reader to make sure they understand it, without much external guidance. There’s more to say about this, but not here.</p>
<h2 id="turn-tape-over">Turn tape over</h2>
<p>In the end its not a data corruption bug <em>as such</em>, but possibly that’s splitting hairs. As you see though, it has existed a long long time, and is fiendishly difficult to hit in almost all real-world scenarios, and even harder to hit <em>undetected</em>. It does reinforce the standard mantras about storage though: take backups, test your backups.</p>
<p>I’ll never exactly be happy about a data-loss bug, but what I am happy about is the way that a whole group of people appeared over a holiday weekend and worked together to solve an ancient mystery. I loved being a part of it, and I’m now looking for ways to get that happening in more proactive and less desperate situations.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Hopefully more soon about all the other thoughts I had while working on this!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      <p dir="auto">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the code<br>
Not a core dev was merging, not even Guido;<br>
The CI was spun on the PRs with care<br>
In hopes that green check-markings soon would be there;<br>
The buildbots were nestled all snug under desks,<br>
Even PPC64 AIX;<br>
Doc-writers, triage team, the Council of Steering,<br>
Had just stashed every change and stopped engineering,</p>
<p dir="auto">When in the "PRs" tab arose such a clatter,<br>
They opened GitHub to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to CPython they flew like a flash,<br>
Towards sounds of <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and <code>__builtin___clear_cache</code>.<br>
First <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/README.md">LLVM was downloaded, unzipped</a><br>
Then the Actions were running <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/build.py">a strange new build script</a>,<br>
When something appeared, they were stopped in their tracks,<br>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/brandtbucher/d6397b1d106c55164b32df27d53eb7b8"><code>jit_stencils.h</code></a>, generated from <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Tools/jit/template.c">hacks</a>,<br>
With their spines all a-shiver, they muttered "Oh, shit...",<br>
They knew in a moment it must be a JIT.</p>
<p dir="auto">More rapid than interpretation it came<br>
And it copied-and-patched every stencil by name:<br>
"Now, <code>_LOAD_FAST</code>! Now, <code>_STORE_FAST</code>! <code>_BINARY_OP_ADD_INT</code>!<br>
On, <code>_GUARD_DORV_VALUES_INST_ATTR_FROM_DICT</code>!<br>
To the top of the loop! And down into the call!<br>
Now cache away! Cache away! Cache away all!"<br>
But why now? And how so? They needed a hint,<br>
Thankfully, Brandt gave a great talk at the sprint;<br>
So over to <a href="https://youtu.be/HxSHIpEQRjs" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> the reviewers flew,<br>
They read <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485513" rel="nofollow">the white paper</a>, and <a href="https://sillycross.github.io/2023/05/12/2023-05-12" rel="nofollow">the blog post</a> too.</p>
<p dir="auto">And then, after watching, they saw its appeal<br>
Not writing the code themselves seemed so unreal.<br>
And the platform support was almost too easy,<br>
ARM64 Macs to 32-bit PCs.<br>
There was <a href="https://github.com/brandtbucher/cpython/blob/justin/Python/jit.c">some runtime C</a>, not too much, just enough,<br>
Basically a loader, relocating stuff;<br>
It ran every test, one by one passed them all,<br>
With not one runtime dependency to install.<br>
Mostly build-time Python! With strict static typing!<br>
For maintenance ease, and also nerd-sniping!</p>
<p dir="auto">Though dispatch was faster, the JIT wasn't wise,<br>
And the traces it used still should be optimized;<br>
The code it was JIT'ing still needed some thinning,<br>
With code models small, and some register pinning;<br>
Or <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-exposing-ghccc-calling-convention-as-preserve-none-to-clang/74233" rel="nofollow">new calling conventions</a>, shared stubs for paths slow,<br>
Since this JIT was brand new, there was fruit hanging low.<br>
It was awkwardly large, parsed straight out of the ELFs,<br>
And they laughed when they saw it, in spite of themselves;</p>
<p dir="auto">A <code>configure</code> flag, and no merging this year,<br>
Soon gave them to know they had nothing to fear;<br>
It wasn't much faster, at least it could work,<br>
They knew that'd come later; no one was a jerk,<br>
But they were still smart, and determined, and skilled,<br>
They opened a shell, and configured the build;<br>
<code>--enable-experimental-jit</code>, then made it,<br>
And away the JIT flew as their "+1"s okay'ed it.<br>
But they heard it exclaim, as it traced out of sight,<br>
"Happy JIT-mas to all, and to all a good night!"</p>

            <p><b>Posted by</b> Rampant Coyote on August 12, 2014</p>
            
                        
<p><em>One of my most popular posts was also my very first… which has since been lost to the Great Blog Devouring of ’14. So…&nbsp; here’s the post from over ten years ago (has it been that long?!?!?!) about an event from almost twenty years ago. Still stuff I have to remind myself about some days.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="http://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1-300x225.jpg" alt="warhawk_1" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rampantgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/warhawk_1.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>In October of 1994, I’d just started as an honest-to-goodness videogame programmer at a small startup called SingleTrac which later went on to fame and glory (but unfortunately not much in the way of fortune) with such titles as <strong>Warhawk</strong>, the <strong>Twisted Metal</strong> series, and the <strong>Jet Moto</strong> series. But at the time, the company was less than 20 employees in size and had only been officially in business for about a month. It was sometime in my first week possibly my first or second day. In the main engineering room, there was a whoop and cry of success.</p>
<p>Our company financial controller and acting HR lady, Jen, came in to see what incredible things the engineers and artists had come up with. Everyone was staring at a television set hooked up to a development box for the Sony Playstation. There, on the screen, against a single-color background, was a black triangle.</p>
<p>“It’s a black triangle,” she said in an amused but sarcastic voice. One of the engine programmers tried to explain, but she shook her head and went back to her office. I could almost hear her thoughts… “We’ve got ten months to deliver two games to Sony, and they are cheering over a black triangle? <em>THAT</em> took them nearly a month to develop?”</p>
<p>What she later came to realize (and explain to others) was that the black triangle was a pioneer. It wasn’t just that we’d managed to get a triangle onto the screen. That could be done in about a day. It was the journey the triangle had taken to get up on the screen. It had passed through our new modeling tools, through two different intermediate converter programs, had been loaded up as a complete database, and been rendered through a fairly complex scene hierarchy, fully textured and lit (though there were no lights, so the triangle came out looking black). The black triangle demonstrated that the foundation was finally complete the core of a fairly complex system was completed, and we were now ready to put it to work doing cool stuff. By the end of the day, we had complete models on the screen, manipulating them with the controllers. Within a week, we had an environment to move the model through.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we came to refer to certain types of accomplishments as “black triangles.” These are important accomplishments that take a lot of effort to achieve, but upon completion you don’t have much to show for it only that more work can now proceed. It takes someone who really knows the guts of what you are doing to appreciate a black triangle.</p>
<p>Years later,&nbsp;I was chatting with another SingleTrac alumnus, and was excitedly relating my work on the multiplayer code. I’d spent a little over a week working on the underlying architecture, trying to make it clean and reliable and easy to use. It was all UDP rather than TCP/IP (for speed), so I created my own “guaranteed delivery” protocol for those rare packets that needed to be guaranteed. I’d rarely worked low-level network code before, so it was kind of a new experience. When all was said and done, I had another computer join the game and boom! There it was, on the host machine. Wow. No updates, it did next to nothing, but the core architecture was there. The rest SHOULD come together quickly. Explaining this to my buddy over IM, I explained, “It’s a black triangle.” He understood what I meant immediately. It’s a convenient shorthand metaphor.</p>
<p>So feel free to steal the term. And when progress seems a little slow because you are doing a bunch of hardcore architecture work, just remember it’s a black triangle.</p>

<p>This site contains an original, self-contained guide to learning the fundamentals of Modern C++, intended to be the basis of a self-study course. Some Chapters depend upon material presented in earlier ones, so studying them linearly is recommended. There are also regular posts (accessible from the front page) which cover topics or areas of C++ not covered in the course.</p>

<p>So here’s a program written in a hurry, possibly in the style of a college CS student in about week six of learning C++ as a taught course. It’s simple, it works, and it can (naturally) be improved upon:</p>

<p>Not all choices can be made at compile-time, sometimes including which function (of several possibilities) to invoke. This article aims to cover all of the methods available to Modern C++ when selecting which function to call, with the decision made at runtime (based upon user input, for example). Terms covered in this article include function pointers, function objects, virtual functions and lambdas.</p>

<p>In this article we’re going to look at a feature new to C++23 which supports a way to return an error condition from a function where a result value was anticipated. This is enabled in a new header <code>&lt;expected&gt;</code> which (as far as I am aware) does not require specific compiler support. (MSVC 19.37 with <code>/std:c++latest</code> was used to test the program code in this article.)</p>

<p>When writing C++, we like to do as much of the work as possible at compile time; with C++ being a statically-typed language, we know the type(s) involved when compilation is taking place. In this article we’ll look at how to pass and receive, variables and results, of differing types depending on the nature of the function call itself. The four methods we will examine are: function overloading, template specialization, tag dispatch, and SFINAE.</p>

<p>Concepts finally appeared in the language with the completion of C++20—I say finally as work to specify them had been going on continuously since before the release of C++11. This article attempts to explain their rationale and usage, with examples that should compile on any up-to-date C++ compiler when specifying <code>-std=c++20</code> (or <code>/std:c++20</code> for MSVC).</p>



<p>So why do we need concepts when template syntax has been available since C++98? Put simply, templates have been (successfully) used in ways that were never envisaged; however the reporting of invalid instantiations and similar errors has not kept pace. Also, the use of <code>auto</code> in function parameter lists gives us template syntax “invisibly”, which the novice/intermediate coder may not expect.</p>

<p>Traits and policy classes are often used with C++ generics, but their role and purpose is often something of an enigma even to experienced C++ programmers. The definitions of these two terms overlap to some extent, and could be summarized as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Traits represent natural additional properties of a template parameter.</li>



<li>Policies represent configurable behavior for generic functions and types.</li>
</ul>



<p>In this article the example code will show use of both of these two, with type information obtained through a (specialized) traits class and functionality obtained from a (generic) policy class.</p>

<p>Functional programming (FP) is a discipline and practice of computer science where Mathematical concepts come to the fore. There are a number of popular FP languages out there, but we can stay with C++ and explore some of the themes of FP by using a subset of familiar syntax. In this article we’ll look at a number of FP concepts, such as purity, immutability and use of higher-order functions, and how they can be concisely and usefully represented in Modern C++.</p>



<h3>1. Purity</h3>



<p>A function is considered pure if its operation depends only upon its formal input parameters, that is not accessing any external (global) state. Global state in FP is a little like the historical Goto statement, shunned but sometimes necessary, and so is by design abstracted away as much as possible. A C++ lambda is pure if it has an empty capture clause, for example:</p>

<p>In the previous articles of this mini-series we’ve covered the use of custom serialization and deserialization functions to generate and interpret XML. In this article we’ll look at how to add to existing classes to give them the ability to utilize the (de-)serialization logic already written. The process is similar to before: create an in-memory model and then serialize it, or start with blank containers and then read in the data, checking for errors.</p>

<p>In the previous articles we’ve looked at creating an in-memory XML hierarchy (or DOM), and serializing from and deserializing to this memory model. In this article we’re going to look at querying the DOM in a similar fashion to JavaScript methods such as <code>document.getElementById()</code> available in a browser. The scheme chosen is to overload <code>operator []</code> (twice) and provide other convenience methods such as <code>name()</code> and <code>numberOfChildren()</code>.</p>

<p>The complement of serialization is deserialization, and this is typically more difficult as it requires character- or pattern-matching of the input, plus checking for erroneous input. To match a stream of XML the possibility of using <code>std::getline()</code> was considered, but this is too inflexible as regards whitespace. Stream input to a <code>std::string</code> was also considered, but again this is unsuitable as breaking all input at whitespace is not what is needed.</p>

<p>Data held in memory must be saved to a store in order to outlive the running-time of the program it belongs to. Simply dumping binary data to disk is not usually the best way, or even a practicable way, of achieving this (think security issues, endianness, 32-bits/64-bits etc.)</p>



<p>The terms “serialization” and its companion “deserialization” are used to describe the conversion between the in-memory model and a (usually textual) disk-file representation. As an example, consider a web-browser which reads an HTML web page (and its dependencies) from a network connection and converts (deserializes) it into a format which can be manipulated through the DOM (Document Object Model). In this article we’ll concentrate more on serialization, which is often a simpler task.</p>

<p>Learning a new programming language is hard, and is especially daunting when as a novice programmer the compiler rejects pretty much every program you write the first time you try to compile it. Of course, compiler errors and warnings are important as they encourage you to write correct code and ensure that your program actually runs at all, and works as expected.</p>



<p>C++ has traditionally been seen as one of the harder programming languages for beginners to pick up; ideally you should already  have some coding experience under your belt in (an)other programming language(s) before trying to learn Modern C++. This mini-series intends to examine the parts of C++ that novice (and more experienced) programmers sometimes fail to understand fully, leading to buggy and/or sub-optimal code.</p>

<p>In this article we’re going to continue the theme of a class-designer’s toolkit, looking at adding generics (template functionality) to C++ classes. Templates have been around since C++98, and almost all C++ programmers will have used them: <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> has the type <code>int</code>  as a parameter, itself being a specialization of a generic class. Any user-defined type can be used as a type parameter, having equal status to the built-in types.</p>



<h3>Generic classes</h3>



<p>Classes which are preceded by a the <code>template</code> keyword are automatically turned into generic classes. These classes can have any number of template parameters, we’re going to concentrate on classes having just one, this being a template type parameter. The class definition starts of as follows:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In college I worked as a developer in several science labs, including a chemistry lab. Even us computational folks were told to keep lab notebooks, and the protocols for your lab notebook were quite strict. At the time, I was not very good at using my notebook (or at doing the science, frankly). Over the intervening years, I’ve come to understand and value what they were for; and now I keep lab books for almost all my software engineering work.</p> <h2 id="whats-a-lab-notebook">What’s a lab notebook?</h2> <p>It’s a disciplined record of what you do and think each day.</p> <p>One of the hardest things about software engineering is that, while it’s often possible to understand the code you committed, it’s usually impossible to see all the things you tried first, that didn’t work. This is a trap for other developers, and even your future self, where a seemingly better solution gets tried again and again, and each time the same problem arises. But since the failure never gets committed, no record of the attempt is left. I suspect most experienced developers can remember a time where their memory saved a team hours or even weeks of work, simply by saying “ah, we tried [clever solution] a few years ago, but ran into problems X, Y, and Z. So we’d need to solve those problems before we try again.”</p> <p>A lab notebook takes that kind of information <em>out</em> of your memory and puts it somewhere safe and permanent.</p> <p>Also, too many developers rely on their working memory, and end up burning out because they are afraid to leave a problem halfway. If the entire plan of attack exists only in your head, taking a lunch break can be disastrous.</p> <p>A lab notebook makes it safe to stop work at any time.</p> <p>As a consultant, it’s perfectly possible for old client to call me up and ask for advice, or an explanation of something I did for them. It’s no fun for anyone to say “sorry, I’ve worked on 5 other client projects since then, I have no memory of what I was doing.” On the other hand, it feels great to roll over to my bookshelf, grab the notebook associated with that client, and find a detailed explanation of what I did and why.</p> <p>In a meeting, writing in a notebook is socially more graceful than typing on a laptop. On a laptop, you might be answering email, or on facebook, or backchannel-chatting.</p> <p>A paper notebook is a way of signalling you’re present and listening.</p> <p>Finally, and least compelling, the <a href="https://www.workfront.com/blog/eudaimonia-machine-blueprint-virtual-workplace">Eudaimonia Machine</a> office design gets some attention from design and tech people every few months. Few people really discuss what goes in the library/archive room of the machine. One answer: your old lab notebooks.</p> <h2 id="what-are-the-rules">What are the rules?</h2> <p>I said there was a lot of discipline associated with a lab notebook. This is in part for forensics. If plagiarism/data falsification/ethics/etc concerns arise over some scientist’s research, the lab notebook can be valuable exonerating evidence — but only if the discipline is kept.</p> <p>Software engineering doesn’t have quite the same forensic constraints, but the same disciplines have nevertheless been valuable for me. Here are some of the major points:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Always in pen.</strong></p> <p>Your goal is not to preserve the <em>outcome</em> of your thoughts — that’s your code. Your goal is to preserve the <em>process</em> of your thoughts. So no erasing, no blacking out. You can put a single line through anything spelled or written incorrectly.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Always <em>during</em></strong></p> <p>Write down what the problem is, what you’re about to do, and what you expect the result to be. Treat your work as an experiment! This is especially valuable for junior developers who are still in a “try everything until something works” frame of mind. Forcing yourself to hypothesize what’s actually wrong is really valuable; and there’s nothing wrong with expecting a negative result (“I don’t think the problem is X, but it’s easy to prove it, so…”)</p> <p>If during the actual process, you deviate from your written plan, write down the deviation, and why you’re doing so.</p> <p>Don’t wait until after you’re “done” — because “done” might mean six hours from now.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Always <em>forward</em>.</strong></p> <p>If you write something on Monday and realize you were wrong on Tuesday, write the correction in Tuesday’s entry. This is a lab <em>journal</em> — from the French “daily”. If you had a misconception, you <em>want</em> a record of that, as well as a record of why you were wrong. You can (and should) add a small note to the original entry pointing to the page where you correct yourself — but don’t obscure what you originally wrote.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Keep a table of contents</strong></p> <p>The first pages of your notebook should be a table of contents; with a few words summarizing what is on each page. Make it easy to answer questions about what you did, and why, even if years have passed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Keep a habit</strong></p> <p>At the start of each day, read yesterday’s pages. Write down what you intend to do today. At the end of each day, read through today’s pages, and add an entry to your table of contents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Summarize when necessary</strong></p> <p>If you’ve spent a messy week going round in circles, and you lab notebook has become hard to follow, feel free to take a page to summarize what you’ve learned and where you ended up. Flag it specially in your table of contents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Store safely</strong></p> <p>At the end of a project, label the spine of your notebook, and store it safely with your others. It should be easy to access if questions ever come up.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These aren’t all the guidelines — pick a research university and I guarantee they’ll have some multi-page document explaining all the protocols surrounding your lab notebook — but these are the ones that have stuck with me.</p> <h2 id="what-notebook-should-i-use">What notebook should I use?</h2> <p>I use full-size gridded notebooks from <a href="https://velasciences.com/">Vela</a>. They’re made locally, and specifically designed for use as lab notebooks, so they have page numbers, page titles and dates, tables of contents, and so on all built-in; they make keeping the above disciplines easy. Vela also sell notebooks covered in material designed for use in wet labs; if you’re a clumsy person, an extra few dollars can make your coffee spill no big deal.</p> <p>They’re expensive, but I rarely use more than one per client, and I’m confident they’ve been worth it every time.</p> <p>(I have no relationship to Vela; I-just-think-theyre-neat.gif)</p> <h2 id="isnt-this-just-a-bullet-journal-isnt-this-just-a-planner-etc">Isn’t this just a bullet journal? Isn’t this just a planner? Etc.</h2> <p>Sure, do whatever works for you. I call it a lab notebook.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2> Astronomy Picture of the Day </h2>
<p>

<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html">Discover the cosmos!</a>
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is
featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.

the mountain is a crescent moon, although the exposure
is long enough to see the rest of lunar circle.

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Single shots like this require planning. 

The first step is to realize that such an amazing 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150624.html">triple-alignment</a> actually takes place.

The second step is to find the best location to photograph it.

But it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- 
and when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest.

Five times over six years the photographer tried and found 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210613.html">bad weather</a>. 

Finally, just ten days ago, the 
<a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/weather-and-climate/">weather</a> 
was perfect, and a photographic dream was realized.

Taken in 
<a href="https://youtu.be/oT5LB8wMNHI">Piemonte</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a>, 
the cathedral in the foreground is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Superga">Basilica of Superga</a>, 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Viso#/media/File:Monviso_-_panoramica_cresta_da_Ostanetta.jpg">mountain</a> in the middle is 
<a href="https://youtu.be/ViA0MrOkv_Y">Monviso</a>, and, well, 
<a href="https://post.bark.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/u4nf59H.png">you know</a> which moon is in the background.

Here, even though the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200322.html">setting Moon</a> was captured in a crescent 
<a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/">phase</a>, 
the exposure was long enough for doubly reflected 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_(astronomy)">Earthlight</a>, 
called the 
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190926.html">da Vinci glow</a>, to illuminate the entire top of the
