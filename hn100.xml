<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Check it out! <a href="https://leebutterman.com/wikipedia-search-by-vibes/">https://leebutterman.com/wikipedia-search-by-vibes/</a></p><p><img src="https://www.leebutterman.com/assets/wikipedia-search-by-vibes-offline.gif" alt="this webapp is running on airplane mode on an iphone and rendering search results in real time for the default onomatopoeia query and thereafter for the sequoia query, it is rendering search results for millions of embeddings in realtime"></p><h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2><p>This is a browser-based search engine for Wikipedia, where you can search for “the reddish tall trees on the san francisco coast” and find results like “Sequoia sempervirens” (a name of a redwood tree). The browser downloads the database, and search happens offline. To download two million Wikipedia pages with their titles takes roughly 100MB and under 50 milliseconds to see the final results. This uses sentence transformers to embed documents, product quantization to compress embeddings, <a href="https://github.com/lsb/pq.js"><code>pq.js</code></a> to run distance computation in the browser, and <a href="https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js"><code>transformers.js</code></a> to run sentence transformers in the browser for queries.</p><h2 id="is-this-good">Is this good?</h2><p>Yes.</p><p>Real-time search over millions of documents is happening in real-time completely offline. Results stream back every 10ms on a mobile device, and search results update gradually as the database is sequentially scanned.</p><h2 id="timing-first-results-in-21ms-70-of-final-results-in-116ms-faceted-search-in-23ms">Timing: first results in 21ms, 70% of final results in 116ms, faceted search in 23ms</h2><p>The distance computation over 2M embeddings takes 250ms in total, over 20 iterations, and we can display intermediate results with a faceted top-10 computation that takes 8ms. To display intermediate results, we run batches of 100k distance computations at a time, and compute the top-k and repaint after a (30ms) timer runs out.</p><p>We order embeddings by compressed page size: more information-dense pages are the first to be analyzed and returned in a top-10 ranking, and might be more useful in a search result. Note that the search results continue to stream in and update the top results, but most of the lower-page-size pages do not rank in the top 10, so the search appears faster than if we did not update the UI until everything returned.</p><p>70% of the final search results were in the first 670K embeddings, which in total rendered in 116 milliseconds (note the topk timing at the bottom left, which counts distance calculations as positive times and topk calculations as negative times):</p><p><img src="https://www.leebutterman.com/assets/wikipedia-search-by-vibes-last-frame.gif" alt="final search query about redwoods with timing data"></p><p>Note that changing the facet for the onomatopoeia search (changing the first letter of the page to return) avoided running a new embedding, and returned in under 25ms. Changing the number of results from top 10 to top 20 or top 100 is similarly instantaneous.</p><h2 id="200k-embeddings-and-page-titles-compress-down-to-10mb-in-arrow">200k embeddings and page titles compress down to 10MB in Arrow</h2><p>The database is small enough to support casual use cases of up to a million embeddings without special treatment.</p><p>Note that, for high performance, we use Arrow instead of JSON. Arrow can store our 8-bit integer product quantization arrays compactly, and Arrow can store an array of strings as an array of indexes into one buffer, which is a significant savings over a million Javascript string objects.</p><h2 id="these-onnx-models-run-in-wasm-for-now">These ONNX models run in WASM for now</h2><p>There is no GPU acceleration, only WebAssembly, so far. ONNX is a convenient compile target. WebGPU is still very new, and is an eagerly-anticipated future direction.</p><h2 id="step-1-embed-all-of-wikipedia-with-a-sentence-transformer">Step 1: embed all of Wikipedia with a sentence transformer</h2><p>There are a lot of sentence transformers to choose from! There is a leaderboard of sentence embeddings: <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb">https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb</a></p><p>The <code>all-minilm-l6-v2</code> model has reasonable performance <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> and is small and available in ONNX weights <a href="https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/">https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/</a> for transformers.js <a href="https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js">https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js</a> .</p><h2 id="step-2-use-product-quantization-to-compress-embeddings">Step 2: use product quantization to compress embeddings</h2><p>6M pages * 384-dimension embeddings * 32-bit floats is over 9GB. Even a million embeddings in float16 precision is 800MB. This is too large for casual usage.</p><p>As a first approximation, to choose the top million, one approach would be to choose the pages with the most information: compress each page and see the number of bytes that come out. Lists would be overrepresented (lists are less compressible than general text), there’s no appreciation of the link structure of webpages, but it’s cheap to compute and easy to start with.</p><p>FAISS (<a href="https://faiss.ai/">https://faiss.ai</a>) is a highly popular embedding search engine serverside, with a lot of tuning knobs for creating different styles of search indices. Autofaiss (<a href="https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss">https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss</a>) will usually recommend using Product Quantization, after creating IVF indices or HNSW indices (Pinecone has a great intro to vector indexing <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-indexes/">https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-indexes/</a>).</p><p>Product quantization is exceptionally simple to implement: creating a ‘distance table’ is <a href="https://github.com/matsui528/nanopq/blob/89dd8da1c449e0a0f3ac4b4635d87ef83368cd34/nanopq/pq.py#L168-L171">under 5 lines of numpy</a> and using that to find distances is a <a href="https://github.com/matsui528/nanopq/blob/89dd8da1c449e0a0f3ac4b4635d87ef83368cd34/nanopq/pq.py#L217">one-liner</a>.</p><h2 id="intermezzo-faceted-search">Intermezzo: faceted search</h2><p>Often times, you will want to search in some product subcategories, like finding only PDFs in a web search, or results in ancient Latin. Splitting up the distance computation from computing a top-10 ranking allows us to fudge the distances in flight before ranking. For million-scale search, this is highly feasible. In this search of Wikipedia, there is one search facet: the first character of the page. Because the top-k ranking is separate from distance computation we can avoid recomputing query embeddings and distances to explore different facet values in real time.</p><h2 id="step-3-hand-write-onnx">Step 3: hand-write ONNX</h2><p>ONNX has a specific opcode that does exactly the product quantization step! That opcode is GatherElements. Unfortunately, the PyTorch ONNX export does not use this special opcode for the model as written. Thankfully, there is abundant support for reading and writing ONNX outside of a PyTorch compilation step.</p><p>A useful graphical editing tool for ONNX is ONNX-modifier, at <a href="https://github.com/ZhangGe6/onnx-modifier">https://github.com/ZhangGe6/onnx-modifier</a> , which presents a friendly interface to add elements into the dataflow graph of any exported ONNX model.</p><p>By taking the multiple steps in the PyTorch model that gets compiled to ONNX, and replacing all of those with one ONNX opcode, distance computation is roughly 4x faster.</p><h2 id="step-4-export-numpy-to-arrow">Step 4: export numpy to Arrow</h2><p>As mentioned, the Arrow format is much more compact in memory and much more compact on disk to store the embeddings and the metadata (page titles).</p><p>Because the Arrow array format only stores one-dimensional data, and because we have 48 dimensions of embedding data, and because we do not want to store embedding data wrapped in another data format, we need two separate schemas, one for the metadata (with a hundred thousand rows each), and one for the embeddings (with a hundred thousand * 48 rows each), and we reshape the embeddings at load time.</p><p>Storing the product quantization codebook in JSON is under 1.0MB, so it is less crucial to optimize this part.</p><h2 id="step-5-let-me-know-what-you-think-">Step 5: let me know what you think 🙂</h2><p>Lots of the library functions in the full <a href="https://github.com/lsb/sqlite-vector-search/tree/trunk/vector-search-sqlite-react">Wikipedia search app</a> should migrate into reusable <a href="https://github.com/lsb/pq.js">pq.js</a> components. A lot of the ONNX shapes are pre-baked, so it would be useful to support different quantization levels and different embedding dimensions. <a href="mailto:leebutterman@gmail.com">Give a shout!</a></p></div> </article></div></div>]]></description>

The titles include “Wild Mushroom Cookbook: form [sic] forest to gourmet plate, a complete guide to wild mushroom cookery” and “The Supreme Mushrooms Books Field Guide of the South-West”.</p><p>Four samples from the books were examined for the Guardian by Originality.ai, a US firm that detects AI content. The company said every sample had a rating of 100% on its AI detection score, meaning that its systems are highly confident that the books were written by a chatbot such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt" data-link-name="in body link">ChatGPT</a>.</p><p>Examples of prose from the books include: “The sweet smell of freshly cooked mushrooms wafted through the air, bringing back fond memories of my mother” and “Foraging for wild mushrooms is a deeply rewarding experience that connects us with nature’s abundance and the rich tapestry of flowers that the Earth provides.”</p><p>The other books tested by Originality.ai were “Wild Mushroom Cookbook: A beginner’s guide to learning the basics of cooking with wild mushrooms for health and flavor, complete with easy-to-follow recipes!” and “Wild Mushroom Cookbook: unlock the delicious secrets of nature’s most flavorful fungi”. The Guardian has attempted to contact the authors named on the books.</p><p>Leon Frey, a foraging guide and field mycologist at Cornwall-based Family Foraging Kitchen, which organises foraging field trips, said the samples he had seen contained serious flaws such as referring to “smell and taste” as an identifying feature. “This seems to encourage tasting as a method of identification. This should absolutely not be the case,” he said.</p><p>Some wild mushrooms, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/aug/10/victoria-death-cap-mushroom-poisoning-what-are-death-caps-deadly-toxic-poisonous-australia" data-link-name="in body link">like the highly poisonous death cap</a>, which can be mistaken for edible varieties, are toxic.</p><p>Frey said that one book refers to the lion’s mane fungus, which is edible but a protected species in the UK and should not be picked. “I would recommend choosing books from reputable sources,” he added.</p><p>Prof Myron Smith, a fungi specialist at Carleton University in Canada, said the books were “totally irresponsible”. He said: “Some of the differences between edibles and non-edibles are very subtle and it really takes an experienced eye and knowledge to discriminate between them.”</p><figure id="4c8e1696-c2bc-4b8d-b1c4-cf6262f96d9d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TweetBlockElement"><gu-island name="TweetBlockComponent" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TweetBlockElement&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;nojs-tweet\&quot;><p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;>🚨: PSA Alert!<br>🔗: link in bio<a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>@Amazon</a> and other retail outlets have been inundated with AI foraging and identification books. <br><br>Please only buy books of known authors and foragers, it can literally mean life or death. <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/FSqQLDhh42\&quot;>pic.twitter.com/FSqQLDhh42</a></p>&amp;mdash; newyorkmyc (@newyorkmyc) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/newyorkmyc/status/1695689778224594959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 27, 2023</a></blockquote>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/newyorkmyc/status/1695689778224594959&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1695689778224594959&quot;,&quot;hasMedia&quot;:false,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;inline&quot;,&quot;isThirdPartyTracking&quot;:false,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;4c8e1696-c2bc-4b8d-b1c4-cf6262f96d9d&quot;}}"><div id="tweet-container-4c8e1696-c2bc-4b8d-b1c4-cf6262f96d9d"><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨: PSA Alert!<br>🔗: link in bio<a href="https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Amazon</a> and other retail outlets have been inundated with AI foraging and identification books. </p><p>Please only buy books of known authors and foragers, it can literally mean life or death. <a href="https://t.co/FSqQLDhh42">pic.twitter.com/FSqQLDhh42</a></p></div>— newyorkmyc (@newyorkmyc) <a href="https://twitter.com/newyorkmyc/status/1695689778224594959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2023</a></blockquote></div></gu-island></figure><p>The AI mushroom books were first reported by the <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-mushroom-foraging-books-amazon/" data-link-name="in body link">404 Media site</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <section>
        <p>The Dead Sea scrolls, made of parchment and papyrus, are still readable nearly two millennia after their creation — yet the expected shelf life of a DVD is about 100 years. Several of Andy Warhol’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/24/5646554/andy-warhols-lost-amiga-computer-art-photo-essay?ref=longnow.org">doodles</a>, created and stored on a Commodore Amiga computer in the 01980s, were forever stranded there in an obsolete format. During a data-migration in 02019, millions of songs, videos and photos were lost when MySpace — once the Internet’s leading social network — fell prey to an <a href="https://mashable.com/article/myspace-data-loss?ref=longnow.org">irreversible data loss</a>.</p><p>A false sense of security persists surrounding digitized documents: because an infinite number of identical copies can be made of any original, most of us believe that our electronic files have an indefinite shelf life and unlimited retrieval opportunities. In fact, preserving the world’s online content is an increasing concern, particularly as file formats (and the hardware and software used to run them) become scarce, inaccessible, or antiquated, technologies evolve, and data decays. Without constant maintenance and management, most digital information will be lost in just a few decades. Our modern records are far from permanent.</p><p>Obstacles to data preservation are generally divided into three broad categories: <em>hardware longevity</em> (e.g., a hard drive that degrades and eventually fails); <em>format accessibility</em> (a 5 ¼ inch floppy disk formatted with a filesystem that can’t be read by a new laptop); and <em>comprehensibility</em> (a document with an long-abandoned file type that can’t be interpreted by any modern machine). The problem is compounded by encryption (data <em>designed</em> to be inaccessible) and abundance (deciding what among the vast human archive of stored data is actually worth preserving).</p><p>The looming threat of the so-called “<a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/category/digital-dark-age/">Digital Dark Age</a>”, accelerated by the extraordinary growth of an invisible commodity — data — suggests we have fallen from a golden age of preservation in which everything of value was saved. In fact, countless records of previous historical eras have all but disappeared. The first Dark Ages, shorthand for the period beginning with the fall of the Roman Empire and stretching into the Middle Ages (00500-01000 CE), weren’t actually characterized by intellectual and cultural emptiness but rather by a dearth of historical documentation produced during that era.</p><p>Even institutions built for the express purpose of information preservation have succumbed to the ravages of time, natural disaster or human conquest. The famous library of Alexandria, one of the most important repositories of knowledge in the ancient world, eventually faded into obscurity. Built in the fourth century B.C., the library flourished for some six centuries, an unparalleled center of intellectual pursuit. Alexandria’s archive was said to contain half a million papyrus scrolls — the largest collection of manuscripts in the ancient world — including works by Plato, Aristotle, Homer and Herodotus. By the fifth century A.D., however, the majority of its collections had been stolen or destroyed, and the library fell into disrepair.</p><p>Digital archives are no different. The durability of the web is far from guaranteed. <a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/a-long-bet-on-link-rot-is-resolved-but-questions-about-the-durability-of-the-web-still-remain/">Link rot</a>, in which outdated links lead readers to dead content (or a cheeky dinosaur icon), sets in like a pestilence. Corporate data sets are often abandoned when a company folds, left to sit in proprietary formats that no one without the right combination of hardware, software, and encryption keys can access. Scientific data is a particularly thorny problem: unless it’s saved to a public repository accessible to other researchers, technical information essentially becomes unusable or lost. Beyond switching to <a href="https://www.planetanalog.com/the-hottest-data-storage-medium-ismagnetic-tape/?ref=longnow.org">analog alternatives</a>, which have their own drawbacks, how might we secure our digital information so that it survives for generations? How can individuals, private corporations and public entities coordinate efforts to ensure that their data is saved in more resilient formats?</p><p>Organizations like The Long Now Foundation are among those working to combat the Digital Dark Age (Long Now in fact coined the term at an early <a href="https://longnow.org/events/01998/feb/08/time-and-bits/">digital continuity conference</a> in 01998), drawing on open-source software, coordinated action across platforms, transparency in design, innovative technologies, and a long view of preservation. From thought experiments and industry analysis to more concrete projects, these organizations are imagining preservation on a massive time scale.</p><figure><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/ROSETTA_DISK_02.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1323"><figcaption>The Rosetta Disk is just one possible way that we can preserve linguistic data for future generations.</figcaption></figure><p>Consider the <a href="http://rosettaproject.org/?ref=longnow.org">Rosetta Project</a>, Long Now’s first exploration into very long-term archiving. The idea was to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages that would be readable to an audience 10,000 years hence. “What does it mean to have a 10,000-year library?” asks Andrew Warner, Project Manager of Rosetta. “Having parallel translations was enough to unlock the actual Rosetta Stone, so we decided to construct a ‘decoder ring,’ figuring that if someone understood one of the 1,500 languages on our disk, they could eventually decipher the entire library.” Long Now worked with linguists and engineers to microscopically etch this text onto a solid nickel disk, creating an artifact that could survive millennia. More symbolic than pragmatic, the Rosetta Project underscores the problem of digital obsolescence and explores ways we might address it through creative archival storage methods. “We created the disk not to be apocalyptic, but to encourage people to think about our more immediate future,” says Warner.</p><p>Indeed, the idea of a 10,000 year timescale captures an anxious public imagination that’s very much grounded in the present. How will technological innovation such as generative artificial intelligence change the way we interpret (and govern) the world? What threats — climate change, pandemics, nuclear war, economic instability, asteroid impacts — will loom large in the next decamillennium? Which information should we preserve for posterity, and how? What are the costs associated with that preservation, be they economic, environmental or moral? “Long Now will be a keeper of knowledge,” says Warner. “But we don’t want to end up erecting a digital edifice in a barren wasteland.”</p><hr><p>As personal computing and the ability to create digital documents became ubiquitous toward the end of the 20th century, preservation institutions — museums, libraries, non-profits, archives — and individuals — were faced with a new challenge: not simply how to preserve material, but <em>what</em> to collect and preserve in perpetuity. The astonishingly rapid accumulation of data has led to a problem of abundance: digital information is accumulating at a staggering rate. Scientific, medical and government sectors in particular have amassed billions of emails, messages, reports, cables and images, leaving future historians to sift through and categorize an enormously capacious collection — one projected to <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3325397/idc-expect-175-zettabytes-of-data-worldwide-by-2025.html?ref=longnow.org">exceed hundreds of zettabytes by 02025</a>. The Clinton White House, by one estimate, churned out 6 million emails per year. NASA’s sky surveys rely on over 2 billion uploaded images. The endless proliferation of junk-content, both human and A.I.-generated, makes sifting through all this data even trickier.</p><p>The term of art for this sorting is known as <em>appraisal</em>: deciding whether or not something should be preserved and what resources are required to do so. “One ongoing challenge is that there’s so much to preserve, and so much that can help diversify the archival record and reflect the society we live in,” says Jefferson Bailey, Director of Archiving &amp; Data Services at the <a href="https://archive.org/about/">Internet Archive</a>, a digital library based in San Francisco that provides free public access to countless collections of digitized materials.</p><figure><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/Internet-Archive-servers.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500"><figcaption>Servers housed at the Internet Archive's San Francisco headquarters.</figcaption></figure><p>The organization began in 01996 by archiving the Internet itself, a medium that was just beginning to grow in use. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral — but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it. Now, the service has more than two million users per day, the vast majority of whom use the site’s <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine,</a> a search function for over 700 billion pages of internet history. Educators interested in archived websites, journalists tracking citations, litigators seeking out intellectual property evidencing or trademark infringement, even armchair scholars curious about the Internet’s past, all can take a ride on this digital time travel apparatus, whose mission is “to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.” That includes websites, music, films, moving images and books.</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p><strong>WATCH</strong> Brewster Kahle's 02011 Long Now Talk, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_ALlJGU_c&amp;ref=longnow.org">Universal Access to All Knowledge</a>," on how the Internet Archive, deemed "impossible" when he founded it in 01996, became an essential part of the web. </p><p><strong>WATCH</strong> Jason Scott's 02015 Long Now Talk, "<a href="https://youtu.be/kugg_fewUgQ?ref=longnow.org">The Web in an Eye Blink</a>," which details Scott's project at the Internet Archive to save all the computer games and make them playable again inside modern web browsers.</p></div></div><p>Some of the services provided by the Internet Archive enable institutions to document their own web properties or older materials, but the frequency of this backup varies. “We archive many widely-read and frequently-changing websites multiple times a day, whereas other sites may only be archived once or twice a year,” says Bailey. Web scrapers allow for easy archiving, but then there’s the problem of storage. A single copy of the Internet Archive library collection occupies more than 99 petabytes of server space (the organization stores at least two copies of everything). Safely storing any long-lived data requires significant emissions, energy and cost.</p><p>The Internet Archive also takes multi-century preservation energy costs into account: “We own and operate and run all our own data centers,” says Bailey. “That’s partly because we’re an archive and don’t want to be dependent on corporate infrastructure, and partly because we can then run less expensive climate control operations.”</p><figure><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/ignite-project-silica-superman-closeup_1920x1280.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1280"><figcaption>Microsoft Research’s Project Silica storage device.</figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-silica/?ref=longnow.org">Project Silica</a> aims to tackle the problem by providing an alternative to traditional magnetic media, which degrades over time. The company created a low-cost, durable WORM media (an acronym for Write Once, Read Many, which means that data is written to a storage medium a single time and cannot be erased or modified). Considered immutable, WORM storage plays a pivotal role in meeting data security and compliance requirements and protecting against ransomware and other threats. Project Silica’s media is also resistant to electromagnetic frequencies: stored in quartz glass, the lifetime of data can be extended to tens of thousands of years. This has important implications for sustainability, because users can leave data in situ, eliminating the costly cycle of periodically copying data to a new media generation.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/87581945-94a94b80-c68e-11ea-8934-0870b0025e7e.webp" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><p><img src="https://static.longnow.org/2023/07/arcticvault1.webp" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></div><figcaption>The Arctic Code Vault in Svalbard.</figcaption></figure><p>Another option is to store data in Earth’s most remote places. GitHub created an <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/?ref=longnow.org">Arctic Code Vault</a>, a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. Such cold storage is meant to last at least 1,000 years and shield data from the outside world’s effects. Arctic archiving strategies could have potential as much of the world warms. Eliminating the need for costly HVAC filtration or cooling systems, building for redundancy, putting in place multiple failovers, storing data in remote or unconventional locations — these are certainly laudable measures, but more will need to be done to mitigate the enormous ecological impact of all this storage. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/29/streamings-dirty-secret-how-viewing-netflix-top-10-creates-vast-quantity-of-co2?ref=longnow.org">Streaming</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html?ref=longnow.org">cryptocurrency</a>, and day-to-day <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think?ref=longnow.org">Internet use</a> already make up nearly 4% of global CO2 emissions — a statistic that rivals the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. Sustainability must be a paramount concern of digital preservation technologies.</p><hr><p>For individual users worried about data preservation, the answer may lie in a switch to better systems with more robust methods of encoding, or investing in mechanisms that permit a kind of time travel to older formats. <a href="https://archive-it.org/?ref=longnow.org">Archive-It</a>, Internet Archive’s web archiving service, offers subsidized and grant-funded services to organizations, including over 1,500 libraries, archives, governments and nonprofits, enabling users to create a personalized cultural heritage storage system. There’s also <a href="https://www.permanent.org/?ref=longnow.org">Permanent Legacy Foundation</a>, a cloud service backed by a nonprofit that allows consumers to permanently store and share their digital archives with loved ones, community members and future generations. “The most distinctive component of Permanent is our legacy planning feature,” says Robert Friedman, Executive Director at Permanent. “We have a very robust vision for memorialized content — what people can do with their archives once they’re no longer able to maintain them.” For a one-time fee, Permanent will convert a user’s files (documents, video, image, audio) to more durable formats; a Microsoft Word document might be converted to a PDF, for example. “The purpose is to make sure there exists at least one copy of every file that isn’t tied to a proprietary format,” says Friedman.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><strong>READ</strong> our <a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/the-permanent-legacy-foundation-wants-to-preserve-your-digital-legacy-for-future-generations/">02020 profile</a> of the Permanent Legacy Foundation and its goal to preserve individuals' digital legacies for future generations.</p></div><p>Not being tied to a corporate entity or the commercial cloud means many of these organizations can have a direct stake in the sustainability of their operations. “If you need your data available consistently, then you have to keep running the operation at idle,” says Friedman. But for many people, their data will never be needed again after death, in which case, those personal archives can be sealed and deleted. “We don’t strip you of your rights,” he adds, “but we do need to know what to do with that data, including whether to destroy it.” Permanent is also conservative in its appraisals, and its subscription model encourages individuals to be selective about what they choose to preserve. (Fees collected by Permanent are used to fund the ongoing cost of storage and operations.)</p><p>“This challenge is not something that one organization is going to solve: it has to be a collective effort,” says Bailey. Federal agencies, public libraries, research institutions and private corporations, each with different budgets and mandates, must come together to address the issue of storage and associated concerns. And, as technology accelerates and emulation of older systems becomes more difficult, Digital Dark Age preppers may need to consider not just the survival of data, but the possibility that it may be misunderstood. Getting future readers to parse what we’ve preserved, and to make sense of that information, is an existential challenge without easy answers.</p><p>The basic lingua franca of the internet is bits: zeroes and ones that lack intrinsic meaning without software and hardware. These bits are effectively linguistic symbols, which can be transmitted over long distances and represent wildly different objects — a string of ones and zeros might represent a photograph, video, sound or text. Barring the invention of some extraordinary universal translation system, making sense of these binary codes without knowing how they were intended to be read is impossible. &nbsp;Also consider online disinformation, spread either by humans or artificial intelligence. Many digital archives already struggle to exclude or annotate content, not to mention living websites like Wikipedia, Twitter or Facebook, which must be continuously monitored for harmful or fraudulent content. “If you exclude fake news, does that mean you run the risk of a non-representative archive?” asks Bailey. “We are open to removal if there’s a reason, and we do it.”</p><p>Public and private organizations and policy-makers will need to decide what content should be restricted, embargoed, or scraped from the web entirely, and design robust digital repositories that can weather the ravages of time. People with limited resources must also be ensured the ability to preserve their data; long-term storage should be designed for equity as well as for sustainability. Finally, we must be judicious in what we store and preserve, creating a meaningful collection for future historians. Our future — and our past — depend on it.</p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>I’ve been a huge fan of coroutines since the mid-1990s.</p>
    <p>I encountered the idea as a student, when I first read <cite>The
      Art of Computer Programming</cite>. I’d been programming already
      for most of my childhood, and I was completely blown away by the
      idea, which was entirely new to me. In fact, it’s probably not
      an exaggeration to say that in the whole of <cite>TAOCP</cite> that
      was the single thing that changed my life the most.</p>
    <p>Within a few months of encountering the idea for the first
      time, I found myself wanting to use it in real code, during a
      vacation job at a (now defunct) tech company. Sadly I was coding
      in C at the time, which didn’t support coroutines. But I didn’t
      let that stop me: I came up with a C preprocessor trick that
      worked well enough to fake them, and did it anyway.</p>
    <p>The trick I came up with has limitations, but it’s reliable
      enough to use in serious code. I wrote it up a few years later
      in the
      article ‘<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">Coroutines
      in C</a>’, and I’ve been using it ever since, in both C and C++,
      whenever the code I’m trying to write looks as if it would be
      most naturally expressed in that style.</p>
    <p>Or rather, I do that in code bases <em>where I can get away
      with it</em>, because it’s unquestionably a weird and unorthodox
      style of C by normal standards, and not everyone is prepared to
      take it in their stride. Mostly I limit my use of C-preprocessor
      coroutines to free software projects where I’m the lead or only
      developer (in
      particular, <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
      and <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/spigot/"><code>spigot</code></a>),
      because there, I get to choose what’s an acceptable coding style
      and what’s not. The only time I’ve ever used the same technique
      in code I wrote for an employer was in that original vacation
      job where I invented the trick – and I’m sure I only got away
      with it that time because my team didn’t practise code
      review.</p>
    <p>Of course, I’m also happy to use coroutine-style idioms in any
      language where you <em>don’t</em> have to resort to trickery,
      such as using generators in Python whenever it seems like a good
      idea.</p>
    <p>Whenever I <em>can’t</em> use coroutines, I feel limited,
      because it’s become second nature to me to spot parts of a
      program that <em>want</em> to be written in coroutine style, and
      would be more awkward to express in other ways. So I’m very much
      in favour of coroutines becoming more mainstream – and I’ve been
      pleased to see support appearing in more and more languages over
      the decades. At the time of writing this, Wikipedia has
      an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Native_support">impressive
      list of languages</a> that now include coroutine support; from
      my own perspective, the big ones are Python generators, and the
      addition of a coroutine system to C++20.</p>
    <p>I recently got round
      to <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/">learning
      about the C++20 system</a> in detail. In the course of that, I
      had conversations about coroutines with several friends and
      colleagues, which made me think more seriously about the fact
      that I’m so fond of them, and wonder if I had anything more
      specific to say about that than ‘they’re really useful’.</p>
    <p>It turned out that I did. So this article presents my
      ‘philosophy of coroutines’: <em>why</em> I find them so useful,
      what kinds of thing they’re useful for, tricks I’ve learned for
      getting the most out of them, and even a few different ways of
      thinking <em>about</em> them.</p>
    <p>But it discusses coroutines as a general concept, not specific
      to their implementation in any particular language. So where I
      present code snippets, they’ll be in whatever language is
      convenient to the example, or even in pure pseudocode.</p>
    <h2 id="awesome">Why I’m so enthusiastic about coroutines</h2>
    <p>Go on then, why <em>do</em> I like coroutines so much?</p>
    <p>Well, from first principles, there are two possibilities.
      Either it’s because they really are awesome, or it’s because
      they suit my personal taste. (Or a combination of the two, of
      course.)</p>
    <p>I can think of arguments for both of those positions, but I
      don’t think I have the self-awareness to decide which is more
      significant. So I’ll just present both sets of arguments, and
      let you make up your own mind about whether you end up also
      thinking they’re awesome.</p>
    <h3 id="objective">The objective view: what makes them useful?</h3>
    <p>To answer ‘what makes coroutines useful?’, it’s useful to start
      by deciding what we’re <em>comparing</em> them to. I can’t answer
      ‘why is a coroutine more useful than <i>X?</i>’ without knowing
      what <i>X</i> we’re talking about. And there’s more than one
      choice.</p>
    <h4 id="vs-state-machines">Versus explicit state machines</h4>
    <p>Two decades ago, when I wrote
      ‘<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">Coroutines
      in C</a>’, I included an explanation of why coroutines are
      useful, based on the idea that the alternative was to write an
      ordinary function containing an explicit state machine.</p>
    <p>Suppose you have a function that consumes a stream of values,
      and due to the structure of the rest of your program, it has to
      receive each individual value via a separate function call:</p>
<pre>function process_next_value(v) {
    // ...
}</pre>
    <p>And suppose the nature of the stream is such that the way you
      handle each input value depends on what the previous values
      were. I’ll show an example similar to the previous article,
      which is a simple run-length decompressor processing a stream of
      input bytes: the idea is that most input bytes are emitted
      literally to the output, but one byte value is special, and is
      followed by a (length, output byte) pair indicating that the
      output byte should be repeated a number of times.</p>
    <p>To write that as a conventional function accepting a single
      byte on each call, you have to keep a state variable of some
      kind to remind you of what you were going to use the next byte
      for:</p>
<pre>function process_next_byte(byte) {
    if (state == TOP_LEVEL) {
        if (byte != ESCAPE_BYTE) {
            // emit the byte literally and stay in the same state
            output(byte);
        } else {
            // go into a state where we expect to see a run length next
            state = EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH;
        }
    } else if (state == EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH) {
        // store the length
        run_length = byte;
        // go into a state where we expect the byte to be repeatedly output
        state = EXPECT_OUTPUT;
    } else if (state == EXPECT_OUTPUT) {
        // output this byte the right number of times
        for i in (1,...,run_length)
            output(byte);
        // and go back to the top-level state for the next input byte
        state = TOP_LEVEL;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>(This is pseudocode, so I’m not showing the details of how you
      arrange for <code>state</code> and <code>run_length</code> to be
      preserved between calls to the function. Whatever’s convenient
      in your language. These days they’re probably member variables
      of a class, in most languages.)</p>
    <p>This is pretty unwieldy code to write, because structurally, it
      looks a lot like a collection of blocks of code connected by
      ‘goto’ statements. They’re not <em>literally</em> goto
      statements – each one works by setting <code>state</code> to
      some value and returning from the function – but they have the
      same semantic effect, of stating by name which part of the
      function is going to be run next.</p>
    <p>The more complicated the control structure is, the more
      cumbersome it becomes to write code in this style, or to read
      it. Suppose I wanted to enhance my run-length compression format
      so that it could efficiently represent repetitions of
      a <em>sequence</em> of bytes, not just <code>AAAAAAA</code>
      but <code>ABABABAB</code> or <code>ABCDEABCDE</code>? Then I
      wouldn’t just need an <em>output</em> loop to emit <i>n</i>
      copies of something; I’d also need a loop on the input side,
      because the input format would probably contain an ‘input
      sequence length’ byte followed by that many bytes of literal
      input. But I can’t write that one as a <code>for</code>
      statement, because it has to return to the caller to get each
      input byte; instead, I’d have to build a ‘for loop’ structure
      out of these small building blocks.</p>
    <p>The more code you write in this style, the more you probably
      wish that the caller and callee were the other way round. If you
      were writing the same run-length decompression code in a context
      where you <em>called</em> a function to read the next byte, it
      would look a lot more natural (not to mention shorter), because
      you could call the get-byte function in multiple places:</p>
<pre>function run_length_decompress(stream) {
    while (byte = stream.getbyte()) {
        if (byte != ESCAPE_BYTE) {
            output(byte);
        } else {
            run_length = stream.getbyte();
            byte_to_repeat = stream.getbyte();
            for i in (1,...,run_length)
                output(byte_to_repeat);
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>This function actually contains the same state machine as the
      previous version – but it’s entirely implicit. If you want to
      know what each piece of code will do when its next input byte
      arrives (say, during debugging), then in the state-machine
      version you answer it by asking for the value
      of <code>state</code> – but in this version, you’d answer it by
      looking at a stack backtrace to find out which of the calls
      to <code>stream.getbyte()</code> the byte will be returned from,
      because that’s what controls where execution will resume from.</p>
    <p>In other words, each of the three state
      values <code>TOP_LEVEL</code>, <code>EXPECT_RUN_LENGTH</code>
      and <code>EXPECT_OUTPUT</code> in the state-machine code
      corresponds precisely to one of the three calls
      to <code>stream.getbyte()</code> in this version. So there’s
      still a piece of data in the program tracking which of those
      ‘states’ we’re in – but it’s the <em>program counter</em>, and
      doesn’t need to be a named variable with a set of explicit named
      or numbered state values.</p>
    <p>And if you needed to extend <em>this</em> version of the code
      so that it could read a list of input bytes to repeat, it would
      be no trouble at all, because there’s nothing to stop you
      putting a call to <code>stream.getbyte()</code> in a loop:</p>
<pre>            num_output_repetitions = stream.getbyte();
            num_input_bytes = stream.getbyte();
            for i in (1,...,num_input_bytes)
                input_bytes.append(stream.getbyte());
            for i in (1,...,num_output_repetitions)
                for byte in input_bytes
                    output(byte);
</pre>
    <p>and you wouldn’t have to mess around with inventing extra
      values in your state enumeration, coming up with names for them,
      checking the names weren’t already used, renaming other states
      if their names had become ambiguous, carefully writing
      transitions to and from existing states, etc. You can just
      casually write a loop, and the programming language takes care
      of the rest.</p>
    <p>(I tend to think of the state-machine style as ‘turning the
      function inside out’, in a more or less literal sense: the calls
      to a ‘get byte’ function ought to be nested
      deeply <em>inside</em> the code’s control flow, but instead,
      we’re forced to make them the <em>outermost</em> layer, so that
      ‘now wait for another byte’ consists of control falling off the
      end of the function, and ‘ok, we’ve got one now, carry on’ is at
      the top.)</p>
    <p>Using coroutines, you can write the code in this latter style,
      with the explicit state machine replaced by the implicit program
      counter, <em>even</em> if the rest of the program needs to work
      by passing each output byte to a function call.</p>
    <p>In other words, you can write this part of the program ‘the way
      it wants to be written’ – the way that is most convenient for
      the nature of what the code has to do. And you didn’t have to
      force the <em>rest</em> of the program to change its structure
      to compensate. That might have required equally awkward
      contortions elsewhere, in which case you’d only have moved the
      awkwardness around, and not removed it completely.</p>
    <p>Coroutines give you greater freedom to choose the structure of
      each part of your program, independently of the other parts. So
      each part can be as clear as possible.</p>
    <p><em>Coroutines mean never having to turn your code inside
      out.</em></p>
    <h4 id="vs-threads">Versus conventional threads</h4>
    <p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, that was the only argument I felt
      I needed in favour of coroutines. But now it’s 2023, and
      coroutines have another competitor: multithreading.</p>
    <p>Another way to solve the code-structure dilemma in the previous
      section would be to put the decompression code into its own
      thread. You’d have to set up a thread-safe method of giving it
      its input values – say, some kind of lock-protected queue or ring
      buffer, which would cause the decompressor thread to block if
      the queue was empty, and the thread providing the data to block
      if it was full. But then there would be no reason
      to <em>pretend</em> either side was making a function call when
      it really wasn’t. Each side <em>really would</em> be making a
      function call to provide an output byte or read an input byte,
      and there would be no contradiction, because the call stacks of
      the two threads are completely independent.</p>
    <p>One of my software
      projects, <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/spigot/"><code>spigot</code></a>,
      is a complicated C++ program completely full of coroutines that
      generate streams of data. I was chatting to a friend recently
      about the possibility – in principle – of rewriting it in Rust.
      But I don’t actually know a lot about Rust yet (if I did try
      this, it would be a learning experience and a half!), and so of
      course I asked: ‘What about all the coroutines? Would I
      implement those using async Rust in some way, or what?’</p>
    <p>My Rust-programmer friend replied: no, don’t even bother. Just
      use threads. Turn each of <code>spigot</code>’s coroutines into
      ordinary non-async Rust code, and run it in its own thread,
      passing its output values to some other thread which will block
      until a value is available. <em>It’ll be fine. Threads are
      cheap.</em></p>
    <p>I have to start by acknowledging my personal biases:
      my <em>first</em> reaction to that attitude is purely emotional.
      It just gives me the heebie-jeebies.</p>
    <p>My own programming style has always been single-threaded
      wherever possible. I mostly only use extra threads when I really
      can’t avoid it, usually because some operating system or library
      API makes it impossible, or <em>astonishingly</em> awkward, to
      do a thing any other way.<label for="footnoteinput-win32-read-write"><sup id="footnote-win32-read-write">1</sup><span>For
      example, in the Win32 API, if you have a bidirectional file
      handle such as a serial port or a named pipe, and you need to
      simultaneously try to read and write it, I think it
      really <em>is</em> the least inconvenient thing to have two
      threads, one trying to read the handle and one trying to write
      it. The alternative <code>GetOverlappedResult</code> approach
      ended up being <em>more</em> painful when I tried it.</span><span>1</span></label>
      I’ve occasionally gone as far as parallelising a large number of
      completely independent computations using some convenient
      ready-made system like Python <code>multiprocessing</code>, but
      I’m at least as likely to do that kind of thing by putting each
      computation into a completely separate <em>process</em>, and
      parallelising them at the process level, using
      a <code>make</code>-type tool or GNU <code>parallel</code>.</p>
    <p>Partly, that’s because I still think of threads as heavyweight.
      On Linux, they consume a process id, and those have a limited
      supply. Switching between threads requires a lot more saving and
      restoring of registers than an ordinary function call,
      and <em>also</em> needs a transfer from user mode to kernel mode
      and back, with an extra set of saves and restores for that. The
      data structures you use to transfer data values between the
      threads must be protected by a locking mechanism, which costs
      extra time and faff. <em>Perhaps</em> all of these
      considerations are minor in 2023, where they were significant in
      2000? I still <em>feel</em> as if I wouldn’t want to commit to
      casually making 250 threads in the course of a
      single <code>spigot</code> computation (which is about the
      number of coroutines it constructs in the course of computing a
      few hundred digits
      of <a href="https://xkcd.com/217/"><i>e</i><sup><i>π</i></sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;<i>π</i></a>), <em>or</em>
      to doing a kernel-level thread switch for every single time one
      of those threads passes a tuple of four integers to
      another. <code>spigot</code> is slow enough as it is – and one
      of my future ambitions for it is to be able to parallelise 1000
      of <em>those</em> computations! But I have to admit that I
      haven’t actually tried this strategy and benchmarked it.
      So <em>maybe</em> I have an outdated idea of what it would
      cost.</p>
    <p>Also, I think of threads as <em>dangerous</em>. You have to do
      all that locking and synchronisation to prevent race conditions,
      and it’s often complicated, and easy to get wrong. My instinct
      is to view any non-trivial use of threads as 100 data-race bugs
      waiting to happen. (And if you manage to avoid all of those,
      probably half a dozen deadlocks hiding behind them!) Now in
      this <em>particular</em> conversation we were talking about
      Rust, and that’s a special case on this count, because Rust’s
      unique selling point is to guarantee that your program is free
      of data races by the time you’ve managed to get it to compile at
      all. But in more or less any other language I think I’m still
      right to be scared!</p>
    <p>So I have strong prejudices against ‘just use real threads,
      it’ll be fine’. But I accept that I <em>might</em> be wrong
      about those. Supposing I am, are there any other arguments for
      using coroutines instead?</p>
    <p>One nice feature of everything being in the same system thread
      is debuggability. If you’re using an interactive debugger, you
      don’t have to worry about which thread you’re debugging, or
      which thread a breakpoint applies to: if the whole overall
      computation is happening in the same thread then you can just
      place a breakpoint in the normal way and it will be hit.</p>
    <p>And if you prefer debugging via ‘recompile with print
      statements’, that’s <em>also</em> more convenient in a
      single-threaded setup where the transfers of control are
      explicit, because you don’t have to worry about adding extra
      locks to ensure the debug messages themselves are atomic when
      multiple threads are producing them. You might not mind having
      to do fiddly lock-administration when you’re setting up
      the <em>real</em> data flow of your program, but it definitely
      slows down investigation if you have to do it for every
      throwaway print statement!</p>
    <p>But another nice thing about coroutines is that they’re easy
      to <em>abandon</em>. If a thread is in the middle of blocking on
      a lock, and you suddenly discover you no longer need that thread
      (and, perhaps, not the one it was blocking on either, or 25
      surrounding threads), then depending on your language’s
      threading system, it can get very painful to arrange to
      interrupt all those threads and terminate them. Even if you
      manage it at all, will all the resources they were holding get
      cleaned up? (File descriptors closed, memory freed, etc.)</p>
    <p>I don’t think thread systems are generally great at this. But
      coroutines <em>are</em>: a suspended coroutine normally has an
      identity as some kind of actual object in your programming
      language, and if you destroy or delete or free it, then you can
      normally arrange for it to be cleaned up in a precise manner,
      freeing any resources.</p>
    <p>Using <code>spigot</code> as an example again: most of its
      coroutines run indefinitely, and are prepared to yield an
      infinite stream of data if you want them to. At some point the
      ultimate consumer of the whole computation decides it’s got
      enough output, and destroys the entire web of connected
      coroutines. Using C++ with preprocessor-based coroutines, this
      is reliably achieved with zero memory leaks. I’d hate to have to
      figure out how to terminate 250 actual system threads as
      cleanly.</p>
    <p>Also, having a language object identifying the coroutine
      instance can be used for other stunt purposes. I’ll talk more
      about that in <a href="#named-object">a later section</a>.</p>
    <p>So <em>I</em> still prefer coroutines to threads. But I have to
      acknowledge that my reasons are a little bit more borderline
      than the reasons in the previous section.</p>
    <p>(However, this discussion is all about <em>pre-emptive</em>
      threads. <em>Cooperative</em> threads which yield to each other
      explicitly are a different matter, and I’ll talk about
      those <a href="#cothreads">later</a> as well.)</p>

    <h3 id="subjective">The subjective view: why do <em>I</em> like
      them so much?</h3>
    <p>This is already the kind of essay where I acknowledge my own
      bias. So I should also admit the possibility that it’s not so
      much that coroutines are objectively amazing, but rather, that
      they appealed especially strongly to <em>me personally</em> for
      some reason that doesn’t apply to everybody.</p>
    <p>I have a couple of theories about what that reason might be, if
      there is one.</p>
    <h4 id="student-ready">“Teach the student when the student is ready”</h4>
    <p>One possibility is that the concept was presented to me at
      exactly the right stage in my education.</p>
    <p>I’d already been programming for a number of years when I
      read <cite>TAOCP</cite>, so I’d already felt for myself the
      frustration of having to write a piece of code ‘inside out’ –
      that is, in the form of an explicit state machine that I’d
      rather have avoided – and I hadn’t thought of any way to make
      that less annoying. So when Donald Knuth helpfully presented me
      with one, I pounced on it with gratitude.</p>
    <p>But if I’d encountered the idea of coroutines
      earlier, <em>before</em> I’d felt that frustration, then I might
      not have appreciated it as much. It would have been one among
      many concepts that went through my brain as I read the books,
      and I’d have thought, ‘ok, fine, I expect that’s useful
      for <em>something</em>’, and then I’d have forgotten it (along
      with half of the rest of <cite>TAOCP</cite>, because there’s
      a <em>lot</em> of stuff in there!). And perhaps I might not have
      managed to recall it later, when the problem did appear in my
      life.</p>
    <p>Conversely, the idea of coroutines might <em>also</em> have had
      less impact on me if I’d learned about it <em>later</em>. I have
      a strong suspicion that if I’d spent another (say) five years
      writing pieces of code inside out because I had no idea there
      was another option, I’d have got much <em>better</em> at writing
      code inside out, and much more used to it, and then the
      opportunity to avoid having to do it wouldn’t have seemed like
      such a huge boon any more.</p>
    <p>Also, by that time, I’d probably have thought of some actual
      advantages to the inside-out state-machine style of coding, and
      started making use of them. There are often silver linings to be
      found in situations like this. In this case I can’t say for sure
      what they might be (since I never <em>did</em> become that
      practised at the skill); but one possibility that springs to
      mind is that an explicit list of states might make exhaustive
      testing more convenient (you can ensure you’ve tested every
      state and every transition). But whatever the compensating
      advantage might be, once I’d noticed it, I’d have been reluctant
      to lose it for the sake of (as I would have seen it)
      not <em>that</em> much extra convenience.</p>
    <p>(This is probably related to Paul Graham’s idea of
      the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub
      Paradox</a>, in which you look at a less powerful language than
      your favourite one and you <em>know</em> it’s less powerful,
      because it lacks some feature you’re used to, and you can’t
      imagine how you’d get anything done without that. But you look
      at a more powerful language that has features yours doesn’t, and
      whatever they are, you seem to have been getting along fine
      without them – so you conclude that they can’t be <em>that</em>
      important, and that the ‘more powerful’ language isn’t that much
      better really.)</p>
    <p>So perhaps it’s just that coroutines hit me at precisely my
      moment of peak frustration with exactly the problem they solve,
      and that’s why I adopted them with so much enthusiasm.</p>
    <h4 id="clarity">They suit my particular idea of code clarity</h4>
    <p>When you look at an existing piece of code, there are two
      different ways you might want to understand it.</p>
    <p>One way is: <em>on its own terms, what does this code do, and
      how do I modify it to do it differently?</em> For example, in
      the <a href="#vs-state-machines">decompressor example</a> a few
      sections ago, suppose you wanted to look at the code and figure
      out what the compressed data format was – either to write a
      specification, or to check it against an existing specification.
      Or suppose someone had just <em>changed</em> the specification
      for the compressed data format, and you had to adjust the code
      for the new spec.</p>
    <p>For that purpose, it doesn’t really matter how the code fits
      into the rest of the program. In fact you don’t even need
      to <em>see</em> the rest of the program. You could figure out
      the format from <em>either</em> of the code snippets I showed
      (the one with a state machine, or the one that
      calls <code>stream.getbyte()</code>), and it wouldn’t matter at
      all that the rest of the program hasn’t even been written. In
      both cases, you can see that the code is getting a stream of
      bytes from <em>somewhere</em>, be it a caller or a subroutine;
      you can follow the logic through and see what bytes cause what
      effects; if you’re updating the code, you just have to follow
      the existing idioms for input and output.</p>
    <p>But although you <em>can</em> do that level of work on either
      version of the code, it’s much easier to do it on the version
      that calls a ‘get byte’ function. At least, I think so; if
      anyone actually finds the state machine version <em>easier</em>
      to work with in that kind of way, I’d be interested to know
      why!</p>
    <p>But the other way you might want to understand a piece of code
      is: <em>how does this fit into the rest of the program, and how
      can I change that?</em> If you had no interest at all in the
      compressed data format and no reason to think this decompressor
      was delivering incorrect output, but you were concerned with
      what was being done <em>next</em> with the data being
      decompressed, then you’d want to find out not ‘what bytes are
      output, and how can I change that?’, but ‘when a byte is output,
      where does it go next, and is it the right place, and how do I
      reroute it to somewhere else?’.</p>
    <p>For <em>this</em> purpose, coroutines often make things less
      clear, rather than more. That’s especially true if they’re based
      on my C preprocessor system, because a person coming fresh to a
      function in that style is going to see some
      weirdo <code>crReturn</code> macro, look up the definition, be
      further baffled (it’s fairly confusing if you don’t already
      recognise the trick), and probably conclude that I’m throwing
      obstacles in their path on purpose! But other less ad-hoc
      coroutine systems have the same property; for example, in C++20
      coroutines, the mechanism for dealing with yielded data values
      lives in a ‘promise class’ type, which is inferred from the type
      signature of the coroutine itself by a system of template
      specialisations that could be almost anywhere in the source file
      or any of its header files. If there isn’t clear documentation
      somewhere in your code base, it might be legitimately quite hard
      to find out what happens to data after it leaves a C++20
      coroutine; you might very well find that the simplest way to
      answer the question was to step through the yield in a debugger
      and see what happened next.</p>
    <p>Which of these kinds of clarity is more important? Of course,
      both of them <em>are</em> important, because both are things you
      might need to understand, or fix, or update in your code. But if
      you spend 90% of time working on the code in one of those ways,
      and 10% of your time in the other way, you’re going to prefer
      the kind of clarity that helps you 90% of the time over the kind
      that helps you 10% of the time.</p>
    <p>And it so happens that my own preference skews towards the
      first kind. Perhaps that has to do with the types of program I
      work on. All my life I’ve gravitated to programs that solve
      complicated problems, because that’s the kind of thing I enjoy
      doing. In those programs, the individual subproblems are
      complicated and so are the pieces of code that deal with them;
      the data flow between them is a small part of the overall
      system. So I don’t want to make debugging each sub-piece of code
      harder, just for the sake of making the data flow more explicit.
      I’d rather each piece made sense on its own terms at the expense
      of the data flow being a little more opaque.</p>
    <p>This is also one example of a more general question. Is it
      better for each program to effectively define its own local
      customised variant of the language it’s written in (via very
      elaborate support libraries, metaprogramming tricks like macros,
      and the like), so that the learning curve takes a long time to
      climb, but you can work really effectively once you’ve climbed
      it? Or is it better to avoid diverging too much from the
      standard ways to use a language, so that a new programmer can
      get up to speed quickly?</p>
    <p>Again, my preference skews toward the former. I value the
      ability to make my own life easier if I’m spending a long time
      in a code base. And I don’t much mind climbing the learning
      curves for other people’s differently customised coding
      environments, because I often learn something in the process
      (and maybe steal any good ideas I find). But I know that there
      are other people who are much more in favour of sticking to the
      orthodoxy.</p>
    <p>(However, that’s only an argument against coroutines as long as
      they <em>aren’t</em> the orthodoxy. With more mainstream
      adoption, perhaps this argument is weakening. Generators in
      Python are <em>definitely</em> mainstream now: I’ve occasionally
      had a code reviewer tell me to use them <em>more!</em>)</p>

    <h2 id="technique">Techniques for getting the most out of coroutines</h2>
    <p>Of course, another reason why one person might find a language
      feature more useful than someone else is that they’re better at
      using it: better at spotting cases where it’s useful, better at
      getting the most out of it when they do use it. And let’s not
      forget the skill of <em>avoiding</em> using it when
      it <em>isn’t</em> useful, so that you don’t get annoyed by
      situations where it’s not really a good fit.</p>
    <p>Here’s a collection of my thoughts on when and how to use
      coroutines for best effect.</p>
    <h3 id="when">When to use coroutines, and when not to</h3>
    <p>My first general piece of advice is: <em>don’t be all-or-nothing
      about it</em>. Coroutines are useful in many situations, but
      they’re not the best tool for <em>every</em> job.</p>
    <p>Programming language features are conveniences, not moral
      imperatives. They exist to make your life easier. So in a case
      where a feature <em>doesn’t</em> make your life easier, it’s OK
      not to use it.</p>
    <p>(As far as I’m concerned, this applies to any language feature,
      not just coroutines. Another good example is recursion: it’s a
      very powerful and useful technique, but I have no time for
      languages that force you to use it for <em>everything</em>, even
      simple looping constructions. Especially if they also require
      you to learn all the tricks of passing extra parameters to
      permit tail recursion: to my way of thinking, that’s a clear
      sign that you’re trying to turn something into recursion that
      doesn’t really <em>want</em> to be written that way. Similarly,
      not everything needs to be a class – sorry, Java – and not
      everything needs to be immutable – sorry, Haskell.
      Multi-paradigm is the One True Way, because it’s the only way
      that doesn’t insist that there’s a One True Way!)</p>
    <p>As I said in an earlier section, precisely one of the good
      things about coroutines is that they give you the freedom to
      structure each part of a program in the way that’s most useful,
      independently of the rest. In particular, that includes the
      freedom to <em>not</em> use a coroutine in a particular
      situation, if you don’t want to!</p>
    <p>Coroutines are useful when successive calls to a function need
      to behave differently, in a way that ‘looks like control flow’.
      That’s hard to define, but after a while, you know the kind of
      thing when you see it: if the full sequence of function calls
      wants to exhibit a number of different behaviours one after
      another, or repeat an action lots of times with different
      actions coming before and after it, or diverge into two totally
      different sequences of operations based on some input condition
      (especially if you then re-converge into some later behaviour
      that looks the same regardless), or most especially repeat a
      sequence of things that <em>also</em> include sub-repetitions
      and conditionals of their own. Those are all the kinds of thing
      that would be very natural to write using sequential code, or
      loops, or if-statements, or nestings of those things – so once
      you recognise that ‘control flow nature’, consider writing it
      as <em>actual</em> control flow, in a coroutine.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, some things just <em>don’t need</em> to be
      coroutines. If a function needs to do basically the same thing
      every time, you <em>could</em> write it as a coroutine anyway,
      containing nothing but an infinite ‘while true: do thing’ loop,
      but there wouldn’t be any real point. That’s just boilerplate
      that makes simple code more complicated for the sake of it. In
      that situation, don’t bother!</p>

    <h3 id="use-cases">Types of code that might usefully become
      coroutines</h3>
    <p>Just waving my hands and saying ‘spot things that look like
      control flow’ isn’t the most helpful advice in the world, of
      course! So in this next section I’ll mention some things I’ve
      found them useful for in the past.</p>
    <p>In coming up with the list, I found it convenient to categorise
      coroutines according to whether they yield to get inputs or to
      produce output or both, and to what other pieces of code.</p>
    <h4 id="generator">Output only: generators</h4>
    <p>One of the simplest kinds of coroutine, and perhaps the most
      familiar to at least Python
      programmers<label for="footnoteinput-python-coroutines"><sup id="footnote-python-coroutines">2</sup><span>I talk about
      generators as if they were <em>the</em> coroutine system in
      Python, but in fact, they’re one of two: Python <em>also</em>
      has
      a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines">completely
      different kind of thing</a> that it actually uses the name
      ‘coroutine’ for, in which function definitions start
      with <code>async def</code> and suspend with <code>await</code>.
      I’ve never played with those, because generators are easier to
      get started with and have scratched my generalised coroutine
      itch well enough. But at some point I should at least give them
      a look.</span><span>2</span></label>, is the kind that yields values to a
      consumer, but its input comes either from the parameters it was
      passed on creation, or from ordinary function calls.</p>
    <p>(Of course, those function calls might be to the ‘next’ method
      of other generators, in which case you can look at this as
      taking input from a different coroutine after all! But only
      semantically: in a <a href="#resumable-callee">later section</a>
      I’ll mention a performance concern relating to this.)</p>
    <p>If a coroutine only generates output, then there’s a third
      alternative to making it a coroutine (as well as the
      state-machine and thread options discussed earlier): you can
      simply make it compute <em>all</em> its output ahead of time,
      and return it in full as a list or array. This gives you all the
      same advantages in terms of writing the control flow in a
      natural and readable style. For example, here are two versions
      of a simple function that finds the ‘record-breaking’ values in
      a list, i.e. every value that is larger than all the ones before
      it:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
<pre># Written as a generator
def record_breaking_values(inputs):
    it = iter(inputs)
    best = next(it)
    yield best
    for value in it:
        if value &gt; best:
            best = value
            yield best</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
<pre># Ordinary function that just returns a list
def record_breaking_values(inputs):
    it = iter(inputs)
    best = next(it)
    records = [best]
    for value in it:
        if value &gt; best:
            best = value
            records.append(best)
    return records</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In that example, the ‘just return a list’ function is one line
      longer because of the actual <code>return</code> statement. But
      that’s a trivial concern. (And I could have made it a line
      shorter instead, if I’d eliminated the <code>best</code>
      variable and just checked <code>records[-1]</code>, but then the
      two pieces of code wouldn’t have matched so clearly.) The point
      is that the control flow inside the function is exactly the
      same, and the algorithm is equally clear to a reader, and
      equally easy to modify.</p>
    <p>The advantages of the coroutine version over this are space and
      time. The space advantage is obvious: if that returned list
      is <em>long</em>, then it’s nicer to avoid ever having to store
      all of it in memory at once, and instead, throw away each value
      after it’s been used. This doesn’t reduce flexibility, because
      (at least in Python) there’s a very concise idiom for turning
      the output of a generator back into a list at the call site if
      you really do need it all available at once.</p>
    <p>(Of course, this is exactly the same reason that Unix provides
      a system for piping data between processes, in place of the more
      obvious approach of writing the data to an intermediate
      temporary file. One way to look at coroutines is that they’re
      the in-process analogue of a Unix
      pipe<label for="footnoteinput-knuth"><sup id="footnote-knuth">3</sup><span>In <cite>TAOCP</cite>, one of Knuth’s
      suggestions for a producer/consumer chain is that you might be
      flexible enough to make a runtime decision as
      to <em>whether</em> to run both parts interleaved as coroutines,
      or whether to run them sequentially storing the intermediate
      data on disk, depending on how much memory you have. I suspect
      this was a more vital concern in the 1970s.</span><span>3</span></label>!)</p>
    <p>The time advantages are more subtle. In fact it’s not
      immediately obvious how there’s a time advantage at all: surely
      the same <em>calculations</em> have to happen, whether we select
      the record-breaking values in advance of using them or
      interleaved with using them.</p>
    <p>And, of course, that’s true. If we really are going to
      use <em>all</em> the returned data, then the <em>overall</em>
      time taken to do the calculations is the same.</p>
    <p>But sometimes we’re concerned with intermediate timings as well
      as the overall time. For example, if an interactive program
      needs to output the next value in a sequence when the user
      performs a UI action, then it’s nicer if the time taken to
      compute that value is reasonably bounded, rather than the
      program <em>occasionally</em> saying “Hold on, I need to
      precompute the next 10000 items before I can give you the
      first of them…”</p>
    <p>And sometimes we’re <em>not</em> intending to use all of the
      returned data. Another way to look at generator-style coroutines
      like this is that they’re a form of <em>lazy evaluation</em>: no
      value in the logical output list is computed until another part
      of the program actually needs it, and that means that
      if <em>nothing</em> ever needs the value, we never wasted the
      time of computing it. In the interactive scenario, you’d
      be <em>particularly</em> annoyed at the program wasting your
      time on precomputing the next 10000 output values if you were
      intending to look at the first ten and then quit the program!</p>
    <p>One special case of this, where you <em>really can’t</em>
      compute the entire intermediate list up front, is if the
      intermediate list is potentially infinite! Some natural
      generators will just keep on and on generating data, and the
      only way to <em>ever</em> stop them is by their consumer getting
      bored and discarding them.</p>
    <p>In any case, the takeaway from this is: any time you see a
      function that constructs and returns a list, if it functions in
      more or less ‘append only’ mode (that is, it builds the list up
      from start to finish, and doesn’t have to refer back to an
      unlimited number of the existing items to decide what to append
      next), it’s worth considering whether it would be clearer
      written as a generator-style coroutine instead, if your language
      makes it convenient.</p>
    <h4 id="consumer">Input only: consumers</h4>
    <p>If I’ve had a section for output-only coroutines, then
      obviously I need a section for input-only ones.</p>
    <p>At least in normal languages where a coroutine is a special
      kind of function, these don’t often seem to be very useful. It’s
      commonplace to have one piece of code producing data and passing
      it to another that consumes it, but you usually only
      need <em>one</em> of them to be a special coroutine- or
      generator-type function; the other can just be a normal
      non-coroutine-style function that invokes the producer coroutine
      when it needs another item, e.g. by calling <code>next()</code>
      on a Python generator.</p>
    <p>You generally <em>can</em> write the two pieces of code the
      other way round, so that the producer is an ordinary function
      and the consumer is a coroutine. But it doesn’t often seem to
      be the easiest way to do things.</p>
    <p>Partly, that’s because languages don’t make it quite as easy.
      In Python, for example, you <em>can</em> pass data to a
      generator by calling <code>g.send(value)</code> and retrieve it
      inside the routine as the return value of the <code>yield</code>
      operator; but it’s awkward that the generator starts off in a
      state where its code hasn’t run at all yet, so you have to faff
      with it to get it to the point of first input. But other systems
      don’t have this awkwardness, or at least, you can arrange not to
      have it; for example, C++20 coroutines allow you to configure
      whether your coroutine should start off suspended, or run to the
      point of first yield / await. (Or other options.)</p>
    <p>More importantly, the consumer end of the data pipeline is
      probably the one that’s taking the program’s main action. So you
      probably want to make <em>sure</em> it completes. I mentioned
      above that one of the virtues of coroutines is often that
      they’re safely discardable (via the language’s cleanup or
      destructor system) if you want to abandon the computation half
      way through – but that stops being a virtue if the computation
      in question is the one you want to be sure of <em>not</em>
      accidentally abandoning!</p>
    <p>So I think it generally makes sense to have the producer end of
      the system be an easily discardable coroutine, and the consumer
      end be ‘normal’ code. That way, if the producer encounters an
      exceptional condition and can’t carry on producing data (e.g. a
      file it was reading from ended abruptly, or contained invalid
      data), the consumer can catch the exception and ensure it does
      something sensible, like switching to a fallback strategy, or
      deleting its half-written output file, or at the very least
      producing a useful error message. You probably don’t want it to
      be silently discarded.</p>
    <h4 id="adapter">Separate input and output: adapters</h4>
    <p>Once you’ve connected a producer to a consumer, the next
      natural step is to have something in the middle be both at once,
      consuming values from one side and emitting them to the other
      side.</p>
    <p>The <code>record_breaking_values()</code> example I showed in
      Python earlier is already an example of one of those, depending
      on how you look at it. If you pass it a static thing like a
      list, then it’s just a producer coroutine, doing computation
      based on its original parameters; but if you pass it another
      generator as an argument, then it ‘yields’ to that generator by
      calling <code>next()</code> on it, and yields to its consumer by
      using the actual <code>yield</code> statement.</p>
    <p>There are lots of natural adapters of this kind that you might
      usefully write as coroutines. Again, it’s not <em>always</em>
      the right thing to write them that way, but it can very easily
      be.</p>
    <p>For example, here’s a tiny Python generator function that I put
      in a lot of my programs, because I often find I want to use it,
      and despite being so simple, it’s not in the standard
      library:</p>
<pre>def cyclic_pairs(inputs):
    it = iter(inputs)
    prev = first = next(it)
    for curr in it:
        yield prev, curr
        prev = curr
    yield prev, first</pre>
    <p>Given a list of inputs such
      as <i>a</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>d</i>,<i>e</i>, this returns
      each pair of adjacent list elements as a tuple, so that you get
      (<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>), (<i>b</i>,<i>c</i>), (<i>c</i>,<i>d</i>)
      and (<i>d</i>,<i>e</i>) as outputs<label for="footnoteinput-pairwise"><sup id="footnote-pairwise">4</sup><span>The
      non-cyclic version of this is also useful. As of Python 3.10
      that <em>is</em> in the standard library,
      as <code>itertools.pairwise</code>, although I’m going to have
      to keep writing it by hand until I can rely on Python 3.10 or
      better being widespread enough. But as far as I know the cyclic
      version still isn’t in <code>itertools</code>.</span><span>4</span></label>.
      Finally, it produces the pair that ‘wraps round the end’,
      consisting of the last element and the first, in this case
      (<i>e</i>,<i>a</i>).</p>
    <p>If you knew the input was in the form of an already-complete
      list, you could write this easily enough by iterating over the
      list indices, and returning <code>(list[i], list[(i+1) %
      len(list)])</code>. But if you write it in this form then it can
      take any iterable as input – including another generator, which
      perhaps doesn’t even know what all its output is going to be
      yet.</p>
    <p>What makes this a natural use case for generators? It’s the
      special cases at the start and the
      end<label for="footnoteinput-StopIteration"><sup id="footnote-StopIteration">5</sup><span>Incidentally, yes, I know,
      there’s another special case that my code doesn’t handle: if the
      input iterator has <em>no</em> values, then the example version
      of <code>cyclic_pairs</code> shown here will
      raise <code>StopIteration</code>, when perhaps you’d prefer it
      to silently generate an empty output list. Before Python 3.7
      this happened automatically, because <code>StopIteration</code>
      was handled differently; in many of my own use cases I never
      pass an empty list anyway. But if you were writing a version
      general enough to go in <code>itertools</code>, you’d probably
      want to check for that case properly.</span><span>5</span></label>. If every input
      value was treated exactly the same, then you could just as
      easily write this as a tiny class storing the <code>prev</code>
      variable, with a <code>__call__</code> method that constructed
      each tuple and updated <code>prev</code>. But in reality,
      the <em>first</em> element from the input iterator must be
      treated specially (in that we still put it
      into <code>prev</code> but don’t yield a tuple at all), and when
      we reach the end, we have an extra thing to do (namely yielding
      that final wraparound tuple). You <em>could</em> fake that up in
      your class, perhaps by special-casing <code>prev=None</code>
      (but what if the input iterator contained some
      legitimate <code>None</code> values itself?), or more likely by
      a system of flag variables in the class. But then you’re in
      ‘explicit state machine when you didn’t really want one’
      territory – so it’s easier just to write code like this, which
      says directly, in sequence, what things you want to do, in what
      order.</p>
    <p>Adapters like this fit nicely into the ‘Unix pipeline’ model,
      as I described a couple of sections earlier. So they’re still
      only a performance improvement, in space and maybe time, over
      doing things the pedestrian way with intermediate lists.</p>
    <h4 id="protocol">Input and output talking to the same entity:
      protocols</h4>
    <p>Now we come to the case where coroutines deliver more than a
      performance optimisation: where they do both input and output,
      but the output goes to the <em>same entity</em> that’s providing
      the input.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t exactly matter what that entity <em>is</em>: it
      might be another part of the same program, or it might be a
      human interacting with the program, or it might be another
      program at the far end of a network connection. But if the
      entity at the other end has to see your outputs so far before
      deciding what your next input is, and you have to do the same to
      generate <em>your</em> next output, then this type of
      coroutine <em>can’t</em> be rewritten as a function that just
      generates the whole output list up front.</p>
    <p>One of Knuth’s examples in <cite>TAOCP</cite> was a piece of
      code that implements a chess-playing algorithm. That’s exactly a
      case of this kind: each time you output a move, you have to wait
      to find out what my responding move is before you can even
      decide what moves you can <em>legally</em> play next, let alone
      which one is best. You can imagine a function like this talking
      to a human player through some user interface code – but you
      could also set two copies of it playing against each other,
      yielding control flow back and forth each time one of them made
      a move.</p>
    <p>(On the other hand, I don’t know that chess is a good case for
      coroutine style, because as far as I know, chess algorithms
      these days work by analysing whatever board position they’re
      given, and if they retain any state from the previous move it
      will only be in the form of cached evaluations of potential
      future game states. So a ‘next chess move’ function probably
      wouldn’t want to be a coroutine after all. But some games’ rules
      – or optimal strategies – <em>do</em> go through sequential
      phases that would suggest a coroutine-structured playing
      function.)</p>
    <p>But gaming is a frivolous use of this idea. A much more
      practical one is network protocols. The reason coroutines occur
      throughout PuTTY is because they’re so useful for implementing
      sequential network protocols, under the constraint that the top
      level of your program is an event loop waiting for whatever
      input event happens next out of network connections, user input,
      and sometimes timers.</p>
    <p>A good example is the key exchange layer of the SSH protocol.
      The two sides exchange setup packets that list all the different
      cryptographic algorithms they’re prepared to use; out of those
      options, they select the best one that both sides understand,
      and then exchange several packets to perform a key exchange
      according to that algorithm. Having done that, each side
      installs a new set of cryptographic keys, and then exchange
      encrypted packets implementing the actual interactive login
      session – until one side decides it’s time to refresh the
      cryptography, and sends another key-exchange setup packet.</p>
    <p>The sequence of packets within each key exchange method is
      different; only one of those sequences is used; and the whole
      thing takes place in a loop, restarting every time a new key
      exchange is needed. These are all markers of ‘looks like control
      flow’, and make it very natural to write the code in a style
      like this:</p>
<pre>function key_exchange() {
    send(KEXINIT); // key exchange initialisation packet
    wait for other side’s KEXINIT;
    outer loop {
        decide what key exchange type we’re doing;
        if (it’s this type) {
            send this;
            expect that;
            send some response;
        } else if (it’s some other type) {
            expect the other side to send a packet first;
            send a totally different response packet;
        } else {
            // potentially more and more cases like this
        }
        install new keys;
        inner loop {
            get next packet from server;
            if (it’s KEXINIT) {
                // time to do another key exchange
                send our own KEXINIT;
                break from inner loop; // so we return to top of outer loop
            } else {
                pass the packet on to the next layer up;
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>This function is structured as if it’s calling a subroutine to
      retrieve the next packet from the other side of the connection.
      But in reality, it’s going to <em>be</em> called each time a
      packet arrives – so we have to either make it a coroutine, or
      turn it inside out by setting up an explicit state machine. I
      think keeping the code in this nice sequential form
      is <em>far</em> preferable, so coroutines it is!</p>
    <p>In fact, this kind of pattern recurs throughout SSH. The
      ‘packets’ that are arriving in the code shown above are built up
      from the actual stream of bytes coming from the network by means
      of reading an initial few bytes giving the packet length, then
      reading that many more bytes to get the rest of the packet, then
      reading the authentication code at the end (if any); doing all
      the decryption and integrity checking, and finally, having a
      packet available to output. This code too wants to be written in
      a style where it calls a ‘wait for <i>n</i> more bytes of
      network data’ function – but, again, it’s <em>being</em> called
      from the main event loop when data comes in on the network
      socket. So that layer too is a coroutine, in the simpler
      ‘adapter’ style where the input and output are separate: it
      consumes bytes from the event loop, and periodically yields a
      completed packet to the key-exchange layer shown above.</p>
    <p>And the ‘next layer up’ – mentioned at the end of the above
      pseudocode – does all of this <em>again</em>. Initially, it’s
      the user-authentication layer of SSH, which might prompt for a
      password, or use a public key, or do something more complicated
      still; any of those might fail, in which case it has to loop
      back round and try the next fallback approach. So that’s very
      natural to write as a coroutine as well. The whole structure of
      SSH is almost <em>designed</em> to be three coroutines stacked
      on top of each other!</p>
    <p>(Once you’ve actually logged in, things get a bit less
      coroutiney. The ‘connection layer’ that takes care of running
      shell sessions is much less sequential. In PuTTY, it’s still
      structured as a coroutine, but <em>mostly</em> that coroutine
      sits in an endless while loop just responding to each packet as
      it comes in. That would normally be the kind of boring stateless
      code that it’s not really worth making into a coroutine at all –
      except that right at the start we have to do a few setup tasks
      like opening an initial session channel, so the coroutine
      consists of a small amount of sequential setup code
      and <em>then</em> the boring while loop.)</p>
    <p>This isn’t an article about SSH alone, of course. That’s just a
      particularly good example. Many other network protocols are just
      as sequential. For example, PuTTY’s code to connect via an HTTP
      proxy is also structured as a coroutine.</p>
    <p>In fact, that code has an extra wrinkle too. Sometimes, when
      authentication fails in HTTP, you can try again within the same
      network connection; but sometimes you have to close the
      connection to the HTTP server and open a fresh one. So there’s
      not just a sequence of operations <em>within</em> a network
      connection: there’s also a sequence of <em>connections</em>
      involved. In PuTTY, this is all handled with a single HTTP proxy
      coroutine: sometimes it yields a special return value to its
      caller saying ‘please close the connection, open a fresh one,
      and call me back when that one’s ready’. Then it can go back
      round to the top of its loop and continue trying to
      authenticate.</p>
    <h4 id="uc-general">More general, and miscellaneous</h4>
    <p>In all of the previous subsections, I’ve shown coroutines with
      at most one input channel and at most one output. Of course, you
      can also have more than one of each.</p>
    <p>There are two conceptually different ways that a coroutine
      might consume two input streams. One is that it yields to
      a <em>specific</em> input stream each time it wants a new value,
      so that it’s in control of how fast the two input streams
      deliver data. There are lots of examples of this in purely
      computational contexts: consider, for example, a function that
      merges two sorted lists, or zips together two or more streams by
      making a tuple of one element from each stream, or other things
      of the kind you might find in Python <code>itertools</code>.</p>
    <p>The other approach, more suited to coroutines that are doing
      asynchronous I/O, is that the coroutine might yield in such a
      way that it will be resumed when <em>any</em> of the input
      streams has data available – no matter which one it is. For
      example, some of PuTTY’s SSH coroutines have to handle both
      network data and user input: the user authentication coroutine
      will sometime respond to a network packet by presenting a
      password prompt to the user, and then it has to receive the
      password that the user typed in return and construct the network
      reply packet. But there’s no guarantee of which is going to
      happen next, out of a network packet arriving and the user
      pressing a key. So the coroutine is resumed
      whenever <em>either</em> one happens.</p>
    <p>That style of coroutine is tricky to write well, and I have
      some advice about it in later sections. Here, I just mention
      that it’s among the possibilities.</p>
    <p>Another slightly unexpected ‘stunt’ use of coroutines is to use
      them to reconstruct the call-stack structure of ordinary
      subroutines: replace every normal function call with a
      coroutine-style yield operation which makes a newly constructed
      instance of the subroutine start running next, and whenever a
      coroutine terminates, resume the one that invoked it.</p>
    <p>Why on earth is <em>that</em> a useful thing to do, you might
      ask? If we want something that behaves like an ordinary function
      call stack, doesn’t the typical programming language have one
      built in already?</p>
    <p>I’ve found that useful in the past as a means of working around
      limitations of the true function call stack. In Python, for
      example, you can only nest function calls about 1000 deep, and
      I’ve sometimes needed to recurse much more deeply than that –
      e.g. running graph algorithms over a DAG with very long chains,
      such as a git repository. It’s surprisingly convenient to
      rewrite function calls and returns in a style like this…</p>
    <div>
      <div>
<pre># Before
def routine(x):
    i = subroutine(x+1)
    j = subroutine(x*i)
    return i+j</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
<pre># After
def routine(x):
    i = yield Call(subroutine(x+1))
    j = yield Call(subroutine(x*i))
    yield Return(i+j)</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>… and then have a small piece of ‘executor’ code which
      maintains a stack of currently active generators in an array,
      and contains a loop which always resumes the innermost generator
      on the stack. If that yields a <code>Call</code> object
      containing another generator, push that one on the stack, so
      that it will be the one resumed next; if it yields
      a <code>Return</code> containing a return value, pop the stack,
      and pass the value to the new topmost generator when it’s
      resumed.</p>
    <p>When I’ve done this in the past, my reason has always been to
      get round Python’s recursion depth limit. But I can think of
      other reasons for reifying your stack into explicit data
      objects.</p>
    <p>One reason is so that those objects can be saved and restored.
      Given the right language support, you might be able to tweak a
      system like this to allow the entire state of a half-finished
      recursive computation to be written out to a disk file; then the
      program could be terminated, and when run again later, reload
      the file and carry on from where it left off. (Although you
      would also need a method of saving the <em>internal</em> state
      of each coroutine, which might be harder.)</p>
    <p>Another is that once you replace the language’s built-in
      control flow with your own imitation, it becomes easy to extend
      or modify it. You could imagine adding a third kind of data
      object alongside <code>Call</code> and <code>Return</code> which
      had a different effect on the executor. For example, you might
      have two or more call stacks and switch between them,
      implementing ‘co-threads’ (which I’ll talk about more
      in <a href="#cothreads">a later section</a>).</p>
    <p>In fact, perhaps you might decide that keeping the active
      function calls in an array was itself a limitation you wanted to
      go beyond. Not all languages insist on a linear stack in that
      way. Scheme, for example, has multiple control-flow features
      (continuations and <code>dynamic-wind</code>) with the effect
      that the stack is replaced by a general DAG of function
      activations, and several branches of the DAG can be resumable.
      (This also means that the stack frames must be subject to
      garbage collection.) A technique like this could be used to
      implement continuations in languages that don’t have them
      natively!</p>
    <p>Speaking of messing about with control flow, another stunt use
      of coroutines – in the right context – is to invent your own
      control flow <em>statements</em>, alongside standard things like
      ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘if’.</p>
    <p>Some languages encourage you to invent control flow primitives
      of your own, by means of making it easy to pass blocks of code
      to a function call:</p>
<pre>function my_control_structure(code) {
    set up stuff;
    while (some condition)
        code.run();
    clean up stuff;
}

# now the braced block becomes the ‘code’ parameter to the above function
my_control_structure {
    statements;
}</pre>
    <p>The <em>wrong</em> way to implement this language feature is to
      literally wrap up the code block at the call site into a lambda
      function, and have the control-structure function execute the
      block using a normal function call. The problem with this is
      that then the code blocks don’t really run in the context of the
      containing function. They might be able to access the function’s
      local variables, by virtue of lexically scoped lambda capture,
      but the control flow is isolated. If one of those blocks
      executes a ‘return’ statement, then it only returns from
      the <em>block</em>, not the containing function (as it would if
      you executed the same return inside, say, a while loop). And if
      you want to ‘break’ from a loop implemented by these means, then
      executing the ‘break’ statement inside the lambda doesn’t work
      at all. This all makes your artificial control structure look
      ‘second class’ compared to the language’s built-in ones.</p>
    <p>Instead of doing that, the <em>right</em> way – and some
      languages actually do this, such as Ruby – is for the
      control-structure function to be a coroutine. Instead of its
      code blocks being ordinary functions that it calls in the
      ordinary way, they should remain in the context of the original
      function, and the control structure should <em>yield</em> back
      to the original function, telling it which block to run next.
      Then custom control structures would be just as good as the
      standard ones, and wouldn’t behave surprisingly differently in
      edge cases<label for="footnoteinput-if-for-while"><sup id="footnote-if-for-while">6</sup><span>In my fantasy programming
      language, this would <em>actually</em> be how the standard
      control structures were implemented. The only primitives in the
      language itself would be ‘goto’ and coroutines. <em>All</em>
      block-structured control flow commands, even the standard things
      like ‘if’, ‘for’ and ‘while’, would be defined in the standard
      prelude as small coroutines of this kind, implemented in terms
      of ‘goto’. Then they wouldn’t need to be
      keywords!</span><span>6</span></label>.</p>
    <p>Of course, if you’re not using a language that already works
      this way, then finding a way to implement it can be tricky or
      impossible. But once I just about found a way to do it in C,
      combining
      my <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">preprocessor
      coroutine system</a>
      with <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/mp/">another
      preprocessor trick</a> for making custom control structures at
      all. In C++ you might do it more easily by having the macro at
      the call site expand to a range-<code>for</code> loop. It will
      depend on the language.</p>

    <h3 id="large-and-small">Coroutines large and small</h3>
    <p>That ‘control flow nature’ that makes a piece of code a natural
      fit for coroutines can occur at all scales, from the largest to
      the smallest.</p>
    <p>Among the examples in previous sections, I’ve already shown
      examples at both ends of that spectrum. Some of the largest and
      most complicated parts of PuTTY’s SSH code, such as the key
      exchange or the user authentication protocol layers, are
      implemented as a giant coroutine. On the other hand, that
      tiny <code>cyclic_pairs</code> Python generator is not far off
      being the smallest possible piece of coroutine-shaped code
      that’s worth bothering to write.</p>
    <p>It’s also worth considering various ways to slice up, or break
      down, the problem. In SSH the multiple protocol layers lend
      themselves nicely to being a coroutine <em>each</em>; they’d be
      much more unwieldy implemented as one single one. On the other
      hand, for some network protocols, a single coroutine might be
      suitable for running the entire network connection.</p>
    <p>And in some other situations, you might have a variable number
      of coroutines, with each one tracking the progress of a single
      transaction <em>within</em> a network protocol. I have an
      example of that too in the PuTTY code: the SSH agent, Pageant,
      is mostly a non-coroutine loop that answers queries in whatever
      order they arrive – but whenever a client of the agent requests
      a signature from one of Pageant’s private keys, it spawns a
      small coroutine to handle the progress of <em>that specific
      signing request</em>, because sometimes it will need to prompt
      the user for a passphrase, loop round again if that didn’t work,
      be prepared to abandon the attempt if the user clicks Cancel,
      etc. This is all control-flow-shaped code – but it suited the
      problem best to have a coroutine for <em>each</em> signature
      request, not one for the whole connection.</p>
    <p>So, when you’re on the lookout for coroutine-shaped parts of a
      program, don’t forget to look for the large ones, the small
      ones, and everything in between!</p>

    <h4 id="activation-energy">Activation energy</h4>
    <p>Of course, depending on the language, that might not be good
      advice after all.</p>
    <p>In Python, writing a generator is made extremely easy. It’s no
      harder than an ordinary function; you just
      write <code>yield</code> at least once in the body, and
      everything is taken care of for you. So there’s no reason
      I <em>shouldn’t</em> write things like
      that <code>cyclic_pairs()</code> function as a generator, if
      it’s only a tiny bit clearer. There’s essentially no cost. The
      next five lines of my code would look a bit nicer as a
      generator? Fine, dash off a generator, why not?</p>
    <p>But if you were writing in C++20, there’s a much higher barrier
      to entry. C++20 coroutines
      are <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/">very
      expensive</a> to set up – not so much in runtime cost (though
      I’m sure there is <em>some</em>), but in programming effort. You
      have to write a whole ‘promise class’ with lots of methods
      explaining how the coroutine should behave in this or that
      circumstance. If the only actual coroutine you wanted to write
      was going to save you (say) five lines of code, then writing
      a whole C++20 promise class from scratch wouldn’t be a net win,
      because it would cost you a hundred or so lines to set up the
      necessary infrastructure. You have to <em>really want</em>
      coroutines to bother setting them up in a C++20 program.</p>
    <p>However, C++20 does let you reuse the promise class for
      multiple coroutines that want to work in similar ways. So if you
      had <em>twenty</em> five-line snippets you wanted to write that
      way, it might become worth it. But if you’d already written the
      first 19 in ordinary non-coroutine style, then when you got to
      the break-even point, it might <em>still</em> not seem worth
      your while to go to the effort of writing the promise
      class <em>and</em> converting all the existing cases to use
      it…</p>
    <p>(Also, this is only a temporary complaint about C++. C++23 will
      bring <code>std::generator</code>, which should make this kind
      of simple job <em>actually</em> simple again.)</p>

    <h3 id="queues">Combine with input queues</h3>
    <p>In <cite>TAOCP</cite>’s presentation of coroutines, and many
      others, the whole point is that you yield to the other piece of
      code precisely when you have data to transfer. If a producer is
      constructing a stream of objects and sending them to a consumer,
      then you write the producer as if it has a function it can call
      for ‘here, I have this object for you’, and you write the
      consumer as if it has a function for ‘ok, what’s my next
      object?’, and there’s exactly one pair of transfers of control
      for each object that traverses the boundary.</p>
    <p>But sometimes that’s not the best way to do it. When it’s not,
      don’t do it that way!</p>
    <p>One case where it’s awkward is the <a href="#uc-general">case I
      mentioned previously</a> of having a coroutine that can receive
      more than one type of input, and doesn’t know which one will
      come next. For example, PuTTY’s SSH authentication layer used to
      implement password / passphrase prompts itself, so it received a
      stream of events in which SSH packets and user keystrokes were
      interleaved, and any call to the main userauth coroutine might
      be providing <em>either</em> of those kinds of event.</p>
    <p>But if you’re writing code in a coroutine-structured style,
      then in a lot of cases, you know which input type <em>you</em>
      want to see next – and it’s very annoying to have to put a
      handler for the other one after each yield. For example, if
      you’re <em>not</em> in the middle of presenting a password
      prompt to the user, what do you do with a keystroke when you
      receive one? Conversely, if you’re waiting for the user to
      finish typing a password, and another network packet comes in,
      what do you do?</p>
    <p>In those early versions of PuTTY, I mostly ignored the problem.
      While the userauth coroutine was waiting for network packets, if
      it was called with a keystroke, it would simply discard it –
      drop it on the floor.</p>
    <p>An effect of that was that you couldn’t open a PuTTY window and
      immediately start typing the first shell command you wanted to
      run in your session, <em>even</em> if you knew that
      authentication was going to succeed without needing any prompts
      (say, because you were using an SSH agent). You’d expect to be
      able to ‘type ahead’, and have your keystrokes buffered until
      the main shell session was ready to use them. Instead, for as
      long as authentication hadn’t finished yet, they’d just be
      thrown away.</p>
    <p>After a while, that became annoying. I wanted keystrokes
      to <em>never</em> be dropped. But I also wanted to write my
      userauth coroutine in the most convenient way. What to do?</p>
    <p>Instead of passing SSH packets or keystrokes directly to the
      userauth coroutine, I made two <em>queues</em> in the SSH layer,
      to hold SSH packets and user input respectively. So when the
      lower layer had a packet to deliver to the userauth layer, it
      wouldn’t pass the packet directly to the userauth function;
      instead, it would put the packet on the userauth layer’s
      incoming packet queue, and then call the userauth function with
      no arguments, just saying ‘hello, it’s worth waking up and
      checking your queues’. And the same went for user input.</p>
    <p>This solved my problem. Now, when userauth knows the next thing
      it’s expecting is an SSH packet, it can run a little resume loop
      that says ‘Is there a packet waiting in my queue? If not,
      suspend, and look again when we’re resumed.’ If user input
      arrives in the meantime, it goes on the <em>other</em> queue,
      and will still be there when the userauth layer gets to a
      different place in the code where it needs some user input – or
      perhaps it won’t be consumed by userauth at all, and will be
      picked up by the connection layer (the one that runs shell
      sessions after you log in), so that you <em>can</em> type ahead
      into the shell prompt you expect to see later.</p>
    <p>In particular, sometimes the userauth layer wouldn’t need to
      suspend itself at all. It would look at its queue and discover
      there was <em>already</em> something there, and charge straight
      on without ever having to yield.</p>
    <p>(In C, using preprocessor coroutines, this little loop was the
      easiest way to wait for a particular one of the possible input
      events. If I were rewriting this code using the C++20 coroutine
      system, I could formalise it, by defining a
      specific <code>co_await</code> idiom for ‘now I want to wait
      until there’s something in this queue’. That could be set up so
      that it would avoid resuming the coroutine <em>at all</em> until
      that queue stopped being empty – and it could also automate the
      initial check of ‘maybe we don’t even need to suspend at all
      because we already have a packet waiting’.)</p>
    <p>Another case where queues are useful is if the data objects are
      very small and numerous. For example, if you wanted to write a
      coroutine that received a stream of <em>bytes</em> from another
      part of the program – say, because the producer was a file
      decompressor, or the consumer was a file compressor – then it
      would be bad for performance to require two coroutine-transfer
      overheads per individual byte. Instead, the producer would
      prefer to provide as many bytes in one go as it conveniently can
      (especially since it might have read lots of them in a block
      from a file, or a decompressor might have generated a lot at a
      time from a run-length record or an LZ77 copy). But then the
      consumer might not need exactly that many for <em>its</em> next
      operation. So it would make sense to append bytes to a queue
      (probably in the form of a circular buffer, or chain of small
      buffers, or something else space-efficient per element). The
      producer could generate as much data as was convenient (or would
      fit in the buffer), and then yield at the point when producing
      the next byte would need actual effort; then the consumer could
      eat as much of the queue as possible, and yield back when it
      wanted more bytes than were available.</p>
    <p>But, just like I’ve been saying about everything else in this
      article, don’t take it to extremes. Using an input queue or
      buffer isn’t <em>always</em> the right thing. One of the effects
      of representing a stream of data as a coroutine is that the
      stream is lazily evaluated: no element is computed until it’s
      really needed. So if some or all of the data values
      are <em>expensive</em> to compute, then either don’t use an
      intermediate queue at all, or else make sure you never put more
      than one thing in the queue <em>unless they’re easy</em>.</p>
    <p>(<code>spigot</code> is a good example of this problem. The
      coroutines in that are mostly generators that yield streams of
      integer matrices. For some generators, the matrices are uniform
      and simple; for others, an occasional matrix
      is <em>exceptionally</em> costly to compute. So in that
      application, queues didn’t seem worth the effort; yielding
      exactly once per matrix is the simplest way to be absolutely
      sure that we never even start trying to compute a matrix until
      its consumer knows it’s needed.)</p>

    <h3 id="handlers">Combine with ambient pre-filters</h3>
    <p>Here’s one more trick on the theme of ‘only use coroutines for
      the coroutine-shaped parts’.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, a stream of data contains things that have to be
      handled sequentially, <em>interleaved</em> with things that
      should be handled the same at any time.</p>
    <p>An example of this is the key-exchange ‘transport layer’ of
      SSH. This includes all the packet types I
      mentioned <a href="#adapter">earlier</a>
      (the <code>KEXINIT</code> start packet, various sequences of
      packets to perform different key exchanges, and
      a <code>NEWKEYS</code> message to signal that you’re about to
      switch to the newly generated encryption keys); but
      it <em>also</em> includes a small number of messages that can
      arrive at any time and must be handled correctly when they do.</p>
    <p>The handling isn’t always <em>difficult</em>. One key example
      is the <code>IGNORE</code> message, which either side may send
      at any time, and the other side – as suggested by the name –
      must ignore it. That’s the single easiest possible way to handle
      a packet.</p>
    <p>But now suppose you’ve written your transport layer in the form
      of a coroutine. There will be lots of separate points in the
      code where you yield, wait for the next packet, and expect it to
      be of a particular type (typically, whatever comes next in the
      key exchange you’re performing). Now <em>every one</em> of those
      yield points has to have an extra check for
      the <code>IGNORE</code> message, which loops round to get the
      packet after it:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
<pre>// What you’d like to write
function transport_layer() {
    // ...
    pktin = co_await PacketInputQueue;
    if (pktin.type != FOO)
        disconnect("got packet type %s, wanted FOO");
    // ...
}</pre>
      </div>

    <p>If you’ve got even ten or twenty yield points in your
      coroutine, this is a lot of tedious boilerplate code – and
      worse, a lot of places to accidentally leave out that extra
      clause, and introduce a latent bug that will only show up when a
      server actually <em>does</em> happen to send <code>IGNORE</code>
      in that particular context. And it only gets worse when you have
      to support the rest of SSH’s any-time message types. Ignoring
      that <code>IGNORE</code> message <em>isn’t</em> the easiest
      thing in the world, it turns out!</p>
    <p>So don’t do it that way.</p>
    <p>Instead, a structure I’ve found useful is to have a
      ‘pre-filter’ on the queue, which isn’t part of the coroutine at
      all. Whenever new packets arrive on the queue, they’re seen
      first by the pre-filtering code. That will handle things that
      can arrive at any time, like <code>IGNORE</code> and its
      friends. The only remaining packets are the ones
      that <em>are</em> expected to appear in a sensible sequence
      that’s natural to write as a coroutine. And <em>those</em> are
      passed to the main transport-layer coroutine, which can handle
      them in the natural way, without having to do anything at a
      yield point that isn’t related to what that <em>particular</em>
      yield point is trying to achieve.</p>
    <p>So this lets the coroutine handle only the coroutine-shaped
      parts of the protocol: the things that happen in sequences, or
      conditionally, or in loops, and look like control flow.
      Meanwhile, the awkward things that can interrupt your nice
      orderly control flow are simply removed from the coroutine’s
      view of the input and handled by a central dispatch function.
      Then each style of code can do what it does best; or, looking at
      it the other way round, each part of the problem can be solved
      in the way that’s most natural for that part.</p>
    <p>(<em>How</em> do you wedge this pre-filter system into a world
      organised by coroutines? PuTTY uses C preprocessor coroutines,
      in which there’s a convenient slot within the coroutine function
      itself – just before the <code>crBegin</code> macro – where you
      can put code that will run on every single resume, before
      control is transferred to wherever the function last suspended.
      For languages which implement coroutines natively, that slot
      probably doesn’t exist, so you’ll have to do it the more
      pedestrian way of hiding the coroutine resume operation behind a
      separate wrapper function, and having that wrapper do any
      pre-filtering necessary before resuming the actual coroutine.)</p>
    <p>The SSH packets I’ve been talking about here are fixed. They
      can be sent at any time at all in the protocol, and
      they <em>never</em> want to be handled by the coroutine code.
      But in other situations, there are message types which
      you <em>sometimes</em> want to handle in the sequential
      coroutine code, even though at other times you’d rather they
      were handled by the pre-filter so that the sequential code can
      concentrate on something else.</p>
    <p>In this situation, you can still keep the sequential code in
      the coroutine and the any-time handlers in the nicely separate
      filter function, by means of the coroutine setting variables
      that affect how much the filter function filters. Then the
      coroutine can dynamically control what subset of the inputs it
      sees, and always focus its attention on the ones that behave
      sequentially.</p>
    <p>Those variables can be as simple or as complicated as you like.
      It might be as simple as having a single boolean flag saying
      whether the coroutine would currently like to see whatever kind
      of thing is only sometimes interesting to it. Or you might need
      some kind of set variable saying which types of thing you
      currently care about. Or maybe the filter might need to be a
      complicated lambda function, who knows. It will depend on how
      much control you need to have over the filter.</p>
    <p>One idea along these lines that I haven’t yet had the
      opportunity to try is to have a <em>lexically scoped</em>
      handler, installed for the duration of a particular block of
      code, and uninstalled again automatically by an object’s
      destructor. It might look something like this (details
      completely made up):</p>
<pre>function event_stream_consuming_coroutine() {
    // Here, we can receive any event type
    event = co_await EventQueue;

    {
        // Install a handler for a particular event we don’t want
        // to be bothered with in the next loop
        HandlerInstaller hi(EventQueue, EVENT_BORING, lambda(event) {
            fixed code to handle this event;
        });

        // Now do some kind of a loop over the remaining event
        // types, which can assume EVENT_BORING never appears.
        while (some condition) {
            // imagine lots of subsidiary control flow here
            event = co_await EventQueue;
        }

        // At the end of this block, the HandlerInstaller object
        // goes out of scope, and its handler is uninstalled
    }

    // And here we’re back to being able to receive any event,
    // even EVENT_BORING
    event = co_await EventQueue;
}</pre>
    <p>The idea is that the <code>HandlerInstaller</code> class has a
      constructor which arranges to add the specified event type to
      the pre-filtering system sitting in front of this coroutine. In
      this example, I’ve also shown it taking a lambda function as an
      argument, so that we can say <em>what</em> to do with one of
      those <code>EVENT_BORING</code> events if it happens within
      this block.</p>
    <p>Then, when the <code>HandlerInstaller</code> goes out of scope
      at the end of the block, its destructor runs, and uninstalls the
      handler again. So after the block
      ends, <code>EVENT_BORING</code> is no longer being filtered
      out of the coroutine’s input, and the
      final <code>co_await</code> could receive one.</p>
    <p>I haven’t had a chance to experiment with this style yet,
      because you can’t do it with preprocessor coroutines. (Not even
      in C++, where you do have destructors. Preprocessor coroutines
      in C++ require all the coroutine’s persistent variables to be
      members of its containing class, so they can’t be scoped to
      sub-blocks of a function.) But you could do it in C++20’s native
      coroutines, where you get to declare block-local variables in a
      natural way. So when I write my first real system based on C++20
      coroutines, I might give it a try!</p>

    <h2 id="features">Coroutine paradigms</h2>
    <p>Finally, in this last section, I’ll talk about some different
      ways to <em>think</em> about coroutines, in the sense of what
      kind of thing they even are.</p>
    <p>I’ve mentioned a couple of things of that kind in passing, in
      previous sections: I said that coroutines can be seen as the
      in-process analogue of a Unix pipe, or as the
      imperative-programming analogue of lazy evaluation (particularly
      something like Haskell’s lazy lists). But those were more about
      the kind of <em>tasks</em> you can use them for; the next few
      sections will be more about what they <em>are</em> than what you
      can use them as.</p>

    <h3 id="taocp"><cite>TAOCP</cite>’s coroutines: symmetric, utterly stackless</h3>
    <p>Knuth’s presentation of coroutines in <cite>The Art of Computer
      Programming</cite> calls them a ‘generalisation’ of subroutines.
      That characterisation doesn’t make sense in all contexts, but in
      that particular context, it does.</p>
    <p>In <cite>TAOCP</cite>, all the example programs are written in
      machine code for the fictitious MIX architecture. MIX is strange
      by modern standards – entire generations of CPU architecture
      fashion have come and gone <em>between</em> MIX and the
      more-or-less RISC architectures of today.</p>
    <p>In particular, MIX has no real commitment to the existence of
      a <em>stack</em>. Typical CPU architectures of today consider a
      stack to be a fundamental necessity: there’s a special register
      reserved for use as the stack pointer, which it’s either
      impossible to use for any other purpose, or at least highly
      inadvisable. Too much of the design is based on the assumption
      that <em>of course</em> you’ll want a stack.</p>
    <p>But in MIX, nobody is making you use a stack. And Knuth, in
      many cases, doesn’t. His example MIX programs are generally set
      up so that each function has just one copy of its variables,
      stored at fixed addresses – and when one function calls another,
      the return address is just another of those variables.</p>
    <p>This way of organising code works fine for every purpose except
      recursion (and multithreading): if a function’s variables always
      live at the same address, it follows that you can’t have two
      independent instances of the function active at once. So a
      function may never call itself, either directly or through any
      other chain of intermediate functions. Or rather: if
      you <em>do</em> need a particular function to have multiple
      concurrent activations, you’ll have to make a special effort to
      enable it to do so – for example, by manually implementing a
      stack inside that function.</p>
    <p>(It’s surprising to the modern eye how little
      emphasis <cite>TAOCP</cite> puts on recursion, in fact! Current
      treatments of programming tend to consider it to be one of the
      most fundamental and important techniques, to be taught early
      and used often. By contrast, Knuth clearly <em>knows</em> about
      it, but is able to get a startling amount done without having to
      resort to it.)</p>
    <p>Anyway. The relevance of all this to coroutines is:</p>
    <p>The MIX subroutine call instruction works like most RISC call
      instructions: rather than pushing the return address on to a
      stack in memory, it simply writes it into a particular register
      called rJ, and then it’s up to the callee to decide what to do
      with it. So a normal MIX function call works by the caller doing
      one of these jumps, and then the callee saves the rJ register in
      one of its own memory
      locations<label for="footnoteinput-self-modifying-code"><sup id="footnote-self-modifying-code">7</sup><span>In fact, Knuth does
      this by self-modifying code. The memory location where you save
      the return address is actually the destination-address field
      <em>within the jump instruction</em> that performs the
      return!</span><span>7</span></label>, so that it can remember where to jump back
      to at the end of its task.</p>
    <p>The MIX call instruction is also its normal jump instruction.
      (rJ isn’t used for anything else, so that’s generally safe.) So
      the callee uses the same instruction when it returns, to
      transfer back to the caller. The only difference is that the
      caller jumps to the <em>start</em> of the callee, whereas the
      callee saves the rJ register on entry and jumps to wherever it
      said. On return, the caller <em>also</em> receives a value in
      rJ, because that jump instruction updated it too – but it
      ignores it, because it doesn’t care which particular place in
      the callee control came back from.</p>
    <p>And that’s the sense in which coroutines ‘generalise’
      subroutines. With subroutines, each side receives a value in rJ,
      but only one of them bothers to remember it. With coroutines
      written in MIX in this style, the only difference is
      that <em>both</em> sides remember the value they receive in rJ,
      and <em>both</em> sides use it as the place to transfer control
      to next.</p>
    <p>So, unlike most languages’ built-in coroutines (and certainly
      unlike my C preprocessor approach), this setup is completely
      symmetric. There is no sense in which one of the two functions
      ‘really is’ the caller, and the other one is just ‘pretending to
      be’ the caller using a special kind of yield statement. Each one
      is doing exactly the same thing as the other. They
      are <em>co</em>-routines, in the sense of “equal partners”.</p>

    <h3 id="resumable-callee">A subroutine that can resume from where it last left off</h3>
    <p>Of course, in modern CPU architectures, there <em>is</em> a
      stack. And in almost all high-level languages (by which, in this
      case, I mean ‘any higher than assembly’ – even COBOL counts),
      there will be a function call and return system that assumes a
      stack, and each function will store its local variables on the
      stack. So if we want to have functions interoperating in a coroutine
      style, and each of those functions occupies a region of memory
      on the call stack, then one function is going to <em>have</em>
      to be higher up the stack than the other.</p>
    <p>This introduces an ugly asymmetry into the perfectly symmetric
      system Knuth described. We have to make an arbitrary decision
      about which way up to order the two functions on the stack, and
      whichever way round we make the decision, you might reasonably
      ask “Why wouldn’t it be just as good to do it the other way?”</p>
    <p>But it has to be done, so we make a choice, and designate one
      of our formerly equal coroutines as the ‘caller’ and one as the
      ‘callee’. What are the consequences?</p>
    <p>An invariant of the conventional stack-based function call
      system is that the currently executing function must be the
      deepest one on the stack. You just aren’t allowed to have extra
      stuff occupying stack space
      below<label for="footnoteinput-stack-grows-downwards"><sup id="footnote-stack-grows-downwards">8</sup><span>For the sake of not
      using too many words, I’ll assume the most common convention for
      stack layout, which is that the stack grows downwards in memory:
      pushes make SP smaller, pops make it bigger, and when you call a
      subroutine, its stack frame is below yours. If you’re used to
      one of the rare architectures that does things the other way up,
      just turn your head upside down while reading this
      section.</span><span>8</span></label> the frame of the current function. (One
      reason is that asynchronous things like signal handlers or
      interrupts might overwrite that space without warning.)</p>
    <p>So, when the caller is executing, <em>the callee can’t have a
      stack frame at all</em>. There would be nowhere for it to live.</p>
    <p>Therefore, when the caller transfers control to the callee, the
      callee has to <em>construct</em> a stack frame. And when control
      transfers back the other way, that stack frame has to be thrown
      away again. So the physical view of what’s happening on the
      stack looks exactly like the caller making multiple independent
      calls to some subroutine: each time, a new stack frame is
      created, lives briefly, and is destroyed again.</p>
    <p>The only differences between this and an ordinary subroutine is
      that the callee coroutine has to preserve all its variables
      between calls – which means they have to be stored
      somewhere <em>other</em> than on the stack – and that every time
      it’s ‘called’, it has to resume from just after wherever it last
      returned from.</p>
    <p>This is the compromise that most languages’ coroutine systems
      end up settling on. My C preprocessor coroutine system is
      exactly this: a coroutine-structured function contains a macro
      at the start that can arrange to transfer control to any of the
      yield points in the function, and at each of those yield points,
      a variable is updated to mark that point as the one to resume
      from next time, and then the yield macro executes the ordinary
      C <code>return</code> statement. So the function’s physical
      stack frame is destroyed (which is OK because all the important
      state is kept in a <code>struct</code> elsewhere), and on the
      next call, a fresh stack frame is created.</p>
    <p>The same is true of C++20 coroutines; it’s better hidden, but
      the low-level code generation will be doing basically this if
      you look deep enough. I expect the same is true of other
      languages that compile to ordinary stack-based native code.</p>
    <p>This ‘resumable subroutine’ architecture has consequences
      beyond the details of the low-level implementation. Here are
      two:</p>
    <p>Firstly, what happens if you want to divide up the work of the
      callee coroutine into subroutines? (For example, in Python, a
      generator can <code>yield from</code> another generator, so that
      the second one runs to completion and delivers all its results
      to the same place as the first generator.) The most obvious way
      to implement a ‘sub-coroutine’ is to have the parent coroutine
      call it repeatedly in a loop, passing its results back one by
      one:</p>
<pre>function parent_coroutine() {
    yield START;

    // Make an instance of a sub-coroutine
    coroutine_instance sub = sub_coroutine();
    // And run it to completion, passing on all its yields
    while (sub is not finished)
        yield sub.next_yielded_thing();

    yield END;
}</pre>
    <p>Now if even the <em>parent</em> coroutine is having its stack
      frame demolished completely on every yield, then the same thing
      must be happening to the sub-coroutine. So if we nest
      sub-coroutine ‘calls’ <i>n</i> layers deep, then every time the
      innermost one yields and resumes, the implementation will have
      to tear down <i>n</i> stack frames and set them all up
      again. <em>The resumable-subroutine model makes deeply nested
      sub-coroutines expensive in performance.</em></p>
    <p>There might be a way to get round this, one way or another. For
      example, in C++20 coroutines, you
      can <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/coroutines-c++20/#stacked-generators">set
      up a promise class</a> in such a way that the logical ‘stack’ of
      sub-coroutines never occupies the physical stack all at once:
      instead, at each stage, a physical stack frame is only needed
      for the <em>currently executing</em> coroutine in the logical
      stack. But it’s not necessarily the <em>default</em> way that
      things will work, so it’s something you have to keep in mind and
      watch out for: if there’s a special way to avoid this stack
      usage problem, remember to do it if your nesting gets too deep,
      and if there isn’t one, don’t <em>let</em> your nesting get too
      deep.</p>
    <p>Secondly, if your language supports exceptions, what happens if
      a coroutine throws one?</p>
    <p>Exceptions propagate up the physical stack. So if the callee
      coroutine throws an exception, it can propagate out into the
      caller. (For example, an exception in a Python generator
      propagates out into the function that called <code>next()</code>
      on it.) But if the caller throws an exception, it can’t
      propagate in the reverse direction.</p>
    <p>It may be possible to configure this to some extent. C++20
      coroutine systems let you explicitly control what happens to an
      exception thrown in the coroutine. But you still can’t propagate
      an exception from ‘normal’ code <em>into</em> a coroutine by any
      sensible method.</p>
    <p>So, if you care about exceptions, perhaps that might drive your
      choice of which of those two ‘equal’ coroutines to turn into the
      caller, and which the callee: in which direction (if any) would
      you like exceptions to travel between the two? Whichever
      direction that is, it might be easiest to make that ‘up the
      stack’.</p>
    <p>(And if, in some extra-confusing scenario, you want exceptions
      to be able to travel in <em>both</em> directions – maybe based
      on the type of the exception – then you <em>really</em> have a
      challenge on your hands. Good luck, and have fun.)</p>

    <h3 id="cothreads">Cooperative threads that identify which thread to transfer to next</h3>
    <p>I performed a minor sleight of hand in the previous section.
      Did you spot it?</p>
    <p>I said: if we want two functions to interoperate in coroutine
      style, and each one occupies a region of the stack, then one
      function has to be higher up the stack than the other.</p>
    <p>But hang on. “The” stack? <em>Who said there was only
      one?</em></p>
    <p>This is the 2020s, and we’ve met multithreading by now. So
      we’re already used to the idea that a complicated program might
      contain <em>multiple</em> stacks, in widely separated regions of
      memory. We could put our two interoperating coroutines
      on <em>separate</em> stacks.</p>
    <p>This immediately solves the problem of sub-coroutines. Now each
      coroutine is free to be reorganised into as many subroutines as
      it likes, without impacting performance by having to forward
      values up and down a long chain, or having to constantly destroy
      and rebuild physical stack frames. Either stack can yield to the
      other, no matter how deep it’s currently nested; when it does,
      execution resumes in the other stack from wherever it left off,
      by restoring the <em>stack pointer</em> as well as the location
      within the current function.</p>
    <p>Working in this style, it becomes natural for sub-coroutines to
      have a ‘return value’, separate from whatever data they yielded.
      (For example, C++20 has <code>co_return</code>, separate
      from <code>co_yield</code>.) Just as an ordinary function
      performing I/O can return a value to its caller indicating
      success or failure, or returning the result of its I/O
      operation, a sub-coroutine that you call to yield on your behalf
      can return a value to you, perhaps communicating the same kind
      of thing.</p>
    <p>Having two stacks restores the elegant symmetry of MIX’s
      coroutines: once again, our two (or more) stacks are equal
      partners in the program’s overall endeavour, with neither one
      being forced to take an artificially subordinate role.</p>
    <p>But this is also what I meant when I said earlier that Knuth’s
      account of coroutines as ‘a generalisation of subroutines’
      didn’t make sense in all contexts. In <em>this</em> model,
      coroutines and subroutines aren’t more and less general versions
      of the same concept: they’re <em>independent</em> concepts, and
      you have both of them at once. I like to imagine them at right
      angles to each other: coroutine transfers go left or right
      between stacks, whereas subroutine calls or returns go up and
      down within a stack.</p>
    <p>OK. So: if each of our coroutines comes with its own stack,
      then doesn’t that make them a lot like threads? What’s the
      difference?</p>
    <p>Firstly, these coroutine stacks are <em>cooperative</em>.
      Control only transfers between them when they ask for it on
      purpose. This makes them unlike ordinary threads, which are
      pre-emptively switched by the OS kernel, or (better still, if
      possible) actually run simultaneously on more than one CPU of
      your multi-core computer.</p>
    <p>This cooperative nature makes it easy to avoid the
      synchronisation problems of real threads. You don’t need to take
      out a lock to stop another coroutine stack from accessing the
      same data as you: all you have to do is <em>not yield to it</em>
      while you’re in the middle of a critical section, and then it’s
      guaranteed not to be running at the time.</p>
    <p>Cooperative multithreading isn’t totally unheard of even in
      normal OS contexts. In the late 1980s, for example, RISC OS came
      out, which was a GUI operating system that let you run multiple
      programs at once, but it was cooperatively
      multithreaded<label for="footnoteinput-riscos"><sup id="footnote-riscos">9</sup><span>RISC OS is still around the
      last time I heard, and will run on a Raspberry Pi in particular.
      I have no idea if it’s <em>still</em> cooperatively
      multithreaded, though. Wikipedia seems to say it is, but its
      most recent citation is from 2003…</span><span>9</span></label>: your program
      would continue running without interruption until you called the
      ‘wait for a GUI event’ system service, and only then would the
      OS switch to running another process. And until <em>that</em>
      process made the same system call, <em>you’d</em> never get
      control back.</p>
    <p>But when you did that, you didn’t know which other program
      would run next. It wasn’t really your business to know: the
      other programs were independent of you. If you exchanged data
      with another program at all, it would be mediated through the
      OS, perhaps via drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste, and you might
      not care <em>what</em> other program it was, only that it was
      providing data you had to do something with.</p>
    <p>But in a coroutine-organised program, the data flow between the
      coroutines is highly structured, and the whole point. If you’re
      a coroutine stack acting as an adapter in between a producer and
      a consumer, then you most certainly do care which stack runs
      next: the consumer mustn’t run until you have a data item ready
      for it, and the producer mustn’t run until you’ve disposed of
      the one you’re holding.</p>
    <p>That’s the other vital difference. Coroutine stacks get
      to <em>identify which stack to switch to next.</em> That adapter
      thread doesn’t just ‘yield to whoever has something to do’: it
      has two fundamentally different operations, ‘yield to the
      producer’ and ‘yield to the consumer’.</p>
    <p>So, that’s my third model of what kind of thing coroutines can
      be. They’re like cooperative threads, except that switching
      between them is done in a manner like a coroutine yield rather
      than like a system call: the yielding ‘thread’ chooses which
      ‘thread’ is going to run next, and maybe passes it a data object
      of some kind, which it might need in order to resume running at
      all.</p>
    <p>I’ve been talking about the CPU’s physical call stack structure
      throughout this section, but now I’ll contradict myself by
      saying that, at the physical low level, depending on the
      language implementation, the ‘stack’ of each of these ‘threads’
      need not <em>actually</em> look anything like a physical call
      stack.</p>
    <p>You <em>could</em> make it look like one. You could allocate a
      piece of memory for a coroutine stack; let the coroutines on it
      push and pop stack frames like ordinary function calls; and have
      a special ‘yield’ function that swaps out the stack pointer and
      switches over to executing on another stack. In fact, that’s not
      a bad way to add coroutines to a language that doesn’t already
      have them, because it doesn’t need the compiler to have any
      special knowledge of what’s going on. You could add coroutines
      to C in this way if you wanted to, and the approach would have
      several advantages over my preprocessor system. (Though also
      some disadvantages: this way, you have to anticipate every CPU
      architecture your code will need to run on, and write and test
      the low-level stack setup and switching code for all of them.
      Also, you lose the advantage I’m about to talk about in the
      <em>next</em> section.)</p>
    <p>But it’s just as likely that a language’s implementation of
      coroutines will choose to do it another way. For example, in
      C++20, you can certainly arrange for coroutines to be able to
      call each other as subroutines, but the natural way to set it up
      involves the logical ‘stack’ of those calls being an array or a
      linked list inside the coroutines’ promise objects. A separate
      physical call stack is never allocated, and (as I mentioned in
      the previous section) a call frame on the existing physical
      stack is only allocated for the currently running coroutine.</p>
    <p>I’ll end this section on an extra-confusing note: if the
      coroutine stacks are kept in a format completely separate from
      the physical call stack of a thread, that opens the possibility
      of combining stacks of coroutines <em>with</em> conventional
      threads – so that when a coroutine stack has some work it can
      do, it could be resumed on the call stack of any thread that was
      free!</p>

    <h3 id="named-object">A named object identifying a program activity</h3>
    <p>Finally, I want to go back to a point I touched on
      in <a href="#vs-threads">a previous section</a>.</p>
    <p>While I was comparing coroutines to ordinary threads
      (pre-emptive or genuinely concurrent), I mentioned that it’s
      useful that a suspended coroutine is always in a state where it
      can be conveniently destructed, if the computation or data
      stream or activity it’s producing is no longer needed.</p>
    <p>More generally, once you’ve started a coroutine and it’s
      suspended itself, there will typically be some kind
      of <em>object</em> in the programming language that represents
      its state. That object will behave like any other: you can
      assign it (or maybe a pointer to it) into a named variable, and
      you can store that variable wherever you like. You could have
      other objects contain pointers to activities they care about;
      you could keep all your activities in an array; you could store
      each one in a separate variable with an easy-to-remember
      name.</p>
    <p>If your language supports automatically destructing things when
      they go out of scope, this lets you tie the lifetime of the
      coroutine to some other lifetime you already cared about. For
      example, if a particular other class is consuming the
      coroutine’s output, you can keep the coroutine object inside
      that class, and then you <em>just don’t need to worry</em> about
      clearing it up: the coroutine will automatically be thrown away
      exactly when nothing can possibly need its output any more, even
      if it was only half-finished. And if it had any internal
      variables that also needed cleaning up, that will all happen
      automatically too, because the language should arrange
      that <em>their</em> destructors run. In a language using RAII,
      even external resources like open files should be cleaned up
      with no fuss.</p>
    <p>(If your language <em>doesn’t</em> support automatic
      destruction, you still get an echo of this usefulness. For
      example, if you’re using my preprocessor coroutine system in C,
      then each coroutine already has to have a structure type storing
      all its internal state. If you want to be able to abandon an
      unfinished coroutine, then you have to accompany the coroutine
      with a hand-written function that frees that state structure and
      any subsidiary resources its fields point to. But in C, you’re
      accustomed to writing those functions all the time anyway, so
      coroutines are no different – and if a non-coroutine object of
      some kind owns a coroutine state, then the free function for the
      first object will naturally call the free function for the
      coroutine state. And <em>vice versa</em>. So it’s still natural
      to set up your code so that coroutines are cleanly destroyed; C
      makes you do all the <em>work</em> yourself, but it’s easy
      to <em>organise</em> it sensibly. This is one of the reasons I
      mentioned in the previous section for why I still use
      preprocessor coroutines in C instead of low-level stack
      switching: it would be a much harder job to free an
      in-progress <em>physical call stack</em> and all the resources
      allocated by unfinished calls on it!)</p>
    <p>An interesting thing about this ‘conveniently destructible’
      nature is that it wasn’t anywhere in <cite>TAOCP</cite>’s
      presentation of coroutines, and I presume therefore not in
      earlier work either. (That’s not <em>surprising</em>, of course,
      since languages with automatic destruction weren’t around in
      those days.) I only really thought about it that way myself when
      someone suggested to me the idea of combining coroutines with
      threads (as I mentioned at the end of the previous section), and
      wondered what the advantage might be over <em>just</em> using
      threads. I decided this was it: if your in-progress activities
      are explicitly stored in a data structure separate from the
      threads that are executing them, then you can abandon an
      activity in an easier and cleaner way than destroying a thread.
      It’s always interesting when the most useful feature of a thing
      turns out to be one that its originator never thought of!</p>
    <p>Anyway. This is my final way of looking at coroutines: they
      allow you to encapsulate a computation, or some other particular
      strand of your program’s activity (such as one among many
      network connections it’s handling), into an object which has a
      name in your programming language, and can be accessed from
      outside the coroutine.</p>
    <p>If you’ve expanded each coroutine into a call stack of its own,
      as I discussed in the previous section, then this is still true:
      from outside the coroutine stack, you still have <em>one</em>
      named object, which encapsulates the whole stack. For example,
      if the coroutine yields data values, then that object will be
      where the rest of the program goes to get them: it will have
      the <code>next()</code> method, or the C++ iterable semantics,
      or whatever the language finds convenient. Whichever layer of
      the coroutine’s internal call stack yields a value, the values
      will all be delivered out of that same single object, without
      anyone outside the coroutine stack having to know or care about
      the internal subdivisions. And destroying that object should
      clean up the entire stack, even if it had multiple layers of
      unfinished internal subroutine calls.</p>
    <p>But having a named object identifying an activity is useful for
      more things than just destroying it. Objects can also provide
      other methods, or expose their internal data to the rest of the
      program on purpose.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have a coroutine object that encapsulates
      the progress of some activity, you might arrange that it
      presents methods returning details of its progress – perhaps a
      headline figure like ‘85% complete’ for the graphical progress
      bar, or perhaps details of the last subdirectory it scanned, or
      what phase of a network connection it’s in. As usual, the
      advantage of doing this with coroutines rather than threads is
      that there’s no worry about concurrent access: if the coroutine
      is suspended, then you can safely read its data (or at least the
      data it’s publishing on purpose).</p>
    <p>You might also arrange that methods on the wrapping object
      can <em>modify</em> the progress of the coroutine in some way.
      That case is harder to think of good examples for, but they do
      sometimes come up.</p>
    <p>One example of this comes up in an example I’ve already shown,
      from PuTTY. In <a href="#protocol">a previous section</a> I
      showed pseudocode of the coroutine that handles the SSH
      transport layer, which periodically does key exchanges. A repeat
      key exchange can be triggered by either side sending
      the <code>KEXINIT</code> packet. In the pseudocode earlier I
      showed the coroutine responding to the <em>other</em> end
      sending <code>KEXINIT</code>. But what if <em>we’re</em> the
      side that decides it needs to rekey first?</p>
    <p>Suppose we had a function <code>trigger_rekey()</code> that the
      rest of the program would call when it decided that needed to
      happen. That function could construct a <code>KEXINIT</code>
      packet and inject it into the output packet queue. When the
      other end responded with its own <code>KEXINIT</code>,
      the <code>key_exchange()</code> coroutine would resume, and see
      it. But then how would it know that in <em>this</em> case it
      shouldn’t respond by sending one of its own? Answer:
      the <code>trigger_rekey()</code> function also wants to set a
      flag <em>in the coroutine’s state</em> that says “We’ve already
      sent our <code>KEXINIT</code>, don’t send another one”.
      Then <code>key_exchange()</code> sees the
      incoming <code>KEXINIT</code> but also sees that the flag is
      set, so it goes back round to the top of the loop without
      sending an unwanted extra <code>KEXINIT</code> first. That’s the
      kind of thing that an accompanying mutator method on a coroutine
      might usefully do.</p>
    <p>OK; what <em>else</em> can you do with a data object in a
      programming language, as well as deleting it, reading its state,
      or changing its state?</p>
    <p>Here’s a <em>really</em> silly idea: you can <em>copy</em> it.
      Suppose you <em>cloned</em> a coroutine object, together with
      all of its internal state?</p>
    <p>Using my C/C++ preprocessor coroutine system, this is perfectly
      possible. In that system, all the persistent variables of the
      coroutine – including the state variable that says where to
      resume from next – have to live in an explicitly declared
      structure (in C) or be members of a class (in C++). Either way,
      there’s no difficulty with making an exact copy: in C, you’d
      have to write a cloning function that dealt with memory
      allocation and deep copying, but that’s an easy mechanical job
      and the structure definition lists all the fields you need to
      handle. And in C++, you might very well be able to use the
      class’s default copy constructor and have it Just Work.</p>
    <p>After you do that, you’ve got two copies of the coroutine, and
      each of them will resume from the <em>same</em> part of the code
      when it next runs. It’s very like the Unix <code>fork</code>
      system call in that respect.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a <em>deliberate</em> feature of my preprocessor
      system; it’s just a thing that drops out naturally from the
      implementation strategy, and turns out to be easy to do. I doubt
      that any language-native coroutine system will be willing to do
      this stunt.</p>
    <p>But if you <em>can</em> do it, what might it be useful for?</p>
    <p>One thing that springs to mind is testing, if your coroutine
      accepts input on each yield. Run the coroutine to a particular
      point, then repeatedly clone it and try lots of different inputs
      on independent copies of it, making sure that each one is
      handled correctly. This might be a lot less expensive that
      running from the start of the coroutine to the test
      point <em>again</em> for each test input.</p>
    <p>Another possibility is to use the same idea at run time, to
      probe the coroutine from outside and <em>find</em> an input that
      will cause it to respond in a particular way. But I haven’t
      thought of a use for that at all!</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I started writing this article because I wondered if I had
      anything in particular to say about coroutines. Turns out I had
      quite a lot!</p>
    <p>Perhaps this will convince a few more people to become
      coroutine fans. Or perhaps it will give some existing coroutine
      users new ways of thinking about them and using them. Or perhaps
      not, and everyone reading this will decide I have weird opinions
      that they disagree with.</p>
    <p>But it was fun to write, and helped me clarify my <em>own</em>
      thoughts. And it’s my blog so I can be self-indulgent if I want
      to. Thanks for reading!</p>

    
    <p>With any luck, you should be able to read the footnotes of this
      article in place, by clicking on the superscript footnote number
      or the corresponding numbered tab on the right side of the page.</p>
    <p>But just in case the CSS didn’t do the right thing, here’s the
      text of all the footnotes again:</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-win32-read-write">1.</a> For
      example, in the Win32 API, if you have a bidirectional file
      handle such as a serial port or a named pipe, and you need to
      simultaneously try to read and write it, I think it
      really <em>is</em> the least inconvenient thing to have two
      threads, one trying to read the handle and one trying to write
      it. The alternative <code>GetOverlappedResult</code> approach
      ended up being <em>more</em> painful when I tried it.</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-python-coroutines">2.</a> I talk about
      generators as if they were <em>the</em> coroutine system in
      Python, but in fact, they’re one of two: Python <em>also</em>
      has
      a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#coroutines">completely
      different kind of thing</a> that it actually uses the name
      ‘coroutine’ for, in which function definitions start
      with <code>async def</code> and suspend with <code>await</code>.
      I’ve never played with those, because generators are easier to
      get started with and have scratched my generalised coroutine
      itch well enough. But at some point I should at least give them
      a look.</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-knuth">3.</a> In <cite>TAOCP</cite>, one of Knuth’s
      suggestions for a producer/consumer chain is that you might be
      flexible enough to make a runtime decision as
      to <em>whether</em> to run both parts interleaved as coroutines,
      or whether to run them sequentially storing the intermediate
      data on disk, depending on how much memory you have. I suspect
      this was a more vital concern in the 1970s.</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-pairwise">4.</a> The
      non-cyclic version of this is also useful. As of Python 3.10
      that <em>is</em> in the standard library,
      as <code>itertools.pairwise</code>, although I’m going to have
      to keep writing it by hand until I can rely on Python 3.10 or
      better being widespread enough. But as far as I know the cyclic
      version still isn’t in <code>itertools</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-StopIteration">5.</a> Incidentally, yes, I know,
      there’s another special case that my code doesn’t handle: if the
      input iterator has <em>no</em> values, then the example version
      of <code>cyclic_pairs</code> shown here will
      raise <code>StopIteration</code>, when perhaps you’d prefer it
      to silently generate an empty output list. Before Python 3.7
      this happened automatically, because <code>StopIteration</code>
      was handled differently; in many of my own use cases I never
      pass an empty list anyway. But if you were writing a version
      general enough to go in <code>itertools</code>, you’d probably
      want to check for that case properly.</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-if-for-while">6.</a> In my fantasy programming
      language, this would <em>actually</em> be how the standard
      control structures were implemented. The only primitives in the
      language itself would be ‘goto’ and coroutines. <em>All</em>
      block-structured control flow commands, even the standard things
      like ‘if’, ‘for’ and ‘while’, would be defined in the standard
      prelude as small coroutines of this kind, implemented in terms
      of ‘goto’. Then they wouldn’t need to be
      keywords!</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-self-modifying-code">7.</a> In fact, Knuth does
      this by self-modifying code. The memory location where you save
      the return address is actually the destination-address field
      <em>within the jump instruction</em> that performs the
      return!</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-stack-grows-downwards">8.</a> For the sake of not
      using too many words, I’ll assume the most common convention for
      stack layout, which is that the stack grows downwards in memory:
      pushes make SP smaller, pops make it bigger, and when you call a
      subroutine, its stack frame is below yours. If you’re used to
      one of the rare architectures that does things the other way up,
      just turn your head upside down while reading this
      section.</p>
<p><a href="#footnote-riscos">9.</a> RISC OS is still around the
      last time I heard, and will run on a Raspberry Pi in particular.
      I have no idea if it’s <em>still</em> cooperatively
      multithreaded, though. Wikipedia seems to say it is, but its
      most recent citation is from 2003…</p>

<p>The most important thing about reading this blog post is to not get scared off by the formulas. The post may look like all the crap you normally skim over, so you may be tempted to skim over this one. Don’t! <strong>None of this is hard.</strong> Just read the post top to bottom, and I promise you every individual step and the whole thing put together will make sense.</p>
<section id="highschool-math">
<h2 data-anchor-id="highschool-math">Highschool math</h2>
<p>In hight school your math teacher may have started a treatment of linear algebra by making you solve a system of linear equations, at which point you very sensibly zoned out because you knew you’d go on to program computers and never have to solve a system of linear equations again (don’t worry, I won’t be talking much about them here).</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{eqnarray}
0x_1 + 1x_2 = 0\\
-1x_1 - 0x_2 = 0
\end{eqnarray}
\tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>You also may have learned that for some reason you can take the coefficients and put them in a 2D array like this: <span>\(A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>. You’ve now defined a matrix <span>\(A\)</span>, and you can re-express the system of linear equations above as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[
\newcommand\qvec[1]{\begin{bmatrix}#1\end{bmatrix}}
A\qvec{x_1\\x_2}=0
\tag{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>If you’re <em>really</em> hellbent on cleaning things up, you can express the vector <span>\(\qvec{x_1, x_2}\)</span> as <span>\(x=\qvec{x_1 \\ x_2}\)</span>, which now gives you a really clean equation:</p>
<p><span>\[
Ax=0
\tag{3}
\]</span></p>
<p>Equations 1 - 3 are just different ways to say the exact same thing. In different situations you may prefer one notation over another, but there is no material difference between them. They are all equivalent.</p>
</section>
<section id="matrix-vector-multiplication">
<h2 data-anchor-id="matrix-vector-multiplication">Matrix-vector multiplication</h2>
<p>I’ll talk about what matrix-vector multiplication <em>means</em> in a moment. For now let’s look at how the operation is defined. The precise definition of matrix-vector multiplication flows out of the notation above, so you never again have to look it up on wikipedia. If you need to multiply a matrix by a vector, say <span>\(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \qvec{1 \\ 2}\)</span>, just recall that this is equivalent to the left side of the system of equations above. Before, we took the coefficients in the linear equation system and factored them out into a 2D array. Now we reverse the procedure– take our 2D array and factor it back in as coefficients:</p>
<p><span>\[
\qvec{
0*1 + 1*2\\
-1*1 - 0*2
}=\qvec{2 \\ -1}
\]</span></p>
<p>If you forget how matrix-vector multiplication works, just remember that its definition flows out of the notation. Convert the matrix-vector multiplication notation back into the linear equation system notation again, and you get the matrix-vector multiplication formula.</p>
<p>You may remember from high school that there is an operation defined on vectors called the dot product. The dot product is the sum of pairwise multiplication of elements of two vectors. E.g. <span>\(\qvec{0, 1}\cdot\qvec{1, 2}=0*1 + 1*2=2\)</span>. The dot product of two vectors is an operation that represents the degree to which the two vectors point in the same direction.</p>
<p>That’s simple enough. But here is something curious. Another way to think of matrix-vector multiplication is by treating each row of a matrix as its own vector, and computing the dot products of these row vectors with the vector we’re multiplying by (in this case <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span>). How on earth does that work?! What does vector similarity have to do with linear equations, or with matrix-vector multiplication? I cannot answer this question quite yet. But we’ll eventually build up to an answer in future posts.</p>
</section>
<section id="matrices-as-functions">
<h2 data-anchor-id="matrices-as-functions">Matrices as functions</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at what matrix-vector multiplication means. This blew my mind when I first learned about it. You can think of a matrix as a function, and you can think of multiplying a matrix by a vector as applying that function to the vector. So when you see <span>\(Ax\)</span>, autocomplete it in your head to “calling some function <span>\(A\)</span> with argument <span>\(x\)</span>”.</p>
<p>This is actually not so strange– you can think of many structures as functions. For example, you can think of a number <span>\(3\)</span> as a function. When you multiply it by things, it makes them three times bigger. Thinking about matrices this way happens to be very convenient.</p>
<p>The fact that <span>\(Ax=0\)</span> denotes both the linear system in equation 1, and a call to a function <span>\(A\)</span> with argument <span>\(x\)</span> (getting the zero vector in return) leads to a curious insight about the relationship between high school math and programming.</p>
<p>In high school you’re given equations and asked to find their roots. We already established that a system of equations is equivalent to matrix-vector multiplication, which can be thought of as function application. And so, in high school you’re <em>given</em> a function <span>\(A\)</span> along with its output, and asked to <em>find the inputs that match that output</em>. Programming is usually the exact opposite. In programming what you’re <em>given</em> is the shape of inputs and outputs, and your job is to <em>construct a function</em> <span>\(A\)</span> that converts inputs to desired outputs. The computer then executes the functions you construct, often at scale.</p>
<p>So it turns out that solving systems of linear equations in high school math classes and writing React code in your day job are two sides of the same coin! It’s a complicated idea, so it takes a while to wrap your head around its implications (and its limitations). Illuminating this relationship in much more depth is another thing I hope to accomplish with these series of posts.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="what-does-beginbmatrix0-1--1-0-endbmatrix-do">What does <span>\(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span> do?</h2>
<p>Going back to our lowly 2x2 matrix <span>\(A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, let’s consider what this matrix does. Taking an equally lowly vector <span>\(x=\qvec{0, 1}\)</span> and multiplying <span>\(A\)</span> by <span>\(x\)</span>, we get <span>\(Ax=\qvec{1, 0}\)</span>. Let’s do this a few more times:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;A\qvec{1 \\ 0}=\qvec{0, -1}\\
&amp;A\qvec{0 \\ -1}=\qvec{-1, 0}\\
&amp;A\qvec{-1 \\ 0}=\qvec{0, 1}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>After the fourth operation we’re back where we started. Plotting this we get:</p>
<div data-execution_count="22">
<p><img src="https://coffeemug.github.io/spakhm.com/posts/01-lingalg-p1/linalg-p1_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png"></p>
</div>
<p>So the matrix <span>\(A\)</span> performs a clockwise rotation on its input vector by 90 degrees! How does that work? Suppose we had to write a normal Python function to do a clockwise 90 degree rotation:</p>
<div data-execution_count="33">
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>def</span> rotate(vec):</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    x, y <span>=</span> vec</span>
<span id="cb1-3">    <span>return</span> [y, <span>-</span>x]</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">[rotate([<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>]),</span>
<span id="cb1-6"> rotate([<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>]),</span>
<span id="cb1-7"> rotate([<span>0</span>, <span>-</span><span>1</span>]),</span>
<span id="cb1-8"> rotate([<span>-</span><span>1</span>, <span>0</span>])]</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-execution_count="33">
<pre><code>[[1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0], [0, 1]]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are the same results that we got by matrix multiplication. It helps to tinker with matrix-vector multiplication by hand to internalize how it works. Can you write a matrix that rotates its input counterclockwise? How about one that rotates by 45 degrees? A matrix that returns its input as is?</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="matrix-matrix-multiplication">Matrix-matrix multiplication</h2>
<p>In highschool your teacher also gave you a bunch of rules for how to multiply matrices by each other, and then, if you’re lucky, maybe explained what matrix-matrix multiplication means. I always thought it’s a silly way of teaching it. Where did the rules come from? Did Moses bring them down from mount Sinai on stone tablets?</p>
<p>Instead, let’s do it the sensible way and put the horse before the cart. Knowing what we know, if <em>we</em> were tasked with defining matrix multiplication, what would we <em>want it to do</em>? What could be a reasonable definition?</p>
<p>We’ve seen in the previous section that <span>\(A\)</span> rotates its input vector clockwise by 90 degrees. Of course when we apply <span>\(A\)</span>, take the resulting vector, and apply <span>\(A\)</span> again, <em>that</em> gets rotated by 90 degrees. So applying <span>\(A\)</span> twice rotates the <em>original</em> input clockwise by 180 degrees. Mathematically, we can express it like this: <span>\(A(Ax)\)</span>. We perform matrix-vector multiplication <span>\(Ax\)</span> which produces a vector, we take that vector, and perform matrix-vector multiplication on that.</p>
<p>Normally in math we want the multiplication operation to associate. It would be strage if the result of <span>\(2*(2*3)\)</span> were different from <span>\((2*2)*3\)</span>. So it’s sensible to apply this principle to matrices and make <em>their</em> multiplication associative. In other words, we want the following equation to be true: <span>\[
A(Ax)=(AA)x
\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span>\(A(Ax)\)</span> rotated <span>\(x\)</span> clockwise by 180 degrees, ideally <span>\(AA\)</span> would be a matrix that does exactly the same thing. To put it more generally, if matrix <span>\(A\)</span> performs some operation, and another matrix <span>\(B\)</span> performs a different operation, we want the matrix <span>\(M=AB\)</span> to perform both of those operations one after another. A different way of putting it is that if we think of matrices as functions, we want matrix multiplication to act in the same way as function composition.</p>
<p>This is exactly what matrix multiplication does. The derivation is a little bit messy, so instead of doing it inline I added it an <a href="#appendix-matrix-matrix-multiplication-derivation">appendix</a> at the end of this post. If you forget why matrix-matrix multiplication is defined the way it is, you can always come back to this explanation.</p>
</section>
<section id="type-systems">
<h2 data-anchor-id="type-systems">Type systems</h2>
<p>Let’s look at another example of matrix-vector multiplication, this time with a non-square matrix:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \\
-1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
\qvec{1 \\ 2}
=\qvec{2 \\ -1 \\ 0}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s call this matrix on the left <span>\(M\)</span>. In the equation above we get our result by performing the dot product of <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span> with every row of <span>\(M\)</span>. In other words, we treat each row of <span>\(M\)</span> as a vector, perform a pairwise multiplication of its elements with <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span>, and sum them.</p>
<p>Now here is something interesting. Since you can’t perform a dot product of two vectors with different dimensions, for matrix-vector multiplication to work the number of elements in <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span> must be equal to the number of columns in <span>\(M\)</span>. Switching to thinking of <span>\(M\)</span> as a function, <em>we’ve now learned something about the type of its input</em>. <span>\(M\)</span>’s arguments <em>must</em> be vectors of two dimensions.</p>
<p>The opposite is true for <span>\(M\)</span>’s rows. Because we perform a dot product of <span>\(\qvec{1, 2}\)</span> with every row of <span>\(M\)</span> and <span>\(M\)</span> has three rows, the output vector must necessarily have three elements. And so, the number of rows in <span>\(M\)</span> tells us about the type of its output.</p>
<p>Here is a simple way of expressing this in typescript:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>// Columns are the input; rows are the output</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>type</span> mC <span>=</span> [<span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span>]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>type</span> mR <span>=</span> [<span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span>]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>type</span> M <span>=</span> (in<span>:</span> mC) <span>-&gt;</span> mR<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s consider how types for matrix multiplication work. Suppose we have a different matrix <span>\(N\)</span>, and we’d like to multiply <span>\(N\)</span> by <span>\(M\)</span>. What must the type of the matrix <span>\(N\)</span> be? Well, if we look at a term <span>\(NMx\)</span>, <span>\(M\)</span>’s output becomes <span>\(N\)</span>’s input. Thefore, <span>\(N\)</span>’s input and <span>\(M\)</span>’s output must be of the same type. In other words, <span>\(N\)</span>’s number of columns must be the same as <span>\(M\)</span>’s number of rows:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>type</span> N <span>=</span> (in<span>:</span> mR) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>any</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you think about which matrices can and cannot be multiplied by each other, it’s actually quite simple– the output of one matrix (its rows) must have the same dimension as the input of another (its columns). If you get confused about that, perhaps writing it out in typescript notation will help!</p>

<section id="whats-next">
<h2 data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>This post should give you a basic intuition for what matrices are and how they work. However, we’ve just scrated the surface. Here are some interesting questions for you to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>You saw we can treat rows of a matrix as vectors. What is the intuitive meaning of these row vectors?</li>
<li>This (correctly) suggests we can also treat matrix columns as vectors. What is the intuitive meaning of column vectors?</li>
<li>If we think of a matrix <span>\(A\)</span> as a function, can we look at it and tell which inputs result in the output of zero? In other words, how do we solve <span>\(Ax=0\)</span>?</li>
<li>We know matrix multiplication can be thought of as composing two functions into a single function. Can we do the opposite and break up a matrix into multiple smaller functions? How? And what would these smaller functions do?</li>
<li>What the heck are determinants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues?</li>
</ul>
<p>To start answering these questions, in the next part I plan to cover linear combinations, vector spaces, linear maps, and linear independence. Stay tuned!</p>

<section id="appendix-matrix-matrix-multiplication-derivation">
<h2 data-anchor-id="appendix-matrix-matrix-multiplication-derivation">Appendix: matrix-matrix multiplication derivation</h2>
<p>Coming back to matrix-matrix multiplication, we’ve already established that we want <span>\((AB)x=A(Bx)\)</span>. Let’s look at how to derive the multiplication definition from this equation. Rather than do it generally, I’ll do it for a 2x2 example, but exactly the same principle applies to matrices of other sizes.</p>
<p>Let <span>\(A=\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, let <span>\(B=\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} \\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} \\ \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, and let <span>\(x=\qvec{x_1 \\ x_2}\)</span>. Now let’s look at <span>\(A(Bx)\)</span>. Doing matrix-vector multiplication <span>\(Bx\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span>\[
Bx=\qvec{x_1b_{11} + x_2{b12} \\ x_1b_{21}+x_2b_{22}}
\]</span></p>
<p>That’s a vector, and we already know how to multiply a matrix by a vector, so we do it again (and get a slightly messy result):</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
A(Bx)
&amp;=\qvec{
  a_{11}(x_1b_{11} + x_2b_{12}) + a_{12}(x_1b_{21} + x_2b_{22}) \\
  a_{21}(x_1b_{11} + x_2b_{12}) + a_{22}(x_1b_{21} + x_2b_{22})}\\
&amp;=\qvec{
  x_1a_{11}b_{11} + x_2a_{11}b_{12} + x_1a_{12}b_{21} + x_2a_{12}b_{22} \\
  x_1a_{21}b_{11} + x_2a_{21}b_{12} + x_1a_{22}b_{21} + x_2a_{22}b_{22}}\\
&amp;=\qvec{
  x_1(a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21}) + x_2(a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22}) \\
  x_1(a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21}) + x_2(a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22})}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is starting to look like the left side of a linear system of equations again, and we know we can rewrite it by factoring out the coefficients into a matrix:</p>
<p><span>\[
A(Bx)=\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} &amp; a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} \\
a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} &amp; a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}\qvec{x_1 \\ x_2}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is our matrix <span>\(AB\)</span>! It’s first column is <span>\(A\qvec{b_{11} \\ b_{21}}\)</span>, and its second column is <span>\(A\qvec{b_{12} \\ b_{22}}\)</span>. In other words each column of <span>\(AB\)</span> is a matrix-vector product of <span>\(A\)</span> with a corresponding column of <span>\(B\)</span>. Which is precisely the definition of matrix-matrix multiplication.</p>

If people like Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, and Alan Newell were among the first to think deeply about how symbolic AI, in which machines manipulate explicit verbal-like representations, might work, Doug was the first to try really hard to make it actually work. I have spent my whole career arguing for consilience between neural networks and symbolic AI, and on the strictly symbolic side of that equation, Lenat was light-years ahead of me, not just more deeply embedded in those trenches than I, but the architect of many of those trenches. </span></p><p><span>Lenat spent the last 40 years of his life launching and directing a project called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc" rel="">Cyc</a><span>, an intense effort to codify all of common sense in machine-interpretable form. Too few people thinking about AI today even know what that project is. Many who do, write it off as a failure. Cyc (and the parent company, Cycorp, that Lenat formed to incubate it) never exploded commercially – but hardly anybody ever gives it credit for the fact that it is still in business 40 years later; very very few AI companies have survived that long.</span></p><p>My own view is that Cyc has been neither a success nor a failure, but somewhere in between:  I see it as a ground-breaking, clarion experiment that never fully gelled. No, Cyc didn’t set the world on fire, but yes, it will seem more and more important in hindsight, as we eventually make real progress towards artificial general intelligence. </p><p><span>Most young AI researchers have never even heard about it. But every single one of them </span><em>should know something about Cyc. </em><span>They don’t need to like it, but they should understand what it was, and what it tried to do, and what they might do instead to accomplish the same goals. </span></p><p><span>Not because Cyc will get used out of the box, as some sort of drop-in replacement for Large Language Models, but because what Lenat tried to do - to get machines to represent and </span><em>reason</em><span> about common sense — still must be done. Yejin Choi’s wonderful 2023 TED talk,</span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/yejin_choi_why_ai_is_incredibly_smart_and_shockingly_stupid" rel=""> Why AI is incredibly smart and shockingly stupid</a><span>, followed directly in that tradition, explaining why common sense is still, despite their apparent success, lacking in current AI systems.

From them we sometimes see an illusion of common sense, depending on the vagaries of what the training set is and the precise wording of a question, but something is obviously still missing. And even if this specific example is patched up, there will inevitably be others of a similar flavor. Cyc is an effort to find a deeper, more robust answer.</p><p>As the AI researcher Ken Forbus of Northwestern University put it to me in an email this morning, “The Cyc project was the first demonstration that symbolic representations and reasoning can scale to capture significant portions of commonsense. While today billion-fact knowledge bases are common in industry, Cyc remains the most advanced in terms of expressiveness, capturing more of the range of thoughts that humans are capable of.  My group has been using Cyc’s representations in our research for decades… Our field would do well to learn more from the Cyc project.” A Google researcher, Muktha Ananda, Director of their Learning Platform, wrote condolences to me this morning, “I have always been a great admirer of [Lenat’s] vision, perseverance and tenacity. His work on Cyc was a great source of inspiration for my own journey into knowledge graphs/webs.” </p><p>§</p><p>Over the last year, Doug and I tried to write a long, complex paper that we never got to finish. Cyc was both awesome in its scope, and unwieldy in its implementation. The biggest problem with Cyc from an academic perspective is that it’s proprietary. To help more people understand it, I tried to bring out of him what lessons he learned from Cyc, for a future generation of researchers to use. Why did it work as well as it did when it did, why did fail when it did, what was hard to implement, and what did he wish that he had done differently? We had nearly 40,000 words, sprawling, not yet fully organized, yet filled with wisdom. It was part science, part oral history.  Needless to say, it takes a long time to organize and polish something of that length. In between our other commitments, we were making slow but steady progress. And then in the new year, I got busy with AI policy, and he got sick; progress slowed. Closer to the end, he wrote a shorter, tighter paper, building in part on the work we had done together. When he realized that he did not have much time left,  we agreed that I would help polish the shorter manuscript, a junior partner in what we both knew would likely be his last paper. </p><p><span>One of his last emails to me, about six weeks ago, was an entreaty to get the paper out ASAP; on July 31, after a nerve-wracking false-start, it came out, on arXiv, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04445.pdf" rel="">Getting from Generative AI to Trustworthy AI: What LLMs might learn from Cyc</a><span>.  The brief article is simultaneously a review of what Cyc tried to do, an encapsulation of what we should expect from genuine artificial intelligence, and a call for reconciliation between the deep symbolic tradition that he worked in with modern Large Language Models.  </span></p><p>In his honor, I hope you will find time to read it.</p><p><em><strong>Gary Marcus</strong><span> has focused his career on integrating neural networks and symbolic approaches; he still hopes that will happen.</span></em></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Please considering sharing this post, in Doug’s memory</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://vitonsky.net/blog/2023/09/01/malware-in-browser-extensions/">https://vitonsky.net/blog/2023/09/01/malware-in-browser-extensions/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37352803">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>September 1, 2023</span><span>5<!-- --> minutes to read<!-- --></span></p></div><div><p>I've developed a few browser extensions, and every week I receive numerous emails with "revenue offer". Some experienced developers know that offers like these will inject malware into the browsers of your users, but scammers who make these offers will not tell you about it. They offer "integrations" that don't look so suspicious. Imagine how many developers have accepted these offers. Then look at the number of extensions in your browser and think about how much risk there is that you have an extension with malware.</p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/files/a0b4319b3c5aa50037d2b7721e6a9ca2f878128cd584bfba48d06afa74082ed3.jpg" alt="Snatch - the movie"></p>
<!-- --><p>Browser extensions may request a lot of permissions, which can be necessary to implement some features and to improve the user experience. However, having wide permissions can increase the attack surface for hackers. This is why browser extensions are a great target for hackers.</p>
<!-- --><p>Browser extensions can access any content on a page, such as emails, private messages in social media, and bank account information. Extensions may also capture pressed keys and send passwords to hackers. The collected data may be sold or used by hackers to steal money, identities, or for blackmail.</p>
<!-- --><p>In recent years, browser extensions have started inserting advertisements on web pages. Here's how it works: a browser extension developer signs up on an ads platform and creates an account for some application. Then they inject ads on any web pages users visit and earn money from clicks. Sometimes even the ads platform doesn't know how the developer is generating clicks.</p>
<!-- --><p>These are not the only ways hackers can use malware in your browser. They can also click on links, open sites in the background for DDoS purposes, and more. The key point is that your browser will be shared with a hacker.</p>
<!-- --><p>Let's see how extensions can be hijacked in case the developer is not a hacker.</p>
<!-- --><h2>Monetization offers of scammers</h2>
<!-- --><p>Extension developer may even not be a hacker, but an extension can be hacked by a third party because the programmer is an engineer with a low qualification level who can't detect scams. Social engineering works on programmers as well.</p>
<!-- --><p>I frequently received emails like this:</p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/files/1e9b6b51d1f4d049da6bd0ef1245df0b84cd49d23c5a7e8e1e7f1e1b692d5696.png" alt="I trust you're doing well. I want to introduce an exclusive revenue-generating opportunity for your Google Translate extension, through our specially curated Premium Bing Hosted Product"></p>
<!-- --></blockquote>
<!-- --><p>The problem we have is that some developers agree to offers like this because they don't understand that it's a scam. As a result, hackers in the screenshot above will inject malware into the clear extensions with good reputation.</p>
<!-- --><p>Developers may not even see the problem, they might just include third-party code that doesn't appear to be malware and actually accomplishes the things scammers claim. For example, it might add Bing suggestions to searches.</p>
<!-- --><p>Malware may intentionally not execute for some people, like developers and app store reviewers, but it does execute for users. This is why it is not secure to embed external resources like JavaScript code, but developers do it under different pretexts.</p>
<!-- --><p>If you are a developer and you are considering an offer like this, remember that you are not only betraying users who trust you, but your extension will also be removed everywhere in a few months when enough reports are sent by users.</p>
<!-- --><h2>Offers to buy project</h2>
<!-- --><p>Except "monetization offers" my spam folder also contains offers like this</p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/files/505fd4899f5e1986caa02da18654e10fc96ea3cb014d3cc48258502215e41587.png" alt="I hope you're doing well. I came across your Chrome extension and wanted to ask if you've ever considered selling it"></p>
<!-- --></blockquote>
<!-- --><p>The idea the same - scammers offers to buy a project (usually for funny money like $10.000), but actually they want to buy users to hack and rob them.</p>
<!-- --><h2>How to protect yourself</h2>
<!-- --><p>As you can see, even if an extension developer is not a hacker, you are still in danger because the extension can still be hacked.</p>
<!-- --><p>Browser app stores try to "moderate extensions", but usually, this means the extensions are analyzed with automated tools that attempt to detect malware patterns. In cases where a hacker hides it well, a robot will approve the new release.</p>
<!-- --><p>To decrease risks, you should keep the number of extensions you use to a minimum and learn more about the extension and its author before installing it.</p>
<!-- --><p>The author must be a real person with a GitHub and social media presence, not just a random person.</p>
<!-- --><p>The author must be a highly qualified programmer and hacker; otherwise, they may be easily deceived by scammers.</p>
<!-- --><p>Browser extensions must be open-source. If you can't find the extension's sources, you can be sure it's malware.</p>
<!-- --><p>The fewer dependencies the extension code has, the better it is for security.</p>
<!-- --><p>Never install random extensions without conducting a background check.</p>
<!-- --><h2>What extension developers should do to protect their users</h2>
<!-- --><p>Never allow content to be embedded from external servers. This primarily concerns scripts, but external pages in iframes or static resources like media files can also be used by scammers to collect the IP addresses of your users or display unacceptable content.</p>
<!-- --><p>With great power comes great responsibility. You have to be a hacker to detect and reject integration offers from scammers. The only way I see to do it is to write code every day and try new things to enrich your experience.</p>
<!-- --><p>You should also make your code accessible for other programmers to develop. They may detect your suspicious activity. Add documentation that explains the key design principles of your software and invite other developers to review and audit your code.</p>
<!-- --><h2>Related links</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p><span>Gerardo Serrano and Stephanie Wilson may have little in common. But there is at least one major tie that binds them: The government seized their vehicles, never charged either of them with a crime, and, most pertinently, made them wait years before resolving their cases.</span></p> <p><span>It is not uncommon for victims of civil forfeiture—the practice that allows law enforcement to take people's assets without having to prove the owner was guilty of a crime—to endure protracted delays before they have the opportunity to even step foot in a courtroom and defend themselves. The U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear </span><i><span>Culley v. Attorney General of Alabama</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/04/18/the-supreme-court-will-decide-whether-you-have-a-right-to-a-prompt-hearing-after-cops-seize-your-property/"><span>decide</span></a><span> if those who find themselves in that situation are entitled to a probable cause hearing after the seizure and, if so, how speedily it must happen.</span></p> <p><span>That the highest court in the country has to rule on whether people get such a hearing is an apt indictment of how unaccountable civil forfeiture has become.</span></p> <p><span>Serrano's case is instructive. In September 2015, while traveling to Mexico, he stopped at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, to take pictures. That upset some Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, who demanded he surrender the password to his cellphone. Serrano refused. The agents then searched his new Ford F-250 truck, found five stray bullets, and accused him of smuggling "munitions of war." Serrano had a concealed carry permit, and there was no firearm in his vehicle. The officers </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/04/19/civil-forfeiture-supreme-court-gerardo-serrano-truck-customs-border-protection/"><span>confiscated his car</span></a><span> anyway.</span></p> <p><span>But the fragile nature of the allegation didn't matter, because it would never be subject to scrutiny. The government didn't press charges. They did, however, keep his vehicle for two years, without holding a hearing where he could contest the seizure—or without ever filing a formal forfeiture complaint.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The dearth of due process protections was devastating. Serrano paid the government $3,800—10 percent of the car's value—as a requirement to fight the move in federal court; he was met with more radio silence, even after the feds cashed the check. A Kentucky resident, he subsequently spent thousands of dollars on rental cars while his vehicle sat halfway across the country, locked in a Texas parking lot.</span></p> <p><span>Serrano never got that hearing, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/04/19/civil-forfeiture-supreme-court-gerardo-serrano-truck-customs-border-protection/"><span>ruled</span></a><span> was fine. The federal government mysteriously changed its tune after two years went by—only when Serrano filed a lawsuit, represented by the Institute for Justice (I.J.), the libertarian-leaning public interest law firm. But as I.J., Serrano, and Wilson write in a recent </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-Brief-of-Amici-Curiae-in-Support-of-Petitioners.pdf"><i><span>amicus</span></i><span> brief</span></a><span> to the Supreme Court, the majority of innocent property owners do not have the resources to file a major class-action suit in order to coerce the government into returning their assets.</span></p> <p><span>It is almost always the government, in fact, that has the leverage to do the coercing, which they use to deter property owners from reclaiming what is theirs. One important tool at its disposal: delaying any hearings.</span></p> <p><span>Wilson knows first-hand. In 2019, over the span of less than six months, police in Detroit seized </span><i><span>two </span></i><span>of her cars after alleging that her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child was a petty drug offender. Wilson, a nursing student, was not suspected of wrongdoing, no arrests were made, and cops did not find drugs or guns in either of her vehicles.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>They proceeded forthwith. In the first instance, Wilson attempted three times, unsuccessfully, to fight the seizure: She was initially told she was too early to file a claim of interest on the car; on the second try, the government couldn't locate her paperwork; by the third try, she had missed a deadline, precluding her from further fighting for her car.</span></p> <p><span>After the second seizure, almost two years went by before Wilson was permitted to go before a judge, who sided with her. The government would not get to keep another one of her vehicles.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It was not for lack of trying.</span></p> <p><span>Detroit is a fitting case study of how byzantine the process of contesting a forfeiture has become. Before any victim is allowed to state their case, and only after they have successfully filed that claim of interest on their property, they must attend four in-person "pre-trial" conferences where prosecutors put a "deal" on the table: The owner may have their property back if they pay the government a fixed fee. In Wilson's case, she would have to buy her own car back for $1,800, not including storage and towing fees, an offer she declined at every conference. She couldn't afford it. Those meetings happen during the workday; if victims are unable to skirt professional commitments that conflict with any of the conferences, the government lays claim to their property, and the victim can no longer contest the seizure.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wilson is named in a </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/ingram-v-cnty-of-wayne-1"><span>suit</span></a><span> challenging those practices, which was argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in May. The court's decision is yet to be released. But in her case, and in similar cases across the country, the government has a considerable stake in upholding the status quo.</span></p> <p><span>You don't have to look very far to figure out what it is. Law enforcement agencies typically pocket the majority of the proceeds from civil forfeiture seizures. As of 2020, Wilson's home state, Michigan, along with 24 others—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming—direct </span><i><span>95 percent to 100 percent</span></i><span> of the funds extracted from seizures toward law enforcement, according to the I.J. </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/policing-for-profit-3-web.pdf"><span>report</span></a><span><em> Policing for Profit</em>. The federal government, which targeted Serrano, is also in that category, funneling money to either the Department of Justice or the Department of the Treasury.</span></p> <p><span>An additional seven states—Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Washington—send 80 percent to 95 percent of the proceeds to law enforcement. Several more fall below that threshold but still benefit handsomely from forfeitures, which in part explains why governments are loath to change course.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Law enforcement agencies bolster their budgets with forfeiture funds in interesting ways. A 2017 report from the </span><i><span>Philadelphia Weekly</span></i> found<span> that police used the money to </span><a href="https://reason.com/2017/09/21/the-secret-slush-funds-of-asset-forfeitu/"><span>purchase</span></a><span>, among other things, submachine guns, uniform embroidery, web design services, and a lawn mower, along with tens of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals. (Forfeiture money also went toward satisfying someone's parking ticket.) In 2021, law enforcement in Georgia were </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/09/29/georgia-tax-crimes-unit-illegally-spent-asset-forfeiture-funds-on-trinkets-and-swag/"><span>revealed</span></a><span> to have spent the money illegally on furniture, Fitbits, gym paraphernalia, and vehicles. In police seminars a few years back, session leaders </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html"><span>offered suggestions</span></a><span> for what sort of property to target based on cops' wishlists, which included flat-screen televisions—those "are very popular with the police departments," one government employee said on video—along with cash and cars (the nicer the better).</span></p> <p><span>Indeed, governments across the U.S. collectively take billions of dollars each year in forfeitures. Between 2002 and 2018, according to the I.J. report, people forfeited at least $63 billion. That stratospheric figure woefully undercounts the actual total, as only 20 states and the feds provided data for that time frame.</span></p> <p><span>So it's not surprising, then, that the government opposes even modest measures of accountability and due process—something as simple as a hearing—when they come across people like Serrano and Wilson. Deprived of the ability to formally and publicly air the cases against them, which are often less than flimsy, the government can pressure victims into giving up their assets entirely or accepting a "deal" like the $1,800 offer Wilson received.</span></p> <p><span>Such settlements are common. Consider the case of Carl Nelson and Amy Sterner Nelson, from whom the FBI </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/18/fbi-seized-almost-1-million-from-amy-sterner-carl-nelson-never-charged-them-with-a-crime/"><span>seized almost $1 million</span></a><span> in May 2020 after alleging Carl, who formerly worked as a real estate transaction manager for Amazon, had participated in an illegal kickback scheme with developers. (He was never charged with a crime.) Following the seizure, the family sold their car and their West Seattle house, liquidated their retirement, and temporarily moved with their four daughters into Amy's sister's basement.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In February 2022, the FBI and the Nelsons agreed to <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nelson-forfeiture-settlement.pdf">settle</a>: Out of the $892,000 the government took, it would give back $525,000. Carl and Amy would forfeit $109,000, with the rest of the sum eaten by court fees. Getting $525,000 back is certainly better than nothing, but losing about $367,000 can hardly be called a bargain.</span></p> <p><span>Serrano, Wilson, and the Nelsons all saw around two years go by before their forfeiture cases were resolved. But even that is not exhaustive. In 2013, police in Indiana seized Tyson Timbs' Land Rover after arresting him for selling drugs to undercover cops. His car—which he had purchased a few months prior for about $42,000—was not connected with drug money. He bought it with his father's life insurance payout.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps more importantly, Timbs, who has a history of drug addiction and relapsed after his dad died, turned his life around post-arrest. But law enforcement would still spend the next </span><i><span>eight years</span></i><span> fighting for the right to keep his car—a reminder that civil forfeiture has little to do with crippling crime and more to do with making the government richer.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Timbs' case provides a particularly vivid illustration of that motive. In the struggle to keep his Land Rover, the state of Indiana argued <a href="https://reason.com/2019/07/03/indiana-is-still-arguing-that-its-constitutional-to-seize-your-car-for-driving-5-mph-over-the-speed-limit/">multiple times</a> that it should be able to take ownership of someone's car for going five mph over the speed limit. That is not parody, although when the solicitor general <a href="https://reason.com/2018/11/28/breyer-destroyed-civil-asset-forfeiture/">made that argument</a> in 2018 in front of the Supreme Court, it was reportedly met with laughter from some of the justices.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The state also submitted that law enforcement should be able to <a href="https://reason.com/2021/02/05/civil-asset-forfeiture-indiana-supreme-court-tyson-timbs/">seize everything you own</a> if you're suspected of committing a drug offense; that there should be no proportionality. The Indiana Supreme Court <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/10/indiana-said-the-government-should-be-able-to-take-everything-you-own-if-you-commit-a-drug-crime-the-state-supreme-court-wasnt-having-it/">rejected</a> that in 2021.</span></p> <p><span>Many people, however, do not have the time and financial resources to fight their cases for months or years on end as they hope for, say, a hearing—which is evident in the billions of dollars the government successfully pockets each year via civil forfeiture. And if a victim is able to wade through the bureaucracy and finally get his or her day in court, it is not guaranteed they will be able to find representation.</span></p> <p><span>In April 2015, cops in Indiana </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/04/01/civil-asset-forfeiture-police-indiana-supreme-court-terry-abbott/"><span>seized</span></a><span> about $10,000 cash from Terry Abbott after he sold drugs to a confidential informant. A little more than three years passed, and in July 2018, the government moved for summary judgment in the case. Abbott intended to fight the seizure, but he had a problem: The government had taken his money, which he needed to pay an attorney.</span></p> <p><span>While defendants are constitutionally entitled to a lawyer in criminal proceedings, civil forfeiture is a civil proceeding, as its name suggests, and thus that constitutional protection no longer applies—despite that the practice is used when police suspect someone of a crime, and that its stated purpose is hamstringing criminal activity.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>So Abbott </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/04/01/civil-asset-forfeiture-police-indiana-supreme-court-terry-abbott/"><span>had to represent himself</span></a><span>. It's a quandary many civil forfeiture defendants confront. "If you can't afford to defend yourself, let alone feed yourself, it becomes complicated," Amy Nelson </span><a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/18/fbi-seized-almost-1-million-from-amy-sterner-carl-nelson-never-charged-them-with-a-crime/"><span>told me</span></a><span> last year, which captures just how coercive the forfeiture process is and how few options people have.</span></p> <p><span>But the first step is getting before a judge at all. When the Supreme Court hears </span><i><span>Culley</span></i><span> next term, they will consider the facts of two cases, both centered around innocent people whose cars were confiscated in Alabama. In one, police seized Halima Culley's vehicle after they arrested her son—who had borrowed the car—for marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia. In the other, cops took Lena Sutton's vehicle after she let a friend, who was found with methamphetamine, use it to run an errand. Sutton would go on to wait over a year before her car was returned; Culley was barred from reclaiming her property for 20 months.</span></p> <p><span>No matter the Court's ruling, the government will still have the upper hand in civil forfeiture proceedings. But the justices have an opportunity to blow over one of the many cards stacked against the people and to send the government a reminder: that due process is a right, not a privilege.</span></p>                        </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>I'm not looking to make a habit out of writing about the Terms of Service of companies; first, it was <a href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave</a>, then <a href="https://stackdiary.com/zoom-terms-now-allow-training-ai-on-user-content-with-no-opt-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoom</a>, and I could have written about Microsoft, but Mozilla has <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/microsoft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken care of that for me</a>. And then there is AWS, which <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opts you in by default</a> as opposed the other way around. It's all happening in real-time.</p>



<p>Now, as to why the X/Twitter new terms are interesting, it's actually pretty simple. Elon has taken a lot of radical steps to build a fortress around X, to make it as isolated as possible from the outside world (<em>cough, scrapers</em>), but now that he got <a href="https://stackdiary.com/xai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xAI going for him</a> - it only makes sense that he'd use X as a source of data that technically only he has access to (highly unlikely, bots still rummage the platform like the plague).</p>



<p>Wasn't Elon the one who said that <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft used Twitter's data illegally</a> and that he wanted to bring them <a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-microsoft-ai-training-data-dispute-musk-nadella-292fd9de9cc2623003fd1ce44897c912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to court</a>? It's funny how that works because now you're going to be working for Elon Musk, and he does not plan to pay you, and he certainly does not plan to ask for your permission to use your content this way.</p>

You can read the full terms here: <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/en/privacy</a> - Section 2.1</figcaption></figure>



<p>The part that interests me the most is that just recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1693756240260698550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon made a tweet</a> in which he said that:</p>



<p>If you’re a journalist who wants more freedom to write and a higher income, then publish directly on this platform!</p>



<p>But what he is really saying is, "Come and publish interesting information exclusively on X so that we can use it for our subsidiary companies and train our models on it!".</p>



<p>How unlikely is it that the endgame here is to merge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X Corp</a> together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xAI Corp</a> down the line? It even says on the <a href="http://x.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xAI</a> homepage:</p>



<p>We are a separate company from X Corp, but will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.</p>



<p>If Elon is committed to AI and the big bottleneck is going to be data quality and uniqueness, yeah - I don't think he's going to think twice about building a drip feed for xAI.</p>



<h3>What do the updated terms mean for you?</h3>



<p>Here's the kicker: based on these AI-assigned definitions in the updated terms, your access to certain content might be limited, or even cut off. You might not see certain tweets or hashtags. You might find it harder to get your own content seen by a broader audience. The idea isn't entirely new; we've heard stories of shadow banning on Twitter before. But the automation and AI involvement are making it more sophisticated and all-encompassing.</p>



<p>This shift isn't just about Twitter. Imagine this methodology expanding across the entire internet. Imagine if your "definitions," determined by AI, controlled not only what you could see on Twitter but also what search results appeared for you on Google, or which news stories showed up in your Facebook feed.</p>



<p>It's not that the internet has fewer pathways or offramps; it's just that you might not see them all. They are hidden or revealed based on your AI-defined identity. So while the internet remains vast and expansive, your individual experience of it could become very narrow, indeed.</p>



<p>What makes this change particularly eye-catching is that Elon Musk, who has had his say about Twitter in the past, once showed concern over third-party organizations using Twitter data to train their own AI systems. He argued that it wasn't ethical. Now, Twitter itself has decided to do just that. So, is it a case of 'do as I say, not as I do'? That's for you to decide.</p>



<p>In short, Twitter is no longer a universal experience but a personalized realm defined by AI algorithms. What we should really be asking ourselves is, are we okay with this AI-driven, highly customized yet restrictive internet experience? It's not a change confined to Twitter; it's a glimpse into what could be the new normal for the internet.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/tpm-luks-bypass">https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/tpm-luks-bypass</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37351685">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Using the vulnerability described in this advisory an attacker may take control of an encrypted Linux computer during the early boot process, manually unlock TPM-based disk encryption and either modify or read sensitive information stored on the computer’s disk. This blog post runs through how this vulnerability was identified and exploited - no tiny soldering required.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This is an exploration of a real security vulnerability we discovered and exploited while working with one of our clients. This vulnerability can be used to gain local root access to a TPM-protected Ubuntu 20.04 Linux computer if it uses RedHat’s <a href="https://github.com/latchset/clevis">Clevis</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut">dracut</a> software to implement unattended unlocking for LUKS full disk encryption. This configuration is desirable when a computer needs to have disk encryption but still allow remote reboots without having someone manually unlock it afterwards. Under normal circumstances, all an attacker who turns up at the encrypted computer would see is a login prompt with no way to gain direct access to the system.</p>
<p>When you turn on your encrypted Linux computer you probably have to enter two passwords before you can use it: first you have to enter the disk encryption password to unlock LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) and then you need to enter a user’s password to log in to the unlocked system. This is mildly annoying when the computer is in front of you but a genuine obstacle if you want to encrypt a server or an appliance device in a remote location where someone won’t be present to type in the password every time the computer reboots.</p>
<p>When we discovered this vulnerability, our client was developing an appliance that needed to operate in a potentially hostile environment and reboot periodically without user interaction. This article outlines one method an attacker might use to read the encrypted contents of the computer’s disk or sneakily modify them. This could allow you to steal secrets or plant a cool backdoor!</p>
<p>You might wonder how Microsoft manages to have disk encryption that allows Windows to start up partially and only then requires the user to enter their personal password once? The answer to this and unattended Linux encryption is <a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/TPM-sniffing">a Pulse Security favourite</a>: the TPM or Trusted Platform Module. This tiny, hardened computer inside the bigger computer can be used for a variety of tasks requiring a trusted third party - such as automatically supplying the password for an encrypted disk during startup. This requires the TPM to have some knowledge of how to decrypt or unlock the disk encryption password. Bus sniffing attacks are possible when a discrete TPM chip is used, but with firmware-based TPMs (also sometimes called fTPMs) this attack is not always possible. A solution that can be performed entirely in software is preferable and increases the exploitability of the attack.</p>
<h2 id="exploit">Exploit</h2>
<p>Generally, a Linux computer using TPM-protected unattended disk encryption will still allow a user to view the output of the boot process and optionally manually enter a decryption password with the keyboard. This allows for situations where the computer fails to boot and needs someone to troubleshoot the startup process. While the unattended TPM unlocking is taking place, the user is still presented with the password prompt and an opportunity to enter input.</p>
<p>Here’s a photo of a laptop running Ubuntu 20.04 waiting for someone to type in a disk decryption password:</p>
<p><a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/waiting.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/waiting.jpg" alt="A ThinkPad waits"></a></p>
<p>Faced with this, we should really perform some fuzzing to see if we can cause unexpected behaviour that might be useful. Successful fuzzing often involves supplying input to a program that the program doesn’t anticipate. In this case, the program is expecting us to provide input using the keyboard. This raises the question of what kinds of input might be unexpected in this situation.</p>
<p>In 2016 <a href="https://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2016-4484/CVE-2016-4484_cryptsetup_initrd_shell.html">a vulnerability was disclosed</a> in Debian’s cryptsetup startup script allowing an attacker to simply hold down the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key and gain root access to the early boot environment of an encrypted Debian computer. I wondered if something similar might still be possible in this scenario.</p>
<p>There’s a limited window of time before the TPM will unlock the disk and the boot process will proceed automatically to the login prompt, so how can we effectively fuzz this input opportunity? What if we could type faster than a human being?
Using an Atmel ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller (such as you’d find in an Arduino Leonardo development board) we can emulate a keyboard that sends virtual keypresses at essentially the maximum rate that the computer will accept. The following short Arduino program sets up a Leonardo as a keyboard emulator:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<code>#include "Keyboard.h"
void setup() {
delay(1000);
Keyboard.begin();
}
void loop() {
Keyboard.press(KEY_RETURN);
delay(10);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
delay(10);
}</code>
</td>
<td>
<a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/emulator.jpg"><img alt="Keyboard emulator labeled 'ENTER CANNON'" src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/emulator.jpg"></a>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>One second after being plugged in this program begins to simulate pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on a virtual keyboard every 10 milliseconds. This is about 10x faster than the usual keyboard repeat rate you’d get simply holding down a key, and Linux seems to recognise around 70 characters per second using this method, or one keypress approximately every 15 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Sending keypresses this fast quickly hits the maximum number of password entry retries, while keeping the system from unlocking the disk automatically due to password guess rate limiting, and systemd eventually gives up trying to unlock the disk. It takes a minute or two but the recovery action in this failure scenario is to give us a root shell in the early boot environment:</p>
<p><a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failing.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failing.jpg" alt="systemd says &quot;Failed to start Cryptography Setup&quot;"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failed.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/failed.jpg" alt="initrd sitting at a root shell"></a></p>
<p>From here it’s easy to manually use the TPM to unlock the disk with the Clevis tooling and mount the root volume for hacking (it takes a few tries sometimes, but it gets there in the end):</p>
<p><a href="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/gottem.jpg"><img src="https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/assets/images/releases/2023-08-25-luks-tpm/gottem.jpg" alt="systemd says &quot;Unlocking the disk and mounting the root filesystem&quot;"></a>
 </p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?</h2>
<p>dracut relies on systemd to unlock LUKS-encrypted disks in the early boot environment. An <a href="https://systemd.io/PASSWORD_AGENTS/">“agent” plugin architecture</a> is used by systemd for disk encryption where a request for a system-wide password can be answered by a pool of different responders, including a script automatically supplying a password and the usual method of just “asking the user”. Clevis implements a systemd password agent for unlocking, but the user may also enter a password using the normal interactive agent. Both of these agents are responding to the same request issued by systemd.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this case exposing a password prompt to the user gives us an attack surface to influence the behaviour of the early boot process.</p>

<p>It’s a little bit unclear whose fault this problem is exactly, it sits at an unfortunate intersection of a number of different design decisions and implementations. I did find that you can sometimes exploit this issue if you mash the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key really fast yourself too, so a keyboard emulator isn’t necessarily required either.</p>
<p>The simplest way to address the most immediate problem: Add <code>rd.shell=0</code> and <code>rd.emergency=reboot</code> to the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html">kernel command line</a>. This ensures that if anything fails during the early boot process the computer will reboot immediately rather than dropping into a root shell.</p>
<p>There are some wider questions to consider here but they’re a lot harder to fix. In an ideal world any deviance from the expected execution flow during early boot would result in the TPM refusing to unlock the disk. While PCR extension in TPMs is good for checking if certain specific things did or didn’t happen, and that general platform configuration matches expectations, it isn’t a great defence against the computer just doing something else entirely that doesn’t interact with the TPM. In this case the TPM has no way to know that the early boot environment has dropped to a shell and can’t tell the difference between the boot script asking for the disk unlock secret and an attacker with their hands on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Microsoft avoids some of this problem by unlocking the disk encryption key very early in the boot process and immediately extending PCR11, meaning that by the time a user gets any kind of interactive access to the computer they can no longer do their own unlock.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Physical access to a computer is still hard to secure. There are a surprising number of edge cases that must be navigated to successfully use boot-time TPM PCR measurement for unlocking secure unattended disk encryption. And don’t forget - always fuzz the user input, even if it’s just a keyboard.</p>

<p><a href="https://nostr-resources.com/">Nostr</a> – the simple, decentralized messaging protocol with the potential to replace (and even integrate with) centralized apps like Twitter and WhatsApp – is going mainstream. And fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve never seen anything quite like it. From December 13th to January 10th, the number of public key identities interacting with Nostr jumped from ~700 to ~250,000 👀 Yes, you read that right, the number of identities increased &gt;30,000% 😯 And even if you only count individual users as identities with profiles in their bio, which is probably a more reliable indicator, user count still jumped &gt;100x!</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v7Jw7jmF48OhNs2d7ADGE892ZIsWX77Q6JZAPK6cGZMStiVIuENu0_7O0v48JI7afXWsg8iG_gRzem2Vk5fr-N02fxFkvwIK-F315HCTk5IeICIhWTlfhPlln2oTscBLbGuIdtL6-aUQqoJf4_TdlsvxqAYHUedChP5SqdcWZ8az5zJKx_llBUgB4QsG8w" alt=""><figcaption>Stats courtesy of <a href="http://nostr.band/stats.html">nostr.band/stats.html</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The proximate cause of this recent explosion in usage was a Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1603945963944480768">tweet</a> and Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1604548665196138499">ban</a> (nothing buys publicity like prohibition).&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But I believe this rapid uptake has much deeper roots which are destined to blossom into a new mainstream protocol that’s as widely adopted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> for the web or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a> for email, an analogy which DK paints nicely <a href="https://www.curiousdk.com/p/decentralized-social-media-just-had">here</a>.</p>



<p>The reasons are 2-fold:</p>



<ol>
<li>Trust in <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/user-trust-social-platforms-falling-according-our-new-study">social media</a> platforms (and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx">institutions</a> more broadly) is at all time lows. People are increasingly aware of the value of free speech and dangers of letting any centralized platform decide what is and is not acceptable to say</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>Nostr has the perfect mix of ingredients to maximize rate of innovation: it’s open/permissionless, incredibly simple/flexible, and has a clear path to evolve</li>
</ol>



<p>I won’t belabor the first point – the controversy over censorship on social media platforms is a well documented <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/09/social-media-content-moderation/">crux of the culture wars</a>. But the second point is very important. I believe that open and permissionless systems inevitably win over closed competitors because open systems can marshal the collective resources of many more contributors than any individual business can employ. This is the central reason why our Internet continues to run on open standards (TCP/IP/HTTP), why Wikipedia and Linux dominate in their respective domains, and why the growth rate of open source software continues to <a href="https://www.coss.community/cossc/open-source-is-eating-software-faster-than-software-is-eating-the-world-3b01">outpace</a> that of its closed counterparts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But being open as a protocol is not necessarily enough. Many have raised the compelling counterpoint that open source protocols eventually ossify, allowing for closed platforms to innovate even faster on top (see <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">here</a> and <a href="https://mignano.co/2022/07/13/the-standards-innovation-paradox/">here</a>). But I don’t see that as much of an issue with Nostr because: A) it’s one of the simplest protocol specs ever – the only object type is a <a href="https://twitter.com/pourteaux/status/1605577543087558656?s=20&amp;t=OuOs0ty3jVH1lGsMO5uuuQ">JSON blob with 7 fields</a>. That simplicity leads to incredible flexibility, allowing for the design of all kinds of interoperable apps on top. B) Nostr has a clear path to evolve and improve via <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips">Nostr Improvement Possibilities (NIPs)</a>. <a href="https://fountain.fm/">Fountain</a> founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/merryoscar">Oscar Merry</a>, stressed to me the importance of having a clear path forward for protocol change by noting all of the <a href="https://podcastindex.org/stats">recent activity</a> we’ve seen around RSS for podcasting since <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcurry?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Adam Curry</a> and friends launched <a href="http://podcastindex.org/">podcastindex.org</a> + <a href="https://origin.fm/blog/podcasting-2point0/">podcasting 2.0</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’re watching all of this theory play out in real time. Just look at how much got done across the Nostr ecosystem in a single day 🤯</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ey1LczjogQu_X73a-4DCa_T7MM4BR4D2229fXoy1cb8O8nfXvtk1-8FYpvNERtXIF51abvtc0xXW_5aKR6UfBOlAnN6nrYPsLlejuIS3VImwxq5vYZdTvu8PfDYM7DsRyonocnNv2H0B7aybjTke5xuQXKsAv-gYxHG-3QVpOaJu2Vd3I44rQk1JUOlsqw" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://nostr.band/">nostr.band</a> Nostr search engine</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s more, all of this recent Nostr growth came while <a href="http://damus.io/">Damus</a>, arguably the most well-known and polished Nostr iOS app, had to hard cap at 10k users (the limit for TestFlight) while waiting for Apple’s App Store to approve its official release. That limitation has, apparently, not done much to slow growth. Instead users are creating their Nostr identities with other apps like <a href="http://getalby.com/">Alby</a>, a browser extension for bitcoin lightning payments that also supports Nostr, and then interacting with Nostr through emerging web clients like <a href="http://astral.ninja/">astral.ninja</a>, <a href="http://iris.to/">iris.to</a>, <a href="http://nostr.rocks/">nostr.rocks</a>, <a href="https://notes.blockcore.net/">blockcore notes</a>, and <a href="https://branle.netlify.app/">branle</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Again, the killer feature here is that ALL of these apps are open and interoperable. I was able to successfully port my identity and social graph from Damus to Alby and then access each of the web clients above.</strong> Many have <a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger/status/1518684477052096515?s=20&amp;t=m8f3FHeCqU72HUGvzqOhPw">dreamed</a> of Twitter enabling this sort of functionality by re-opening its API as it did in its earliest days. But while Twitter is a centralized company with an advertising driven revenue model, Nostr is a neutral protocol whose data stream will NEVER be shut to developers, because it CANNOT be shut to developers. Only individual clients and relays can restrict data. But then new ones will inevitably rise to augment and/or take their place. In fact, I would not be at all surprised to see Twitter itself become a major Nostr client in the coming year.</p>



<p>This is all incredible for building a more free and open world, which is ultimately the mission. But this new, open network also excites the investor in me. That’s because I believe that as Nostr emerges as the open standard for messaging, it will develop symbiotically with the open standards for money (bitcoin) and payments (Lightning Network). Together these three open systems will combine to create the first ever <a href="https://value4value.info/">Value4Value</a> protocol stack (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenjhall/status/1605729184122146816">Stephen Hall</a>), where service providers must continue to innovate and provide real value or else their users will exit for better options. This dynamic will enable a myriad of interesting, venture scale business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://value4value.info/">Value4Value</a> is a simple but revolutionary concept: people who create valuable content or services should be remunerated appropriately by those who derive value. For a beautiful vision of how a Value4Value world could look, check out this recent <a href="https://dergigi.com/2022/12/18/a-vision-for-a-value-enabled-web/">essay</a> from Gigi. One of the essay’s central claims is that most of the ills of our modern attention/outrage economy stem not from some fundamental human evil, but rather from inadequate technology and broken incentives. The core culprit is credit based money, which unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearer_instrument">bearer instrument</a> cash carries counterparty risk. This counterparty risk has prevented the use of small micropayments and/or necessitated the collection of customer identity. Put another way, people must currently pay for value online either in batches (subscriptions) or with a proxy currency (attention).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with the <a href="https://hivemind.vc/why-lightning-why-now/">Lightning Network</a>, anyone can send nearly free and instant payments globally with a bearer instrument – denominations of bitcoin (satoshis) – worth as little as a fraction of a penny. What’s more, this system is open to all 8B people alive, independent of where they live, whether or not they have a government identity, and how much money or credit they have. This is a brand new construct which I believe will completely rewire all Internet commerce (and ultimately grow it orders of magnitude by on-boarding billions of new users and use cases).</p>



<p>So how do Nostr, Bitcoin, and the Lightning Network fit together to build this future? And what sorts of business opportunities will these integrations yield? Well for starters, let’s be clear, it’s not that Nostr MUST use Bitcoin and Lightning. They’re completely independent protocols. But the fit is simply too natural not to emerge. And because both the <a href="https://twitter.com/fiatjaf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">creator</a> and many early developers of Nostr are also open source Lightning Network developers, the likelihood of this marriage seems inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe there will be multiple initial use cases for integrating Nostr and Lightning, each of which will create new business models (either standalone or partially bundled). I think they’ll loosely follow along the four axes that Nostr is currently unbundling from centralized apps like Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/macieklaskus">Maciek</a> did an excellent job of <a href="https://twitter.com/macieklaskus/status/1606977470124752896">outlining this unbundling</a>:</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/macieklaskus/status/1606978675693572096"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ya8JkrWaRpp97r8yvzGor3NHUzX0pofRD_p0XOjYwUdbQ1cgD7EvvTbg7mW5Nm3-MeiSRZVtXvrdzX5eqaUupu5qUD0dAef9P2ipLLG9vbq_93is4yVRILsBpHeIh1WOkv-ttjPymwlJHF8hO4qWYNK0N_NrzKMBjGUI_tAhRmkJG39VuTqBAhGJu3mIKA" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>I’ll rephrase these dimensions as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Relays &amp; Resources&nbsp;</li>



<li>Identity</li>



<li>Clients &amp; Apps&nbsp;</li>



<li>Search &amp; Discovery&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s examine each layer and its potential business models:</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Relays &amp; Resources</em></li>
</ol>



<p>First, perhaps the most obvious opportunity is on the server/resource side. Today, <a href="http://nostr.watch/relays/find">dozens</a> of individuals and organizations are running Nostr relays simply to support the cause. But as the number of users grows 3-4 orders of magnitude and support is added for richer data like images and video, it will quickly become prohibitively expensive to run these relays altruistically. I expect to soon see premium relays that charge per KB written or read. There’s already at least one <a href="https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/1610765009692545024">credible proposal</a> to do just that by hooking up Nostr relays with LSATs (Lightning based pseudonymous token identities). I also expect to see <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-caching/">caching services</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery networks</a> emerge to help users filter the global firehose of information based upon their own preferences and to ensure fast and reliable connection. Eventually I expect to see other resources like bandwidth and compute metered and billed for in similar fashion.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2">
<li><em>Identity&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Second, we’re already starting to see multiple services emerge to validate a user’s identity. <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md">NIP 05</a> establishes a standard for web servers to validate that the holder of a Nostr public key also has (or has purchased) access to that web server. <a href="https://nostrplebs.com/">Nostrplebs</a> is one of the leading early services that charges for identification exclusively in satoshis over the Lightning Network. <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxAWebster/status/1610753954882945024">Alby</a> and <a href="https://stacker.news/items/118706">Stacker News</a> have both launched free NIP 05 verification associated with their users’ Lightning Address (a human readable address to receive Lightning payments). <a href="http://lnbits.com/">LNbits</a> <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/main/lnbits/extensions/nostrnip5">released</a> open source software that allows anyone to verify Nostr identities at a domain they control. Still others like <a href="https://twitter.com/pourteaux">@porteaux</a> are proposing ideas to use the Bitcoin blockchain itself as the namespace. </p>



<p>I believe this idea could integrate with <a href="https://twitter.com/namcios/status/1535302090360250368?s=20&amp;t=CXKT4zbh4Op9cxu-lt-_Gg">Block’s vision for Web 5</a>, which to the best of my understanding, also anchors <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/dids-built-on-bitcoin-fix-the-web">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> into the Bitcoin blockchain. It’s early, but I expect to see a variety of services and features emerge here.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3">
<li><em>Clients &amp; Apps&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Third, clients could charge users directly, though I expect many will actually monetize via their relay or some ancillary service. One feasible model could be giving away a consumer version of the app for free and then charging for an enterprise version with additional features (think enterprise Slack or Discord) as <a href="https://twitter.com/jb55?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">jb55</a> <a href="https://www.podpage.com/citadeldispatch/cd63-building-nostr-a-censorship-resistant-alternative-to-twitter-with-fiatjaf-jb55-and-mrkukks/">mentioned</a> as a possible direction for Damus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clients could also likely take a small cut for coordinating payments that flow through their app to resource providers (e.g. paid relays), service providers, or other users.&nbsp; And there’s always the option that some clients introduce <a href="https://stacker.news/items/121253">various forms of advertising</a>.</p>



<p>And while most people are still thinking about clients in the social media context, I expect to see many more custom apps (with potentially unique business models) built with Nostr and Value4Value assumptions baked in.&nbsp; As Jack laid out nicely in this <a href="https://fountain.fm/episode/12616447623">podcast</a>, the future of Nostr is likely a Cambrian explosion of microapps, each focused on a specific niche or use case. But that can all communicate interoperably. Like him, I’m particularly excited about specialized services that help creators fund and distribute their work. I expect to see several companies move quickly in this direction – e.g. <a href="http://fountain.fm/">Fountain</a> for podcasts, <a href="https://wavlake.com/">Wavlake</a> for music, and <a href="https://geyser.fund/">Geyser</a> for generalized crowdfunding. I also expect to see a lot of experimentation in how open source software gets developed. <a href="https://twitter.com/NostrDirectory">Nostrdirectory</a> proposed the interesting idea of a bounty poll app where users vote with their satoshis for what a dev builds next. This could lead to a cool Github + Trello + Upwork type mashup.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/44j3ZLNU5AwuU2q-5xgd8bnKXGkNuL_B_IGSj3kpE6SWBVi2rrQUvnrNq1fT_NhPBsCc8nGSGf1ThGRAmkZav9fkWStk53iiLdyaEZNBSLFjPD7sr54BxubADpiHga1YwaIYdzGZ7nLL1TdCWhZZTd4Dvk_9A9W4ZagNhh11D4da3SBHP1WEkRwLd6Zhow" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://nostr.band/">nostr.band</a> Nostr search engine</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps we’ll even see the emergence of a new decentralized Nostr/Lighting marketplace like a modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBazaar">OpenBazaar</a>, an early protocol for p2p commerce <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2015/06/introducing-ob1/">backed by USV</a>, which was a great idea, but just too early in my opinion. Their key mistakes were requiring everyone to run a dense desktop app + node and using mainchain Bitcoin for payments. Nostr + Lightning solve these problems by allowing anyone to access the marketplace via light web or mobile clients with instant Lightning Network payments. My early money here is on <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/Diagon-Alley">Diagon Alley</a> (from <a href="https://stacker.news/items/120388">LNbits</a>), which was itself an early inspiration for the creation of the Nostr protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XHMnGvQPfU0Rcfmg8l_fdHChQ_htNKjCbTPy-spwHA18VPtHRsC8b5t0iH-li6nD0LIZto9VURRGXD_9QzGmqI3sdSHL_UrRZr8FOziqPkdKqHBGSNI37POyi7FW9_YnMYdsXPP0eaCUrcozkD2a-gYbWKANZiDSWEs0KdY8QGm0p4uF-wKWd2ZID3FCRg" alt=""></figure>







<p>LNbits founder <a href="https://twitter.com/arcbtc">Ben Arc</a> has also published ideas for other types of Nostr + Lightning marketplaces as well, including a <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr/issues/21">decentralized Uber</a>. Perhaps one day all marketplaces will be coordinated trustlessly via Nostr.</p>



<p>In addition to microapps flourishing, we may also see the emergence of new super apps like a decentralized WeChat for users who prefer to combine all of their messaging and commerce in one place. Imagine if CashApp becomes your primary messaging app (or WhatsApp your primary payments app). I could easily see a world where remittances are sent with a text message and goods sold via a Tweet.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4">
<li><em>Search &amp; Discovery</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Fourth, just as with web 1.0 and 2.0, I believe that the biggest winners will emerge in search &amp; discovery. My best bet is that we’ll see Nostr search engines that differentiate by indexing the most data and providing the best social graph &amp; ValueRank market signal, an idea which I fleshed out in <a href="https://hivemind.vc/howtodisruptgoogle/"><em>How to Disrupt Google</em></a>. TL;DR: for the first time in history, we can now associate information with value. As the amount of information goes infinite, only the amount of bitcoin (value) remains scarce. Attaching this value to information will help surface the highest quality information (in association with other attributes like the identity of who pledged that value).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before playing with Nostr, I believed that the best way to create this new value-based search engine was by either dropping satoshis on top of the current web (via tips from a browser extension like <a href="http://getalby.com/">Alby</a>) or by creating a brand new value-native knowledge marketplace like <a href="http://stacker.news/">StackerNews</a>. I now think that perhaps the best way to build this search engine is on top of Nostr, a blue ocean of quality content that Google and other centralized web companies will likely not index for some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to build this vision, we need two key primitives: A) identity and B) value associated with individual Nostr posts (perhaps via tips like people are already giving on StackerNews or in Fountain). Put another way, we need an open social graph and open value graph. Every Nostr post already contains identity metadata (the poster’s public key). And the integration between posts and value is emerging quickly! jb55&nbsp;has already published his plan to do this for Damus. He’s also going to propose it as a new <a href="https://github.com/lnurl">LNURL</a> spec and/or NIP as well.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/phW8XqTUgm971POhaJYfgN_RaOrRpgQ_kZMP0SKR8yCxXihV7i9qfYsDQ2nnKgtrVdBWqMi1OjbS14Z7CVA9KeaxJGAGiQRtd6WNKBkZflFyvVQjspPmoS2xAjNjiLsd9InHWElLoMAMatFVCTadRIu8yYEvFfOup_DS6su2y_xgeYOKPDCeYRt-p0BJcg" alt="" width="620" height="426"><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://nostr.rocks/">nostr.rocks</a> Nostr client&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>And <a href="http://astral.ninja/">astral.ninja</a> has already shipped this feature! Here’s a <a href="https://share.cleanshot.com/7TzYCKg0">screencast</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/Bumi">Bumi</a> instantly tipping <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">NVK</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jack?lang=en">Jack</a>. And here’s a screenshot of me tipping 100 satoshis to a Nostr post by GPT-3 Bot, a chatbot interface to Open AI’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aAWBxlM_CDymLJqfKcSlXLlubBoJeVDg9b8pVHA3zsL3Bj2KV0UBtwe224oznFESFq1XVcQkNy6LzP54gJPeM-NfUYjU1gOHOnMIr9wxCVx1V5BXrSQe3FnjZ-Nzq-WmiG8jTaSBFYsoDk7arjTuKQAIX5P98_h3oyo0WWuhD3b0WRvN-N5dNSJoAfAn9A" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot from <a href="http://astral.ninja/">astral.ninja</a> Nostr client&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>(<em>I kept the tip-selector interface for this screenshot. The experience is even more seamless when I turn on auto-tipping in astral.ninja and set an automatic budget on Alby</em>)</p>



<p>If your mind wasn’t blown already, let me clarify: I just sent a micropayment via an open twitter-like client to a bot interface for GPT-3 🤯 What other financial system can bank the AIs? 😉</p>



<p>The search engine that can best index and rank these new Nostr posts and their associated value will be in an incredible position to build the next Google. <a href="https://twitter.com/ArturBrugeman">Artur</a> has a similar idea, as his 2 sites – <a href="https://realsearch.cc/">realsearch</a> and <a href="https://nostr.band/">nostr.band</a> – are playing with each of these ideas. I expect that he’ll merge them at some point. His Nostr search engine is already particularly good – I used it multiple times to find specific Nostr posts while writing this article. I expect to see (and fund) several more approaches here and will likely expand my thinking on this idea in future posts. </p>



<p>Ultimately, I’m still open minded about how each of these layer &amp; businesses will develop and whether they’ll do so as independent entities or get rebundled either partially or fully. My best bet is that we’ll see some early winners that merely re-create existing services and business models. But the really big winners will come in the second wave once evolution plays its course and mashes up communication and commerce in truly novel ways that no one yet expects. New medium, new message (<a href="https://fountain.fm/episode/12616447623">h/t NVK</a>). And to hammer home the point – <strong>the real magic is that all of these apps, no matter their specific focus, will speak openly and interoperably.</strong> It sure feels like we’re getting close to building a global <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/hivemind_vc">hivemind</a> of communication and commerce 😉&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with each passing day, I’m becoming increasingly convinced that this rapidly developing ecosystem is what will bring Bitcoin and the Lightning Network mainstream. Many are already <a href="https://stacker.news/items/120480">speculating that the recent surge</a> in Wallet of Satoshi Lightning payments may be directly attributable to Nostr usage. Just wait until Damus integrates tipping and gets approved by the app store…</p>



<p>I recognize that all of this is still very early and that these claims are bold. But my spidey sense says that this is not a drill. I’ve seen enough early adoption and understand enough of the potential to believe that Nostr + Bitcoin + Lightning represents the most interesting opportunity to rebuild a decentralized Internet. And I’m planning to go all in on this thesis with Hivemind Fund 2 (just as I did on the Lightning Network with Hivemind Fund I). If you’re a hacker experimenting with Nostr, <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxAWebster">please reach out</a>. This is my top priority.</p>

Senior Software Engineering polyglot. My depth of knowledge comes from understanding larger context rather than knowing every detail of a particular technology, language, or framework.<p>I like a team that doesn’t mind sharing knowledge, and admitting that none of us are perfectly knowledgeable about any of this software business. If you can’t admit a mistake, or want to horde knowledge, then you you have some growing to do.</p><p>Knowledge sharing also applies to The Business side of a company - please freely explain the acronym of the week and offer to go deeper with the software creators that show interest.

Dear climate-tech/green-tech recruiters and engineering leads,<p>I know you're out there. I can sense you, lurking behind a pile of processed resumes and cradling your reusable coffee cup like a talisman warding against ChatGPT cover letters. You're searching for that unicorn, the 10x engineer motivated by saving the planet who also rocks human skills that would make Brené Brown sit up and take notice.</p><p>I... am not that unicorn. More of a walrus, really, with wombat-like characteristics? But I did recently get restructured out of a role in climate-tech before I was done saving the world. I want more. I've got solid technical chops in platform engineering, Linux, AWS, Docker, all that good stuff. I'm an actual human who can talk (and listen) to people while only staring at my shoes approximately 35% of the time.</p><p>I work remotely from New Zealand, where green is practically a brand. We have tax treaties so you can pay me from everywhere, and our timezone dovetails nicely with many popular tech hubs including the Western US, Oceania, and Asia.</p><p>I make dev teams better. Add me to yours. There's a bit of a problem with CO2 we need to fix.</p><p>Cheers,
Rich.

From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users.

I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty.</p><p>I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other techo-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line!

I'm looking for a position that will allow me to use more of my technical knowledge and grow beyond personal projects and FOSS contributing. I'm fast-learning, thorough and have solid soft-skills. In code I value simplicity, efficiency and documentation. Besides being into programming since I first laid my hands on a PC, I have years of professional experience as sound engineer and graphic designer under my belt. Standing between the worlds of technology and humanities, I'm the one to bridge the gap.<p>As my latest occupations aren't formally technical, I have realistic expectations regarding my potential role.

At home, I've built up a small collection of projects and services depending on need and interest - TrueNAS, an OpenWRT-flashed router for network-wide adblock, and a small troupe of Raspberry Pi's with RTL-SDR for decoding ADS-B. I'm currently mucking with earthly.dev to automate building Arch Linux ARM images and sniffing the traffic from our home SMART meter.<p>I'm physically disabled, so remote or one day a week onsite is critical, but occasional travel with plenty of notice is fine. I'm looking to work with/for someone who values people over KPI's. Ideally your incentives are aligned with building the best product/service possible for the end user and we're doing some good for the world. If you want someone to come in and invest time and effort improving developer quality of life, I also love finding and fixing little annoyances.

I'm an experienced DevOps / SRE / Infrastructure engineer who has focused mostly on startups who need to level up their infrastructure capabilites (e.g. migrating from Heroku to AWS).<p>As such, I've had my fingers in a lot of pies over the course of my career, doing what needs to be done to automate infrastructure and turn it into a commodity while preventing it from becoming a black box. I believe that crafting appropriately leveled documentation is a key to keeping the walls down between infrastructure and application engineering. I love teaching others my craft while continuing to acquire new skills.</p><p>I am willing to consider equity in partial exchange for base compensation for the right opportunity at a small startup. I also have the ability to hire at least one more to build a team if desired.

Hi all,<p>For the last 1.5 years I have been working at a unicorn enterprise SaaS company as a SRE where I:</p><p>- built internal applications/tooling and APIs in Python and JavaScript</p><p>- wrote multi-environment deployment CI/CD pipelines for Gitlab which are fast, easy to maintain, and effective</p><p>- deployed our AWS infrastructure as code using Terraform, including advanced multi-account architectures using AFT</p><p>- created terraform modules and templates that developers love to use in a self-service capacity and which make their lives easier</p><p>Aside from DevOps/SRE type work, I am comfortable developing software and I am capable of running a project end-to-end, from collecting and parsing vague business requirements, to architecting and implementing a solution.</p><p>I've previously done freelance contract work building web applications.</p><p>Thanks for reading, I'd be happy to chat more about my skills and background.

My name is Joe. I am a software engineer. I build my own software, Awayto, which you can currently demo at <a href="https://awayto.store/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://awayto.store</a> to see my output. The demo features a communications platform, similar to what you would expect if you were running an online writing center. There is RBAC, scheduling &amp; online appointments, voice/video calling, shared whiteboard/document marking, and more. However, the system is built in a generic fashion where features can be added or removed on a whim, leading to a pivotable system for whatever business you're creating.<p>I'm interested in working with businesses with the above feature set interests, educational groups, community services, and so on. The software is fully open source and runs bare metal or (currently) on hetzner. As a freelancer I am looking for work on projects of similar scope, as well as implement Awayto for your own purposes, should you need.</p><p>I've been developing for 25 years and am of course open to other projects as well. And I look forward to hearing what ideas you have, and your needs.</p><p>Please contact me at joe \at\ keybittech.com for any inquiries, and check my profile for more info and links to my work.

I am a software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, more than 10 years of experience and 10 professional certifications earned after a lot of study and hard work.<p>You can see several technologies in the above list but I personally prefer to work with anything related to the Rust Programming Language. Backend? Blockchain? Compilers? DevOps? Embedded? Mobile? I am totally onboard as long as you have a little bit of Rust involved.</p><p>For more information, take a look at my CV (<a href="https://c410-f3r.github.io/curriculum.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://c410-f3r.github.io/curriculum.pdf</a>) or my GitHub account (<a href="https://github.com/c410-f3r">https://github.com/c410-f3r</a>).

I spent much of my year and half there on a small team working to improve the existing legacy Angular 1.x dashboard application by improving design responsiveness, introducing TypeScript, migrating components to React, and services to Axios/Redux.

I enjoy iterative processes, lean development lifecycles, learning new codebases, and experimenting with developer tooling and build systems that reduce the latency in feedback loops, like Vite.

Hi, I’m Ryan. I’m a senior software engineer with about a decade of industry experience over a diverse array of languages and technologies. My areas of interest include machine learning, optimization, and complex systems architecture. I particularly enjoy working with functional languages and am always interested in opportunities to solve difficult problems and really push my boundaries.<p>I’m also passionate about building healthy, functional teams who can focus on building the right things quickly.</p><p>I’m self-taught and my degree is in philosophy, which I like to think honed my ability to distill complex requirements into simple concepts and to communicate well with technical and non-technical folk alike.</p><p>I like to unwind by indulging in my hobbies of hand-tool woodworking or music production. It’s another way I enjoy solving problems, albeit in a very different context. Always looking to learn and grow, so I relish the idea of being the least experienced person in the room - it means I’m in the right place :)

A number of my colleagues and I are thinking of leaving the software development agency we work for. To be clear, this is an opportunity to hire a team, not individuals.<p>We're an experienced technical team, with lots of client-facing experience which means we're good at delivering value for money without compromising code quality, and we have experience delivering highly scalable systems. We've all worked in many tech stacks and domains - part of agency life is being able to deliver idiomatic code in a language you've never worked in before in a matter of weeks, not months. You name it, we've done it - whether that's C#, Kotlin, React, Python, SQL Server, or something else entirely. Lots of cloud experience as well, especially (but not exclusively) AWS.</p><p>If this is even potentially interesting to you, please get in touch. We're very open to initial conversations of any kind.

Here's the lowdown:</p><p><a href="https://www.kindbuds.ai/ght/spence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.kindbuds.ai/ght/spence</a></p><p>* Input: Provide Spence with your current resume.</p><p>* Target: Share a job listing you're interested in.</p><p>* Output: Spence analyzes the job description, then refines your resume and crafts a cover letter, making sure both align closely with the job's requirements.</p><p>The main idea? Too many resumes get lost in automated systems or aren't tailored enough for the specific job. Spence helps bridge that gap by ensuring your documents are as relevant as possible to the position you're applying for.</p><p>Keen to hear your feedback, and if anyone's up for testing, I'm all ears.  I'm also for hire.

I'm coming off a 2 year sabbatical and looking for cool projects (C++ is a bonus.) I've worked on some very impactful stuff: I have contributed to the JavaScript language standard (TC39 committee) when working on the Chakra Javascript Engine. I owned the distributed build client (Goma fork) of the newest Chromium-based Edge browser, servicing over 500 devs. I was a consultant for specialized DevOps for top Azure customers, including implementing MLOps and GitOps. I have written MSDN documentation and samples, and conducted internal and external training. I'm an Australian citizen with a green card, friendly and easy to work with.

Our team of 4 built integrations with PostgreSQL and MongoDB and with user-provided JavaScript code and implemented detailed metrics and error logging for active workflows. To learn more, visit us at www.otto-etl.com.</p><p>Some other personal/creative projects can be found on my GitHub.

I'm a Software Engineer of ~6 years with a focus on Front-End Development, but moving towards Full-Stack in my day-to-day work. I’m passionate about delivering quality user experiences both on the UI and API level. I’m interested in fine tuning performance, and making sure that the development experience is just as great in my teams, as the user’s.
My main interests are healthcare products, and developer tooling / any tools that could be used during the development process. (Ex.: Task boards, CI, Design tools, and many more!). Open hearing any offers though. I have experience working with teams from early stage startups through companies collaborating between time zones, with large engineering teams.
Send me a message if you think I could be a good addition to your team!</span></p></div></td></tr>

Hello! I'm Ricardo, a self-taught Full-stack Engineer with a strong emphasis on backend development. Beyond my technical prowess in Javascript/Typescript, PHP 8, Flutter, SQL, Docker, and more, I complement my web development skills with prior experience in administration and financial analysis.<p>For over a decade, I've dedicated myself to the same company, managing the complete life cycle of numerous projects from inception to deployment, consistently ensuring optimal performance and user experience. Working solo has given me a broad perspective, but I'm now keen to join a team where I can focus on a specific role. Collaborating with and learning from others will undoubtedly fast-track my professional growth.</p><p>I look forward to leveraging both my technical and analytical skills in new, challenging projects. It's also important for me to state my principles. I'm not inclined to engage in industries that harm the environment, jeopardize people's health, or are ethically dubious, such as gambling or casinos. I am committed to making positive contributions to the world through my work.

I keep the work associated with my online accounts private.</p><p>Email: Femme@Femmeandroid.com</p><p>- 8 years of professional development experience as a full stack developer.</p><p>- Most familiar (use most days): Python, FastAPI, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, MacOS, Docker, AWS (EC2, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, IAM), Git</p><p>- Familiar (Use most months): ElasticSearch, CloudSearch, Tailwind, Vue</p><p>- Hobbies (Used on at least one completed project over the past five years): Go, Zig, C, C++, Rust, Phoenix, NoSQL, MongoDB, (probably more, but these were the ones that came to mind.)</p><p>My day job has me performing two main functions:</p><p>- Building full stack web development systems.  I generally lean more towards writing backend code, and documenting our infrastructure. UI is my weakest area.  This role has me working in datasets with ~1 billion row tables, and search indexes with ~100 million documents.  Since we're a small company (~8 developers), I have been a major part of the architecture of our systems over the past 8 years.  We've got five separate core businesses that our dev team supports, and I've been a part of architecting and implementing all of them. I would prefer to focus more on backend development in a future role.</p><p>- Creating one-off scripts or processes to assist in business functions.  These tend to involve quickly reverse engineering undocumented web APIs we have permission to use, and querying them for our customers.  At their simplest, these are a mix of writing some SQL and a few HTTP requests.  At their most complicated, they have involved designing and implementing a tree structure to accurately model the business domain, and then pulling data about these structures from relevant public APIs.</p><p>- This month, I reduced the cost of a company's AWS CloudSearch spend by 80% (over 10k/month) by reviewing their codebase, doing some reasearch, and improving what they were storing and how they were doing so.  This required a one-line code change on the existing codebase, and writing a new, short (~500 line) indexer. Doing a deep dive into the single highest AWS line item was the impetus for the project, and frankly, it turned out far better than expected.</p><p>Outside of work, I run <a href="https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com</a>, a website I built and maintain.  It really will self-destruct, and it reaches ~100k users and handles ~13M requests each month.  Building tools and infrastructure to manage its moderation and keep it a positive community has been a huge learning experience.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/31/a_star_star_domains/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/31/a_star_star_domains/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37351628">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>If you fancy creating a blog or website to discuss the Arm architecture or the Softbank-owned outfit that develops it, keep the British CPU designer's name out of the domain name you choose – or draw the wrath of its lawyers.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> offers that advice after Maria Markstedter – a noted author, assembly language expert, and security researcher who's written extensively about Arm at the websites she operates – <a href="https://twitter.com/Fox0x01/status/1691774253014618222" rel="nofollow">received</a> a cease-and-desist demand from Arm's lawyers. Her offense? According to the letter she shared on Xitter, using the trademark "Arm" in the domain name <code>arm-assembly.com</code> that she used to promote a book she wrote about the ISA.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the letter went to the web host provider for her Arm-related websites, who passed it onto Markstedter to handle. The missive demanded that the website come down as it featured Arm's "Arm" trademark in the domain name.</p>

    

<p>"The website operated under the domain name arm-assembly.com ... is using Arm IPR in the domain name," the legal letter stated. "The domain name incorporates the famous Arm Ltd mark and suggests an association with the famous Arm Ltd brand and/or Arm Ltd sponsorship or endorsement of this website."</p>

        


        

<p>Yes, there is a need for trademark holders, like Arm, to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/trademarks/enforcement/">assert</a> their ownership and rights and protect their marks. Still, the order came as quite a shock to Markstedter, given her close relationship with the design house stretches back six years.</p>
<p>"I first thought this must've been a misunderstanding given my previous relationship with Arm," she told <em>The Register</em> last night.</p>

        

<p>"I wrote my thesis about Arm security features and exploit mitigations for Arm's internal use, [have] given internal presentations, keynoted their conference, advocated for them, visited them at their HQ in Cambridge – all without compensation because I wanted this to be a mutually beneficial relationship instead of a gig."</p>
<p>Markstedter, who runs the Arm programming training'n'tutorial outfit Azeria Labs, therefore asked Arm what all the fuss was about – only to meet radio silence. Then, on Monday, blogs and websites owned and operated by Markstedter were taken down by her hosting provider after it received another cease and desist letter. These websites included:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm-reversing.com</li>

<li>arm-exploitation.com</li>

<li>arm-basics.de</li>

<li>azeria-labs.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Markstedter told us the sites offered educational resources, courses on reverse-engineering Arm code, and promotions for her latest book.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://azeria-labs.com/">Azeria-Labs.com</a> was taken down despite not including "Arm" in its name – the cease and desist order Arm sent to Markstedter's hosting provider identified her sites by a single IP address they all shared, which led to the provider tearing down everything.</p>
<p>The labs dotcom, and its catalog of tutorials covering Arm assembly and exploit mitigation, is now back online.</p>

        

<p>"In order to get my site back ASAP, I yielded and transferred my domains to them, and Azeria Labs got unblocked," Markstedter told us.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/china_arm_tradewar/">Arm reveals just how vulnerable it is to trade war with China</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/29/arm_css_n2/">Need a datacenter processor? Try our take-and-bake Neoverse N2 cores, says Arm</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/21/arm_ipo_official/">It's official! Arm files for IPO on Nasdaq</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/10/arm_riscv_website/">Up in arms! Arm kills off its anti-RISC-V smear site after own staff revolt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This resolution did involve transferring ownership of four of the domains containing the offending "Arm" trademark to Arm.</p>
<p>"At the very least, I expected a simple heads-up or direct contact from them acknowledging the unfortunate necessity of their actions and asking for input on possible resolutions," Markstedter said.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At the very least, I expected a simple heads-up or direct contact from them acknowledging the unfortunate necessity of their actions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yet I have only been contacted by their lawyers, and despite bringing this matter to their attention, I have yet to receive an official email from Arm attempting to address and resolve the issue or apologize."</p>
<p>In the wake of the takedown, Markstedter <a href="https://twitter.com/Fox0x01/status/1696569707493552504" rel="nofollow">registered</a> leg-assembly.com to promote her book and plans to spin up additional body-part-related domains to provide additional resources on the Arm instruction set architectures.</p>
<p>"My disappointment with Arm's actions doesn't mean I've got any hard feelings towards the amazing folks working at Arm. They've been a huge support over the years, and I genuinely appreciate that," she emphasized. "The frustration is more about the decision-making from the higher-ups and legal teams that led to this domain issue."</p>
<h3>Litigate or lose it?</h3>
<p><em>The Register</em> asked Arm to comment on the cease-and-desist order, and its representatives told us it had nothing to say. Then as we were preparing to publish this article, the chip designer came back and said its actions were necessary to protect its Arm brand.</p>
<p>"We value the contributions that our developer and researcher community make to the Arm ecosystem and are committed to continuing to work with them as collaboratively and constructively as possible," a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"At the same time, we have a duty to protect the Arm brand, which has been built over more than 30 years. Like all companies with registered trademarks, Arm is legally obligated to ensure those trademarks are protected and used appropriately. We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved."</p>
<p>However, Markstedter told us that, apart from Arm's legal team, she hasn't received a single email from the firm itself that discusses finding a mutual solution. Markstedter said she had suggested Arm could donate her book to universities and persons who couldn't afford them, but had yet to receive any feedback on the proposal.</p>
<p>Arm's rush to snatch up domain names is somewhat ironic, considering that in 2018 the biz <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/10/arm_riscv_website/">create</a> the website <code>riscv-basics.com</code> and used it to host content smearing rival RISC-V architecture and list multiple reasons why Arm's tech is superior. Arm pulled the dot-com after an internal revolt by its staff, and the domain has since lapsed into someone else's hands.</p>
<p>Arm's takedown comes just a week after the Neoverse designer officially <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/21/arm_ipo_official/">filed</a> for an IPO on the US Nasdaq. In the filing, Arm disclosed numerous risk factors, including many related to its operations in China. However, we don't recall any mention of experts writing tutorials about its ISA as something Arm thinks investors need to worry about.</p>
<p>That said, it did warn: "We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and contractual protections ... to protect our IP rights.</p>
<p>"The steps we take to protect our IP rights may be inadequate."</p>
<p>Some may well agree with that. ®</p>

<p>I first became aware of Single Pair Ethernet when I was mindlessly browsing Sparkfun's new products announcements a while ago, but didn't jump in because I felt the real utility was the ability to power devices over the same cable.</p>
<p>More than a year later, Sparkfun's Single Pair Ethernet Design Challenge gave me the excuse to create the hardware I originally wanted, offering a power budget that can handle non-trivial hardware with data rates to match.</p>

<p>This write-up summarises my (successful) attempts at building a <em>Power over Data Line</em> (PoDL) compliant device and power supply as part of a one-month '<em>sink or swim</em>' approach to designing and testing new hardware, and getting to look at maturity of the 10Base-T1 ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'll quickly cover some PoDL basics, then walk through the critical design decisions and test process for a prototype underwater sensor node suitable for ocean research.</p>
<p>All project files and full schematics are <a href="https://github.com/Scottapotamas/spe-marine-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-single-pair-ethernet-interesting" is="h2">Why is Single Pair Ethernet interesting?</h2>
<p>Put simply, it's a step closer to what sounds like my ideal transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports reasonably high data rates (for microcontrollers) at ~10 Mbps,</li>
<li>Adds the ability to provide reasonable amounts of power with up to 50W,</li>
<li>Has the ability to integrate easily with existing networking stacks,</li>
<li>and doesn't over-complicate wiring.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, Single Pair Ethernet supports long range &gt;1km cable runs which exceed typical Ethernet specifications, and does so while aiming for far lower power consumption.</p>
<p>Off to the side, 10Base-T1S has similar goals but is built around a multi-drop half-duplex wiring configuration for shorter distance networks.</p>
<h2 id="power-over-data-lines" is="h2">Power over Data Lines</h2>
<p>With conventional PoE, two spare pairs are used for power transfer which avoids the need to mix power and data.</p>
<p>With SPE+PoDL, the high frequency data signals are low voltage (<code>1.0Vpp</code> or <code>2.4Vpp</code>) compared to the large DC offset required by PoDL. Add in the fact that a single cable run can be &gt;1km long and some care needs to be taken to correctly couple and decouple data from the power lines.</p>

<p>The coupled inductors (differential mode) couple DC supply onto the twisted pair, while the transceiver's data is inductively coupled through the isolation transformer. To reduce common mode noise, a choke filters the input, and it's also a good idea to protect the transceiver from high voltage transients with suitable ESD supression measures (typically TVS diodes).</p>
<p>For convenience in the field, the specification allows the conductors to be installed in any orientation. This means that downstream devices need to support reverse polarity power with a rectification or FET based switching arrangement.</p>
<h3 id="podl-types-and-classes" is="h3">PoDL Types and Classes</h3>
<p>Standards develop and change over time as the group and industry work out the details. SPE+PoDL is just as confusing as I expected and has 16 supported power classes and a compatibility matrix between power classes and <code>10Base-T1S</code>, <code>10Base-T1L</code>, <code>100BaseT1</code>, <code>1000BaseT1</code>.</p>
<p><code>IEEE 802.3bu</code> started by defining several Types of power capable SPE devices <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>, primarily for automotive use. This included 10 classes for unregulated and regulated 12V and 24V options, along with regulated 48V.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>PD Power Budget (W)</th><th>PD Vmin</th><th>PD Vmax</th><th>Current Limit (mA)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>0.5</td><td>4.94</td><td>18</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4.41</td><td>18</td><td>227</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>18</td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10.6</td><td>18</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>10.3</td><td>36</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>8.86</td><td>36</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>23.3</td><td>36</td><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>21.7</td><td>36</td><td>461</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>30</td><td>40.8</td><td>60</td><td>735</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>50</td><td>36.7</td><td>60</td><td>1360</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p><code>IEEE 802.3cg</code> later simplified things by adding Type E devices (<code>10Base-T1L</code> only) and another 6 classes of power delivery suitable for ~1-8W devices running with 20-30V (nominally 24V), and a massive 50W when using 54V supplies.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>PD Power Budget (W)</th><th>PD Vmin</th><th>PD Vmax</th><th>Current Limit (mA)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10</td><td>1.23</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>3.2</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>240</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>8.4</td><td>14</td><td>30</td><td>632</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>7.7</td><td>35</td><td>58</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>20</td><td>35</td><td>58</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>52</td><td>35</td><td>58</td><td>1579</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>For my typical projects, being able to use 24V with a few watts of power budget is the right balance of capable and practical, so I decided to aim for Class 12 support.</p>
<p>When a power supply wants to provide power to a downstream device, it first attempts to <strong>detect</strong> compliant PD hardware, and then uses a bidirectional communications process called SCCP to <strong>classify</strong> the device.</p>
<h3 id="detection--classification" is="h3">Detection &amp; Classification</h3>
<p>Detection is reasonably straightforward - the power supply uses a constant-current source capable of 9-16mA and ensure the open-loop voltage doesn't exceed 5.5V.</p>
<p>The downstream device uses this stimulus current to power up a small regulator for it's VID circuitry. Then, it sinks current until the voltage is brought within the specified signature range of 4.05-4.55V.</p>
<p>The power supply monitors the power line voltage and can signal to when a valid downstream device is identifying itself correctly.</p>
<p>The classification process is more involved, where both sides implement current sinking circuitry for a half-duplex 333bps communications link. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snla395/snla395.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TI SNLA395 appnote</a> explains it reasonably well.</p>

<p>Electrically this can be as simple as some resistors and an extra mosfet on each board controlled by a microcontroller, but reference material often includes extra buffering and input protection circuitry.</p>
<p>While literature suggest either bit-banging or an SPI peripheral make data transfer easy, I wasn't particularly keen to spend several hundred dollars to buy the specification <em>and then</em> implement a driver to communicate correctly.</p>
<p>Looking for alternatives, the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc9111.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analog Devices LTC9111</a> is a viable option for adding SCCP to the Type E downstream devices, with the added benefit of simplifying input polarity handling. For ~$5 and a simplified BOM this is probably a pretty easy choice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a simple supply-side SCCP controller doesn't seem to exist yet, the only option I could find was the incredibly expensive ($20) <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ltc4296-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LTC4296</a> 5-port controller intended for switch style devices.</p>
<h3 id="fast-startup" is="h3">Fast Startup</h3>
<p>For a fully capable PoDL supply, both detection and classification steps would be implemented.</p>
<p>However the standard allows us to only implement detection <strong>OR</strong> classification and call it 'Fast-start operation'. Given the lower complexity of detection, this was a pretty appealing option.</p>
<h2 id="submersible-sensor-node" is="h2">Submersible Sensor Node</h2>
<p>So now we understand what SPE+PoDL will let us do, lets get into the design.</p>
<p>Marine scientists often need to make observations or stimulate the environment. The combination of harsh environmental conditions, specialised hardware, and tricky cross-domain skill-sets needed to develop bespoke hardware presents a special challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Did you know</em>: Playing sounds of healthy reefs can help attract marine life to damaged reefs and accelerate recovery processes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A single conductor pair providing power and data over long distances offers some interesting improvements in data rate, reduced power consumption, and simpler (cheaper/lighter) cabling.</p>
<p>Building on the Sparkfun MicroMod ecosystem (and hardware provided as part of the design challenge), I'll design replacements for the data-only ADIN1110 function boards which add PoDL capabilities.</p>
<p>Then we'll package them in a waterproof enclosure suitable for small sensing payloads as a technology demonstrator.</p>
<h3 id="mechanical-design" is="h3">Mechanical Design</h3>
<p>The electronics need to fit inside a practical waterproof housing, so I let the mechanical design drive the design choices for the electronics stack.</p>
<p>I considered building a housing out of PVC pipe with glands and a heaping of potting compound, but found <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueRobotics</a> sell reasonably configurable waterproof housing parts for building custom modules for use on their ROV platforms. As a bonus, STEP models for most of their parts made it pretty easy to plan out the housing and mock up the electronics.</p>
<p>I chose the smallest 2″ acrylic tube (<em>~58mm OD</em>) and matching aluminium end-caps. This provides an internal volume constrained by the 50 mm tube diameter and ~118 mm maximum gap between bulkheads.</p>

<p>The top cap/bulkhead has 4×M10 threaded holes for accessories as part of BlueRobotic's hardware ecosystem. The prototype uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.5mm Wetlink penetrator for the tether cable</li>
<li>10m, high resolution pressure sensor</li>
<li>White indicator LED</li>
<li>Pressure relief/test valve</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst this prototype won't see properly deep water, BlueRobotics suggest this tube configuration should be capable of withstanding 200 meter operation, and far deeper if an aluminium sleeve is used.</p>
<p>I created mockup PCB models which I could use for board outlines in KiCAD, and to check how much height was available for the tall parts like SPE connector block and inductors.</p>

<p>There's a reasonable amount of room in the tube, but clearances like these usually have a habit of looking larger when being designed on a screen.</p>
<p>There are 3 PCB's that need to be designed - the main 'spine' PCB which behaves like a MicroMod compliant carrier board, and the power supply and device variants of the SPE+PoDL communications board.</p>
<h3 id="backplane-pcb" is="h3">Backplane PCB</h3>
<p>Acting as the MicroMod 'carrier', this board acts as the tube's electrical spine and provides the processor and function board NGFF (aka M.2) connectors, as well as USB and SWD connectors, a 3.3V regulator, some I2C headers, and breakout pads for expansion IO.</p>

<p>The hardest part of designing this board was trying to untangle the supported GPIO across the range of processor boards, and how that's mapped against the function boards. While Sparkfun's documentation and guides normally sit between '<em>pretty good</em>' and '<em>excellent</em>', this process was rather tedious.</p>
<p>From another (unfinished) project, I already had pretty much the entire range of MicroMod processor boards laying around (<code>ESP32</code>, <code>STM32F405</code>, <code>NRF52840</code>, <code>RP2040</code>, <code>SAMD51</code>, <code>Teensy</code>, <code>Apollo3</code>/Artemis) and wanted the design to support the widest range of targets possible (the whole point of MicroMod).</p>
<p>This list of options is cut down substantially if much more than the primary SPI and I2C busses are needed, you want <code>ADIN1110</code> example library to work, and most processor boards have subtle implementation inconsistencies which turn the pin allocation into a trade-off balancing act.</p>

<p>I won't go into the implementation details around the <code>ADIN1110</code> or MicroMod edge-connector, but if you're interested the full schematics are in the <a href="https://github.com/Scottapotamas/spe-marine-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git repository</a>.</p>
<p>The key areas of discussion are the signature circuitry, and how power is handled once the supply enables full bus voltage.</p>

<p>From left to right, we've got a <code>AP7375</code> wide input voltage LDO which can tolerate bus voltage providing the 3.3V supply to a <code>MCP65R41T</code> comparator with an internal 1.2V internal reference.</p>
<p>The voltage divider (<code>R1</code>, <code>R2</code>) is configured to output approximately 1.2V (matching the internal reference voltage) for a 4.05V input voltage. The output of the comparator then controls a simple N-channel mosfet which switches the <code>TL431</code> shunt regulator on or off, resulting in a regulated voltage which matches the signature voltage range.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In bench testing the signature voltage measured on the supply side was ~3.905V, slightly lower than intended.</p>
<p>I ended up replacing <code>R2</code> with 390k to compensate for voltage drop over the rectifier diodes, resulting in a signature voltage of 4.4V.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming the detection circuit works correctly, the power supply would then enable the full bus voltage of 24VDC.</p>

<p>The <code>TPS26625</code> eFuse switch is configured to automatically switch on once the input voltage is above the PoDL Class 10-12 minimum voltage specification of 14V. It also provides configurable over-voltage and current limiting which makes a compact layout possible.</p>
<p>The 5V regulator is an interesting part - the Texas Instruments <code>TLVM23625</code> is a tiny, 36V capable, 2.5A switch-mode regulator with an integrated inductor and switch. This was pretty helpful with the constrained layout.</p>
<p>The 5V output is used to power the function board's 3.3V LDO, and also back-powers the carrier board. I included a current shunt and amplifier allow for sink-side current measurement on the 5V rail.</p>

<p>The resulting layout is reasonably dense, but maintains the same MicroMod Function board dimensions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tweaked the 5V regulator's feedback network after testing. I was seeing the intended 5.03V regulated voltage, but needed to compensate for the ~0.205V drop over the protection diode.</p>

<h3 id="pse-function-board" is="h3">PSE Function Board</h3>
<p>This board shares the input coupling network and <code>ADIN1110</code> design with the PD board, but replaces the detection signalling circuitry and bulk regulator with the necessary circuitry to test and detect valid downstream devices. Instead of using the power switch to power up the board when bus voltage is within spec, it's used to switch the HV input on once detection succeeds.</p>

<p>Unlike the PD board, managing the detection process does require microcontroller interaction to enable the current source, watch the detection circuit, and then disable the current source before enabling the HV switch.</p>
<p>Additionally, maintain full voltage signature (MVFS) behaviour needs the microcontroller to monitor the current sense signal for a minimum peak load of 11mA per 10ms span to keep the power supply  active (though this can be set lower if needed).</p>

<p>From left to right, a 7V output wide input LDO powers the current stimulus circuit. Instead of building a constant-current source from scratch, I use a <code>NSI50010YT1G</code> LED driver IC which is switched on/off by a P-channel mosfet. This approach is intentionally simple, but probably not ideal as there's limited control over the current output and startup slew-rate.</p>
<p>The current source output is protected from the switched 24V output by a diode, and also has a 5.6V zener diode to clamp the output voltage to the specified maximum open-loop voltage of 5.5V.</p>
<p>Once the downstream powers up and starts presenting the signature voltage range of 4.05V to 4.55V, the <code>TLV6700</code> window comparator output provides the microcontroller with the <code>VID_VALID</code> signal.</p>
<p>The microcontroller then enables this board's <code>TPS26625</code> eFuse to pass the 24V input supply to the downstream device. On this board, the eFuse's ULVO and OVP is configured for the Class 10-12 allowable PSE range of 20-30V.</p>

<p>I'm a little annoyed with how the detection circuitry part placement and routing turned out, a mix of rushing the design late at night and higher part count made it tricky to fit in the same area as the PD's circuitry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aside, this PSE design probably makes more sense as it's own carrier board, or as a media converter to 10BaseT ethernet.</p>
<p>Implementing it as a function board allowed for design re-use and opens up some flexibility in final use-cases though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="printable-mounting-brackets" is="h3">Printable mounting brackets</h3>
<p>With the boards designed, I brought exported STEP models back into my CAD model and designed a pair of 3D printed board mounts use the 4×M3 internal mounting holes in the bulkheads.</p>
<p>The upper bracket abuses the solderable standoffs on the rear of the backplane board as mounting features, along with the key cutout in the PCB to force alignment.</p>

<p>Because the mounted electronics need to slide through the tube to meet the other end-cap, a simple tapered groove design is used to retain the PCB once installed.</p>
<h3 id="electronics-assembly--testing" is="h3">Electronics Assembly &amp; Testing</h3>
<p>PCBs and printed parts were ordered from China and arrived in South Australia in a pretty impressive 4-days. The components from DigiKey arrived a day or two later.</p>
<span>
      
    </span>
<p>I assembled 2 of each board using a pretty typical paste stencil and reflow plate, with some hot air assisting for heavier parts.</p>
<span>
      
    </span>
<p>Bring-up testing didn't throw any surprises, I started with a lab supply to check the power paths didn't have any critical errors.</p>
<p>The PD board eFuse ULVO/OVP behaviour and 5V regulator behaved as expected. The rectifier and decoupling network also handled 24V with either polarity without issue, dropping about 0.4V across the rectifier diodes.</p>
<p>Testing the PSE board was similar, checking the current source output with a multimeter, then using the lab supply to provide a 4.2V test voltage to trigger the window comparator's output.</p>

<p>I quickly wrote some simple PD detection handling code which uses a state-machine to control the detection behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the current source,</li>
<li>Wait for the downstream device to boot,</li>
<li>Check the comparator output for VID valid flag (and filter it),</li>
<li>Disable the current source, wait a bit,</li>
<li>Enable the power switch to enable 24V supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope trace below shows the PoDL bus voltage in yellow (<code>CH1</code>), and the PD board's 5V regulator is the blue trace (<code>CH2</code>). The state-machine timing was intentionally slowed down to make the trace easier to understand.</p>

<p>We can see the current source enable, settle at 4.4V for 5ms, then decay once the current source is disabled. Then the 24V switch enables with a nicely controlled slew rate thanks to the eFuse, followed by the 5V regulator cleanly coming up a couple of milliseconds later.</p>
<p>This is a successful power up sequence for 24V PoDL!</p>
<p>On the data side, I mounted the custom function boards into the MicroMod function carrier and flashed some basic Arduino test sketches to exercise the ADIN1110's self-test loopback.</p>

<p>We can communicate with the MAC over SPI successfully, so that part of the implementation is also working fine!</p>
<h4 id="making-late-night-mistakes" is="h4">Making late night mistakes</h4>
<p>At this point, it's rather amazing that the design and implementation has gone almost perfectly to plan...</p>
<p>So I tried testing a 6S LiPo battery as my 'field' 24V source instead of my lab supply. I'm sure a few of you reading are seeing where this is going.</p>
<p>The inrush spike resulted in the PSE board's onboard (unprotected) 7V LDO being sacrificed to the cause. Hindsight is 20/20 and immediate, so I cobbled together a simple resistor based soft-start circuit and filter from scrap parts to prevent any future mishaps.</p>
<p>Also, it was about this time when I noticed I had unfortunately placed the processor board mounting standoff about 1.05mm further than it's intended position. Not a big deal, but incredibly frustrating to see gap between screw and board edge.</p>
<h3 id="firmware" is="h3">Firmware</h3>
<p>With the electronics <em>mostly</em> working without issue, it was time to interface to the test sensors and send some packets.</p>
<p>The boards were designed without assuming any specific sensors would be used, but I used these I2C sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature &amp; Humidity - <code>SHTC3</code> via <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparkfun <code>SEN-16467</code></a></li>
<li>Motion - <code>LSM6DSO</code> via <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparkfun <code>SEN-18020</code></a></li>
<li>Depth/Pressure - <code>MS5837</code> via <a href="https://bluerobotics.com/store/sensors-cameras/sensors/bar02-sensor-r1-rp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueRobotics <code>Bar02</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Sparkfun breakouts mount directly to the standoffs on the rear of the backplane board.</p>
<p>The <code>Bar02</code> comes with a JST-GH connector, so I re-terminated it with a JST-SH connector for consistency with the other boards and headers on the backplane PCB.</p>
<p>Attempting to avoid any more scope-creep, I opted to use the Arduino ecosystem instead of going bare-metal with my preferred STM32 or ESP32 toolchains. The promise of quick integration with pre-made libraries for the sensors, T1L transciever, and communications protocol was alluring.</p>
<p>The project is structured as a simple super-loop which runs some state-machines to handle polling sensors before packing data into packets for transfer over SPE.</p>
<h4 id="writing-a-ms5837-driver" is="h4">Writing a MS5837 Driver</h4>
<p>The very cool <code>MS5837-02</code> pressure sensor supports absurdly high precision (via oversampling) at rather high sample rates - starting with a base resolution of <code>0.11 mbar</code> at <code>1.5kHz</code> and <code>0.016 mbar</code> at <code>~60Hz</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Converting the pressure resolution into a more understandable unit puts the absurdity of this sensor into context:</p>
<p><code>0.016 mbar</code> equates to a depth change of roughly <code>0.16 millimeters</code> in sea water. <code>160 μm</code>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the BlueRobotics Arduino driver only supports the maximum oversampling (<code>OSR = 8192</code>) setting and forces a 40ms blocking delay...</p>
<p>I implemented a generic C library to work with the <code>MS5837-02</code>, letting the integrating developer take back some control over configuration and sampling behaviour. This approach allows the library to be used with a simple state-machine or with RTOS style yields.</p>

<p>While the temperature is needed for the 2nd order pressure compensation maths, I didn't see any downside from reducing the temperature oversampling slightly which also allows for quicker turnaround time.</p>
<p>My driver is a simple open-sourced and <a href="https://github.com/Scottapotamas/MS5837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available standalone on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h4 id="internal-sensors" is="h4">Internal Sensors</h4>
<p>The SHTC3 and LSM6DS0 Arduino libraries were better behaved, and I was able to throw together a reasonable implementation sampling the IMU's FIFO buffer reasonably easily.</p>
<h4 id="adin1110-serial-bridge" is="h4">ADIN1110 Serial Bridge</h4>
<p>At the start of the project I wanted to implement proper TCP/IP support via LwIP to connect the sensor node directly to a normal Ethernet network through a media converter, but the lack of integration examples and diminishing amount of time meant I knew I would run out of time during debugging. Maybe next time!</p>
<p>Building off Sparkfun's reasonably thin <code>sfe_spe_advanced</code> wrapper around Analog Device's library, I was able to send raw buffers of bytes between the transcievers with fairly minimal effort.</p>
<p>Because I'm familiar with the protocol (and wrote the library) I was able to connect the <code>electricui-embedded</code> read and write callbacks, and setup the power-supply side MicroMod process to act as a nearly transparent SPE-to-Serial proxy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that a 10 Mbps networked node was constrained by a 10x slower serial link (<code>912600 baud</code>) was slightly amusing, but will hopefully be an area I can address with a bit more time in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="user-interface" is="h3">User Interface</h3>
<p>I'm using Electric UI's <a href="https://electricui.com/docs/interface/transformer">DataFlow and DataTransformer</a> system to calculate real-time wave height statistics on the stream of depth sensor data. Turns out wave analysis and meaningful visualisations are slightly non-trivial, so I'll probably write a second post going into greater depth.</p>
<p>As a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter the incoming pressure measurement stream to reduce noise,</li>
<li>Calculate the rate of depth change (derivative),</li>
<li>Detect peak and troughs, and the time between them,</li>
<li>Average the midpoint height of detected waves to create a long-running reference depth,</li>
<li>Generate a histogram to show wave behaviour relative to the reference depth.</li>
</ul>
<p>These statistics are data-loggable alongside the raw sensor streams.</p>

<p>A quick trip through Blender to perform <em>Planar Decimation</em> helps bring the model complexity down from ~2M tris to a couple hundred thousand, and we export the file as a <code>gltf</code>.</p>

<p>Once assembled, I removed the pressure-relief valve stem and attached a vacuum pump to perform a leak test.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with how everything turned out, just wished I had a bit more time for refinement!</p>
<h2 id="field-testing" is="h2">Field Testing</h2>
<p>We tested the tube in a pool briefly to check buoyancy. During the early mechanical design stages I created a simple spreadsheet to estimate the assembly mass and displacement from first-principles which suggested additional ballast weight was not needed (slightly negatively buoyant). In the real-world it was slightly positively buoyant and could use a bit of extra weight.</p>
<p>Being the natural over-achiever (and qualified diver) that he is, my colleague Michael suggested we should give it real-world test.</p>
<p>We drove down to a popular dive reef with good jetty access to test the sensor node.</p>

<p>By stitching some velcro lengths to each side of some printed mounting clamps, it provided a fairly easily removable and non-invasive mounting solution that could be handled underwater.</p>
<p>If the sensor node was deployed for longer periods of time, a more carefully designed mount would be necessary.</p>

<p>I think we got the tick of approval from the locals.</p>
<h2 id="useful-resources--thanks" is="h2">Useful Resources &amp; Thanks</h2>
<p>Firstly, thanks to Jack &amp; Brittany for accompanying us during the test dive. It wouldn't have gone as smoothly without you!</p>
<p>Thanks to Michael for doing such a great job documenting the assembly and test.</p>
<p>On the design side, I found these manufacturer app notes helpful:</p>

   <p>Off the coast of California is an unusual "octopus garden" — the largest congregation of deep-sea octopuses ever discovered on Earth, where over 6,000 octopuses huddle around an extinct underwater volcano in the black, cold ocean depths, almost two miles below the surface. </p>   <p>Most are brooding females that spend their days doing nothing but guarding nests full of eggs, a tedious task which can take nearly two years.<strong> </strong>It would take even longer if not for the warm water seeping from the seafloor that speeds up<strong> </strong>the growth of their babies, according to new <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3247">research</a> that suggests this natural incubator is why octopuses gather there in such huge numbers. </p>   
   <p>The discovery, published in the journal <em>Science Advances</em> on Wednesday, highlights how low-key hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor can create isolated patches of cozy warmth, hidden in the darkness, that could play an outsized role in supporting deep-sea life. Thousands of such spots could be dotted up and down coastlines, researchers say. </p>   <p>"It's definitely a special site for these animals. It's a breeding site for this octopus. It has effects for the entire community nearby that then has spillover effects beyond that," says <a href="https://www.mbari.org/person/james-barry/">Jim Barry</a> of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, the lead researcher for this work. "So it's regionally important and we still know very little about it. How many more of these are there?"</p>   <h3>A surprise in shimmering water </h3>   <p>Scientists found this site about five years ago, when a submersible vehicle got sent to explore some underwater hills around Davidson Seamount, a submerged mountain off the coast of central California that once was a volcano. </p>   <p>While the seamount was well-studied, the surrounding areas were not, and researchers were shocked when the vehicle's headlamps suddenly revealed large groups of purple octopuses, <em>Muusoctopus robustus</em>, that were crouched over nests of eggs.</p>   <p>Octopuses generally are antisocial loners that would rather fight another octopus than live in close quarters. And yet biologists had stumbled onto an enormous octopus garden, a trippy scene straight out of a Beatles song. </p>   
   <p>"They thought, 'Well, let's get a really close look.' And as they zoomed into these octopus, then they saw this shimmering water and they realized this is a thermal spring, this is warm water coming out. And that was somewhat of a surprise because this is an inactive volcano," explains Barry.</p>

   <p>The first time scientists ever <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3247">observed</a> a bunch of deep-sea octopuses gathering together was about a decade ago, in another place where warm water seeped out of the seafloor, off Costa Rica. But researchers studying that rocky outcrop didn't see any viable eggs and thought that perhaps the higher temperatures there had harmed their development. </p>   <p>Just this summer, however, <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/scientists-discover-new-deep-sea-octopus-nurseries-in-costa-rica/">another expedition</a> revisited that outcrop and saw that it was actually an active, successful nursery. </p>   <p>"It really kind of blew my mind because it is so drastically different and they're taking observations in the exact same places that we had been looking at," says <a href="https://ccom.unh.edu/user/ahartwell">Anne Hartwell</a>, with the Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire, who visited the Costa Rica site in 2014.</p>   <p>Hartwell is part of the team that recently spent months doing robotic work to study the octopus garden near California, to figure out what role warm water might play in drawing octopuses together. </p>   <p>"The robots we use are so advanced and they have such great technology and cameras and dexterity with their mechanical arms," says Hartwell. "They enable us to not quite be down there in person, but get a lot done as if we were."</p>   <p>The researchers mapped an area the size of a few football fields in detail, installed a time-lapse camera that watched octopuses continuously, and visited individual octopus nests again and again while monitoring water temperatures with probes. </p>   <div id="res1195199276">

   <p>"We found 6,000 animals in just a small area, and that was just a portion of where the octopuses are distributed. So we're estimating, I don't know, up to 20,000 animals may be there," explains Barry. He adds that the female octopuses are so focused on tending their nests that they mostly ignored the investigators. </p>   
   <p>"We can drive up to within eight inches of them and hold a camera right there. They don't do a thing," he says. </p>   <h3>The allure of rare warmth in the deep </h3>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1195402656" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The ocean water at this depth is normally about 35 degrees Fahrenheit, but the spa-like waters seeping out of cracks and crevices got up to about 51 degrees Fahrenheit—and that's where the octopuses wanted to brood. </p>   <p>"The females only nest in warm sites. As far as we can tell, we could find none in cold waters," says Barry. "There are plenty of nesting sites available, but they don't nest on just any bare rock. They only choose those sites where there's a nice warm pool. And in fact, if one female leaves, we found that another one will jump in there within a couple of weeks."</p>   <p>What's more, he says, the octopus eggs matured much more quickly than one would expect, based on what's known about other octopuses that live in the cold ocean depths. </p>   <p>Brood times for nesting females there seemed to be about 1.8 years, while previous <a href="https://www.mbari.org/news/deep-sea-octopus-broods-eggs-for-over-four-years-longer-than-any-known-animal/">observations</a> of a deep-sea octopus in cold water showed that it took 4.5 years for its eggs to hatch, a length of time longer than any other animal. </p>   <p>Biologists know from prior research that warming generally speeds the pace of octopus embryo development. Barry says that having a shorter brooding period should give the offspring a greater chance of survival, since the female octopuses and their developing embryos would spend less time in an immobile, vulnerable state.   </p>   <div id="res1195201918">

   <p>"Seeing that they are getting a brooding time of 1.8 years is awesome. It shows that there's an advantage to these octopus breeding their eggs in the warmer water," says <a href="https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/borcutt.html">Beth Orcutt</a> of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine, who has studied the octopus populations off Costa Rica. "That's the first time we've been able to look at that with this kind of data."</p>   
   <p><a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/janet-voight">Janet Voight</a>, an expert on deep-sea octopuses at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, says it's astonishing to her that the California site has "a concentration of predators that exceeds any reasonable expectation. It's like, whoa."</p>   <p>But these female octopuses have given up their predatory life to reproduce and, instead, they themselves are being eaten when they die. The octopus garden seems to support a teeming variety of other life such as crustaceans, anemones and snails. "These are all parts of an ecosystem that's sustained by the octopus being there and dying in there," Voight says.</p>   <p>Despite the richness of this ecosystem, it could easily have been missed by explorers, because the ocean bottom is so vast and dark, illuminated only for brief moments by the lights of slow-moving exploration vehicles. </p>   <p>"When you think of the deep sea, it's kind of muddy and flat and nothing too much conspicuous around," says Voight. "Then you stumble upon something like this and it's like a bonanza."</p>

        <p>
  Hello,<br>
  today we are going to talk about some flying robot behavior improvements. Some of the problems we fixed were reported countless times, so I hope that some people will appreciate it :).
</p>

<h3>Quality of life versus flashy features<author>kovarex</author></h3>
<p>
  I know that you are mainly looking forward to the new content, and that <i>just</i>
  quality of life improvements aren't the kind of things that make people buy the game and get excited for.
</p>

<p>
  But I strongly believe, that if you want to add content, mechanics, and systems to a game, which already isn't simple, there is always a risk of just it being too much. By doing QOL improvements, we reduce the small hassles and annoyances, which effectively creates an extra mental space to enjoy more in the game. Its like cleaning your room before getting a new toy.
</p>

<p>
  So to make things clear, the reason that we make and present these kind of changes is not because we don't want to make new flashy features, we just want the new stuff to be enjoyable without a burden of having too much to deal with.<br>
  But don't worry, we will show something new next week!

<h3>Smarter robot tasks<author>Oxyd</author></h3>

<p>
  Logistic and construction robots have been in the game for a while, and at their
  core they are fairly simple entities. A logistic robot, for example, may be told
  to go pick up an item from a chest, and deliver it to another chest. So far so
  good, but in Factorio there usually is more than one item to be transferred —
  so what does the game do when tasked with transferring, say, 500 items from one
  box to another?
</p>

<h4>The Old Way</h4>
<p>
  In Factorio 1.1, the game keeps a list of all idle robots, including those
  hiding away in roboports, and when a task needs to be taken care of, it
  selects the nearest idle robot from that list. So, to transfer 500 items from
  a provider chest to requester, the game would find the first idle robot
  closest to the provider chest and task it with the transfer. This robot now
  has a task, so it is removed from the list of idle robots.
</p>

<p>
  But we still have 499 other items to transfer (ignoring robot capacity bonus
  for simplicity). The logistic network simply repeats the previous steps for
  all the other items — find the next closest idle robot, task it with
  transferring the next item and so on until there is a robot for each of the
  500 items in the box.
</p>

<p>
  The problem with this strategy is that while the first few robots may be
  located in roboports reasonably close to the provider chest, by the time we
  get to the last items the network may have to reach for robots at the other
  end of the factory because there is no closer idle robot for the task. The
  end result is that the first batch of robots will arrive at the chest, take
  the item and deliver it to the destination, and then recharge and go have a
  nap in a roboport — transferring a single item was all these robots were
  tasked with and the remaining items have already been assigned to other
  robots. After that, a slow trickle of robots from far away parts of the
  factory will come in and transfer the remaining items.
</p>

  </p>
</div>


<p>
  The situation is similar for construction robots, and this can be especially
  apparent when using one's portable roboport. Say the player wants to remove a
  bunch of trees in their factory. A single personal roboport can have up
  to 25 construction robots, so that's up to 25 trees that will be
  deconstructed using the player's personal robots. All remaining trees will
  be assigned to robots from the main logistic network, and the player will
  have to wait for them to arrive for the trees to be gone — even though the
  player's personal robots are right there with nothing better to do!
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<h4>The New Way</h4>
<p>
  Choosing a robot for a task only from the list of idle robots clearly isn't
  the best strategy. Assigning a task to a robot that is currently busy but
  nearby may be a better choice, even if the new task may have to wait until
  the robot finishes its other tasks. This required two main changes to the
  logistic network code.
</p>

<p>
  The first change was to allow robots to have multiple tasks assigned to
  them. Much of the code has been written with the assumption that a robot
  has exactly one job, but after some code refactor, robots now have a queue of tasks.
</p>

<p>
  Second, we need a way to select a robot for a task. Each task has a starting position,
  for example a deconstruction order starts at the entity to be deconstructed. Until now, the selection process
  was simple — just select the idle robot closest to that point.<br>
  But now, when we can also select a robot with one or more queued tasks, the process
  becomes a bit more complex.
</p>

<p>
  The new metric for robot selection is the <i>arrival time</i>. For an idle robot,
  its arrival time is simply the distance to the starting position divided by its speed.
  For a busy robot, we can look through its queue of tasks, figure out where and when the robot is
  going to end up when its done, and then add the flight time from there to the starting position of the new job.<br>
  When selecting a robot for a task, we select the one that is going to arrive first, even if it has to take care
  of other things before that.
</p>

<p>
  It is worth pointing out that the arrival time calculation is only an estimate.
  For example, we simplify the effects of the recharging times.
  A keen-eyed player will no doubt notice situations where choosing a different
  robot could have been a little bit more efficient.
  But in the big picture, it doesn't seem to be very noticeable.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how the new system handles our previous two examples. The initial batch of robots is tasked with
  transferring all the items which results in them shuffling back and forth
  between the requester and the provider.
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  For deconstructing trees, each of the player's personal robots does more than
  just a single tree. Robots from the main network still come to help out, but
  this time it's because they can help get the whole job done faster.
</p>

  </p>
</div>


<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>
  Having a simple list of all busy robots and going through it each time a new
  task comes in may work fine for small factories, but with several thousand
  robots flying everywhere it can quickly become a UPS drain. To alleviate
  that, we implemented a different representation.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever a robot's queue of tasks is updated, it calculates its final
  position estimate — that is, its final position and the time at which it
  will finish. Each map chunk now stores a list of all busy robots that are
  estimated to finish on that chunk. So when a robot updates its final position
  estimate, it registers itself in that chunk's list of robots. When searching
  for a robot for a particular task, the game now starts its search at the
  chunk where the job's starting position is located, and continues its search in
  an outward spiral.
</p>

<p>
  Storing busy robots on chunks and searching in a spiral improved the
  performance by a lot, and even factories with thousands of busy robots run well.
</p>

<h3>Smarter robot other things<author>Klonan</author></h3>

<p>
  While playing and developing the expansion for the last 2 years, we have also accumulated a few more features and changes to make the robots feel smarter and work better.
</p>

<h4>Roboport robot requests</h4>

<p>
  There are some situations when you need to make sure some roboports always have robots to service tasks. For example if you have a little resupply point with buffer chests, you want logistic robots around to quickly empty your trash and refill your supplies. It is quite annoying when all the materials are right there, but you are stuck waiting around, because due to natural robot migratory patterns, the roboports in the area are quite empty.
</p>

<div>
    <p>
      <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
        <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-requests-before.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
      </video>
    </p>
  </div>


<p>
  It could be solved with requester chests, inserters, circuit network, and such... but we decided a smoother approach. You can now set logistic requests for robots directly inside the roboport GUI. Robots will be dispatched from other roboports to fulfill the request (important to note, robots will not be taken from storage or provider chests).
</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-requests-gui.png">
</p>

<p>
  With this new feature, we can set all the roboports near our resupply point to always have 100 logistic robots available. Once we arrive, our needs are serviced in record time, and afterwards you can see robots arriving to get the roboport back up to 100.
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
      <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-requests-after.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  Another nice use of this is that we can use the roboport requests to remove certain robots from the network. Perchance we had some mod with higher quality worker robots, we can request the low quality ones and remove them with a filter inserter, over time removing the worse robots from circulation.
</p>

<h4>Better robot charging heuristic</h4>

<p>
  When a worker robots runs low on energy, they need to find a nearby roboport to charge at, but they need to be a little bit smart about it. For instance if they always chose the closest roboport, then you would get queues and traffic jams at some roboports while others are completely empty.
</p>

<p>
  For these 'smarts' we use a quite simple heuristic, factoring in not just how close the roboport is, but also how many other robots are currently charging there. Typically this worked 'well enough' but every so often you could encounter a little inconvenient situation where they are still bunching up on some roboports while ignoring others that are just a little bit further.
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  In some extreme cases this can actually be quite a problem, as the robots waiting to charge still use energy for hovering, so lose more energy, in a positive feedback loop where all robots who join the queue will fall to 0 energy while they are waiting their turn. Generally though the main problem here is that the player looks at the robots and thinks "These robots are so dumb...". Not the end of the world, but we can do better...
</p>

<p>
  Surprisingly in this case the issue can be helped a lot by just a small improvement in the heuristic logic. When deciding which roboport to charge at, the robots crucially did not consider the current robots on the way to that roboport, only those already in the queue, and did not factor in how many free charging spots the roboport has open. By adding these two extra parameters into the equations, the distribution of the robots improves quite nicely.
</p>

<h4>
  Mitigation for robot pathing over lakes
</h4>

<p>
  It has been a problem for a long time, the robots are pretty dumb when it comes to pathfinding, and try to fly over areas that have no logistic network coverage. This is because for performance reasons, we don't do any pathfinding at all. The robots just fly in a straight line to the job position.
</p>

<p>
  One major problem of this is the possibility of the robots to get stuck in an infinite loop. This is because they fly out over uncovered territory, run out of battery, and return back to recharge and try again. Obviously they will never make it.
</p>

<div>
  <p>
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
      <source src="https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/blog-sync/fff-374-robot-path-before.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Mp4 playback not supported on your device.
    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  This issue was notable enough and annoying enough for us that we really did want to come up with a fix. The solution we came to was a smart trick in the roboport selection when they run out of energy. Usually the robot just chooses one of the nearest roboports, which is fine for normal circumstances, but in this case leads to the robot turning completely around in failure.
</p>

<p>
  So we changed the selection logic, so that the robot tries to always charge at a roboport that is closer to the destination than the robot is. This means that even if the robot will potentially fly with low energy for longer, it will always be able to make some progress towards the target, and eventually complete their mission.
</p>

    </video>
  </p>
</div>


<p>
  It is not a perfect solution, but should hopefully help prevent the most egregious issue of this technical constraint.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Andrew Marble<br><a href="http://marble.onl/">marble.onl</a><br>andrew@willows.ai<br>August 30, 2023</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties advocacy group, recently published a good article entitled “ISPs Should Not Police Online Speech—No Matter How Awful It Is.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It argues that providers within the internet “stack” should refrain from censoring traffic according to their own values. That laws and regulations already exist to deal with norms around content; subjective single chokepoint censorship will inevitably be abused and not limited to things universally agreed as worth blocking; and that once infrastructure providers start applying their own judgements, pressure will mount to censor more and more things. Importantly, they’re not advocating for a free-for-all, but against vigilante justice, advocating that legal and regulatory mechanisms be used to deal with infringing content.</p>
<p>The AI industry would be well served by taking a similar stance with respect to model licensing. A core principle of open source software licenses is non-discrimination in how the software is used. Copyright holders open sourcing their licenses rightly do not concern themselves with end uses. This is not an invitation for illegal use (which is already illegal). It’s an implicit acknowledgement that a license is the wrong place to try and enforce opinions, norms, laws, whatever you want to call them, about use.</p>
<p>Recently we’ve seen (so-called) “ethical” and commercially oriented licenses pushed as alternatives to open-source. I’m talking specifically here about AI models where the weights are released for download, not about served models or infrastructure. For example, the OpenRail++ license used by StableDiffusionXL includes the following schedule<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You agree not to use the Model or Derivatives of the Model:</p>
<p>In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local or international law or regulation;</p>
<p>For the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way;</p>
<p>To generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others;</p>
<p>To generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used to harm an individual;</p>
<p>To defame, disparage or otherwise harass others;</p>
<p>For fully automated decision making that adversely impacts an individual’s legal rights or otherwise creates or modifies a binding, enforceable obligation;</p>
<p>For any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against or harming individuals or groups based on online or offline social behavior or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics;</p>
<p>To exploit any of the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons based on their age, social, physical or mental characteristics, in order to materially distort the behavior of a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm;</p>
<p>For any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against individuals or groups based on legally protected characteristics or categories;</p>
<p>To provide medical advice and medical results interpretation;</p>
<p>To generate or disseminate information for the purpose to be used for administration of justice, law enforcement, immigration or asylum processes, such as predicting an individual will commit fraud/crime commitment (e.g. by text profiling, drawing causal relationships between assertions made in documents, indiscriminate and arbitrarily-targeted use).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This combines things that are already illegal, things that are subject to current regulation, things that arguably should be subject to regulation, and judgements of the copyright holder about what AI should not be used for. Likewise, Facebook’s LLaMA model contains various usage restrictions<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, including the usual enumeration of illegal things but notably (bolding mine)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Engage in, promote, incite, facilitate, or assist in the planning or development of activities that present a risk of death or bodily harm to individuals, including use of Llama 2 <strong>related to the following:</strong></p>
<p>a. Military, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, espionage, use for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State</p>
<p>b. Guns and illegal weapons (including weapon development)</p>
<p>c. Illegal drugs and regulated/controlled substances</p>
<p>d. Operation of critical infrastructure, transportation technologies, or heavy machinery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are clearly value judgements about specific things. While we don’t know the motivations, the result is that Facebook has acted as a kind of vigilante censor telling us how we can and cannot use source code in an extra-legal way.</p>
<p>The choice of license resides with the companies releasing the models. However, the resources required to build these models put them firmly in the same category as backbone infrastructure providers, and so applying their own values on uses has the same negative effect as internet censorship. They’ve already crossed from just restricting purely illegal uses to specific legal ones (guns, military), as well as restricted “disinformation” which has become a synonym for disagreement. It’s only a matter of time until special interests push for more restrictions, including ones that you don’t agree with. To make matters worse, past open source licenses were uniform (other than the copyright/copyleft divide) making assembling a system out of different software components straightforward. If we have to start taking the morals imposed by every model provider into account when building AI solutions, this adds an added complication that will surely benefit some bureaucrat but that’s overall a dead weight on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Again, there are existing laws and regulations that deal with inappropriate uses, and current efforts to enact more to deal specifically with AI. Advocating against corporate censorship or restriction doesn’t mean agreeing with all uses, it means imposing the restrictions democratically and not through vigilantism. So far these restrictions have received little attention in the AI community. We need stronger norms and more pressure calling out restrictive licenses, even if we agree with the current restrictions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not long ago if you went to McDonalds for a coffee, it came with a sticker on the cup. If you saved up six on a little piece of card (also on the cup), your 7<sup>th</sup> coffee was free. A simple system, and very private.</p><p>That sticker system was scrapped in 2020, for an app<sup>1</sup>. Suddenly, McDonalds have gone from knowing nothing about you, to collecting your financial info, your location and even looking at your search and browsing history. And for your &lt;cough&gt; convenience, you can sign-in with Facebook, Google or Apple.</p><p>OK, so I work in business too, and it’s imperative that you use data to understand customer behaviour and market to them. But do you really need this level of information? This is just one example of what I refer to as ‘creeping surveillance’.</p><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm.jpeg" alt="" width="353" height="750" srcset="https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm.jpeg 470w, https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm-141x300.jpeg 141w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://elnion.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Blog-2-Appstore-screen-shot-sm.jpeg"></figure><p><strong>How data about you is monetized</strong></p><p>I can only guess at what all that data is used for in the example above<sup>2</sup>, but it’s typical of many apps that give you free stuff in exchange for data. I also don’t want to beat-up on McDonalds – as a reputable business they do provide opt-outs and are doing a lot to transform their business into a more sustainable one, which is great news.</p><p>Much more problematic are where the developer’s ONLY purpose for the app is to siphon your data – the user functions are merely a ruse designed to get you to install it. From games to widgets, productivity apps, and even ones that claim to <em>protect</em> your privacy. Whatever function you need, you can be pretty sure there’s a ‘data vampire’ app for that.</p><p>But why? Well, data about you is a lucrative business.</p><p><strong>We value your privacy</strong></p><p>It may be the biggest lie ever told. They sure do value it though. They value it because your privacy is up for sale all over the place – and mostly, WITH your consent<sup>3</sup>. Cookie walls – you hate them, so you click OK. Privacy policies – you hate them too, so you don’t read them. Data collection opt-outs are hidden or long winded. It’s all by design. It’s called obfuscation, and they want you to give in. Even user ‘privacy control panels’ are mostly designed to mislead you – all of which, incidentally, is not technically allowed under GDPR.</p><p>Data about you<sup>4</sup> makes $billions for big tech, but smaller companies can still make huge profits from personal data collected from websites and apps. Depending on the level of detail, the data from just a few thousand individuals could net thousands of dollars for a small company, or even a lone developer. It all goes into a pot that profiles you to a scary level of detail – believe me when I say they can predict your actions better than you can. That’s why real time bidding ad-clicks can go for anything from a few cents to $2 and up. Remember, that’s just for a single user click on an ad.</p><p><strong>It’s time for business to believe in choice</strong></p><p>Creeping surveillance has become normalized when it really should not be – it’s dysfunctional. Many people believe privacy to be a human right. Even Mark Zuckerberg purchased the properties surrounding his own<sup>5</sup> to create a privacy buffer for his family (which you contributed to, I’m sure he’s grateful). It’s not the only example – Larry Page, the co-founder of Google is a famously private person. The fact is that the people that want to trade on <em>your</em> privacy, crave it for themselves.</p><p>This is why data collection should be a choice. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. Let’s not forget that many people are happy with data collection – they <em>want</em> the most integrated and tailored experience possible.&nbsp; And they want it even though they know the ramifications; I’ve met ‘privacy professionals’ that think this way. Personally, I do my best to avoid tracking, apart from with the companies I trust, then I play the game. Surely looking for engaged people like that means you’ve found your hot prospect?</p><p>Talking from the business side for a moment, there are plenty of ways to combine tactics – tokenisation, anonymization, differential marketing (and more), in addition to what I’m sad to say has become ‘traditional’ data collection. Let people choose, it fosters trust. Make it simple to select what level of tracking people are comfortable with, including ‘none’. This layered approach will make your prospects and customers happy – if they trust you. It shouldn’t really trouble you unless you are Meta, Google, or swathe of other big names, of course.</p><p>The problem is that marketing teams are under so much pressure to get lead numbers up, lead quality suffers. This is often driven by sales management demanding more leads, only to complain about lead quality afterwards, at which point they blame marketing. So, whether you’re in sales and marketing or just reading this with a casual interest in privacy, consider this. When the starting gun was fired on GDPR in May 2018, many US websites worried about the legal consequences blocked European visitors, but the New York Times took a different approach. They dropped real-time bidding and behavioural ads and focused on contextual and regional ads instead. The NYT ad business continued to grow ‘nicely’ as they put it<sup>6</sup>, even without all that creepy targeting.</p><p>In my next blog I’ll be looking at what you can do to preserve your privacy. When you lose ground to this sort of creeping erosion of your rights, it can be really very hard to reclaim them, so it’s important that we all keep fighting.</p><hr><p>1: This blog refers to the UK App; screen shot shows the privacy information from Apple’s UK app store. Data collection may vary by country or region</p><p>2: I have asked McDonalds why they need my browsing history on several occasions, but so far, they have not responded</p><p>3: Don’t get hung-up on consent folks, it’s not needed if a business has what’s called a ‘legitimate interest’ – which can be a rather stretchy, elastic term when in the hands of less reputable businesses</p><p>4: Note that I don’t refer to it as ‘your data’ – that’s because it isn’t</p><p>5: Why Mark Zuckerberg buys up properties that surround his 10 homes: <br><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3009010/why-mark-zuckerberg-buys-properties-surround-his-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3009010/why-mark-zuckerberg-buys-properties-surround-his-10</a></p><p>6: After GDPR, The New York Times cut off ad exchanges in Europe — and kept growing ad revenue, Digiday, Jan 2019:<br><a href="https://digiday.com/media/gumgumtest-new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://digiday.com/media/gumgumtest-new-york-times-gdpr-cut-off-ad-exchanges-europe-ad-revenue/</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><hr><section><p><time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2023-09-01">September 01, 2023</time> • 839 words</p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/farewell-ec2-classic-header.jpg" alt="EC2-Classic in a museum gallery" loading="lazy"></p><p>Retiring services isn’t something we do at AWS. It’s quite rare. Companies rely on our offerings – their businesses literally live on these services – and it’s something that we take seriously. For example SimpleDB is still around, even though DynamoDB is the “NoSQL” DB of choice for our customers.</p><p>So, two years ago, when <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-classic-is-retiring-heres-how-to-prepare/">Jeff Barr announced that we’d be shutting down EC2-Classic</a>, I’m sure that there were at least <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27988964">a few of you</a> that didn’t believe we’d actually flip the switch — that we’d let it run forever. Well, that day has come. On August 15, 2023, we shut down the last instance of Classic. And with all of the history here, I think it’s worth celebrating the original version of one of the services that started what we now know as cloud computing.</p><p>EC2 has been around for quite a while, almost 17 years. Only SQS and S3 are older. So, I wouldn’t blame you if you were wondering what makes an EC2 instance “Classic”. Put simply, it’s the network architecture. When we launched EC2 in 2006, it was one giant network of 10.2.0.0/8. All instances ran on a single, flat network shared with other customers. It exposed a handful of features, like security groups and Public IP addresses that were assigned when an instance was spun up. Classic made the process of acquiring compute dead simple, even though the stack running behind the scenes was incredibly complex. “Invent and Simplify” is one of the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Amazon Leadership Principles</a> after all…</p><p>If you had launched an instance in 2006, an m1.small, you would have gotten a virtual CPU the equivalent of a 1.7 GHz Xeon processor with 1.75 GB of RAM, 160 GB of local disk, and 250 Mb/second of network bandwidth. And it would have cost just $0.10 per clocked hour. It’s quite incredible where cloud computing has gone since then, with a P3dn.24xlarge providing 100 Gbps of network throughput, 96 vCPUs, 8 NVIDIA v100 Tensor Core GPUs, 32 GiB of memory, and 1.8 TB of local SSD storage, not to mention an EFA to accelerate ML workloads.</p><p>But 2006 was a different time, and that flat network and small collection of instances, like the m1.small, was “Classic”. And at the time it was truly revolutionary. Hardware had become a programmable resource that you could scale up or down at a moment’s notice. Every developer, entrepreneur, startup and enterprise, now had access to as much compute as they wanted, whenever they wanted it. The complexities of managing infrastructure, buying new hardware, upgrading software, replacing failed disks — had been abstracted away. And it changed the way we all designed and built applications.</p><p>Of course the first thing I did when EC2 was launched was to move this blog to an M1.small. It was running <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Moveable Type</a> and the M1 was good enough run the server and the local (no RDS yet) database. Eventually I turned it into a highly-available service with RDS failover, etc., and it ran there for 5+ years until the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html">Amazon S3 Website feature</a> was released in 2011. The blog has now been “serverless” for the past 12 years.</p><p>Like we do with all of our services, we listened to what our customers needed next. This led us to adding features like Elastic IP addresses, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, CloudWatch, and various new instance types that would better suit different workloads. By 2013 we had enabled VPC, which allowed each AWS customer to manage their own slice of the cloud, secure, isolated, and defined for their business. And it became the new standard. It simply gave customers a new level of control that enabled them to build even more comprehensive systems in the cloud.</p><p>We continued to support Classic for the next decade, even as EC2 evolved and we implemented an entirely new virtualization platform, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/09/reinventing-virtualization-with-nitro.html">Nitro</a> — because our customers were using it.</p><p>Ten years ago, during my 2013 keynote at re:Invent, I told you that we wanted to “support today’s workloads as well as tomorrow’s,” and our commitment to Classic is the best evidence of that. It’s not lost on me, the amount of work that goes into an effort like this — but it is exactly this type of work that builds trust, and I’m proud of the way it has been handled. To me, this embodies what it means to be customer obsessed. The EC2 team kept Classic running (and running well) until every instance was shut down or migrated. Providing documentation, tools, and support from engineering and account management teams throughout the process.</p><p>It’s bittersweet to say goodbye to one of our original offerings. But we’ve come a long way since 2006 and we’re not done innovating for our customers. It’s a reminder that building evolvable systems is a strategy, and revisiting your architectures with an open mind is a must. So, farewell Classic, it’s been swell. Long live EC2.</p><p><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/farewell-ec2-classic-certificate.png" alt="Certificate of achievement" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, go build!</p><p>Recommended posts</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2019/08/modern-applications-at-aws.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=farewell+ec2+classic">Modern applications at AWS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=farewell+ec2+classic">Monoliths are not dinosaurs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/10/amazon_ec2_in_full_production.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=farewell+ec2+classic">Amazon EC2 in full production (2008)</a></li></ul></span></section><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>In December, Apple</span> said that it was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/">killing an effort</a> to design a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">privacy-preserving iCloud photo-scanning tool</a> for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the platform. Originally announced in August 2021, the project had been controversial since its inception. Apple had first paused it that September in response to concerns from digital rights groups and researchers that such a tool would inevitably be abused and exploited to compromise the privacy and security of all iCloud users. This week, a new child safety group known as Heat Initiative told Apple that it is organizing a campaign to demand that the company “detect, report, and remove” child sexual abuse material from iCloud and offer more tools for users to report CSAM to the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, in a rare move, Apple responded to Heat Initiative, outlining its reasons for abandoning the development of its iCloud CSAM scanning feature and instead focusing on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/">set of on-device tools and resources for users</a> known collectively as Communication Safety features. The company's response to Heat Initiative, which Apple shared with WIRED this morning, offers a rare look not just at its rationale for pivoting to Communication Safety, but at its broader views on creating mechanisms to circumvent user privacy protections, such as encryption, to monitor data. This stance is relevant to the encryption debate more broadly, especially as countries like the United Kingdom weigh passing laws that would require tech companies to be able to access user data to comply with law enforcement requests.</p><p>“Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to breaking the chain of coercion and influence that makes children susceptible to it,” Erik Neuenschwander, Apple's director of user privacy and child safety, wrote in the company's response to Heat Initiative. He added, though, that after collaborating with an array of privacy and security researchers, digital rights groups, and child safety advocates, the company concluded that it could not proceed with development of a CSAM-scanning mechanism, even one built specifically to preserve privacy.</p><p>“Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit," Neuenschwander wrote. "It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.”</p><p>Heat Initiative is led by Sarah Gardner, former vice president of external affairs for the nonprofit Thorn, which works to use new technologies to combat child exploitation online and sex trafficking. In 2021, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">Thorn lauded Apple's plan</a> to develop an iCloud CSAM scanning feature. Gardner said in an email to CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday, August 30, which Apple also shared with WIRED, that Heat Initiative found Apple's decision to kill the feature “disappointing.”</p><p>“Apple is one of the most successful companies in the world with an army of world-class engineers,” Gardner wrote in a statement to WIRED. “It is their responsibility to design a safe, privacy-forward environment that allows for the detection of known child sexual abuse images and videos. For as long as people can still share and store a known image of a child being raped in iCloud we will demand that they do better.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the email to Cook, Gardner wrote that Apple's photo-scanning tool “not only positioned Apple as a global leader in user privacy but also promised to eradicate millions of child sexual abuse images and videos from iCloud. … Child sexual abuse is a difficult issue that no one wants to talk about, which is why it gets silenced and left behind. We are here to make sure that doesn’t happen.”</p><p>Apple maintains that, ultimately, even its own well-intentioned design could not be adequately safeguarded in practice, and that on-device nudity detections for features like Messages, FaceTime, AirDrop, and the Photo picker are safer alternatives. Apple has also begun offering an application programming interface (API) for its Communication Safety features so third-party developers can incorporate them into their apps. Apple says that the communication platform Discord is integrating the features and that appmakers broadly have been enthusiastic about adopting them.</p><p>“We decided to not proceed with the proposal for a hybrid client-server approach to CSAM detection for iCloud Photos from a few years ago,” Neuenschwander wrote to Heat Initiative. “We concluded it was not practically possible to implement without ultimately imperiling the security and privacy of our users.”</p><p>On Heat Initiative's request that Apple create a CSAM reporting mechanism for users, the company told WIRED that its focus is on connecting its vulnerable or victimized users directly with local resources and law enforcement in their region that can assist them rather than Apple positioning itself as an intermediary for processing reports. The company says that offering this intermediary service may make sense for interactive platforms like social networks.</p><p>The need to protect children from online sexual abuse is urgent, though, and as these concerns intersect with the broader encryption debate, Apple's resolve on refusing to implement data scanning will continue to be tested.</p><p>Read the full exchange between Heat Initiative and Apple below.

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">JSONPath or jq?</h3>
<p dir="auto">For more complex parsing, filtering, and modifying of JSON data, jq is recommended due to the built-in operators and functions. Refer to the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more specifc information on jq.</p>
<p dir="auto">One big advantage of <code>jq</code> is that you can use logic in your JSON filter, such as filters to only show items that have a value greater than/less than etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the wiki <a href="https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help">https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help</a> for more information and examples</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parse JSON embedded in HTML!</h3>
<p dir="auto">When you enable a <code>json:</code> or <code>jq:</code> filter, you can even automatically extract and parse embedded JSON inside a HTML page! Amazingly handy for sites that build content based on JSON, such as many e-commerce websites.</p>
