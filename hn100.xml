<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!----><p>I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career. I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career. These two facts are not unrelated.</p>
<p>I build AI agent infrastructure for a living. I'm one of the core maintainers of <a href="https://openfga.dev/">OpenFGA</a> (CNCF Incubating), I built <a href="https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/agentic-authz">agentic-authz</a> for agent authorization, I built <a href="https://distill.siddhantkhare.com/">Distill</a> for context deduplication, I shipped MCP servers. I'm not someone who dabbles with AI on the side. I'm deep in it. I build the tools that other engineers use to make AI agents work in production.</p>
<p>And yet, I hit a wall. The kind of exhaustion that no amount of tooling or workflow optimization could fix.</p>
<p>If you're an engineer who uses AI daily - for design reviews, code generation, debugging, documentation, architecture decisions - and you've noticed that you're somehow more tired than before AI existed, this post is for you. You're not imagining it. You're not weak. You're experiencing something real that the industry is aggressively pretending doesn't exist. And if someone who builds agent infrastructure full-time can burn out on AI, it can happen to anyone.</p>
<p>I want to talk about it honestly. Not the "AI is amazing and here's my workflow" version. The real version. The one where you stare at your screen at 11pm, surrounded by AI-generated code you still need to review, wondering why the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/1.png" alt="An overwhelmed engineer surrounded by code, errors, and notifications"></p>
<h2>The paradox nobody warned us about</h2>
<p>Here's the thing that broke my brain for a while: AI genuinely makes individual tasks faster. That's not a lie. What used to take me 3 hours now takes 45 minutes. Drafting a design doc, scaffolding a new service, writing test cases, researching an unfamiliar API. All faster.</p>
<p>But my days got harder. Not easier. Harder.</p>
<p>The reason is simple once you see it, but it took me months to figure out. When each task takes less time, you don't do fewer tasks. You do more tasks. Your capacity appears to expand, so the work expands to fill it. And then some. Your manager sees you shipping faster, so the expectations adjust. You see yourself shipping faster, so your own expectations adjust. The baseline moves.</p>
<p>Before AI, I might spend a full day on one design problem. I'd sketch on paper, think in the shower, go for a walk, come back with clarity. The pace was slow but the cognitive load was manageable. One problem. One day. Deep focus.</p>
<p>Now? I might touch six different problems in a day. Each one "only takes an hour with AI." But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.</p>
<p>This is the paradox: <strong>AI reduces the cost of production but increases the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making. And those costs fall entirely on the human.</strong></p>
<h2>You became a reviewer and you didn't sign up for it</h2>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/3.png" alt="AI dropping code onto a conveyor belt faster than a human can review"></p>
<p>Before AI, my job was: think about a problem, write code, test it, ship it. I was the creator. The maker. That's what drew most of us to engineering in the first place - the act of building.</p>
<p>After AI, my job increasingly became: prompt, wait, read output, evaluate output, decide if output is correct, decide if output is safe, decide if output matches the architecture, fix the parts that don't, re-prompt, repeat. I became a reviewer. A judge. A quality inspector on an assembly line that never stops.</p>
<p>This is a fundamentally different kind of work. Creating is energizing. Reviewing is draining. There's research on this - the psychological difference between generative tasks and evaluative tasks. Generative work gives you flow states. Evaluative work gives you decision fatigue.</p>
<p>I noticed it first during a week where I was using AI heavily for a new microservice. By Wednesday, I couldn't make simple decisions anymore. What should this function be named? I didn't care. Where should this config live? I didn't care. My brain was full. Not from writing code - from judging code. Hundreds of small judgments, all day, every day.</p>
<p>The cruel irony is that AI-generated code requires more careful review than human-written code. When a colleague writes code, I know their patterns, their strengths, their blind spots. I can skim the parts I trust and focus on the parts I don't. With AI, every line is suspect. The code looks confident. It compiles. It might even pass tests. But it could be subtly wrong in ways that only surface in production, under load, at 3am.</p>
<p>So you read every line. And reading code you didn't write, that was generated by a system that doesn't understand your codebase's history or your team's conventions, is exhausting work.</p>
<p>This is also why I think agent security and authorization matter so much. If we can't review everything AI produces - and we can't, not at scale - then we need systems that constrain what agents can do in the first place. Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, audit trails. The less you have to worry about "did the AI do something dangerous," the more cognitive budget you have for the work that actually matters. This isn't just a security problem. It's a human sustainability problem.</p>
<h2>The nondeterminism problem</h2>
<p>Engineers are trained on determinism. Same input, same output. That's the contract. That's what makes debugging possible. That's what makes reasoning about systems possible.</p>
<p>AI broke that contract.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/4.png" alt="Same prompt, same AI, different results - clean code or spaghetti"></p>
<p>I had a prompt that worked perfectly on Monday. Generated clean, well-structured code for an API endpoint. I used the same prompt on Tuesday for a similar endpoint. The output was structurally different, used a different error handling pattern, and introduced a dependency I didn't ask for.</p>
<p>Why? No reason. Or rather, no reason I can access. There's no stack trace for "the model decided to go a different direction today." There's no log that says "temperature sampling chose path B instead of path A." It just... happened differently.</p>
<p>For someone whose entire career is built on "if it broke, I can find out why," this is deeply unsettling. Not in a dramatic way. In a slow, grinding, background-anxiety way. You can never fully trust the output. You can never fully relax. Every interaction requires vigilance.</p>
<p>I tried to fight this. I version-controlled my prompts. I built elaborate system messages. I created templates. Some of it helped. None of it solved the fundamental problem: <strong>you are collaborating with a probabilistic system, and your brain is wired for deterministic ones.</strong> That mismatch is a constant, low-grade source of stress.</p>
<p>This frustration is actually what led me to build <a href="https://distill.siddhantkhare.com/">Distill</a> - deterministic context deduplication for LLMs. No LLM calls, no embeddings, no probabilistic heuristics. Pure algorithms that clean your context in ~12ms. I wanted at least one part of the AI pipeline to be something I could reason about, debug, and trust. If the model's output is going to be nondeterministic, the least I can do is make sure the input is clean and predictable.</p>
<p>The engineers I've talked to who handle this best are the ones who've made peace with it. They treat AI output like a first draft from a smart but unreliable intern. They expect to rewrite 30% of it. They budget time for that rewriting. They don't get frustrated when the output is wrong because they never expected it to be right. They expected it to be useful. There's a difference.</p>
<h2>The FOMO treadmill</h2>
<p>Take a breath and try to keep up with just the last few months. Claude Code ships sub-agents, then skills, then an Agent SDK, then Claude Cowork. OpenAI launches Codex CLI, then GPT-5.3-Codex - a model that literally helped code itself. New coding agents announce background mode with hundreds of concurrent autonomous sessions. Google drops Gemini CLI. GitHub adds an MCP Registry. Acquisitions happen weekly. Amazon Q Developer gets agentic upgrades. CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, MetaGPT - pick your agent framework, there's a new one every week. Google announces A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol) to compete with Anthropic's MCP. OpenAI ships its own Swarm framework. Kimi K2.5 drops with agent swarm architecture orchestrating 100 parallel agents. "Vibe coding" becomes a thing. OpenClaw launches a skills marketplace and within one week, researchers find 400+ malicious agent skills uploaded to ClawHub. And somewhere in the middle of all this, someone on LinkedIn posts "if you're not using AI agents with sub-agent orchestration in 2026, you're already obsolete."</p>
<p>That's not a year. That's a few months. And I'm leaving stuff out.</p>
<p>I fell into this trap hard. I was spending weekends evaluating new tools. Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.</p>
<p>Here's what that actually looked like: I'd spend Saturday afternoon setting up a new AI coding tool. By Sunday I'd have a basic workflow. By the following Wednesday, someone would post about a different tool that was "way better." I'd feel a pang of anxiety. By the next weekend, I'd be setting up the new thing. The old thing would sit unused. One coding assistant to the next to the next and back to the first one. Each migration cost me a weekend and gave me maybe a 5% improvement that I couldn't even measure properly.</p>
<p>Multiply this by every category - coding assistants, chat interfaces, agent frameworks, multi-agent orchestration platforms, MCP servers, context management tools, prompt libraries, swarm architectures, skills marketplaces - and you get a person who is perpetually learning new tools and never getting deep with any of them. The Hacker News front page alone is enough to give you whiplash. One day it's "Show HN: Autonomous Research Swarm" and the next it's "Ask HN: How will AI swarms coordinate?" Nobody knows. Everyone's building anyway.</p>
<p>The worst part is the knowledge decay. I spent two weeks building a sophisticated prompt engineering workflow in early 2025. Carefully crafted system prompts, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought templates. It worked well. Three months later, the model updated, the prompting best practices shifted, and half my templates produced worse results than a simple one-liner. Those two weeks were gone. Not invested. Spent. The same thing happened with my MCP server setup - I built five custom servers (Dev.to publisher, Apple Notes integration, Python and TypeScript sandboxes, more), then the protocol evolved, then the MCP Registry launched on GitHub and suddenly there were thousands of pre-built ones. Some of my custom work became redundant overnight.</p>
<p>The agent framework churn is even worse. I watched teams go from LangChain to CrewAI to AutoGen to custom orchestration in the span of a year. Each migration meant rewriting integrations, relearning APIs, rebuilding workflows. The people who waited and did nothing often ended up in a better position than the people who adopted early and had to migrate twice.</p>
<p>I've since adopted a different approach. Instead of chasing every new tool, I go deep on the infrastructure layer underneath them. Tools come and go. The problems they solve don't. Context efficiency, agent authorization, audit trails, runtime security - these are durable problems regardless of which framework is trending this month. That's why I built <a href="https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/agentic-authz">agentic-authz</a> on OpenFGA instead of tying it to any specific agent framework. That's why Distill works at the context level, not the prompt level. Build on the layer that doesn't churn.</p>
<p>I still track the landscape closely - you have to when you're building infrastructure for it. But I track it to understand where the ecosystem is going, not to adopt every new thing. There's a difference between being informed and being reactive.</p>
<h2>The "just one more prompt" trap</h2>
<p>This one is insidious. You're trying to get AI to generate something specific. The first output is 70% right. So you refine your prompt. The second output is 75% right but broke something the first one had correct. Third attempt: 80% right but now the structure is different. Fourth attempt: you've been at this for 45 minutes and you could have written the thing from scratch in 20.</p>
<p>I call this the prompt spiral. It's the AI equivalent of yak shaving. You started with a clear goal. Thirty minutes later you're debugging your prompt instead of debugging your code. You're optimizing your instructions to a language model instead of solving the actual problem.</p>
<p>The prompt spiral is especially dangerous because it feels productive. You're iterating. You're getting closer. Each attempt is slightly better. But the marginal returns are diminishing fast, and you've lost sight of the fact that the goal was never "get the AI to produce perfect output." The goal was to ship the feature.</p>
<p>I now have a hard rule: three attempts. If the AI doesn't get me to 70% usable in three prompts, I write it myself. No exceptions. This single rule has saved me more time than any prompting technique I've ever learned.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism meets probabilistic output</h2>
<p>Engineers tend toward perfectionism. We like clean code. We like tests that pass. We like systems that behave predictably. This is a feature, not a bug - it's what makes us good at building reliable software.</p>
<p>AI output is never perfect. It's always "pretty good." 70-80% there. The variable names are slightly off. The error handling is incomplete. The edge cases are ignored. The abstraction is wrong for your codebase. It works, but it's not right.</p>
<p>For a perfectionist, this is torture. Because "almost right" is worse than "completely wrong." Completely wrong, you throw away and start over. Almost right, you spend an hour tweaking. And tweaking AI output is uniquely frustrating because you're fixing someone else's design decisions - decisions that were made by a system that doesn't share your taste, your context, or your standards.</p>
<p>I had to learn to let go. Not of quality - I still care about quality. But of the expectation that AI would produce quality. I now treat every AI output as a rough draft. A starting point. Raw material. I mentally label it "draft" the moment it appears, and that framing change alone reduced my frustration by half.</p>
<p>The engineers who struggle most with AI are often the best engineers. The ones with the highest standards. The ones who notice every imperfection. AI rewards a different skill: the ability to extract value from imperfect output quickly, without getting emotionally invested in making it perfect.</p>
<h2>The thinking atrophy</h2>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/5.png" alt="A brain on a couch watching AI, its thinking muscles covered in cobwebs"></p>
<p>This is the one that scares me most.</p>
<p>I noticed it during a design review meeting. Someone asked me to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard. No laptop. No AI. Just me and a marker. And I struggled. Not because I didn't know the concepts - I did. But because I hadn't exercised that muscle in months. I'd been outsourcing my first-draft thinking to AI for so long that my ability to think from scratch had degraded.</p>
<p>It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes. After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening with AI and engineering thinking. When you always ask AI first, you stop building the neural pathways that come from struggling with a problem yourself. The struggle is where learning happens. The confusion is where understanding forms. Skip that, and you get faster output but shallower understanding.</p>
<p>I now deliberately spend the first hour of my day without AI. I think on paper. I sketch architectures by hand. I reason through problems the slow way. It feels inefficient. It is inefficient. But it keeps my thinking sharp, and that sharpness pays dividends for the rest of the day when I do use AI - because I can evaluate its output better when my own reasoning is warmed up.</p>
<h2>The comparison trap</h2>
<p>Social media is full of people who seem to have AI figured out. They post their workflows. Their productivity numbers. Their "I built this entire app in 2 hours with AI" threads. And you look at your own experience - the failed prompts, the wasted time, the code you had to rewrite - and you think: what's wrong with me?</p>
<p>Nothing is wrong with you. Those threads are highlight reels. Nobody posts "I spent 3 hours trying to get Claude to understand my database schema and eventually gave up and wrote the migration by hand." Nobody posts "AI-generated code caused a production incident because it silently swallowed an error." Nobody posts "I'm tired."</p>
<p>The comparison trap is amplified by the fact that AI skill is hard to measure. With traditional engineering, you can look at someone's code and roughly gauge their ability. With AI, the output depends on the model, the prompt, the context, the temperature, the phase of the moon. Someone's impressive demo might not reproduce on your machine with your codebase.</p>
<p>I became much more selective about AI content on social media. I still follow the space closely - I have to, it's my job. But I shifted from consuming everyone's hot takes to focusing on people who are actually building and shipping, not just demoing. The ratio of signal to anxiety matters. If a feed is making you feel behind instead of informed, it's not serving you.</p>
<h2>What actually helped</h2>
<p>I'll be specific about what changed my relationship with AI from adversarial to sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Time-boxing AI sessions.</strong> I don't use AI in an open-ended way anymore. I set a timer. 30 minutes for this task with AI. When the timer goes off, I ship what I have or switch to writing it myself. This prevents the prompt spiral and the perfectionism trap simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Separating AI time from thinking time.</strong> Morning is for thinking. Afternoon is for AI-assisted execution. This isn't rigid - sometimes I break the rule. But having a default structure means my brain gets both exercise and assistance in the right proportions.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting 70% from AI.</strong> I stopped trying to get perfect output. 70% usable is the bar. I'll fix the rest myself. This acceptance was the single biggest reducer of AI-related frustration in my workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Being strategic about the hype cycle.</strong> I track the AI landscape because I build infrastructure for it. But I stopped adopting every new tool the week it launches. I use one primary coding assistant and know it deeply. I evaluate new tools when they've proven themselves over months, not days. Staying informed and staying reactive are different things.</p>
<p><strong>Logging where AI helps and where it doesn't.</strong> I kept a simple log for two weeks: task, used AI (yes/no), time spent, satisfaction with result. The data was revealing. AI saved me significant time on boilerplate, documentation, and test generation. It cost me time on architecture decisions, complex debugging, and anything requiring deep context about my codebase. Now I know when to reach for it and when not to.</p>
<p><strong>Not reviewing everything AI produces.</strong> This was hard to accept. But if you're using AI to generate large amounts of code, you physically cannot review every line with the same rigor. I focus my review energy on the parts that matter most - security boundaries, data handling, error paths - and rely on automated tests and static analysis for the rest. Some roughness in non-critical code is acceptable.</p>
<h2>The sustainability question</h2>
<p>The tech industry has a burnout problem that predates AI. AI is making it worse, not better. Not because AI is bad, but because AI removes the natural speed limits that used to protect us.</p>
<p>Before AI, there was a ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by typing speed, thinking speed, the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. You couldn't work yourself to death because the work itself imposed limits.</p>
<p>AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people don't know their cognitive limits until they've blown past them.</p>
<p>I burned out in late 2025. Not dramatically - I didn't quit or have a breakdown. I just stopped caring. Code reviews became rubber stamps. Design decisions became "whatever AI suggests." I was going through the motions, producing more than ever, feeling less than ever. It took me a month to realize what had happened and another month to recover.</p>
<p>The recovery wasn't about using less AI. It was about using AI differently. With boundaries. With intention. With the understanding that I am not a machine and I don't need to keep pace with one. Working at <a href="https://ona.com/">Ona</a> helped me see this clearly - when you're building AI agent infrastructure for enterprise customers, you see the human cost of unsustainable AI workflows at scale. The problems aren't just personal. They're systemic. And they need to be solved at the tooling level, not just the individual level.</p>
<p>Ironically, the burnout period is when some of my best work happened. When I stopped trying to use every AI tool and started thinking about what was actually broken, I saw the problems clearly for the first time. Context windows filling up with garbage - that became Distill. Agents with all-or-nothing API key access - that became agentic-authz. The inability to audit what an agent actually did - that's becoming AgentTrace. The fatigue forced me to stop consuming and start building. Not building more features faster, but building the right things deliberately.</p>
<h2>The real skill</h2>
<p>Here's what I think the real skill of the AI era is. It's not prompt engineering. It's not knowing which model to use. It's not having the perfect workflow.</p>
<p>It's knowing when to stop.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/6.png" alt="A hand pulling the STOP switch - good enough, ship it, go outside, rest"></p>
<p>Knowing when the AI output is good enough. Knowing when to write it yourself. Knowing when to close the laptop. Knowing when the marginal improvement isn't worth the cognitive cost. Knowing that your brain is a finite resource and that protecting it is not laziness - it's engineering.</p>
<p>We optimize our systems for sustainability. We add circuit breakers. We implement backpressure. We design for graceful degradation. We should do the same for ourselves.</p>
<p>AI is the most powerful tool I've ever used. It's also the most draining. Both things are true. The engineers who thrive in this era won't be the ones who use AI the most. They'll be the ones who use it the most wisely.</p>
<p>If you're tired, it's not because you're doing it wrong. It's because this is genuinely hard. The tool is new, the patterns are still forming, and the industry is pretending that more output equals more value. It doesn't. Sustainable output does.</p>
<p>I'm still building in this space every day. Agent authorization, context engineering, audit trails, runtime security - the infrastructure that makes AI agents actually work in production. I'm more committed to AI than ever. But I'm committed on my terms, at my pace, building things that matter instead of chasing things that trend.</p>
<p>Take care of your brain. It's the only one you've got, and no AI can replace it.</p>

		<p>If you use an Apple silicon Mac I’m sure you have been impressed by its performance. Whether you’re working with images, audio, video or building software, we’ve enjoyed a new turn of speed since the M1 on day 1. While most attribute this to their Performance cores, as it goes with the name, much is in truth the result of the unsung Efficiency cores, and how they keep background tasks where they should be.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, start your Apple silicon Mac up from the cold, and open Activity Monitor in its CPU view, with its CPU History window open as well. For the first five to ten minutes you’ll see its E cores are a wall of red and green with Spotlight’s indexing services, CGPDFService, mediaanalysisd, BackgroundShortcutRunner, Siri components, its initial Time Machine backup, and often an XProtect Remediator scan. Meanwhile its P cores are largely idle, and if you were to dive straight into using your working apps, there’s plenty of capacity for them to run unaffected by all that background mayhem.</p>

<p>It’s this stage that scares those who are still accustomed to using Intel Macs. Seeing processes using more than 100% CPU is terrifying, because they know that Intel cores can struggle under so much load, affecting user apps. But on an Apple silicon Mac, who notices or cares that there’s over a dozen mdworker processes each taking a good 50% CPU simultaneously? After all, this is what the Apple silicon architecture is designed for. Admittedly the impression isn’t helped by a dreadful piece of psychology, as those E cores at 100% are probably running at a frequency a quarter of those of P cores shown at the same 100%, making visual comparison <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/08/why-cpu-in-activity-monitor-isnt-what-you-think/">completely false</a>.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Apple brought it to the iPhone 7 in 2016, in its first SoC with separate P and E cores. That’s an implementation of Arm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE" target="_blank">big.LITTLE</a> announced in 2011, and <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8368" target="_blank">development work at Cray</a> and elsewhere in the previous decade. What makes the difference in Apple silicon Macs is how threads are allocated to the two different CPU core types on the basis of a metric known as <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/05/09/what-is-quality-of-service-and-how-does-it-matter/">Quality of Service</a>, or QoS.</p>
<p>As with so much in today’s Macs, QoS has been around since <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/qualityofservice" target="_blank">OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a>, six years before it became so central in performance. When all CPU cores are the same, it has limited usefulness over more traditional controls like Posix’s <code>nice</code> scheduling priority. All those background tasks still have to be completed, and giving them a lower priority only prolongs the time they take on the CPU cores, and the period in which the user’s apps are competing with them for CPU cycles.</p>
<p>With the experience gained from its iPhones and other devices, Apple’s engineers had a better solution for future Macs. In addition to providing priority-based queues, QoS makes a fundamental distinction between those threads run in the foreground, and those of the background. While foreground threads will be run on P cores when they’re available, they can also be scheduled on E cores when necessary. But background threads aren’t normally allowed to run on P cores, even if they’re delayed by the load on the E cores they’re restricted to. We know this from our inability to promote existing background threads to run on P cores using St. Clair Software’s <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Tamer</a> and the command tool <code>taskpolicy</code>.</p>
<p>This is why, even if you sit and watch all those background processes loading the E cores immediately after starting up, leaving the P cores mostly idle, macOS won’t try running them on its P cores. If it did, even if you wanted it to, the distinction between foreground and background, P and E cores would start to fall apart, our apps would suffer as a consequence, and battery endurance would decline. Gone are the days of <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/10/what-to-do-when-a-process-is-using-excessive-cpu/">crashing mdworker processes</a> bringing our Macs to their knees with a spinning beachball every few seconds.</p>
<p>If seeing all those processes using high % CPU can look scary, the inevitable consequence in terms of software architecture might seem terrifying. Rather than building monolithic apps, many of their tasks are now broken out into discrete processes run in the background on demand, on the E cores when appropriate. The fact that an idle Mac has over 2,000 threads running in over 600 processes is good news, and the more of those that are run on the E cores, the faster our apps will be. The first and last M-series chips to have only two E cores were the M1 Pro and Max, since when every one has had at least four E cores, and some as many as six or eight.</p>
<p>Because Efficiency cores get the background threads off the cores we need for performance.</p>

<p>What if this is as good as software is ever going to be? What if AI stops getting better and what if people stop caring?</p>

<p>Imagine if this is as good as AI gets. If this is where it stops, you'd still have models that can almost code a web browser, almost code a compiler—and can even present a pretty cool demo if allowed to take a few shortcuts. You'd still get models that can kinda-sorta simulate worlds and write kinda-sorta engaging stories. You'd still get self-driving cars that almost work, except when they don't. You get AI that can make you like 90% of a thing!</p>
<p>90% is a lot. Will you care about the last 10%?</p>
<p>I'm terrified that you won't.</p>
<p>I'm terrified of the <em>good enough to ship</em>—and I'm terrified of nobody else caring. I'm less afraid of AI agents writing apps that they will never experience than I am of the AI herders who won't care enough to actually learn what they ship. And I sure as hell am afraid of the people who will experience the slop and will be fine with it.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://ezhik.jp/losing-the-plot-that-was-never-there">woodworking enthusiast</a> I am slowly making my peace with standing in the middle of an IKEA. But at the rate things are going in this dropshipping hell, IKEA would be the dream. Software <em>temufication</em> stings much more than software commoditization.</p>

<p>I think Claude and friends can help with crafting good software and with learning new technologies and programming languages—though I sure as hell move slower when I stop to learn and understand than the guy playing Dwarf Fortress with 17 agents. But at the same time AI models seem to constantly nudge towards that same median Next-React-Tailwind, <em>good enough</em> app. These things just don't handle going off the beaten path well.</p>

										<figcaption>Spend all the tokens you want, trying to make something unique like Paper by FiftyThree with AI tools will just end up looking normal and uninspired.</figcaption>
									</figure>
								
<p>Mind you, it's not like slop is anything new. A lot of human decisions had to happen before your backside ended up in an extremely uncomfortable chair, your search results got polluted by poorly-written SEO-optimized articles, and your brain had to deal with a ticket booking website with a user interface so poorly designed that it made you cry. So it's a people problem. Incentives just don't seem to align to make good software. Move fast and break things, etc, etc. You'll make a little artisan app, and if it's any good, Google will come along with a free clone, kill you, then kill its clone—and the world will be left with net zero new good software. And now, with AI agents, it gets even worse as agent herders can do the same thing much faster.</p>
<p>Developers aside, there's also the users. AI models can't be imaginative, and the developers can't afford to, but surely with AI tools, the gap between <em>users</em> and <em>developers</em> will be bridged, ChatGPT will become the new HyperCard and people will turn their ideas into reality with just a few sentences? There's so many people out there who are coding without knowing it, from Carol in Accounting making insane Excel spreadsheets to all the kids on TikTok automating their phones with Apple Shortcuts and hacking up cool Notion notebooks.</p>
<p>But what if those people are an aberration? What if this state of <em>tech learned helplessness</em> cannot be fixed? What if people really do just want a glorified little TV in their pocket? What if most people truly just don't care about tech problems, about privacy, about Liquid Glass, about Microsoft's upsells, about constantly dealing with apps and features which just <em>don't work</em>? What if there will be nobody left to carry the torch? What if the future of computing belongs not to artisan developers or Carol from Accounting, but to whoever can churn out the most software out the fastest? What if <em>good enough</em> really is good enough for most people?</p>
<p>I'm terrified that our craft will die, and nobody will even care to mourn it.</p> <h2>🦔 🦔 🦔</h2> <center><sub><time>2026-02-08</time>  • <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Ezhik/116034520904489092">Discuss on Mastodon</a> • <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:png3xhpd6ccblcrcrxsxmfrs/post/3medprdipoc2l">Discuss on Bluesky</a></sub></center></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The modern Olympics sell themselves on a simple premise: the whole world, watching the same moment, at the same time. On Friday night in Milan, that illusion fractured in real time.</p><p>When Team USA entered the San Siro during the parade of nations, the speed skater Erin Jackson led the delegation into a wall of cheers. Moments later, when cameras cut to US vice-president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance, large sections of the crowd responded with boos. Not subtle ones, but audible and sustained ones. <a href="https://x.com/donkoclock/status/2019887497891696788" data-link-name="in body link">Canadian viewers heard them</a>. Journalists seated in the press tribunes in the upper deck, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/06/intimate-and-enormous-milano-cortina-opening-ceremony-winter-olympics-2026" data-link-name="in body link">myself included</a>, clearly <a href="https://x.com/cbrennansports/status/2019884436121125181" data-link-name="in body link">heard them</a>. But as I quickly realized from a groupchat with friends back home, American viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Um9gPUoA0" data-link-name="in body link">watching NBC did not</a>.</p><figure id="60a9b2dc-fbb1-42da-a579-ddbed3a0a525" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:2,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;NBC appears to cut crowd’s booing of JD Vance from Winter Olympics broadcast&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;60a9b2dc-fbb1-42da-a579-ddbed3a0a525&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/06/nbc-appears-to-cut-crowds-booing-of-jd-vance-from-winter-olympics-broadcast&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:8,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:2}}"></gu-island></figure><p>On its own, the situation might once have passed unnoticed. But the defining feature of the modern sports media landscape is that no single broadcaster controls the moment any more. CBC carried it. The BBC liveblogged it. <a href="https://x.com/donkoclock/status/2019887497891696788" data-link-name="in body link">Fans clipped it</a>. Within minutes, multiple versions of the same happening were circulating online – some with boos, some without – turning what might once have been a routine production call into a case study in information asymmetry.</p><p>For its part, <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/denies-editing-jd-vance-boos-olympics-opening-ceremony-audio.html" data-link-name="in body link">NBC has denied</a> editing the crowd audio, although it is difficult to resolve why the boos so audible in the stadium and on other broadcasts were absent for US viewers. But in a broader sense, it is becoming harder, not easier, to curate reality when the rest of the world is holding up its own camera angles. And that raises an uncomfortable question as the United States moves toward hosting two of the largest sporting events on the planet: the 2026 men’s World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p><p>If a US administration figure is booed at the Olympics in Los Angeles, or a World Cup match in New Jersey or Dallas, will American domestic broadcasts simply mute or avoid mentioning the crowd audio? If so, what happens when the world feed, or a foreign broadcaster, shows something else entirely? What happens when 40,000 phones in the stadium upload their own version in real time?</p><p>The risk is not just that viewers will see through it. It is that attempts to manage the narrative will make American broadcasters look less credible, not more. Because the audience now assumes there is always another angle. Every time a broadcaster makes that trade – credibility for insulation – it is a trade audiences eventually notice.</p><p>There is also a deeper structural pressure behind decisions like this. The Trump era has been defined in part by sustained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/trump-sues-media-outlets-bias" data-link-name="in body link">hostility toward media institutions</a>. Broadcasters do not operate in a vacuum; they operate inside regulatory environments, political climates and corporate risk calculations. When presidents and their allies openly threaten or target networks, it is naive to pretend that has no downstream effect on editorial choices – especially in high-stakes live broadcasts tied to billion-dollar rights deals.</p><p>But there is a difference between contextual pressure and visible reality distortion. When global audiences can compare feeds in real time, the latter begins to resemble something else entirely: not editorial judgment, but narrative management. Which is why comparisons to Soviet-style state-controlled broadcasting models – once breathless rhetorical exaggerations – are starting to feel less hyperbolic.</p><p>The irony is that the Olympics themselves are built around the idea that sport can exist alongside political tension without pretending it does not exist. The International Olympic Committee’s own language – athletes should not be punished for governments’ actions – implicitly acknowledges that governments are part of the Olympic theater whether organizers like it or not.</p><p>Friday night illustrated that perfectly. American athletes were cheered, their enormous contingent given one of the most full-throated receptions of the night. The political emissaries were not universally welcomed. Both things can be true at once. Crowd dissent is not a failure of the Olympic ideal. In open societies, it is part of how public sentiment is expressed. Attempting to erase one side of that equation risks flattening reality into something audiences no longer trust. And if Milan was a warning shot, Los Angeles is the main event.</p><p>Since Donald Trump’s first term, American political coverage around sport has fixated on the micro-moments: Was the president booed or cheered? Did the broadcast show it? Did he attend or skip events likely to produce hostile crowds? The discourse has often felt like a Rorschach test, filtered through partisan interpretation and selective clips.</p><p>The LA Olympics will be something else entirely. There is no hiding from an opening ceremony. No ducking a stadium when the Olympic Charter requires the host country’s head of state to officially declare the Games open. No controlling how 200 international broadcasters carry the moment.</p><p>If Trump is still in the White House in mid-2028, one month after his 82nd birthday and in the thick of another heated US presidential campaign, he will stand in front of a global television audience as a key part of the opening ceremony. He will do so in California, in a political environment far less friendly than many domestic sporting venues he has appeared in over the past decade. And he will do it in a city synonymous with the political opposition, potentially in the back yard of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/gavin-newsom-2028-presidential-race" data-link-name="in body link">the Democratic presidential candidate</a>.</p><p>There will be some cheers. There will almost certainly be boos. There will be everything in between. And there will be no way to make them disappear. The real risk for American broadcasters is not that dissent will be visible. It is that audiences will start assuming anything they do not show is being hidden. In an era when trust in institutions is already fragile, that is a dangerous place to operate from.</p><p>The Olympics have always been political, whether through boycotts, protests, symbolic gestures or crowd reactions. What has changed is not the politics. It is the impossibility of containing the optics.</p><p>Milan may ultimately be remembered as a small moment – a few seconds of crowd noise during a long ceremony. But it also felt like a preview of the next phase of global sport broadcasting: one where narrative control is shared, contested and instantly verifiable. The world is watching. And this time, it is also recording.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2 id="232-halftime-release">23.2 Halftime Release</h2>

<p>Hello again!</p>

<p>The last few months have been quite the endeavor, as we have been busy rebasing and updating LineageOS, on not one but two large AOSP releases. Nevertheless, we have persevered and are pleased to present LineageOS 23.2.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-aosp">Changes in AOSP</h3>

<p>Over the last few years, AOSP has been shifting to a quarterly release cadence, meaning that new features and bug fixes are released every three months. Google recently announced that AOSP will be shifting to a biannual release cadence, meaning that the latest fixes and features will drop every six months now.</p>

<p>Android Security Bulletins will still be released, and picked to all supported LineageOS versions monthly.</p>

<p>While this change does not significantly alter our development process, it is worth noting that LineageOS will adopt a six-month cadence, with work on each new point release starting every six months.</p>

<h3 id="whats-changed">What’s Changed</h3>

<p>When you install or upgrade to this release, you will immediately notice the new UI and color scheme. This is because LineageOS is now officially using Google’s Material Expressive design system which focuses on expressive colors, and emotive design elements.</p>

<p>In addition, you may notice the updated UI of the Quick Settings panel, which now contains fully customizable tiles, which in our opinion are much more pleasant to use! In this release, you will also find an expanded dark theme, and more powerful file utilities surrounding private spaces.</p>

<h3 id="updated-apps">Updated Apps</h3>

<p>This release mainly focuses on the Material Expressive design language, and in the interest of keeping up with these guidelines, we have been working diligently at updating the default apps to Material Expressive.</p>

<h4 id="updater">Updater</h4>

<p>Contributor pjgowtham has been hard at work on updating the Updater app, and when those changes are merged, you will be treated to a completely redesigned UI, improved update management, delightful animations and various bugs fixed. It wasn’t quite ready for the 23.2 launch, but will be soon, so be on the lookout!</p>

<h4 id="other-apps">Other apps</h4>

<p>In addition to the Updater, Twelve (the default music app), Deskclock and ExactCalculator have received Material 3 Expressive updates, which brings them into the modern era. Stay tuned for similar updates to the other default apps!</p>

<h3 id="development-tools">Development Tools</h3>

<p>In the previous release changelog, we teased some development tools that were in the midst of being reviewed. These have now been merged, and developers have some new tools in their arsenal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>beautify_rro.py</code>: Beautifies multiple existing RROs given a directory.</li>
  <li><code>generate_rro.py</code>: Extracts RROs from a prebuilt overlays directory.</li>
  <li><code>update_certificates.py</code>: Updates app certificates given a stock dump directory.</li>
  <li><code>decompile_cil.py</code>: Extracts sepolicy rules from a prebuilt SELinux image.</li>
  <li><code>extract_aconfig.py</code>: Extracts config files from stock dumps.</li>
  <li><code>match_manifest_tarball.py</code>: Matches kernel (or source) tarball releases against public Git history.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leadership-changes">Leadership Changes</h3>

<p>After roughly seven years with Lineage, and another five with CyanogenMod, we’re sad to announce Rashed is stepping away from the project to spend more time offline. We wish him the best!</p>

<p>We’re also glad to announce that the current directors group have voted Nolen Johnson (npjohnson) in as the ninth director. Welcome!</p>

<h3 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h3>

<p>Overall, we feel that the 23.2 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 23.0 and is
ready for initial release.</p>

<p>We will still allow new LineageOS 21 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we will continue our policy of no longer
allowing newly submitted LineageOS 21 devices to ship.</p>

<p>LineageOS 23.2 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to
come as they meet the requirements specified by the
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md">Charter</a> and are
marked as ready for builds by their maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-to-lineageos-232">Upgrading to LineageOS 23.2</h3>

<p>To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> and then on “Upgrade to a higher version of LineageOS”.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole’ install guide for your
device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> by clicking on your device and then on “Installation”.</p>

<p>Please note that if you’re currently on an official build, you <em>DO NOT</em> need to wipe your device,
unless your device’s wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with
massive changes, such as a repartition.</p>

<h3 id="developers-developers-developers">Developers, Developers, Developers</h3>

<p>Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!</p>

<p>If you’re a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it’s easier than ever.
Just follow the instructions <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but
are no longer supported - seriously - even if it’s not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe
we can help you complete it.</p>

<p>After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you’ll receive some
feedback on your device submission; and if it’s up to par, you’ll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS’s official repositories.</p>

<p>Don’t have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots
of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/contributing-apps/">improve them</a>, or you can
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/contributing_wiki">contribute to the wiki</a> by adding
more useful information &amp; documentation.
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html">Gerrit</a> is always open for submissions! Once
you’ve contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we’ll
get you in the loop.</p>

<p>Also, if you sent a submission that didn’t get a response in the last few months, please follow up,
we’ve swapped providers again!</p>

<h3 id="generic-targets">Generic Targets</h3>

<p>We’ve talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.</p>

<p>Although we’ve had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to
developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we’ve documented how to use
them in conjunction with the Android
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html">Emulator/Android Studio</a>!</p>

<p>Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations,
and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google’s
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>.
We won’t be providing official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies
entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble’s requirements, but feel
free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!</p>

<p>Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy all later Android versions) diverged GSI and Emulator
targets. Emulator targets reside in <code>lineage_sdk_$arch</code>, while GSI targets reside in
<code>lineage_gsi_$arch</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, experimental targets now exist for QEMU-based virtual machine software (libvirt,
UTM, etc). Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?</p>

<p>If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate">our wiki</a> and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we’ll take
the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.</p>

<p>Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/beyond-agentic-coding">https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/beyond-agentic-coding</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46930565">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm generally pretty pro-AI with one major exception: agentic coding.  My consistent impression is that agentic coding does not actually improve productivity and deteriorates the user's comfort and familiarity with the codebase.  I formed that impression from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/my-experience-with-vibe-coding">my own personal experiences</a></p>
<p>Every time I use agentic coding tools I'm consistently unimpressed with the quality of the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my experiences interviewing candidates</p>
<p>I allow interview candidates to use agentic coding tools and candidates who do so consistently performed <em>worse</em> than other candidates, failing to complete the challenge or producing incorrect results<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.  This was a huge surprise to me at first because I expected agentic coding to confer an unfair advantage but … nope!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>research studies</p>
<p>Studies like the <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">Becker study</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245">Shen study</a> show that users of agentic coding perform no better and sometimes worse when you measure productivity in terms of fixed outcomes rather than code velocity/volume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe agentic coding is a lost cause, but I do believe agentic coding in its present incarnation is doing more harm than good to software development.  I also believe it is still worthwhile to push on the inadequacies of agentic coding so that it empowers developers and improves code quality.</p>
<p>However, in this post I'm taking a different tack: I want to present other ways to leverage AI for software development.  I believe that agentic coding has so captured the cultural imagination that people are sleeping on other good and underexplored solutions to AI-assisted software development.</p>
<h2>The master cue</h2>
<p>I like to design tools and interfaces from first principles rather than reacting to industry trends/hype and I've accrued quite a few general design principles from over a decade of working in DevProd and also an even longer history of open source projects and contributions.</p>
<p>One of those design principles is my personal "master cue", which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good tool or interface should keep the user in a flow state as long as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle isn't even specific to AI-assisted software development, and yet still highlights why agentic coding sometimes misses the mark.  Both studies and developer testimonials show that agentic coding breaks flow and keeps developers in an idle/interruptible holding pattern more than ordinary coding.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089">Becker study</a> took screen recordings and saw that idle time approximately doubled:</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/idle-time.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I believe we can improve AI-assisted coding tools (agentic or not) if we set our north star to “preserve flow state”.</p>
<h2>Calm technology</h2>
<p><a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm technology</a> is a design discipline that promotes flow state in tools that we build.  The design principles most relevant to coding are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tools should minimize demands on our attention</p>
<p>Interruptions and intrusions on our attention break us out of flow state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools should be built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>A tool is not meant to be the object of our attention; rather the tool should <em>reveal</em> the true object of our attention (the thing the tool acts upon), rather than obscuring it.  The more we use the tool the more the tool fades into the background of our awareness while still supporting our work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools should create and enhance calm (thus the name: calm technology)</p>
<p>A state of calm helps users enter and maintain flow state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-LLM examples of calm technology</h2>
<p>Engineers already use “calm” tools and interfaces as part of our work and here are a couple of examples you're probably already familiar with:</p>
<h3>Inlay hints</h3>
<p>IDEs (like VSCode) can support <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-editing#_inlay-hints">inlay hints</a> that sprinkle the code with useful annotations for the reader, such as inferred type annotations:</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/inlay-hints.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These types of inlay hints embody calm design principles because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they minimize demands on our attention</p>
<p>They exist on the periphery of our attention, available for us if we're interested but unobtrusive if we're not interested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>They don't replace or substitute the code that we are editing.  They enhance the code editing experience but the user is still in direct contact with the edited code.  The more we use type hints the more they fade into the background of our awareness and the more the code remains the focus of our attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they create and enhance calm</p>
<p>They promote a sense of calm by informing our understanding of the code <strong>passively</strong>.  As one of the <a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</a> principles puts it: <em>“Technology can communicate, but doesn't need to speak”.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>File tree previews</h3>
<p>Tools like VSCode or GitHub's pull request viewer let you preview at a glance changes to the file tree, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/file-tree-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You might think to yourself “this is a very uninteresting thing to use as an example” but that's exactly the point.  The best tools (designed with the principles of calm technology) are pervasive and <strong>boring</strong> things that we take for granted (like light switches) and that have faded so strongly into the background of our attention that we forget they even exist as a part of our daily workflow (also like light switches).</p>
<p>File tree previews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>minimize demands on our attention</p>
<p>They're there if we need the information, but easy to ignore (or even forget they exist) if we don't use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>When we interact with the file tree viewer we are interacting directly with the filesystem and the interaction between the representation (the viewer) and the reality (the filesystem) feels direct, snappy, and precise.  The more we use the viewer the more the representation becomes indistinguishable from the reality in our minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create and enhance calm</p>
<p>We do not need to constantly interact with the file tree to gather up-to-date information about our project structure.  It passively updates in the background as we make changes to the project and those updates are unobtrusive and not attention-grabbing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chat-based coding agents are not calm</h2>
<p>We can think about the limitations of chat-based agentic coding tools through this same lens:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they place high demands on our attention</p>
<p>The user has to either sit and wait for the agent to report back or do something else and run the LLM in a semi-autonomous manner.  However, even semi-autonomous sessions prevent the user from entering flow state because they have to remain interruptible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are not built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>Chat agents are a highly mediated interface to the code which is <strong>indirect</strong> (we interact more with the agent than the code), <strong>slow</strong> (we spend a lot of time waiting), and <strong>imprecise</strong> (English is a <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html">dull interface</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they undermine calm</p>
<p>The user needs to constantly stimulate the chat to gather new information or update their understanding of the code (the chat agent doesn't inform the user's understanding passively or quietly).  Chat agents are also fine-tuned to maximize engagement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prior art for calm design</h2>
<h3>Inline suggestions from GitHub Copilot</h3>
<p>One of the earliest examples of an AI coding assistant that begins to model calm design principles is the OG AI-assistant: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions">GitHub Copilot's support for inline suggestions</a>, with some caveats I'll go into.</p>
<p><img src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/inline-suggestions.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This does one thing really well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it's built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>The user is still interacting directly with the code and the suggestions are reasonably snappy.  The user can also ignore or type through the suggestion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, by default these inline suggestions violate other calm technology principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they demand our attention</p>
<p>By default Copilot presents the suggestions quite frequently and the user has to pause what they're doing to examine the output of the suggestion.  After enough times the user begins to condition themselves into regularly pausing and waiting for a suggestion which breaks them out of a flow state.  Now instead of being proactive the user's been conditioned by the tool to be reactive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they undermine calm</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot's inline suggestion interface is visually busy and intrusive.  Even if the user ignores every suggestion the effect is still disruptive: suggestions appear on the user's screen in the center of their visual focus and the user has to decide on the spot whether to accept or ignore them before proceeding further.  The user also can't easily passively absorb information presented in this way: understanding each suggestion requires the user's focused attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>… <em>buuuuut</em> these issues are partially fixable by disabling the automatic suggestions and requiring them to be explicitly triggered by <code>Alt</code> + <code>\</code>.  However, unfortunately that also disables the next feature, which I like even more:</p>
<h3>Next edit suggestions (also from GitHub Copilot)</h3>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions#_next-edit-suggestions">Next edit suggestions</a> are a related GitHub Copilot feature that display related follow-up edits throughout the file/project and let the user cycle between them and possibly accept each suggested change.  They behave like a “super-charged find and replace”:</p>
<video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>These suggestions do an amazing job of keeping the user in a flow state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they minimize demand on the user's attention</p>
<p>The cognitive load on the user is smaller than inline suggestions because the suggestions are more likely to be bite-sized (and therefore easier for a human to review and accept).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they're built to be “pass-through”</p>
<p>Just like inline suggestions, next edit suggestions still keep the user in close contact with the code they are modifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they create and enhance calm</p>
<p>Suggestions are presented in an unobtrusive way: they aren't dumped in the dead center of the user's attention and they don't demand immediate review.  They exist on the periphery of the user's attention as code suggestions that the user can ignore or focus on at their leisure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI-assisted calm technology</h2>
<p>I believe there is a lot of untapped potential in AI-assisted coding tools and in this section I'll sketch a few small examples of how we can embody calm technology design principles in building the next generation of coding tools.</p>
<h3>Facet-based project navigation</h3>
<p>You could browse a project by a tree of semantic facets.  For example, if you were editing <a href="https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell">the Haskell implementation of Dhall</a> the tree viewer might look like this prototype I hacked up<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>:</p>
<video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://haskellforall.com/imgs/beyond-agentic-coding/semantic-facets.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>The goal here is to not only provide a quick way to explore the project by intent, but to also improve the user's understanding of the project the more they use the feature.  "String interpolation regression" is so much more informative than <code>dhall/tests/format/issue2078A.dhall</code><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, the above video is based on a real tool and not just a mock.  You can find the code I used to generate that tree of semantics facets <a href="https://github.com/Gabriella439/facet-navigator">here</a> and I'll write up another post soon walking through how that code works.</p>
<h3>Automated commit refactor</h3>
<p>You could take an editor session, a diff, or a pull request and automatically split it into a series of more focused commits that are easier for people to review.  This is one of the cases where the AI can <em>reduce</em> human review labor (most agentic coding tools <em>create</em> more human review labor).</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/458416/how-to-decompose-a-large-git-commit-with-an-ai">some prior art here</a> but this is still a nascent area of development.</p>
<h3>File lens</h3>
<p>You could add two new tools to the user's toolbar or context menu: <em>“Focus on…”</em> and <em>“Edit as…”.</em></p>
<p><em>“Focus on…”</em> would allow the user to specify what they're interested in changing and present only files and lines of code related to their specified interest.  For example, if they want to focus on “command line options” then only related files and lines of code would be shown in the editor and other lines of code would be hidden/collapsed/folded.  This would basically be like “Zen mode” but for editing a feature domain of interest.</p>
<p><em>“Edit as…”</em> would allow the user to edit the file or selected code as if it were a different programming language or file format.  For example, someone who was new to Haskell could edit a Haskell file “as Python” and then after finishing their edits the AI attempts to back-propagate their changes to Haskell.  Or someone modifying a command-line parser could edit the file “as YAML” and be presented with a simplified YAML representation of the command line options which they could modify to add new options.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is obviously not a comprehensive list of ideas, but I wrote this to encourage people to think of more innovative ways to incorporate AI into people's workflows besides just building yet another chatbot.  I strongly believe that <a href="https://haskellforall.com/2026/01/chat-is-least-interesting-interface-to">chat is the least interesting interface to LLMs</a> and AI-assisted software development is no exception to this.</p>

<p>Getting the correct output wasn't even supposed to be the hard part of the coding challenge.  The standard interview challenge provided the candidate with a golden output that their program needed to match and despite that agentic coders would not only fail to match the golden output but sometimes <em>not even realize</em> their program didn't match the golden output because they hadn't even run their agentically coded solution to check if it was correct.  The actual hard part of the coding challenge was supposed to be follow-up questions about the journey to production, which vibe coders also performed worse on. <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been passionate about writing “Good Code™” since before I started my career, beginning way back when I was still a kid in middle school.</p> <blockquote><p>What is “Good Code™“?</p></blockquote> <p>Good Question™ :)</p> <p>Good Code is code that is easy to read and understand. Good Code is code that is pleasing to develop with and maintain. Good Code is code that exists for a specific reason, and no more. Good Code is a product of the rare combination of talent, experience, passion, and the investment of time that may not be immediately useful for the business. And most unfortunately, Good Code is rare.</p> <p>That being said, by trade, I am a Software Engineer. Not a “Computer Programmer”, nor a “Coder”, nor any other title that implies that my job is to “write good code”. In fact, nothing about my job title necessitates that I read or write code at all! My job is to create useful software that solves real problems.</p> <p>Recently, a colleague of mine at <a href="https://modal.com/"><!--[!--><!--]--> Modal</a><!----> rewrote an external system that integrated deeply with the Linux kernel. The initial rewrite was a simple translation of a C codebase to a Rust one, in preparation for some custom feature work. The resulting code wasn’t bad, nor was it un-idiomatic Rust. What it also wasn’t was Good Code. It was hard to read and understand, would have been difficult to extend and maintain, and it wasn’t even clear to us why we’d taken the burden of rewriting and maintaining this extra system.</p> <p>The initial rewrite also relied heavily on coding agents.</p> <p>This same colleague then invested time into understanding the kernel subsystem, the exact reasons why the original C program was written how it was, and rewrote the Rust translation himself. The difference was night and day; the code flowed naturally, explained itself and the underlying subsystems, and may genuinely be some of the nicest parts of the entire codebase. Better, I think, than even the original C, despite this type of program being arguably one of the best places to use C over Rust.</p> <p>It was the first time in weeks, maybe months, that I’d felt something that used to be common in my day-to-day: excitement about the lines of code in front of me. I used to write (approximations of) Good Code most days. Somewhere along the way, everything changed. Nowadays I don’t even write the first version of most of the code I commit. I’m definitely far more productive with an agent at my side. They’re not at all <em>horrible</em> at this coding stuff, just not truly <strong>great</strong> at it. At the end of the day, the code they spit out is… acceptable. It gets the job done, it passes my litmus tests, but it certainly isn’t Good Code.</p> <p>Perhaps the age of caring about these lines of code is over. I’m sure that there were folks passionate about Good Assembly or Good Circuits whose passions have quietly faded into the echoes of “how things used to be,” forgotten as they and their fields evolved. From my (biased) perspective, the change in Software Engineering feels uniquely sudden, and I can’t help but mourn the silent death of Good Code.</p><!----></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is announcing its intent to take decisive steps to restrict GLP-1 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) intended for use in non-FDA-approved compounded drugs that are being mass-marketed by companies — including Hims &amp; Hers and other compounding pharmacies — as similar alternatives to FDA-approved drugs. These actions are aimed to safeguard consumers from drugs for which the FDA cannot verify quality, safety, or efficacy. &nbsp;We take seriously any potential violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p><p>The FDA is also taking steps to combat misleading direct-to-consumer advertising and marketing following warning letters that were sent in the fall of 2025. In promotional materials, companies cannot claim that non-FDA-approved compounded products are generic versions or the same as drugs approved by FDA. They also cannot state compounded drugs use the same active ingredient as the FDA-approved drugs or that compounded drugs are clinically proven to produce results for the patient.</p><p>The FDA will use all available compliance and enforcement tools within its authorities to address unsubstantiated claims and associated public health concerns. Entities engaged in the manufacture, distribution, or marketing of unapproved compounded GLP-1 products should be aware that failure to adequately address any violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

[Note: I am no longer working on TCC. Check the mailing list to get up
to date information.]

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>

<li> <b>SMALL!</b> You can compile and execute C code everywhere, for
  example on rescue disks (about 100KB for x86 TCC executable,
  including C preprocessor, C compiler, assembler and linker).</li>

<li> <b>FAST!</b> tcc generates x86 code. No byte code
  overhead. Compile, assemble and link several times <a href="#speed">faster</a> than <tt>GCC</tt>.</li>

<li> <b>UNLIMITED!</b> Any C dynamic library can be used directly. TCC is
  heading torward full <b>ISOC99</b> compliance. TCC can of course compile
  itself.</li>

<li> <b>SAFE!</b> tcc includes an optional <b>memory and bound
checker</b>. Bound checked code can be mixed freely with standard
code.

</li><li> Compile and execute C source directly. No linking or assembly
  necessary. Full C preprocessor and GNU-like assembler
  included. </li>

<li> C script supported : just add <tt>'#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run'</tt> at the first
  line of your C source, and execute it directly from the command
  line.</li>

<li> With <code>libtcc</code>, you can use TCC as a backend for dynamic code
generation. </li>

</ul>

Compilation speed for the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/download.php">Links
Browser project</a>. There are 76936 lines (including
headers). 1950947 lines (67.2 MBytes) are compiled because the same headers are
included in many files. TinyCC is about <b>9 times</b> faster than
GCC.

It wasn't because Windows 11 had crashed, but rather, Microsoft told me it wasn't <em>"available in (my) account". </em>It turned out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-apps-like-notepad-arent-loading-what-is-error-code-0x803f8001-and-how-d" data-url="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-apps-like-notepad-arent-loading-what-is-error-code-0x803f8001-and-how-d" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-apps-like-notepad-arent-loading-what-is-error-code-0x803f8001-and-how-d">an error (0x803f8001) with Microsoft Store's licensing service</a> stopped me from opening a few first-party apps, including the Snipping Tool.</p><p>Yes, even the app I usually use to screenshot error messages was busted. Ironic. Now, I'm usually a fairly level-headed Windows enthusiast who can relate to users who both love and loathe Microsoft's operating system, <em>but I couldn't open Notepad.exe — are we serious?</em></p><div data-nosnippet="" id="qYb1es6A7Zw">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I didn’t ask for this and neither did you.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for a robot to consume every blog post and piece of code I ever wrote and parrot it back so that some hack could make money off of it.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for the role of a programmer to be reduced to that of a glorified TSA agent, reviewing code to make sure the AI didn’t smuggle something dangerous into production.</p>
<p>And yet here we are. The worst fact about these tools is that they work. They can write code better than you or I can, and if you don’t believe me, wait six months.</p>
<p>You could abstain out of moral principle. And that’s fine, especially if you’re at the tail end of your career. And if you’re at the beginning of your career, you don’t need me to explain any of this to you, because you already use Warp and Cursor and Claude, with ChatGPT as your therapist and pair programmer and maybe even your lover. This post is for the 40-somethings in my audience who don’t realize this fact yet.</p>
<p>So as a senior, you could abstain. But then your junior colleagues will eventually code circles around you, because they’re wearing bazooka-powered jetpacks and you’re still riding around on a fixie bike. Eventually your boss will start asking why you’re getting paid twice your zoomer colleagues’ salary to produce a tenth of the code.</p>
<p>Ultimately if you have a mortgage and a car payment and a family you love, you’re going to make your decision. It’s maybe not the decision that your younger, more idealistic self would want you to make, but it does keep your car and your house and your family safe inside it.</p>
<p>Someday years from now we will look back on the era when we were the last generation to code by hand. We’ll laugh and explain to our grandkids how silly it was that we typed out JavaScript syntax with our fingers. But secretly we’ll miss it.</p>
<p>We’ll miss the feeling of holding code in our hands and molding it like clay in the caress of a master sculptor. We’ll miss the sleepless wrangling of some odd bug that eventually relents to the debugger at 2 AM. We’ll miss creating something we feel proud of, something true and right and good. We’ll miss the satisfaction of the artist’s signature at the bottom of the oil painting, the GitHub repo saying “I made this.”</p>
<p>I don’t celebrate the new world, but I also don’t resist it. The sun rises, the sun sets, I orbit helplessly around it, and my protests can’t stop it. It doesn’t care; it continues its arc across the sky regardless, moving but unmoved.</p>
<p>If you would like to grieve, I invite you to grieve with me. We are the last of our kind, and those who follow us won’t understand our sorrow. Our craft, as we have practiced it, will end up like some blacksmith’s tool in an archeological dig, a curio for future generations. It cannot be helped, it is the nature of all things to pass to dust, and yet still we can mourn. Now is the time to mourn the passing of our craft.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>Why I Write Games in C (yes, C)</h2>
<p>I am an unusual beast. All my solo project games I've been making recently have
been written in 'vanilla' C. Nobody does this. So I think it might be
interesting to explain why I do.</p>
<p>Dry programming language opinions incoming, <strong>you have been warned</strong>.</p>
<h2>What I need from a language</h2>
<p>There's some things which are non-negotiable. First of, it has to be reliable.
I can't afford to spend my time dealing with bugs I didn't cause myself.</p>
<p>A lot of my games were written for flash, and now flash is dying. I do <strong>not</strong>
want to spend my time porting old games to new platforms, I want to make new
games. I need a platform that I am confident will be around for a while.</p>
<p>Similarly I want to avoid tying myself to a particular OS, and <em>ideally</em> I'd
like to have the option of developing for consoles. So it's important that my
programming language is portable, and that it has good portable library
support.</p>
<h2>What I want from a language</h2>
<p>The strongest thing on my desired, but not <em>required</em> list is simplicity. I
find looking up language features, and quirky 'clever' api's incredibly tiring.
The ideal language would be one I can memorize, and then never have to look
things up.</p>
<p>Dealing with bugs is huge creative drain. I want to produce less bugs, so I
want strict typing, strong warning messages and static code analysis. I want
bugs to be easier to find, so I want good debuggers and dynamic analysis.</p>
<p>I'm not interesting in high-def realism, but I do still care a bit about
performance. Having more cycles available broadens the palette of things you
can do. It's particularly interesting to explore what is possible with modern,
powerful computers if you aren't persuing fidelity.</p>
<p>Even more than that I care about the speed of the compiler. I am not a zen
master of focus, and waiting 10+ seconds is wasteful, yes, but more importantly
it breaks my flow. I flick over to Twitter and suddenly 5+ minutes are gone.</p>
<p>I am not an OOP convert. I've spent most of my professional life working
with classes and objects, but the more time I spend, the less I understand why
you'd want to combine code and data so rigidly. I want to handle data as data
and write the code that best fits a particular situation.</p>
<h2>The Alternatives</h2>
<p>C++ is still the most common language for writing games, and not without
reason. I still do almost all of my contract work in it. I dislike it
intensely.</p>
<p>C++ covers my needs, but fails my wants badly. It is desperately complicated.
Despite decent tooling it's easy to create insidious bugs. It is also slow to
compile compared to C. It is high performance, and it offers features that C
doesn't have; but features I don't want, and at a great complexity cost.</p>
<p>C# and Java have similar issues. They are verbose and complex beasts, and I am
searching for a concise, simple creature. They both do a lot to railroad a
programmer into a strongly OOP style that I am opposed to. As per most higher
level languages they have a tendency to hide away complexity in a way that
doesn't actually prevent it from biting you.</p>
<p>I like Go a lot. In many ways it is C revisited, taking into account what has
be learnt in the long years since it was released. I would like to use it,
but there are big roadblocks that prevent me. The stop-the-world garbage
collection is a big pain for games, stopping the world is something you
can't really afford to do. The library support for games is quite
poor, and though you can wrap C libs without much trouble, doing so adds
a lot of busy work. It is niche enough that I worry a little about long term
relevance.</p>
<p>It would be nice to make things for the web, but it feels like a terrifyingly
fast moving enviroment. It is particularly scary with the death of flash.
I really dislike javascript, it is so loose that I marvel that people are
able to write big chunks of software in it. I have no interest in trying.</p>
<p>Haxe feels much more promising than most alternatives. If I do web stuff again
I'll be diving in here. There is some good library support. I am a little
concerned by its relative youth, will it last? I don't much have else to say
about it though, I've only dabbled with the surface.</p>
<p>Some people just say screw it, I'll write my own language, the language I want
to use. I admire this, and sometimes I toy with the idea of doing the same. It
feels like too much to throw away all existing library support, and taking
full responsibilty for future compatibility. It is also very difficult, and
when it comes down to it I would rather be making games than programming
languages.</p>
<h2>Why C is <em>still</em> my best fit</h2>
<p>C is dangerous, but it is reliable. A very sharp knife that can cut fingers as
well as veg, but so simple it's not too hard to learn to use it carefully.</p>
<p>It is fast, and when it comes to compilation I can't think of anything faster.</p>
<p>It can be made to run on just about anything. Usually this is relatively easy.
It is hard to imagine a time when this won't be the case.</p>
<p>The library and tooling support is strong and ongoing.</p>
<p>I say this with some sadness, but it is still the language for me.</p>
<p>I absolutely DO NOT mean to say "hey, you should use C too". I full appeciate
preferences here are pretty specific and unusual. I have also already written
more 'vanilla' C code than most, and this certainly is part of my comfort.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's it :-)</p>

<h2>SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes</h2>
<p>SectorC (<a href="https://github.com/xorvoid/sectorc">github</a>) is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It supports a
subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. It is quite likely the smallest C compiler ever written.</p>
<p>In a base64 encoding, it looks like this:</p>

wYQA0+CaANP4jwCUwHf/lcAMAJzADgCfwIUAnsCZAJ3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVao=
</code></pre>
<h2>Supported language</h2>
<p>A fairly large subset is supported: global variables, functions, if statements, while statements, lots of operators, pointer dereference, inline machine-code, comments, etc.
All of these features make it quite capable.</p>
<p>For example, the following program animates a moving sine-wave:</p>
<pre><code>int y;
int x;
int x_0;
void sin_positive_approx()
{
  y = ( x_0 * ( 157 - x_0 ) ) &gt;&gt; 7;
}
void sin()
{
  x_0 = x;
  while( x_0 &gt; 314 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 314;
  }
  if( x_0 &lt;= 157 ){
    sin_positive_approx();
  }
  if( x_0 &gt; 157 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 157;
    sin_positive_approx();
    y = 0 - y;
  }
  y = 100 + y;
}


int offset;
int x_end;
void draw_sine_wave()
{
  x = offset;
  x_end = x + 314;
  while( x &lt;= x_end ){
    sin();
    pixel_x = x - offset;
    pixel_y = y;
    vga_set_pixel();
    x = x + 1;
  }
}

int v_1;
int v_2;
void delay()
{
  v_1 = 0;
  while( v_1 &lt; 50 ){
    v_2 = 0;
    while( v_2 &lt; 10000 ){
      v_2 = v_2 + 1;
    }
    v_1 = v_1 + 1;
  }
}

void main()
{
  vga_init();

  offset = 0;
  while( 1 ){
    vga_clear();
    draw_sine_wave();

    delay();
    offset = offset + 1;
    if( offset &gt;= 314 ){ // mod the value to avoid 2^16 integer overflow
      offset = offset - 314;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>But, how?</h2>
<p>When I started thinking about SectorC, I had just finished <a href="https://xorvoid.com/otcc_deobfuscated.html">Deobfuscating OTCC</a> with a lot of its ideas freshly loaded into my head.
I also just had some healthy doses of <a href="http://justine.lol/">justine.lol</a> and <a href="http://tom7.org/">Tom7</a> to inspire the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>Did I think I would succeed? I suspected NO. Fit an entire C compiler in 510 bytes of instruction memory? Good luck (sarcasm).</p>
<h2>Tokenizing</h2>
<p>The first problem came quickly. In C, the tokenizer/lexer alone seems larger than one 512 byte sector! We need to consume an arbitrary stream of bytes and produce “tokens”.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
  if( a &lt; 5 ){
    func();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Would be consumed and converted into:</p>
<pre><code>'int'  TOKEN_KEYWORD_INT
'main' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'if'   TOKEN_KEYWORD_IF
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
'a'    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'&lt;'    TOKEN_OPERATOR
'5'    TOKEN_NUMBER
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'func' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
';'    TOKEN_SEMI
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
</code></pre>
<p>We need to specifically recognize <code>keywords</code>, <code>identifiers</code>, <code>operators</code>, and <code>numbers</code>. And then we need to convert numbers from string to integer with something like <code>atoi()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>int atoi(const char *s)
{
  int n = 0;
  while (1) {
    char c = *s++;
    if (!c) break;
    n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
  }
  return n;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote a fairly straight-forward and minimalist lexer and it took &gt;150 lines of C code. A crude estimate of the same code in x86-16 would require 300-450 bytes minimum (e.g. a simple <code>add ax,bx</code> instruction encodes as 2 bytes). And this doesn’t include any symbol table, recursive-descent parser, code-generator, branch-patching, etc.</p>
<p>No Chance.</p>
<p>So, naturally … I continued. Always pick the losers. The lolz are more fun that way.</p>
<h3>Big Insight #1</h3>
<p>Big Insight #1 came while thinking about other languages such as Forth. The tokenizer in Forth is nearly trivial. Every token is simply space-delimited. Every token is just called a <code>WORD</code> and nothing is special (slight lie). Hmm, how about a C that does that? So dreamed up a C that is technically still a C, is probably turing-complete, and will definitely make every code maintainer terrified. 😏</p>
<p>I will call it the <em>Barely C Programming Language</em>:</p>
<pre><code>int done , a , b , c , p , cond ;
int(main)(){while(!done){
     a = b - c ;
     *(int*) p = b - c ;
     a = *(int*) p ;
     if(cond) a = b - 45 ;
}}
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have spacing strategically placed to create “mega-tokens”</p>
<p>For example: <code>int(main)(){while(!done){</code> is one such "mega-token".</p>
<p>In a sense, we actually have a language more like:</p>
<pre><code>VAR_BEGIN done AND a AND b AND c AND p AND cond END
MAIN_BEGIN
  a = b - c END
  DEREF p = b - c END
  a = DEREF p END
  COND a = b - 45 END
MAIN_END
</code></pre>
<p>But, a normal C compiler will also recognize it as C!</p>
<p>Even after using space-delimiters, we still have a lot of tokens and need to find more ways to minimize the tokenizer. What is essential? Well it’s quite hard to avoid the <code>atoi()</code> if we want to actually have integer literals. What else do we need? How about nothing.</p>
<h3>Big Insight #2</h3>
<p>Big Insight #2 is that <code>atoi()</code> behaves as a (bad) hash function on ordinary text. It consumes characters and updates a 16-bit integer. Hashes are perhaps the holy-grail of computer-science.
With a good hash, we can just side-step all the hard problems by trading them for an even harder problem (hash collisions), and then we just ignore that harder problem. Brilliant. (sticks fingers in ears) 🤪</p>
<p>So we have this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Token Type</th>
<th>Meaning of atoi()</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Integer Literal</td>
<td>uint16 number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Keyword</td>
<td>token ”enum” value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Identifier</td>
<td>hash value into a 64K array</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Implementing Barely C</h2>
<p>The first implementation of Barely C fit in 468 bytes. It was a simple recursive-descent parser over the <code>atoi</code> tokens. There was no symbol table of any kind. Variables simply access a 64K segment using the hash value. Codegen is emitted somewhat similar to <a href="https://xorvoid.com/otcc_deobfuscated.html">OTCC</a>, using <code>ax</code> as the result register and shuffling values to the stack and then to <code>cx</code> for binary operators.</p>
<h2>Minimizing with Byte-Threaded Code</h2>
<p>In an attempt to steal every good idea Forth ever had, I then dreamed up what I will call “byte-threaded-code”. Since a sector is 512 bytes, if we simply align address on a 2-byte boundary, we can do addressing with a single byte! We can have a series of “gadgets” and do forth-style threading:</p>
<pre><code>bits 16
  cpu 386

  jmp 0x07c0:entry

entry:
  push cs
  pop  ds

  lea si,operations
next:
  xor ax,ax
  lodsb
  add ax,ax
  push next
  jmp ax

putch:
  mov ah,0x01
  mov al,bl
  mov dx,0
  int 0x14
  ret

  align 2
hang:
  jmp hang

  align 2
print_F:
  mov bx,'F'
  jmp putch

  align 2
print_G:
  mov bx,'G'
  jmp putch

operations:
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 16  ; hang
</code></pre>
<p>Annoyingly, <code>nasm</code> won’t let you do something like <code>db print_F/2</code> so I had to write a custom little assembler to do it.</p>
<p>Alas, this idea didn’t work out. In 512 bytes, the overhead of this Forth-style computation model doesn’t pay for itself. There are a lot of little overheads: 2 byte alignment, extra <code>ret</code> instructions, calling other “threads”, the <code>next</code> function, etc. The byte-threaded version of Barely C ended up at the same size as the straight-forward version</p>
<p>However, the idea is fun and I decided to document it anyways in the event that someone else finds utility.</p>
<h2>Minimizing the Straight-Forward version</h2>
<p>Instead, I returned to the straight-forward version and minimized it as much as possible. From 468 bytes ⇒ 303 bytes (165 bytes saving): 510 - 303 ⇒ 207 spare bytes to use for new features!</p>
<p>Some tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganize code to allow “fall-through” instead of <code>jmp</code> or <code>call</code></li>
<li>Use tail-calls via <code>jmp</code> wherever possible</li>
<li>Perform call-fusion (e.g. <code>call tok_next2</code> instead of <code>call tok_next; call tok_next</code>)</li>
<li>Utilize <code>stosw</code> and <code>lodsw</code> extensively</li>
<li>Eliminate machine code tables for cheaper inline <code>stosw</code> versions</li>
<li>Prefer <code>cmp ax,imm</code> over <code>cmp bx,imm</code></li>
<li>Keep jump offsets within 8-bits to encode more efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h2>Look Ma, A Real C!</h2>
<p>As it turns out, a lot can be accomplished in 200 bytes if you already have a tokenizer, parser, and code-generator in 300 bytes. With these 200 bytes, <em>Barely C</em> became a proper C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>if</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>
<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>while</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>
<li>Lots of operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></li>
<li>Grouping expressions: <code>( expression )</code></li>
<li>Function definitions and recursive function calls (using <code>func()</code> as a hash value into a symbol table at segment 0x3000)</li>
<li>A special <code>asm</code> statement for inline machine-code</li>
<li>Single-line <code>//</code> comments</li>
<li>Multi-line <code>/*</code> comments</li>
<li>A trick to do “space-injection” before semicolons to make code look more normal</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest enabler here is the <code>binary_oper_tbl</code> which allows for a very cheap way to add lots of operations. Each operator is simply a <code>&lt;16-bit token-value&gt; &lt;16-bit-machine-code&gt;</code> pair, costing just 4 bytes.The above 14 operators cost just 56 bytes plus a little overhead to scan the table.</p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>Here's the full grammer specification:</p>
<pre><code>program     = (var_decl | func_decl)+
var_decl    = "int" identifier ";"
func_decl   = "void" func_name "{" statement* "}"
func_name   = &lt;identifier that ends in "()" with no space&gt;
statement   = "if(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "while(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "asm" integer ";"
            | func_name ";"

</code></pre>
<p>In addition, both <code>// comment</code> and <code>/* multi-line comment */</code> styles are supported.</p>
<p>(NOTE: This grammar is 704 bytes in ascii, 38% larger than it's implementation!)</p>
<h2>Inline Machine-Code</h2>
<p>A programming language without I/O is useless. And, as the C language is defined in an I/O agnostic way, we need some way out. Thus, an <code>asm</code> extension is supported. This allows programs to generate raw x86-16 machine code literals inline. Using <code>asm</code>, programs can access any low-level detail of the machine. This is used extensively in the example code.</p>
<h2>Error-Handling</h2>
<p>What is “error-handling”? 🤣</p>
<p>In traditional C style, we trust the programmer to write correct and well-formed programs. We are certain they are all minor gods and goddesses with the ability of perfection. Obviously, spending bytes on error-checking would be foolish. Surely all will agree that this is a very reasonable standard.</p>
<p>For the less divine among us, a <code>lint</code> was also written (that doesn’t fit in a sector) to detect errors. The author certainly didn’t require this tool for development.</p>
<h2>Runtime</h2>
<p>If C compiler writers were a secret shadow organization like the Free Masons, Illuminati, Lizard Peoples, or Pizzagaters our inner-secret would be “C actually has a runtime”.</p>
<p>SectorC has a runtime under <code>rt/</code> consisting of two files implemented in C itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rt/lib.c:</code> A collection of library routines, often coded in inline <code>asm</code></li>
<li><code>rt/_start.c:</code> The actual entry-point <code>_start()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The runtime code is concatenated with program source to construct the full source to compile and run.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>A few examples are provided that leverage the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>examples/hello.c:</code> Print a text greeting on the screen writing to memory at <code>0xB8000</code></li>
<li><code>examples/sinwave.c:</code> Draw a moving sine wave animation with VGA Mode 0x13 using an appropriately bad approximation of <code>sin(x)</code></li>
<li><code>examples/twinkle.c:</code> Play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” through the PC Speaker (Warning: LOUD)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems fitting to end an article with “takeaways” or “what did we learn”. So.. umm.. what did we learn? Honestly, I’m not sure. But in the interest of fun, here’s a Choice Your Own Adventure version of What Did We Learn:</p>
<table>

			<p>You know he did other things than Larry, right?</p>

<p>We talked with Al Lowe about Leisure Suit Larry, but mostly other stuff. This was Roar’s first interview and he ran out of time before he could dive into what Al is mostly known for.</p>
<p>Al Lowe is an American software developer who started making games in the early eighties. His is mostly known for the Leisure Suit Larry games, created with Sierra, but he is also a musical man who loves playing his sax and still plays with his model trains. He has also created lots of other games for Sierra, not only the Larry series.</p>
<p>If you think Al is great, but you already know all you need to know about Larry, then this is the article for you. And it is pretty long. Get your coffee now, before continuing…</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Have you ever been to Norway?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh yeah, sure. I have this eyeball right here. It works because I spent a week recuperating in the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital. I had a detached retina when we were flying into Oslo, and went to an ophthalmologist, and she said to get to the hospital right now. The next morning a bunch of Norwegian women started poking around in my eye and fixed it.</p>

<p>Of course, I was blind in that eye for the next week, and I was already blind in the other eye, so I wandered around in the dark while my wife went sightseeing. I went with her, but I didn’t see any sights.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> So you have felt and smelt the beautiful fjords, but never seen them.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, on an earlier trip, we did take the railroad to Bergen. Over the mountain plateau [Hardangervidda]. So we spent some time there, and that was fun.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I’ve never actually taken that trip myself, but I heard it’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It was not for us. We got to the top, up in the top of the mountains. And the electricity went off. And so, we parked in the middle of this beautiful snowy scene for three hours, before they finally got the power back on. Then we went on our journey but we had already missed the connecting rides. We had booked a trip on a boat through the fjords, and a trip on the cog railway. We missed all of them. So be sure you go when there is electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, we like to joke about that in Norway, the richest country in the world and the lousiest trains. I guess that is a good segue, because you do like trains, don’t you? At least model trains?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes, I do. I’ve been a model railroader for most of my life. I got my first model train when I was 2 years old, and my dad wouldn’t let me play with it. So he ran it around the Christmas tree and I had to watch. But eventually, when I was 9 or 10, I got interested in HO size trains, and built a layout in our basement. Completely by myself, I had no idea what I was doing or anything, but I just learned as I went, piddled around and figured it out. I went to the hobby shop sometime and would say stuff like: How do you glue this stuff to this stuff? And they’d give me some special glue and and teach me how.</p>

<p>So, it was fun. I learned a lot, and I proved that I could do things with my hands. I ended up learning a lot about wiring and electricity. And scenery, I did stuff with papier-mâché. I took old tomato sticks from our garden, cut them in different heights. I wrapped old screen door wire over the top of them and coated that with plaster to make mountains and stuff. So I did a lot of stuff, mostly things I’d read about in magazines, but I think it helped me understand that I could learn something if I didn’t already know it.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Did you add any miniature figures or models and stuff like that in the scenery as well?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Sure, yeah, lots of stuff. In fact, I built buildings out of balsa wood. And I read an article in a magazine that said if you hold your X-Acto knife at just the right angle and drag it across the balsa wood, you can make clapboard siding, you know, where the siding overlaps. I also built doors from scraps of wood.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was fun. It’s a fun hobby, and it served me for ten years at first. Then I went to college and started playing music, and I forgot about it. But then when my son was 10 years old I thought: I liked doing this when I was 10, maybe he will. So we went to the hobby shop and bought a bunch of trains. Of course he wasn’t interested at all, but I got hooked again! So for the last 35 years I’ve been doing N-scale trains, where the locomotive is about five inches long.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> So your son is 45, then?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes, then you could have been my dad, because I’m 46.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, you’re the right age, then, I guess.</p>

<h2>Model trains are not what they used to be</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I was sent a link to the <a href="https://www.nmra.org/">National Model Railroad Association</a> where you are mentioned as a member of the board of directors of the 4th Division of the Pacific Northwest region.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> The Pacific Northwest Region of the NMRA, yeah. I did that for 10 years at least. Then I was assistant director for another 10 years so I worked at that organization for about 20 years. But recently I said: That’s enough, let some new blood come in. So we got new people now, and they’re much better, so I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> But you didn’t get any money for it?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> No, no, it’s a volunteer organization. At first we did a paper newsletter every month. We would print and fold and staple and stamp and address-label hundreds of newsletters. I did that for a couple years until I finally convinced everybody that we’ve got to go online. So then I made a PDF, posted it, and we sent out an email. That was much better, but we still had a few die-hard people that would download it and print it out every time. I was part of this for 24 years.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Are there any physical magazines about model trains today?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes. Well, the man who ran one of the biggest ones just passed away and so his magazine’s gone now, but there’s still a magazine called N Scale, and it’s housed right here in the suburb of Seattle. It is distributed all over the world. And then there’s the National Model Railroad Association, which publishes a magazine every month, all over the world. And then there’s Model Railroader and Railroad Model Craftsman. I know there’s one for each of the scales, for HO and S and O and G for garden railroads.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> It’s an old hobby. A weird hobby, in that it follows my path. Most people get interested in trains when they’re little kids. And then they grow out of it in high school. Then later in life, they realize: I got time and money now. I could get back in it, this is a good hobby. And it really is. It’s great socially, because the group that I’m in have a layout that’s portable and we can bring it to shows. So 6-8 times a year we pack everything up into a trailer, move it to a place, and set it up. And we run trains all weekend, we talk with the public and hundreds of people come by and see my work. Then we pack it up and put it back in the trailer and then wait for the next show. So it doesn’t get old because it’s so long between shows. It’s really fun.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I guess there’s not that much development in the field, so even though you haven’t done it for 20 years, it’s not that hard to just continue where you left off?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Actually, it has changed completely with computers. So you couldn’t be more wrong! Actually, you were correct for 40 years at least. But in the 90s people started developing computerized means of running the trains. And in the mid-90s, the National Model Railroad Association set up standards and said: If you follow all these rules then your stuff can run on anybody’s system. And that’s when it really changed over.</p>
<p>About 2001 or 2002, we went from the old system, which was a rheostat that controlled the amount of voltage applied to the rails, just like a volume control. So we went from a potentiometer that changed the amount of power to the tracks to constantly powered tracks, with a computer chip inside each locomotive. It has a number address that you can set. Then on your remote control you can type in the number of the locomotive you want to drive, turn a knob, and it sends a radio signal through the air to a computer that’s permanently affixed to the layout. And that computer multiplexes a serial signal on top of the power, just kind of like your old phone modems where they overlaid a signal on top of the regular phone lines. It then tells the locomotive to go this fast, back up, or sound the whistle and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I guess for you this was not a bad thing at all, because you love that kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, no, right? It was right up my the alley there.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I have some experience painting Warhammer miniature figures. Did you paint miniatures yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah. The trouble with N Scale is that the people are very small. It’s a challenge to paint. We always tell everybody that the hard part is getting the eyelashes right.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> And that’s at least one thing that does not get easier with age.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> No, no, that’s true. But I have lots of special tools for that. I have an optimizer that has LED lights built around it, so I can zoom right in on things and paint the tiny little stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Pretending to be a cyborg.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, well … getting the help I need.</p>
<h2>Al Lowe and music</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Music is very important to you. And people wouldn’t think about music when they hear your name. But for me, I got this mp3-file in the late 90s with the title: «Al Lowe – For Your Thighs Only». And that played the music from Leisure Suit Larry. So then I learned the name. And of course, I had played these games earlier, but never picked up on the name.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I hope you paid me a royalty.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, of course! So for me you were a musician before I found out that you had also created these games.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I was involved with a lot of Sierra products in one way or another. I worked on their spelling program when they had a word processor. I worked on their assembler for Apple II. I worked on … God, just a lot of different stuff. 26 products in 16 years.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, I should plug <a href="https://allowe.com/">my website</a>. Tell people, if they have gotten this far, they should visit my website. There’s lots more stuff there. If you enjoy this, you’ll enjoy that.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, I believe I will. Your kids, did they go for music, game developing, or anything else in their father’s footsteps?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Of course not. They’re my kids.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Since you’re a saxophone player, I would guess that you can play a lot of other instruments as well?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I was a high school band director, so I had to learn to play every instrument somewhat. So, I can pick up a viola and play badly, and I can play a trombone or French horn, but my real instrument is the saxophone and also flute and clarinet.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> So, what kind of music do you like?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Big Band Jazz. But I play as much as I listen. I tend to watch films and read books, but I play music. I’m in two big bands, where I play lead alto sax. And they meet every week for a couple hours in the evening. And I’m in two saxophone quartets that meet a little less regularly, but we play classical saxophone music, and also some pop songs and things, but it’s just four saxophones, and so we get a lot of interesting work. That’s real fun.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I’ve been looking at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPh4AbZOjB4">YouTube video</a>, where you played in a band called The David Hasselhoff Big Band.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yes, the group is ironically named.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Metallica had been covered by a band of four cello players. Would it be possible to do something like that with saxophones?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It would absolutely be possible, but the question is, why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That is the better question. I guess being Norwegian, I don’t really feel like any music should be without some kind of growling.</p>
<h2>Al Lowe and television</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Do you watch any modern series on television?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> We watch a lot of Scandinavian noir shows. A lot of Danish and a couple of Norwegian shows. And we watch them in Norwegian with subtitles. We don’t want to use the English voiceover, because they are usually not very good.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> No, I would guess not.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It is easier and better just to listen to the Norwegian and not know what you’re saying, but be able to read the subtitles and get the gist. I can’t think of a title right now, but we’ve got a long list on Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah. Today it’s very easy to consume whatever you want to consume. Even though you don’t necessarily own the stuff you watch.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> From very early on I didn’t want to own any movies or TV shows. We never bought anything. I always felt like I would rather just rent and see something new – see more stuff, instead of looking at the same thing over and over. And so, I didn’t build up a collection of VHS or DVDs. I was «streaming» when that was still analog. We got discs in the mail, you know. That was pretty advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah like Netflix, the original Netflix?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<h2>Al Lowe and humor</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> What about humor? The modern humor scene versus the old humor scene. Some things that were acceptable to say back in the eighties are not any more, and so on, and we even rewrite old things to make them more «modern». Do you have any views about this issue, being an old humorist yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I said and did things in the eighties’ games that I would never dream of doing now. Let’s put it that way. On the other hand, violence seems to be quite popular. I don’t understand it. We get scared of humor, but yet, you just can’t blow a person up any more than we do now. It is an odd situation isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yep. There has also been so much nudity in the last 10 years in all kinds of movies, and very explicit nudity.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, which I enjoy. I have no problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, yeah, I won’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, all in all, I guess my opinion is that things have gotten better. How long has it been since I wrote Larry 1? 35 years? No, 38 years. So in the 38 years since I wrote Larry 1, I think all of that stuff has gotten better, with the exception of violence. I’m not happy with that. I think we show too much, too often, and too strongly and too dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It’s very brutal now.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> But, you know, I think all these things are a pendulum, right? You know, it’s gonna swing over here, and then eventually it’s gonna swing back. Typical human behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes, that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> We’ll see what happens. Well, <em>I</em> won’t see what happens. You can see what happens.</p>

<h2>Old Sierra games</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes. Um, I guess I also have to talk to you about the old Sierra games. And these might not be the most original questions.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I only want original questions…..</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> You had, among other things, been working on the Dark Crystal Game: Gelfling Adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, I did.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> And growing up when I did, I loved watching that old Dark Crystal movie. It was pretty scary when I was eight or nine, but man, what a wonderful movie.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It was. Yeah, it sure was. And Roberta [Williams] was delighted when Jim Henson asked her to do a computer game based on Dark Crystal. And I was delighted, because after the artists had done all the backgrounds and things for Dark Crystal, Sierra asked me to spin off an educational version of it. We called it the Gelfling Adventure, and it wasn’t a big hit, but it was sure fun to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I would guess if you could get it today, in a big box, it would be worth a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I used to have a copy, but I think I sold it on eBay when I cleaned out my attic. I had an attic full of games, and finally I just put them on eBay and sold them off one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> You did? Was it that collection Metal Jesus Rocks bought?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Ah, no, that was not a game, that was stuff from Sierra. We should tell people what we’re referring to – there’s a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MetalJesusRocks">Metal Jesus Rocks</a>. And he came over and did an interview one day at my house.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, I saw that, you showed him all your cool stuff. And that is gone now?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> He convinced me that I should put it up on eBay, and somebody would buy it. And I said, no, nobody would do that. Who would want such a silly thing?</p>
<p>And, it turned out that the current owner of Sierra, Activision [now owned my Microsoft] got mad and sent me a cease and desist letter: If you sell this, there might be something on those disks that we own. We don’t know what it is, you may not know what it is, and you may doubt that it’s there, but if there’s anything we’ll sue you. So I was like: oh, shit, what? Whatever I would get from selling it wouldn’t be nearly enough to pay a lawyer to defend me. So, I pulled it.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> So, it’s still up there, if you look. Let’s see if I can adjust the camera a little. <em>*Shows boxes of stuff in the background*</em> Right there, those black boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Did you ever get to meet Jim Henson?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I did not, no.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> He was big back then.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, my wife and I never missed an episode of The Muppet Show. It was one of the most creative and funny things. Just warm-hearted, good, kind spirited, and funny as hell. Just a great show. And the first movie was also great. Then the second Muppet movie was maybe a little less, and the third one was a little less, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I did like the movies too. More than I liked The Muppet Show, because I was too young to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> The Muppet Show had a lot humor that went over kids’ heads, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> And also, all those guests, I had no idea who they were.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I knew every one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That does help. But I have seen the episodes as an adult, and now I enjoy them, because now I know who these people are.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, I highly recommended it. Still funny.</p>
<h2>Leisure Suit Larry</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That brings me to the first Leisure Suit Larry game. It had all these questions at the start that was usually based on American pop culture or politics.</p>
<p>In the end you just ended up writing down every question you could get. Then the answer you tried and whether it was correct or not.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> That’s how you did it? You know, all you had to do was press Alt-X.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yes, we found that out after a while. But it was a very good way of learning English before that.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> And now you know who Spiro Agnew was.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, but that’s also because of the Futurama series. He was a recurring character there being Nixon’s vice president and helper. But knowing that was not normal as a 10-year-old kid in Norway in the late 80s.</p>

<h2>Disney games</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> My first real computer was a Commodore 64. So my first love with your stuff, without even knowing it was you, was Donald Ducks Playground.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, yeah! I was very proud of that game. That won a bunch of educational awards over here, and was a successful product for Disney. Not as successful for Sierra and Al Lowe.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It was probably a cheap licence to get?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> They had no idea what any of the games or computers was about. They had a couple of women who worked for them, and did educational film strips, movie slideshows and, you know, educational workbooks and stuff like that they sold to schools. And so they told these two women: You take charge of this computer thing because it’s kind of like a movie projector or a slot film strips, and I think it’s got a screen, so you’re in charge.</p>
<p>Well, I quickly realised that I knew much more, and I knew Sierra knew much more than they did. A couple of the other products we did were Mickey’s Space Adventure and <a href="https://wiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/Goofy%27s_Word_Factory">Goofy’s Word Factory</a> (never released). Those guys consulted with them often about how to create their product. But I took the approach: I’m too busy to talk to you until I get it done, and when I get it done, I’ll show it to you. And they bought off on that for a while. They didn’t know what I was doing. Then finally I said: Okay, it’s done, take a look at it.</p>
<p>Well, then they had a big, long list of changes that we should make, because for them to be important, they had to put some mark on the product. They said; Well, I think that the leaf should be red instead of green, or I think his pants should be this instead of that, or this should be over in that corner.</p>

<p>I said: Well, you know, I could make all those changes, or we could ship the product and make some money. What do you want to do? And Ken Williams said: Well, ship it, you know, let’s get it out. And so, I pretty much did that entire product without any input from Disney. And it was the same with Donald Duck. They had changes they wanted to make, but they weren’t improvements. If they had come up with something better, then yeah, I would have done it. Because I wanted to make it better, but just to make this color a little different, or move that thing over one pixel, you know, that made no difference whatsoever. Anyway, that’s my Disney story.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It’s such a nice-looking game. And I learned about quarters and dollars and cents.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I haven’t seen it in 40 years, probably.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> In other games, like Winnie the Pooh or Mickey’s Space Adventure, you improved on the Zork formula. You added graphics. And you didn’t have to type in what you wanted to do, but instead clicked buttons with text.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Did you ever play the Black Cauldron?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> No, but I did look at a YouTube video, and I thought: Maybe this is a Sierra game where you cannot die. But ah, I was wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, no, you can. I didn’t know it at the time, but I feel like I invented the point-and-click adventure. Because that whole game could be played with a mouse or a joystick. It could be played just by pointing and moving to where you wanted to go. And then using the function keys – I’m doing it the old-fashioned way, using the keys on the right side of the keyboard where God intended them to be instead of up here, where nobody can hit them. But anyway, I used the function keys instead of clicking icons and stuff. Roberta added the icons with King’s Quest V, I think.</p>
<h2>Working for, but not being employed by Sierra</h2>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> How was it working with the Williamses?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, I have no complaints, they bought me a nice house, bought me some nice cars, let me retire at 52, so I will say I was pretty happy.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah, because you stayed there your whole career. At least your whole gaming career?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I resigned from my teaching gig and started working for Ken full-time. After six months, he hit hard times. There was one Friday the company started the morning with 120 employees. And in the afternoon it had been cut to 40 employees. So they fired two-thirds of the company that day, including me.</p>

<p>He then called me into the office and said: I want you to keep working. I don’t want you to quit and leave. I want you to work on this product. And, I’ll give you advances against future royalties instead of a salary. I said, whoa, how much are we talking here? What kind of advances? Well, I can do this much for that. I asked: What about this other game you wanted? Because I was going to work on that. Oh, yeah, yeah, we’ll add that on, too. So I can do that one, and we’ll give you so much for that one. And I said, okay, well, what about the translation to Atari and Commodore for, you know, Winnie the Pooh or something? Oh, yeah, you would do that too. So I added up all the advances he was talking about&nbsp; and it was double the salary he had been paying me.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Ah! Haha, nice.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I figured I could get it done in a year so I said: Okay, that sounds good. Have I just been fired? Yep. Great, thanks! And I shook his hand, and for the next 15 and a half years I was an outside contractor who only worked on a contract basis. I got royalties instead of salary, and ended up having a great relationship with Sierra until Ken left the company. And when Ken got bought out by this … well, I don’t know how much depth you want to go into that, but there was a really ugly end for Sierra, where they were bought out in a hostile takeover by one of their board members, who were then convicted and sent to prison for fifteen years for fraud. So it was an ugly end.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> When Ken left, the writing was on the wall. It was pretty obvious that they didn’t have anybody who could replace him, and there was nobody to replace Roberta. Sierra’s new method of product development was: Listen to a pitch, fund that pitch, let them do a lot of work on it, and then look at the product when it’s half done and not fun with nothing to see. Then they’d get cold feet and say: Oh, gosh, I don’t know if we should spend the rest of the money. Then cancel it.</p>
<p>They just went through this endless churn of, you know, we’ll start a new product, oh no, oh, uh, no, we’ll cancel that. Now let’s do another one. Oh, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Oh, wait, it doesn’t look very good… Well, it’s not done, dumbass. So the company quickly went into this….. Did you ever see the old World War II movies when they would shoot a plane and it would spiral out?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Oh yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, that’s what Sierra felt like for about a year there. You could just see all the good people jumping ship and going to better companies. And all the bad people were staying around and making products that were even worse. And so, maybe two years after Ken left the company, they decided to move what little work was left to Los Angeles and merge with Blizzard. Then they turned off the lights and sent all the employees home. They locked the doors, and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>Including the end of all the historic materials that we used to create the games, which were carefully… well, I shouldn’t say that. That’s a lie. They were uncarefully stored. They were thrown in a box, put in a cabinet, and then when they needed cabinet space, they rented a storage unit and threw them in there. Then at the end somebody said: Why are we paying money for a storage unit for all this old crap? Then they burned it all.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Oh, they burned it?!</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, yeah, it was just the dumbest thing. That was the end of the company. I had a few cells of animation that survived, but there’s very little of that stuff left anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> But at least you did have a copy of the source code for your games?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, for the early games I made. Once you got to Larry 6, the games were too big and you couldn’t back them up anymore. I think it was like 5 or 6 CDs, and at some point along there I just gave up. I have the source material for Larry 7, but I have no way to compile it.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> If you put it online, someone will create a compiler, I’m pretty sure of it. People are nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> It’s too bad they didn’t let me sell the source code, because one of the things I loved doing was writing comments in the code. And more often than not, the comments were funnier than the game. It was a shame to let that all go to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> When you say the later games, you talk about games like Torin’s Passage and Freddy Pharkas, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, I have the source material for that somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> There are some projects that emulate these old games. ScummVM, I think, now supports a lot of non-Scumm games as well. So it might be that someone is thinking about Freddy Pharkas and Torin’s Passage for that engine [this is actually true for both these titles].</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yeah, maybe. I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> It’s not impossible and I guess that’s also a point with these old games. They are fun to play, but usually because you did play them as a kid. If I gave Leisure Suit Larry to my kids today, I’m not sure if they would like them.</p>

<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, they would have to think. Sierra games were about thinking, they weren’t about shooting or killing, or building things. They were about figuring out things in your brain, and that’s something that we seem to be losing as a species.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> That’s true. It’s also very popular to look at other people playing games today, on Twitch and Youtube.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> That I don’t understand at all. And I think part of it is because the games that people watch don’t require thinking, or the same kind of puzzle solving. They’re certainly thinking in shooter games, but it’s not the same, you know? You don’t sit and ponder something. You don’t wait around, figure out what to do. Can I do this? How would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah. Did you ever play that Softporn Adventure game without any hints?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Uh, only with the source code.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Because I think you have a sound argument that people don’t like to think today, but there are a lot strange solutions that are not that obvious in the old games.</p>

<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Why did all the old Sierra games always have these difficult stairs everywhere?</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> I can’t tell you other than you had to get to a different level. I actually spoofed that in, uh, Larry 2, I think? We had a cliff face and you had to walk this narrow path alongside a cliff. If you slipped, you went over the side, but you grabbed with this long arm that extended out and then brought you back up like a rubber band, so you couldn’t die on those stairs or on that cliff. That was my joke on those stairs.</p>
<p>But you’re right, it was a definite feature of Sierra games. Also, the deaths were because we often didn’t know what people would try. And when they would try something, we had no code in there to handle that. What were we gonna do? You couldn’t ignore it. I think somewhere, Larry 3, maybe, I added the feature that said: When you die you can go back to a game you saved, or you can just go back to life. And that seemed much more friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Yeah? And you also had these very funny comments about you dying when you died.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Oh, sure. Yeah, it was always fun for me to make fun of the player. And there was something else that I want to bring to you that I don’t know that people have noticed. My games always referred to Larry as you. So when I talk to the player, I would say: You did this, you fell off a cliff, that was a dumb thing you did. Whereas a lot of other games referred to the main character in the third person. It was: Larry has fallen off, you know? But I always felt it like it was more meaningful to me as a player if the game referred to me as a person.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> I agree. And you can only blame yourself for trying to pet that cat or something.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Yep. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Someone created a game: Stair Quest. It’s a game where you move like you do in the old Sierra games, and there are these very thin diagonal stairs that you have to traverse, and you fall off all the time and die.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Well, the trick with the stairs usually was to use the keys on the numeric keyboard. You’d have to use all of the keypad, including the diagonals. But I guess people didn’t always have keypads. So when the layout changed it made it pretty difficult to move.</p>
<p><strong>Roar:</strong> Hmm, that’s a very good point. And with that I will let you get on with the day. It was wonderful meeting you, Al Lowe.</p>
<p><strong>Al:</strong> Nice to meet you.</p>
