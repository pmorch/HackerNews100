            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rentry.co/GPT2">https://rentry.co/GPT2</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40199715">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <article>
                    <div><h4 id="gpt-2">GPT-2?<a href="#gpt-2" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<h6 id="background">Background<a href="#background" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p><a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">https://chat.lmsys.org</a> enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their output according to different benchmarks, without needing to log in. One of the models recently available is <code>gpt2-chatbot</code>, which demonstrates capability greatly beyond any GPT-2 model. It is available to for chatting with in "Direct Chat" and "Arena (Battle)" which is the (initially) blinded version. There is no information to be found on that particular model name <em>anywhere</em> on the site, or elsewhere. The ratings results generated by LMSYS' benchmarks are available via their API for all models - except for this one. The model name simply appears to be a cover for something else entirely.</p>
<h6 id="subjective-note">Subjective note<a href="#subjective-note" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>In my opinion, it is likely that this mystery model is in fact either GPT-4.5 or GPT-5.<br>
The quality of the output in general - in particular its formatting, structure, and overall comprehension - is absolutely superb. Multiple people, with great LLM and chatbot experience, have noted unexpectedly good quality of the output (in public and in private) - and I agree fully. To me, it feels like the step from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, but instead using GPT-4 as a starting point. </p>
<h6 id="rationale">Rationale<a href="#rationale" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>This particular model is a "stealth drop" by OpenAI to benchmark their latest GPT model, without making it apparent that it's on <a href="http://lmsys.org/" rel="" target="nofollow noopener _blank">lmsys.org</a>, in order to a) not get too biased replies, b) get replies that are "ordinary benchmark" tests without people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, and b) decrease the likelihood getting "mass-downvoted" by other competing entities. OpenAI would provide the compute for this, and LMSYS would gain latest-generation datasets from people using their services.</p>
<h6 id="qrd">QRD<a href="#qrd" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<ul>
<li>It uses OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer; this has been verified by testing its vulnerability to the <a href="https://rentry.org/SpecialTokens">special tokens used by OpenAI</a>. </li>
<li>It does not appear affect to specific special tokens used by Claude/Llama/Gemini.</li>
<li>When emergency/legal-related contact information and model information is required, it consistently provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI. This information is much more comprehensive and accurate than what GPT-3.5 (of course) and GPT-4 provides.</li>
<li>It consistently claims to be "a ChatGPT", which is similar to how OpenAI has launched "GPTs" (plural) as custom assistants in their ChatGPT interface.</li>
<li>It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.</li>
<li>You can test the direct chat for 8 messages, and then switch to "Battle" mode and either select or re-roll model options. Feel free to click the feedback buttons; there's probably some minimal amount of ratings you need to provide per generation.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits<a href="#rate-limits" title="Permanent link"> </a></h6>
<p>"GPT2-chatbot" does however have a rate limit that is different from the GPT-4 models, for direct chat:<br>
</p><div>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been investigated. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is in fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could of course imply that a) the model is more costly in terms of compute, and b) that the ones providing the compute prefer people to use the Arena (Battle) mode for generating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they hit the daily user limit.</p>

<p>Attempt to prove anything here wrong. Feel free to try to correct anything and just quote/mention the rentry in your post on /g/ and I'll see it. I'll probably keep tabs on just "GPT2" as well.</p>

<p>The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has captured the sharpest infrared images to date of one of the most distinctive objects in our skies, the Horsehead Nebula. These observations show a part of the iconic nebula in a whole new light, capturing its complexity with unprecedented spatial resolution.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb" target="_blank">Webb’s</a> new images show part of the sky in the constellation Orion (The Hunter), in the western side of the Orion B molecular cloud. Rising from turbulent waves of dust and gas is the Horsehead Nebula, otherwise known as Barnard 33, which resides roughly 1300 light-years away.&nbsp;</p><p>The nebula formed from a collapsing interstellar cloud of material, and glows because it is illuminated by a nearby hot star. The gas clouds surrounding the Horsehead have already dissipated, but the jutting pillar is made of thick clumps of material that is harder to erode. Astronomers estimate that the Horsehead has about five million years left before it too disintegrates. Webb’s new view focuses on the illuminated edge of the top of the nebula’s distinctive dust and gas structure.</p>	</div>

		<p>The Horsehead Nebula is a well-known photon-dominated region, or PDR. In such a region ultraviolet light from young, massive stars creates a mostly neutral, warm area of gas and dust between the fully ionised gas surrounding the massive stars and the clouds in which they are born. This ultraviolet radiation strongly influences the gas chemistry of these regions and acts as the most important source of heat.&nbsp;</p><p>These regions occur where interstellar gas is dense enough to remain neutral, but not dense enough to prevent the penetration of far-ultraviolet light from massive stars. The light emitted from such PDRs provides a unique tool to study the physical and chemical processes that drive the evolution of interstellar matter in our galaxy, and throughout the Universe from the early era of vigorous star formation to the present day.</p><p>Owing to its proximity and its nearly edge-on geometry, the Horsehead Nebula is an ideal target for astronomers to study the physical structures of PDRs and the evolution of the chemical characteristics of the gas and dust within their respective environments, and the transition regions between them. It is considered one of the best objects in the sky to study how radiation interacts with interstellar matter.</p>	</div>

Even if the interior – all loud greens and purples with gold-rimmed cabinets – looks hopelessly post-Soviet, the amenities include foam pillows, hairdryers and bathrobes. One could do worse for $155 a night. But Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov, for whom the pillared pile on the Aegean is named, are no ordinary hoteliers. They are Russian “illegals,” or spies operating outside of diplomatic cover, who spent decades living under false pretenses as naturalized citizens of Czechia. </p><p>And Villa Elena is no ordinary hotel. </p><p>For the last fifteen years, it has served as the Greek safehouse for members of GRU Unit 29155, Vladimir Putin’s most grimly accomplished assassination and sabotage squad, the one responsible for poisoning enemies of the Kremlin and blowing up materiel stored in Czechia and Bulgaria, both NATO countries, before it could be sent to the Georgian and Ukrainian armies as well as Western-backed Syrian rebels. All of these end users were variously squaring off against Russian forces or threatening to overthrow an important Russian client. In fact, the Šapošnikovs abetted those bombings, which <em>The Insider</em> first exposed as <a href="https://theins.press/en/politics/266039" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the work of Unit 29155</a>.</p><p>Today, the Czech Intelligence Center for Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime has released the findings of a years-long investigation into Unit 29155’s role in destroying two Czech government-run weapons and ammunition depots in 2014 in Vrbětice, a small town in the south Moravian region of Czechia. These attacks, which resulted in Prague’s expulsion of 18 Russian intelligence officers operating in the country under diplomatic cover, were conducted with explosive devices emplaced by Unit 29155’s most recognizable operatives: Alexander Mishkin, 44, and Anatoly Chepiga, 45. Both would gain international notoriety for trying to murder Sergei Skripal, a GRU officer turned British double agent, along with his daughter Yulia, in Salisbury, England in 2018, with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok. </p><p>The Šapošnikovs not only arranged for Mishkin and Chepiga to gain access to two different warehouses in Vrbětice, but they also communicated directly with Gen. Andrei Averyanov, 58, the founding commander of Unit 29155, who tasked them with facilitating violence against their adoptive nation. </p><p>The GRU, like the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, has long maintained its own illegals program. But the Šapošnikovs are the first known case of to ever be affiliated with Unit 29155, whose remit is strictly kinetic. In March, <em>The Insider</em>, along with its investigative partners <em>60 Minutes</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em>, uncovered evidence implicating Unit 29155 in directed energy attacks thought to be the cause of <a href="https://theins.press/en/politics/270425" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Havana Syndrome</a>, the name given to a collection of debilitating medical ailments afflicting American intelligence officers and diplomats worldwide.</p><p>While both Šapošnikov spouses engaged in espionage for Russia assisted GRU’s sabotage operations, the wife, Šapošnikova, 62, appears to have been directly integrated with Unit 29155, as evidenced both by findings by the Czech investigators and by <em>The Insider’s</em> independent discovery of documentary evidence. As such, Czech investigators have concluded, she likely directed and supervised her husband’s – and possibly their son’s – activities in support of Russian state interests. The family’s clandestine duties ranged from intelligence-gathering to logistical facilitation, providing safe havens, recruitment efforts, and even aiding in securing physical access for GRU operatives conducting sabotage missions.</p><p><em>The Insider </em>has also discovered that Šapošnikova even possessed a secret Russian service passport from a special series reserved for spies from Unit 29155. She even received the Hero of Russian Federation, the highest state honor awarded to those who perform “service to the Russian state and nation, usually connected with a heroic feat of valor.” Putin himself bestowed the title on Šapošnikova in a secret ceremony in Moscow following Unit 29155’s sabotage operations in Czechia and Bulgaria.</p><p>In 2023, Czech authorities, after conducting an independent criminal investigation into the Šapošnikovs’ role in the 2014 bombings in Vrbětice, declared the couple “persons of interest” and requested their questioning by Greek authorities. Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov submitted a statement to Greek authorities alleging they are persecuted by the Czech Republic and are “scapegoats in the name of unknown interests.” Nikolay Šapošnikov died from a heart attack in Greece in February 2024 at the age of 62.</p><h3 id="article_block_0">The Illegals</h3><p>Nikolay Šapošnikov was born in 1961 in Severodvinsk in the far north-west of Russia into a family of military engineers. In 1983 he graduated from the engineering department of the Baku Military Command School and was appointed commander of a motorized rifle company in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital. Records show that Šapošnikov’s unit <a href="http://www.bezenchukgp.ru/information/predsedatel-sobraniya-predstavitelei" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was deployed</a> to Afghanistan from 1983-1986, during the Soviet occupation of the country. In 1985 he divorced his first wife, Natalia, and immediately married Elena Šapošniková (née Lisetskaya), a Kyiv-born engineer and the daughter of a lieutenant-colonel who taught at the Kyiv military command institute. At the time of their marriage she was working at the Baku-based Physics Institute. Elena had a son, Pavel, from a previous marriage. She and Nikolay bore a daughter, Valeria, who was born in 1986.</p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/_P9gq_6fxmoIA8VH-oyk9ql3mWHqCxIJREphxa_Xago/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTAv/ZmlsZS05OWU1ZmVh/NjBjMTBlZDkyN2M1/MjhjNWQ0MDVhNWZk/My5wbmc.jpg" alt="Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov’s Soviet passport photos"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Nikolay and Elena Šapošnikov’s Soviet passport photos</h5></p></div><div><p>The following year, the Soviet Union began withdrawing from Afghanistan. Šapošnikov was redeployed to Czechoslovakia, then a member of the Warsaw Pact, the U.S.S.R.’s equivalent to NATO, where he served as motorized rifle company commander in Jelsava in what is today’s Slovakia. His military career ended, at least on paper, three years later as Czechoslovakia, along with the rest of the Eastern Bloc countries, shook off the yoke of Communist rule. In February 1989, Šapošnikov was expelled from the Communist Party and censured by his commanders over “repeated embezzlement of gasoline and batteries from the army.” This blot on his resume, whether real or contrived, would come in handy a little while later.</p><p>In 1990, Nikolay was retired from military service, formally on medical grounds (he suffered from a spinal injury), and assigned as a reservist to Kyiv, Ukraine, where his wife’s family then lived.</p><p>But as Soviet troops departed that country, too, less than a year later, Šapošnikov returned to Czechoslovakia, where he reported to a police precinct in the town of Zvolen. He sought political asylum, citing his expulsion from the Soviet Communist Party as evidence of his dissidence. In August 1991, after several consecutive stays in refugee camps, Nikolay received the status of a political refugee. A few months later, he was rejoined by his wife Elena and their two young children. They similarly received Czechoslovakian political asylum in 1992.</p><p>After the Czech Republic split peacefully from Slovakia into an independent country, the family of self-professed Soviet dissidents promptly applied for citizenship. However, their applications were riddled with omissions, misrepresentations, and forgeries. Šapošnikov falsely claimed he was born to a family of clerks, not military officers. He also hid the fact that he was a soldier, too, that he had served as a commander in Afghanistan, and that he had a daughter from a previous marriage. Finally, he presented a forged birth certificate for Pavel, Elena’s son from her first marriage, making it appear as if Nikolay were Pavel’s biological father. </p><p>Elena Šapošnikova’s misrepresentations in pursuit of Czech citizenship were more egregious. She lied that she had surrendered her Ukrainian passport upon receiving Czechoslovakian asylum in 1992, when in fact she repeatedly used the Ukrainian document to travel to both Russia and Ukraine – the very countries her purported risk of persecution entitled her to refugee status in the first place.</p><p>For all that, the Šapošnikovs still became Czech citizens, likely through bribery or co-opting crooked bureaucrats. Nikolay received his passport in 1999, while Elena, after “at least six” attempts, obtained hers in 2004 following the involvement of Stanislav Gross, Prague’s notoriously corrupt interior minister at the time. An immigration officer working on Elena’s case even attached a hand-written note to her file: “A red line running through this entire application has been the various people constantly trying to intervene to achieve a positive outcome.”</p><h3 id="article_block_1">All in the Family</h3><p>Even after the collapse of Communism, the white and black market trade in Soviet-era weapons was a growth industry, owing to the fact that so many nations around the globe – including new-minted members of the EU and NATO – had armies that still relied on kit manufactured in the U.S.S.R or its satellites. In the early 2000’s, Nikolai pitched his military expertise to Petr Bernatik, a former secret agent of the ŠtB, the Czechoslovakian state security service. An engineer by training, Bernatik had served as an undercover informant in the ŠtB’s counterintelligence department, which kept close ties with both the Soviet KGB and the occupying Red Army. After the Czech Republic became a free-market economy, Bernatik launched a number of arms trading companies and hired his former commanding officers from the Czech secret police to work for him. He apparently felt no compunction in also enlisting a former Russian officer.</p><p>The largest of Bernatik’s arms dealing businesses was Imex Group. Šapošnikov’s unofficial role in the company was that of a business development executive: he scouted sales opportunities and provided consultancy and support to Imex’s international customers. As time went by, Šapošnikov brought more and more of his own family into Imex. By 2012, both Valeria and Pavel, his daughter and stepson, were employed by the company. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/Bm_jDKnK-be3YB6j4ZPmqWRvduS6Keg0X9geyLqKrCo/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTcv/ZmlsZS1lYTQxYmUx/MjU1MzE1MzA4N2Y1/MDI3MTMzOWJjZDgw/Yy5wbmc.jpg" alt="Pavel Šapošnikov’s application to the Czech Pirate Party forum"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Pavel Šapošnikov’s application to the Czech Pirate Party forum</h5></p></div><div><p>A graduate of the University of Prague, Pavel joined Czechia’s libertarian center-left Pirate Party in 2014, describing himself in an online forum as a former “employee in the field of international trade” with “a different opinion from my superiors.” Pavel admired the grassroots movement’s doctrine of openness and transparency. “I don’t know how I can be helpful at the moment,” he posted to the party’s online forum as part of his application, “but maybe something will come up.” Pavel’s name was later <a href="https://forum.pirati.cz/viewtopic.php?t=37981&amp;start=10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> in a list of suspicious new applicants who were using avatars instead of photos in their online communication. Travel data shows Pavel flew to Simferopol, the provincial capital of Russian-occupied Crimea, in 2019.</p><p>Elena, meanwhile, ran her own business: a company that purported to import pig iron from former Soviet republics. But as Czech police would later discover, Elena was also deeply involved with her husband’s enterprise and intimately aware of Imex’s operations. In many ways, she seemed to be supervising and directing Nikolay’s activities in direct coordination with Andrey Averyanov, the head of Unit 29155. She communicated with Gen. Andrey Averyanov via email; his Gmail address, registered from a Russian IP address, is <a href="https://theins.ru/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="65130c11041f0c5654250208040c094b060a08">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>. (“Vitazi” in Russian means “knights.”)</p><p>Elena also provided a veneer of plausibility for the Šapošnikovs’ lavish lifestyle. Despite Šapošnikov’s modest income from Imex (around $650 per month), the family bought real estate in Czechia and Greece at a value far in excess of what their collective income could account for. As Czech investigators note, “in some cases their official income could not cover even their phone bill for the month.” Furthermore, Elena owned a company registered in the Marshall Islands and controlled two bank accounts in Switzerland. Those offshore accounts, plus unexplained cash infusions to their Czech banks and a series of in-cash payments, appeared to have been the real source of income. </p><p>Then there was their Greek villa.</p><h3 id="article_block_2">The GRU’s Hellenic Retreat</h3><p>In 2009 the Šapošnikovs purchased a sprawling villa on the picturesque Aegean peninsula of Halkidiki, Greece. The price, as recorded in the notarial deed of purchase obtained by <em>The Insider</em>, was 275,292 euros, or $300,000 at the time. Elena would later tell investigators that she had funded the investment “with money from my parents” – a tall order for the septuagenarian couple living in Kyiv on pensions of under $300 per month.</p></div><div><p>The Šapošnikovs moved into Villa Elena in 2010 and set off to run it as a hotel. They only visited Czechia occasionally from then on.</p><p>While sites such as Booking.com and Tripadvisor <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g16781003-d16780226-Reviews-Villa_Elena-Frama_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contain links</a> to the property, where it appears at least a few holidaymakers stayed and even left reviews, <em>The Insider</em> has not been able to find any publicly bookable dates since it started this investigation in 2021.</p><p>Unpublicized tourists include members of Unit 29155 who began traveling to the nearby port city of Thessaloniki – only an hour’s drive south-east from the villa – as soon as the Šapošnikovs took ownership.</p><p>Averyanov traveled to Thessaloniki under his cover identity of “Andrey Overyanov” and stayed in the vicinity of Villa Elena for a week between July 15 and July 21, 2013, metadata from his burner phone obtained by <em>The Insider </em>shows. Averyanov returned to Thessaloniki the following year, on the return leg of a trip he made to Amsterdam on August 25, 2014. At least four other members of Unit 29155 took trips to Thessaloniki and likely also stayed at Villa Elena in the period from 2012 to 2018. Some of these visits coincided with missions the operatives had in the region. </p><p>For example, Unit 29155 member Alexey Kapinos, whom Šapošnikov described to Czech investigators as “a family friend,” flew to Thessaloniki on a diplomatic passport on April 25, 2014. Just a day earlier, Kapinos’ GRU associates, all traveling under fake identities, arrived in Bulgaria. According to a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/04/26/how-gru-sabotage-and-assassination-operations-in-czechia-and-bulgaria-sought-to-undermine-ukraine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint investigation</a> by <em>The Insider</em> and <em>Bellingcat</em>, which has since been corroborated by indictments from Bulgarian prosecutors, Unit 29155 poisoned the Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev with an unidentified organophosphate substance at the time of this trip. </p><p>Emilian Gebrev, the head of the company EMCO, told <em>The Insider</em> that he had been befriended by the Šapošnikovs in 2012. The illegals evidently sought out his friendship despite the scarcity of common business projects between them. Gebrev said he remembered that Elena was the dominant partner in the marriage, always steering the conversation in her preferred direction. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/Z15nWbD-_sd0b4RgW2nac3ZXL-FZZa9FAtPloAYdKTI/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTYv/ZmlsZS1lNDk5YzRh/ODFiMmYxY2I2NzFh/YTIyZjhiOGRiMTU1/NC5qcGVn.jpg" alt="The Šapošnikovs — Nikolay and Elena"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>The Šapošnikovs — Nikolay and Elena</h5></p></div><div><p>As previously disclosed by <em>The Insider</em>, at the time of his poisoning Gebrev was seen as a consequential supplier of ammunition to the Ukraine Army, then reconstituting itself following Russia’s seizure of Crimea and orchestration of a plausibly deniable “separatist” insurgency in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Gebrev says that shortly before being poisoned he stopped supplying Ukraine with ammunition in voluntary compliance with the Minsk Accords, two serially violated ceasefire agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 by Ukraine, Russia, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Two sources active in weapons procurement in Ukraine at the time told <em>The Insider</em> that immediately after Gebrev’s poisoning, Šapošnikov offered Ukrainian government buyers “a reliable replacement” for the Bulgarian arms merchant. In the event, Kyiv never purchased from the supplier suggested by Šapošnikov due to the deficient quality of his inventory.</p><h3 id="article_block_3">The Saboteurs</h3><p>Czech police investigators now disclose that Elena, the senior illegal in the husband-and-wife team, communicated with Averyanov via his Gmail account, offering critical intelligence about pending weapons sale contracts involving Imex Group. The Šapošnikovs’ cultivation of Gebrev paid off. Their company began trading frequently with EMCO, which produced and repaired everything from Soviet-era artillery to armored vehicles across a host of plants in Bulgaria, often for export to Georgia and Ukraine. EMCO also refurbished dated Czech-made ammunition, including rounds subsequently purchased by Imex Group, corporate records show.</p><p>Averyanov’s interest in Imex Group’s partners across NATO was obvious. Any sales deemed contrary to Russia’s interest would be ideal targets for Unit 29155, which could target the weapons and ammunition, if not try to kill the brokers responsible for selling them to enemy states or non-state actors, such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a collection of Western-backed rebel groups opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Czechs allege that Imex Group was involved in deals with European counterparts that resold mines, assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and anti-tank missiles. One Slovakian company, Kelson, sought to acquire these wares through intermediary companies, all with the intent to resell them to the Saudi Ministry of Defense. The FSA, the Czechs conclude, were “probably” the ultimate recipient. (Saudi Arabia did indeed purchase weapons in Croatia that wound up in FSA custody, as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/middleeast/in-shift-saudis-are-said-to-arm-rebels-in-syria.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times </em>reported in 2013</a>.)</p><p>As a senior GRU commander overseeing a strictly kinetic unit within the service, Averyanov would have been ordered by Moscow to interdict covert weapons shipments intended for Syria’s mainstream insurgents, who, prior to Russia’s direct military intervention in the country’s civil war in 2015, were perilously close to unhorsing one of Russia’s most valued client regimes in the Middle East. The CIA and Turkish intelligence backed dozens of FSA formations battling Assad’s army and Iranian-backed militias until the rise of hardline jihadists, particularly as the Islamic State, transformed NATO’s approach to Syria as a counterterrorist mission. </p><p>On July 24, 2013, Averyanov wrote to Šapošniková that “very, very much we need a complete list…” of sought-after platforms. She later forwarded the GRU general attached PDF files titled “Aircraft_FSA.pdf,” “Ammunition_FSA.pdf,” and “Weapons_FSA.pdf,” all of which Pavel Šapošnikov sent her on August 3.  </p><p>The GRU was therefore “informed about the planned trade from beginning to end,” the Czech investigators conclude. “These goods were stored exclusively in Vrbětice in warehouses No. 16 and 12. As a result of the subsequent explosions, the goods were not delivered and were completely destroyed.”</p><p>The Šapošnikovs — likely aided by Petr Bernatik Jr., the executive director of Imex and the son of its founder — provided physical access to these warehouses. They may have also conspired to help the GRU commit an act of piracy or maritime terrorism.</p><p>The first case of Unit 29155 sabotaging a military consignment may have involved disappearing a ship carrying pontoon bridge parts and Ukrainian-made KrAZ trucks destined for Vietnam. The “INA,” a Ukrainian ship<strong>,</strong> disappeared in 2013 sometime after passing through the Suez Canal and switching off its transponder. According to Czech investigators, Elena and Averyanov “communicated about this order,” which set sail from the Bulgarian port of Varna on December 17, 2013, where the Šapošnikovs had arrived personally to oversee the departure. People familiar with the transaction told <em>The Insider</em> that this shipment would have interfered with a direct sale to Vietnam by a Russian arms export company, and the ship’s disappearance may have been aimed at sabotaging this competing supplier.</p><p>Almost a year later, on October 16, 2014, the first warehouse in Vrbětice went up in flames. </p><p>Czech investigators are clear that this was the handiwork of Unit 29155. On September 26 of that year, Averyanov, using his Gmail account, messaged Šapošnikova: “Hello Elena, I am sending a request to visit the warehouses…” </p><p>The subsequent digital exchange between the GRU handler and his Czech agent consisted of pleasantries and business. Šapošnikova wished “Andrusha,” the diminutive for Andrey, a happy birthday on September 29, and the two made plans to meet in person in Portugal the following month. Evidence shows Averyanov and Nikolay, along with Elena and their daughter Valeria, did in fact meet in Lisbon on October 3. </p><p>A week later, the Šapošnikovs were back in Czechia, where Nikolai met with Petr Bernatík Jr., the son of the Imex Group’s founder and “a key player in its operations,” according to investigators. Averyanov then sent a blank email to Bernatik Jr.’s corporate Imex address. The message contained an attachment of Photoshopped passport scans for two men: “Ruslan Khalimovich Tabarov” and “Nicolai Popa.” These were fake identities of Mishkin and Chepiga, the Unit 29155 operatives who would go on to poison the Skripals in Salisbury. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/S4zyAJebTxCk7S8KDpg48UhpMZuu0pEETBtml9_WHiA/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTgv/ZmlsZS1hOGFmZmY1/ODI0NTBmOGUyYmEy/MTk3NzE3YzlhZThm/MS5wbmc.jpg" alt="Photoshopped passport pages for Unit 29155 operatives Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, sent by their commander Gen.

Bernatik Jr. had no other correspondence on that day, nor did he conduct any other duties for Imex Group. He did, however, call Šapošnikov before and after forwarding Averyanov’s message. A little over an hour after forwarding Averyanov’s email, just before 10 o’clock in the morning, Mishkin and Chepiga cleared passport control in Prague. Later that day, they checked into the Florentina Boat Hotel in the Czech capital, where they mingled and flirted with a young Ukrainian woman, using the same absurd cover story they’d use for the Skirpal assassination: they were traveling sports nutritionists. </p><p>On Monday, October 13, Bernatik Jr.’s assistant instructed the warehouse authority in Vrbětice to allow entry for “Ruslan Tabarov” and “Nicolai Popa” anytime between October 14th and 17th. </p><p>The Šapošnikovs were at that exact moment meeting with Averyanov and his deputy Alexey Kapinos at the Gino Paradize Hotel in Besenova, a village in Slovakia. En route to the hotel, the Šapošnikovs would have passed through the city of Žilina, where another Unit 29155 operative, Nikolay Ezhov, was staying at the Polom Hotel, having arrived from Moscow together with Averyanov.</p><p>The complicity of Alexey Kapinos and Nikolay Ezhov, along with several other members of Unit 29155, to the targeted explosions in Vrbetice, were previously disclosed by a joint investigation by The Insider and Bellingcat. The new details provided by Czech investigators corroborate and supplement <em>The Insider's</em> findings which were based on analysis of travel data, shown in the map below. </p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/XxqY5AhwfmmxLrBHDpK6Vl7oDznj8YA1eSvW-p1by5Y/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ4OTkv/ZmlsZS0wYmM1MzY2/NWMyNGUzMTc2NDMx/OTcwYTZhZDkzMmVi/OS5wbmc.jpg" alt="Timeline and map of arrivals of members of 29155 in the area of the Vrbetice explosions in October 2014"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Timeline and map of arrivals of members of 29155 in the area of the Vrbetice explosions in October 2014</h5></p></div><div><p>Warehouse 16 blew up at 9:30 a.m. on October 16, turning the entire building into a giant inferno with secondary explosions caused by igniting gunpowder and incendiaries. The resulting blast was so severe that an hour later, the Institute of Geophysics at the Czech Academy of Science registered a large earthquake. Two Imex Group employees, Luděk Petřík and Vratislav Havránek, were killed instantly while conducting an inspection of aircraft engines and 152-millimeter artillery shells belonging to EMCO. Both Petřík and Havránek were ripped apart instantly; shrapnel from a Soviet PG-15 anti-tank grenade, a type of munition was later recovered from the severed remains of one of them. </p><p>A month and a half later, on December 3, artillery, mortars, and assault rifles – much of it owned by EMCO – began exploding in Warehouse 12 in the same Vrbětice facility. </p><h3 id="article_block_4">The Telltale Passport</h3><p>The Šapošnikovs were initially confronted by Czech investigators in 2021 with the array of incriminating overlaps between their actions, meetings, and communications with Unit 29155 and the explosions not only in Czechia, but also at arms warehouses in Bulgaria. As <em>The Insider</em> was the first to report, Unit 29155’s first kinetic operation on EU and NATO soil took place in the Bulgarian village of Lovnidol in 2011, after other operatives from the unit, using homemade detonators, blew up yet another EMCO consignment of artillery shells recently transported from the Vrbětice facility. Bulgaria was subsequently the target of 6 additional bombings or acts of arson, all perpetrated by Unit 29155. </p><p>The Šapošnikovs were subjected to several interrogations, conducted via the proxies of the Greek and Bulgarian authorities (the couple refused to travel to Czechia to submit themselves to questioning there). They repeatedly changed their testimony to try to account for new, independently sourced evidence with which they were confronted. Their main argument in favor of their innocence was that all their links to Unit 29155 were “personal” or driven by the legitimate business interests of Imex Group. The Šapošnikovs claimed they did not know Andrey Averyanov or Alexey Kapinos were members of an internationally wanted state terrorist organization. They further insisted that they did not knowingly assist Unit 29155 with any of their sabotage operations. The couple has accused Czech authorities of political persecution owing to their Russian heritage. Moreover, there is no predicate offense, as the 2014 explosions in Vrbětice, they maintain, were the result of industrial accidents.</p><p>The Šapošnikovs’ defense is unlikely to withstand the weight of forensic evidence compiled by Czech investigators — or the new discovery made by <em>The Insider</em> as this story was going to press. </p><p>Travel and border crossing data, recently made available thanks to an avalanche of terabytes leaked from Russian government databases, showed that Elena Šapošnikova is in possession of a secret Russian passport. Critically, her nine-digit passport number is part of a numerical range reserved exclusively for members of Unit 29155, differing from those of her colleagues only by its last two digits. Šapošnikova’s is 646518955.<strong> </strong></p></div><div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://api.theins.ru/images/kvEVpLy8KXwQlEBRWGDEIBDaQLbMj1ijFxa-yYmdGCU/rs:fit:866:0:0:0/dpr:2/q:80/bG9jYWw6L3B1Ymxp/Yy9zdG9yYWdlL2Nv/bnRlbnRfYmxvY2sv/aW1hZ2UvMjQ5MDAv/ZmlsZS1mNTdkMGI1/NTVjYmE5ODAyZWU2/YWU3ODRhMTc2ZmVm/NC5wbmc.jpg" alt="Passport numbers reserved exclusively for members of GRU Unit 29155"></p></div></figure></div><p><h5>Passport numbers reserved exclusively for members of GRU Unit 29155</h5></p></div><div><p>Šapošnikova used this passport to travel between Greece and Russia on at least two occasions, once in December 2015 and the second time in December 2017. In both cases, she used sophisticated tradecraft that sought to leave no trace in databases accessible to European authorities. For instance, she booked her trips and bought her plane tickets using her Czech passport, registering only that nationality with the Greek airline. But upon crossing the Russian border, Šapošnikova used her secret Russian passport, thus bypassing the need to obtain a Russian visa issued to her as a Czech citizen and eliding the digital footprint associated with the relevant application.</p><p>Notably, Šapošnikova’s first trip to Moscow under her GRU service passport lasted only two days. She traveled from Thessaloniki to Moscow on December 3, 2015 and left on December 5. The trip was short but sweet. It was on this visit that Vladimir Putin bestowed her Hero of the Russian Federation title, a decoration the naturalized Czech arms dealer and hotelier now shares with many of her colleagues in Russia’s elite band of murderers and saboteurs.</p><p><em>With additional reporting by Kato Kopaleishvili.</em></p></div><div><h5>SEE ALSO</h5></div></div><div><h4>Subscribe to our weekly digest</h4></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
On April 21, a group of anonymous authors and non-anonymous signatories published
<a href="https://save-nix-together.org/">a lengthy open letter</a> to the
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
Nix</a> community
and Nix founder Eelco Dolstra calling for his resignation from the project. They
claimed ongoing problems with the project's leadership, primarily focusing on the
way his actions have allegedly
undermined people nominally empowered to perform various
moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter has gained
more than 100 signatures.
</p>

<h4>Decision-making authority</h4>

<p>
The Nix project is governed by the
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/foundation">
NixOS Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization
that handles the project's finances and legal responsibilities. The foundation
itself is headed by a board with five voting members, chaired by Dolstra.
There are no term limits, and the board selects its own membership and chair.
According to <a href="https://nixos.org/community/teams/foundation-board/">
the board's team page</a>, its responsibilities include handling
"<q>administrative, legal, and financial tasks</q>", sponsorships and donations,
funding for "<q>community events and efforts</q>", and acting as an arbiter in
case of conflicts in the community. Notably, the board "<q>is not responsible
for technical leadership, decisions, or direction</q>", nor is it expected to
handle all decision making. The board is responsible for
providing "<q>a framework for teams
to self-organize</q>", including a duty to "<q>[h]and out the credentials and
permissions required for the teams' work</q>".
</p>

<p>
The open letter has several related complaints, but the most central one is that
they allege Dolstra has repeatedly strong-armed the board and members of
other community teams to overrule their decisions:
</p>

<blockquote>
For example, after months of discussion on sponsorship policy in the board, with
consensus having been formed on a policy that allows community veto of NixCon
sponsors, Eelco (and Graham [Christensen], at the same time) appeared at the
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/open-board-call-2024-03-20/41898/">
open board call
over 45 minutes in</a>, and began re-litigating the issue of whether we need to
limit sponsorship to begin with, which had already been agreed upon by everyone
but him.
</blockquote>

<p>
Christensen is Dolstra's co-founder at
<a href="https://determinate.systems/">Determinate
Systems</a>.
The letter lists other examples, such as Dolstra blocking longtime
contributors from becoming code reviewers or blocking a build-system change that
had made it through the RFC process.
The letter
concludes that Dolstra is essentially
leveraging social power from being the founder of the project to overrule
decisions that are nominally supposed to be made collaboratively.
In short, Dolstra is acting as "<q>the effective Benevolent Dictator for Life
(BDFL)</q>" of the
project, even though the NixOS Foundation's charter doesn't grant anyone that
authority.
The letter
says this leads to "<q>a culture of responsibility without authority</q>" that
erodes contributors' desire to continue working on the project. It specifically
mentions the moderation team as an example of this, saying that its members are
"<q>in fear of
their authority being undermined directly by Eelco or indirectly through the
Foundation</q>".
</p>

<p>
When asked to comment on the concerns raised in the letter, members of the NixOS
moderation team responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Overall we think that the letter describes the situation of the
moderation team fairly well. We have been operating in an emergency
mode most of the time for over half a year now. Our team retention is
at an all time low, and we are barely able to keep up with recruiting
new members as old ones quit. Right now the moderation team is down to
four people, including two who desire to leave as soon as a replacement
is found, not counting another moderator who left last week.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that the moderation team feels disempowered, this is
mostly because of heavy antagonism from some community members or risks
of destabilizing the community, and not because of an actual lack of
power. Most of that is a reflection of a deeper cultural conflict
within the community and not directly related to the foundation board.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite slightly disagreeing with the source of the issue,
they went on to acknowledge that Dolstra had impeded several attempts to improve
the situation, and said that they understood many community members' complaints.
The team also
called the situation itself "a deep structural and cultural issue involving
many people".
</p>

<p>
Pierre Bourdon, a long-time contributor to Nix,
<a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/112310645064859357">
posted on Mastodon</a> about his experience working on NixOS,
<a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/112310661634038271">
stating</a> that while
he disagrees with the tone and approach of the open letter, the factual
statements about Dolstra's leadership match his own experience.
</p>

<h4>Conflicts of interest</h4>

<p>
The letter also alleges several conflicts of interest, primarily concerning
Dolstra's employer, Determinate Systems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries">
Anduril</a>, a military contractor that uses NixOS, has repeatedly
attempted to become a sponsor of NixCon, which did not go over well with the
community, as reflected in the minutes of
the board meeting on March 20. The letter says Dolstra pushed
strongly for the inclusion of Anduril as a sponsor even after it became clear
that many core contributors disagreed. Anduril was eventually dropped as a sponsor
for <s>both</s> <a href="https://2023.nixcon.org/">NixCon 2023</a>
<s>and <a href="https://2024-na.nixcon.org/">NixCon 2024</a> after community
pressure</s>.
[Thanks to Martin Weinelt for pointing out that
<a href="https://2024-na.nixcon.org/#sponsors">Anduril did end up sponsoring NixCon
2024</a>.]
</p>

<p>
On April 10, Théophane Hufschmitt, the secretary of the board, shared
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-event-sponsorship-policy/43110">
an update</a> on the board's
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/blob/bb7af14ae242ab87c8312bb4122b2a3cd184462d/policies/sponsorship_policy.md">
new sponsorship policy</a>. Hufschmitt expressed the board's apologies for the
way the situation was handled, and promised that "<q>we will prioritize
transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness in our decision-making
processes</q>."
</p>

<p>
That same day, Samuel Dionne-Riel
<a href="https://twitter.com/samueldr/status/1778259760707448853">
stated</a> that Dolstra had refused to clarify
whether he had a relationship with Anduril and
asked
Christensen, a co-founder of Determinate Systems: "<q>Does DetSys have or had
relationships with Anduril?</q>" Christensen
<a href="https://twitter.com/grhmc/status/1778386025007460682">replied</a>:
"<q>Did you know this
category of question is pretty much impossible to answer because NDAs are a
thing?</q>"
</p>

<p>
This isn't the only time Dolstra has appeared to avoid disclosing potential
conflicts of interest; the letter alleges that
he kept his status as a founder of Determinate Systems secret for
some months (a claim Dolstra later denied), and that
this is especially worrying in light of some of the technical
promises that Determinate Systems makes to customers. The company produces its
own installer for Nix that the company promises will provide stable support for some
Nix features. The letter states: "<q>This is fine, however, it is questionably
acceptable to do that while employing <em>the lead developer of CppNix</em>
[the main Nix implementation] and saying
nothing about how this will interact with the team's [decision-making]
autonomy.</q>"
The concerns are not entirely theoretical, either;
the main Nix installer has been
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/10109">
broken in various ways</a> since version 2.18 in September 2023.
</p>

<h4>Call to action</h4>

<p>
The final section of the letter calls
for Dolstra's resignation from the board, suggesting that he should also
completely disengage from the project for at least six months, to give the rest
of the board time to reform the project's governance.
</p>

<blockquote>
This document should be seen as the canary in the coal mine for what <em>many</em> people
have been feeling for years and does not exhaustively cover absolutely all
problems in the community, but we hope it is enough to justify action.
</blockquote>

<p>
The letter ends by suggesting that if Dolstra doesn't resign, the signatories
would switch to and support a fork of the project.
I contacted several of the
signatories to ask whether they'd be willing to provide additional commentary on
why they believed a letter like this to be a necessary step.
Haydon Welsh responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
I signed the letter because it was clear that every other team member was
sick and tired of Eelco, and so I saw it only right if that's their only
hope to regain enthusiasm for the project. No open-source project should
die or be hard-forked because of one person, that destroys a lot of the
purpose for being open-source.
</blockquote>

<p>
Kiara Grouwstra had stronger feelings on the matter:
</p>

<blockquote>
While I want a full rotation of members on the NixOS board, as well as
changes to its goal and structure so as to better incorporate the
community including marginalized perspectives, my friend convinced me
the polemic response would not sit well with the moderators, and shared
with me the draft open letter about Eelco's role, which I opted to
settle for as the lower-hanging fruit right now.
</blockquote>

<p>
On April 27, Xe Iaso wrote <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/much-ado-about-nothing/">
a blog post</a> about xer perspective on the matter, stating that at this point
a fork is both inevitable and doomed.
Even if the actions called for in the letter do come about, the difficult
situation is already having an impact on the Nix community. On April 21, Nixpgs
contributor Kamila Borowska
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/305826">resigned from the project</a>.
On April 25, Mario Rodas, who had contributed more than 250 packages,
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/306702">
followed suit</a>. In total, 24 maintainers
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=label%3A%228.has%3A+maintainer+removal%22">
have left</a>.
</p>

<h4>Dolstra's response</h4>

<p>
On April 26, Dolstra posted
<a href="https://determinate.systems/posts/on-community-in-nix/">
a response</a> to the letter.
He states that the role of the board is to handle the
financial and legal work, not to run the Nix community.
He also claims that he has had "<q>very little involvement in Nixpkgs and NixOS
in recent years</q>".
Dolstra goes on to state: "<q>I am just one member of the five-member Nix team
and hold no more formal authority than the others in determining the direction
of the team.</q>"
While this is true, it does not directly refute the
letter's claims that Dolstra exceeds the formal authority granted to him.
</p>

<p>
Dolstra also reiterated his position that NixCon should not refuse Anduril's
sponsorship, stating: "<q>It is my opinion that it is not for us, as open source
software developers, to decide whose views are valid and whose are not, and to
allow or disallow project or conference participation as a result.</q>"
Dolstra does, however, explicitly refute the claim that his involvement in
Determinate Systems was at all secret: "<q>My role,
participation, and focus on the good work being done at Determinate Systems have
been public knowledge since the company's inception</q>". He goes on to say that
the claim that Determinate Systems seeks to have an outsized influence on the
community is "<q>patently false</q>".
</p>

<p>
He ends his response by inviting community members who feel unwelcome in
the Nix community to work for Determinate Systems instead:
</p>

<blockquote>
I remain committed to creating a community where everyone feels seen, heard, and
valued, and I will not let unfounded accusations detract from this important
work. I encourage everyone reading this who feels that they have not been heard
or feels displaced to join the Determinate Systems community as we continue
working to make Nix as easy to use and as impactful as possible.
</blockquote>

<p>
It is difficult to predict where the Nix community will go from here, and
what the eventual fate of any forks will be. For
now, Dolstra remains the chair of the board — a position he seems unlikely to
give up under pressure from the letter's signatories.

<p><em>Note from Jeremy</em>: This is my personal submission to the authors of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">bill SB-1047</a>. It’s not an official Answer.AI statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a comment from Jeremy Howard regarding SB-1047. I am an AI researcher and entrepreneur. I am the CEO of Answer.AI, an AI R&amp;D lab registered to do business in California. I am the author of popular AI software including the fastai library, a widely used AI training system. I am the co-author of <em>Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD</em>, a widely-praised book with a 4.7 rating on Amazon based on nearly 500 reviews, and am the creator of the <em>Practical Deep Learning</em> series of free courses, the longest-running deep learning course in the world, with over 5 million views. I co-authored the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification</a>, which created the 3-stage language model pre-training and fine-tuning approach on which all of today’s language models (including ChatGPT and Gemini) are based.</p>
<p>While the intent of SB-1047 to ensure the safe and secure development of AI is commendable, certain provisions within the bill raise serious concerns regarding their potential impact on open-source developers, small businesses, and overall innovation within the AI sector. This response aims to highlight these concerns and suggest alternative approaches that could achieve the desired safety goals without stifling the dynamism of the AI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ironically, by imposing these restrictions on open-source development, SB-1047 could actually reduce overall safety within the AI ecosystem, in particular through reducing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency and Collaboration</strong>: Open-source development fosters transparency and collaboration, allowing a wider range of experts to identify and address potential safety concerns. Restricting this open development model limits the ability of the broader community to contribute to safety solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity and Resilience</strong>: Open-source projects contribute to a more diverse and resilient AI landscape. Concentrating control within a few large entities creates single points of failure and increases the potential for systemic risks.</li>
</ul>
<section id="concerns-regarding-open-source-development">
<h2 data-anchor-id="concerns-regarding-open-source-development">Concerns Regarding Open-Source Development</h2>
<p>Open source has been a key enabler of the success of the US software industry, and has allowed many Americans to access critical software tools which would otherwise be unavailable to them. Open source has, in particular, provided many of the fundamental building blocks for modern artificial intelligence, and is the basis on which nearly all academic research (including safety and security research) is done. Harming open source will harm developers, consumers, academics, and obstruct the development of new startups. The bill would cause harm in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overly Broad Definitions</strong>: The definition of “covered model” within the bill is extremely broad, potentially encompassing a wide range of open-source models that pose minimal risk. This could inadvertently criminalize the activities of well-intentioned developers working on beneficial AI projects.</li>
<li><strong>Dual use</strong>: An AI model is a general purpose piece of software that runs on a computer, much like a word processor, calculator, or web browser. The creator of a model can not ensure that a model is never used to do something harmful – any more so that the developer of a web browser, calculator, or word processor could. Placing liability on the creators of general purpose tools like these mean that, in practice, such tools can not be created at all, except by big businesses with well funded legal teams.</li>
<li><strong>Restrictive Requirements</strong>: The bill imposes significant burdens on developers, including mandatory shutdowns, extensive reporting, and compliance with potentially ambiguous “covered guidance.” These requirements could disproportionately impact open-source developers who often lack the resources of larger corporations to navigate complex regulatory processes.</li>
<li><strong>Disincentivizing Openness</strong>: The fear of legal repercussions and bureaucratic hurdles could discourage open-source development, hindering the collaborative spirit that has been instrumental in driving AI advancements. This reduction in transparency could also make it more difficult to identify and address potential safety concerns.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="impact-on-small-businesses-and-innovation">
<h2 data-anchor-id="impact-on-small-businesses-and-innovation">Impact on Small Businesses and Innovation</h2>
<p>The proposed regulations create significant barriers to entry for small businesses and startups looking to innovate in the AI space. The costs associated with compliance, coupled with the legal risks, could deter entrepreneurs and limit competition. This would ultimately stifle innovation and concentrate power within established corporations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barrier to Entry</strong>: The substantial costs associated with compliance, including fees, audits, and legal counsel, could create a significant barrier to entry for small businesses and startups. This would limit competition and concentrate power within established corporations, ultimately hindering innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Chilling Effect on Research</strong>: The fear of inadvertently triggering the bill’s provisions could lead researchers and developers to self-censor or avoid exploring promising avenues of AI research. This would stifle scientific progress and limit the potential of AI to address societal challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Talent</strong>: The restrictive environment created by the bill could drive talented AI researchers and developers out of California, harming the state’s economy and weakening its position as a leader in AI innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>California plays a critical role in driving US innovation, particularly in the technology sector. By placing undue burdens on AI development, SB-1047 risks hindering the state’s leadership in this crucial field. This could have ripple effects throughout the US, slowing down overall progress in AI research and development.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternative-approaches">
<h2 data-anchor-id="alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches</h2>
<p>Instead of focusing on regulating AI model development, I urge you to consider alternative approaches that address the actual risks associated with AI applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support Open-Source Development</strong>: Encourage and facilitate the open-source development of AI models to foster collaboration, transparency, and a more diverse and resilient AI ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Usage, Not Development</strong>: Instead of regulating the development of AI models, the focus should be on regulating their applications, particularly those that pose high risks to public safety and security. Regulate the use of AI in high-risk areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and critical infrastructure, where the potential for harm is greatest, would ensure accountability for harmful use, whilst allowing for the continued advancement of AI technology.</li>
<li><strong>Promote Transparency and Collaboration</strong>: Encourage the development and adoption of best practices for responsible AI development through collaboration between industry, academia, and government. This could involve creating industry standards, fostering open-source development, and investing in AI safety research.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in AI Expertise</strong>: Provide resources to government agencies to develop expertise in AI and build capacity to effectively monitor and address potential risks. This would enable a more informed and nuanced approach to AI regulation that balances safety with innovation.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h2 data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>California has a unique opportunity to lead the way in responsible AI development. However, SB-1047, in its current form, risks stifling innovation and undermining the state’s leadership in AI. By adopting alternative approaches that prioritize accountability for harmful use while fostering a vibrant and open AI ecosystem, California can ensure the safe and beneficial advancement of this transformative technology.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<article>
  
  <div><p>If you asked a lawyer whether ChatGPT could do his job, he would laugh you out of the room. The tool is often useful, but can’t handle legal questions end to end. It makes up sources, its reasoning can be flawed, and it may overlook key aspects of the law.</p>
<p>We decided to tackle this problem at <a href="https://hotseatai.com/">Hotseat</a>. After iterating multiple times, implementing advanced agentic workflows, and testing with dozens of lawyer, we’re certain that the product has glaring limitations and it won’t replace any jobs soon. However, we figured out an unintuitive, LLM-only method of doing RAG, and we leveraged it to make LLMs answer complex questions about select EU regulations.</p>
<p>In this post, you’re going to learn how to implement a system that can perform advanced reasoning over very long documents.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>A great answer to a legal question must at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be based on sound reasoning;</li>
<li>Quote the source text of the law to be verifiable; and</li>
<li>Take into account all relevant parts of the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet these requirements, we had to put the relevant documents in the prompt - we couldn’t just hope that the LLM was trained on all of the law. We also limited our scope to a single regulation. It made the problem approachable, and we could scale later.</p>
<p>In our first attempts, we<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> fed the entire 226 pages of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">EU’s AI Act</a> into GPT-4 and asked a sample question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the deployment of an LLM acting as a proxy to optimize SQL queries fall within the regulatory scope of the EU’s AI Act?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we found that GPT-4 couldn’t give us a good answer.</p>
<p>A lawyer would start by asking some helper questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the proxy meet the definition of an AI system?</li>
<li>Can the proxy be classified as a high-risk AI system?</li>
<li>Will the proxy process personal or sensitive data?</li>
</ol>
<p>But in a single response, GPT-4 couldn’t both break down the question and answer it. The former task requires a high-level analysis of the document, and the latter - low-level focus on details.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>We split answering the question into subtasks.</p>
<p>The rough idea is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make GPT-4 figure out which subquestions it should ask; then</li>
<li>Answer each subquestion independently; and</li>
<li>Aggregate the findings into a single response.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-down-the-question">Breaking Down the Question</h3>
<p>To answer a legal question based on a single regulation, GPT-4 must first find the relevant sections. It requires high-level reasoning across the entire document.</p>
<p>We discovered that GPT-4 can complete this task well, provided you prompt it carefully. All the standard prompt engineering guidelines apply. Crucial were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structuring the document with Markdown.</strong> Without it, reasoning over 80,000 tokens wouldn’t work.</li>
<li><strong>Roleplaying.</strong> We framed the task as a senior lawyer planning out work for a junior lawyer.</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/give-the-model-time-to-think"><strong>Tokens to “think.”</strong></a> We gave the model space to produce internal notes about the task - like how it understands the user’s question - before asking for the plan itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>We designed the output so it corresponds to a list of subquestions required to answer the main question. Each point is self-contained; it includes specific instructions and references to sections of the document. If a lawyer looked at any single step, they could carry it out themselves.</p>
<p>Here’s what GPT-4 gave us:</p>
<div>
<h4 id="plan-for-the-junior-lawyer">Plan for the Junior Lawyer</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify Relevant High-Risk Categories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Analyze <strong>Annex III</strong> for high-risk AI systems to see if the language model fits under any listed categories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Examine Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Look at <strong>Articles 8-15</strong> to understand general requirements for high-risk AI systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>…</li>
</ol>
<p><em>(The other 7 points truncated for brevity. Full plan <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/9ba6cf3e172f38b288dc1705ecde9967">here</a>, and the prompt <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/6ef19e197feec9e4ce42c3b6994a919d">here</a>.)</em></p>
</div>

<p>The quality of the plans still surprises me. When we analyzed them for questions from actual lawyers, we found that GPT-4 generally covers all necessary subquestions.</p>
<h3 id="answering-subquestions">Answering Subquestions</h3>
<p>The plan is executed by a simple AI agent. In fact, just a single conversation that GPT-4 has with itself.</p>
<p>GPT-4 is prompted with instructions to assume the role of a “master agent” tasked with answering a legal question based on the pre-generated plan. It can delegate subquestions to “junior lawyers” - in fact, separate GPT-4 chats - by calling <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">functions</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example function call:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="js"><span><span><span>AnnexAnalysis</span>({
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"task"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Analyze Annex III for high-risk AI systems to see if the language model fits under any listed categories."</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"annexes"</span><span>:</span> [<span>"Annex III"</span>],
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"legal_question"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Does the deployment of an LLM acting as a proxy to optimize SQL queries fall within the regulatory scope of the EU's AI Act?"</span>
</span></span><span><span>})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We convert such calls into prompts that contain the task, the question, the specified parts of the regulation, and instructions to carry out the task. Whatever GPT-4 outputs is fed back into the master chat as the junior lawyer’s answer.</p>
<p>We preprocess the regulation so that when a call contains a reference to “Annex III,” we know which pages to put into the “junior lawyer’s” prompt. This is the LLM-based RAG I mentioned in the introduction.</p>
<p>Compared to analyzing the entire AI Act, GPT-4’s reasoning is massively boosted when it’s given a clear task and a short context. With a 5k-token-long prompt, you can even usually trust the LLM to correctly quote the source, which is useful to a user verifying the final answer.</p>
<p>We implemented the master AI agent as a while loop. It goes on as long as GPT-4 calls functions, going through the plan step by step. Eventually, after all subquestions are answered, it outputs the final answer in a format we can detect with a regex. We then break the loop and return the answer to the user.</p>
<p>You can see the final answer <a href="https://hotseatai.com/ans/does-the-development-and-deployment-of-q_2azysfQoPxFksVXKW8TYw2TGT79#legal-trace">here</a>, in the “Legal trace” section.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/58ccf2d104c0fe9a8f7bde585d304d59">the master prompt</a> along with <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/004b8e90ca55e5c6f8f83e3eb603cf01">function definitions</a>, and here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/hugodutka/d19137accea33fc4a0105f94f7f296c0">the junior lawyer’s prompt</a>.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-limitations">Results and Limitations</h2>
<p>Answering a question this way takes 5 to 10 minutes and costs about $2 with GPT-4.</p>
<p>The highlight of testing the system with dozens of lawyers was when a GDPR specialist reviewed its answers. The lawyer ranked 8 out of 10 responses as excellent, and the remaining 2 as overly cautious in interpreting the law.</p>
<p>However, over the long term, we found that GPT-4 can identify subquestions very well but often can’t answer them correctly. In non-trivial scenarios, it makes logical errors.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Lawyers also told us that when they answer a question, they rarely touch upon a single regulation. Not only do they analyze multiple regulations, but they also take into account supporting documents such as various guidelines, regulatory technical standards, and court rulings. In contrast, this system can only process a single document at a time.</p>
<p>We’ve learned that the combination of high latency, faulty reasoning, and limited document scope kills usage. No lawyer wants to expend effort to ask a detailed question, wait 10 minutes for an answer, wade through a 2-pages-long response, and find that the AI made an error.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">In late 2020, Dr. Debby Day said her bosses at Cigna gave her a stark warning. Work faster, or the company might fire her.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">That was a problem for Day because she felt her work was too important to be rushed. She was a medical director for the health insurer, a physician with sweeping power to approve or reject requests to pay for critical care like life-saving drugs or complex surgeries.</p>
        
    
                    

<figure data-pp-id="3" data-pp-blocktype="embed">

</figure>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">She had been working at Cigna for nearly 15 years, reviewing cases that nurses had flagged for denial or were unsure about. At Cigna and other insurers, nurses can greenlight payments, but denials have such serious repercussions for patients that many states require that doctors make the final call. In more recent years, though, Day said that the Cigna nurses’ work was getting sloppy. Patient files that nurses working in the Philippines sent to her, she said, increasingly had errors that could lead to wrongful denials if they were not corrected.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Day was, in her own words, persnickety. If a nurse recommended denying coverage for a cancer patient or a sick baby, she wanted to be certain it was the right thing to do. So Day said she researched guidelines, read medical studies and scrutinized patient medical records to come to the best decision. This took time. She was clearing fewer cases than many of her peers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Some of her colleagues quickly denied requests to keep pace, she said. All a Cigna doctor had to do was cut and paste the denial language that the nurse had prepared and quickly move on to the next case, Day said. This was so common, she and another former medical director said, that people inside Cigna had a term for these kinds of speedy decisions: “click and close.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">“Deny, deny, deny. That’s how you hit your numbers,” said Day, who worked for Cigna until the late spring of 2022. “If you take a breath or think about any of these cases, you’re going to fall behind.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">In a written response to questions, Cigna said its medical directors are not allowed to “rubber stamp” a nurse’s recommendation for denial. In all cases, the company wrote, it expects its doctors to “perform thorough, objective, independent and accurate reviews in accordance with our coverage policies.” The company said it was unaware of the use of the term “click and close” and that “such behavior would not be tolerated.”</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">During Day’s final years at Cigna, the company meticulously tracked the output of its medical directors on a monthly dashboard. Cigna shared this spreadsheet with more than 70 of its doctors, allowing them to compare their tally of cases with those of their peers. Day and two other former medical directors said the dashboard sent a message loud and clear: Cigna valued speed. (ProPublica and The Capitol Forum found these other former Cigna doctors independently; Day did not refer them.) One of Day’s managers in a written performance evaluation called the spreadsheet the “productivity dashboard.”</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Measuring the speed and output of employees is common in many industries, from fast food to package delivery, but the use of these kinds of metrics in health care is controversial because the stakes are so high. It’s one thing if a rushed server forgets the fries with your burger. It’s another entirely if the pressure to act fast leads to wrongful denials of payment for vital care. <a href="https://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/news-media/press-releases/2022/walgreens-sharpens-focus-on-patient-care-and-experience-eliminating-task-based-metrics-for-pharmacy-staff-performance-reviews-chainwide">Walgreens in 2022 dropped measurements of its pharmacists’ speed</a> from their performance reviews after some alleged that practice could <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/walgreens-will-stop-judging-pharmacy-staff-fast-work-rcna54297">lead to dangerous mistakes</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">ProPublica and The Capitol Forum examined Cigna’s productivity dashboards for medical directors from January and February 2022. These spreadsheets tallied the number of cases each medical director handled. Cigna gave each task a “handle time,” which the company said was the average amount of time it took its medical directors to issue a decision.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Day and others said the number was something different: the maximum amount of time they should spend on a case. Insurers often require approval in advance for expensive procedures or medicines, a process known as prior authorization. The early 2022 dashboards listed a handle time of four minutes for a prior authorization. The bulk of drug requests were to be decided in two to five minutes. Hospital discharge decisions were supposed to take four and a half minutes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">“Medical directors would message me and say, ‘We can’t do these cases in four minutes. Not if you want to do a good job,’” Day recalled.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">As ProPublica and The Capitol Forum reported last year, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims">Cigna built a computer program that allowed its medical directors to deny certain claims in bulk</a>. The insurer’s doctors spent an average of just 1.2 seconds on each of those cases. Cigna at the time said the review system was created to speed up approval of claims for certain routine screenings; the company later <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/pxdx">posted a rebuttal</a> to the story. A congressional committee and the Department of Labor launched inquiries into this Cigna program. A spokesperson for <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001159-cathy-mcmorris-rodgers">Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers</a>, the chair of the congressional committee, said Rodgers continues to monitor the situation after Cigna shared some details about its process. The Labor Department is still examining such practices.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">One figure on Cigna’s January and February 2022 dashboards was like a productivity score; the news organizations found that this number reflects the pace at which a medical director clears cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Cigna said it was incorrect to call that figure on its dashboard a productivity score and said its “view on productivity is defined by a range of factors beyond elements included in a single spreadsheet.” In addition, the company told the news organizations, “The copy of the dashboard that you have is inaccurate and secondary calculations made using its contents may also be inaccurate.” The news organizations asked what was inaccurate, but the company wouldn’t elaborate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Nevertheless, Cigna said that because the dashboard created “inadvertent confusion” the company was “reassessing its use.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Day was afraid to look at the dashboards. Anyone could see that by Cigna’s measures, she was a laggard. In January 2022, only a third of her peers had lower scores, and in February 2022, it was just a quarter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">In a recorded phone call and in emails with supervisors, Day complained that Cigna’s metrics failed to account for the quality of decisions. She said she and others asked higher-ups how often medical director decisions were overturned on appeal but nobody would say.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Day gave Cigna written permission to discuss her employment with ProPublica and The Capitol Forum.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">The company described Day as a “disgruntled former employee” and said her “personal view is not an accurate representation of the work of the many medical directors and clinicians we employ.” Cigna added that prior authorization requests are often time-sensitive and the company’s “mission is to ensure our patients receive the right care as quickly as possible.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">Cigna rejected the assertions that denying cases was an effective way of working faster. “Even if medical directors were incentivized to review more claims — which they are not — it makes no sense to suggest that this incentivizes denials; it would be far quicker to approve all claims,” the company spokesperson wrote. The insurer said that denials take more time because they require a deeper review of clinical data, potentially requesting additional reviews by senior clinical directors, drafting denial letters and possibly phoning the treating physicians.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">But another doctor who had worked at Cigna also said that denying a request for payment was far quicker than approving one since the nurses served up language that could be used to justify the denial. That former Cigna medical director said, “Sometimes you just have to accept the nurse and click and close if you had too much work.” (That doctor asked not to be named because they feared repercussions if they commented publicly.)</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">When Debby Day got her job at Cigna in November 2005, she thought it was a godsend.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">She had been working for a health insurance startup in North Carolina. The charismatic founder of the company, Day said, had told her and a handful of principal executives to expect a windfall when the company went public. That never happened, and Day was eventually left with no job and no severance.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">When a recruiter mentioned the medical director job at Cigna, it sounded like a perfect fit. The job was based in North Carolina, but Cigna didn’t mind that she was licensed in California, where she did her residency at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. She was ready to leave the executive track, and the position allowed her to put her medical training to good use without the daily grind of working in a clinic.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">The daughter of an ophthalmologist, Day had watched her father perform eye surgery when she was a child, and she found medicine fascinating. When Day started practicing, she learned quickly that while she enjoyed the intellectual challenges of medicine, the hands-on work of seeing patients drained her. As a medical director, she said, “I could really take care of patients without having to talk to them all day long.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">Cigna, like all health insurers, makes patients get approval in advance for certain treatments. Day became one of the people who reviewed these prior authorization requests, deciding what to cover and what to deny. Everyone Day worked with was under one roof in Raleigh, North Carolina. The office buzzed with conversations among colleagues, and she was able to consult with specialists on complex cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">She never felt pressure to do anything but make the right decision for the patient. At the same time, she said, she didn’t hesitate to reject treatment she thought was improper.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">A couple years into her time at Cigna, Day noticed some doctors prescribing a costly treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG, that helps patients with weakened immune systems fight off infections. Only she found they were prescribing it in cases where it didn’t make any medical sense. That wasn’t good for patients or for Cigna. “Some of these guys were pouring it into every patient they could get their hands on and then making hundreds of thousands of dollars billing for it,” she recalled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">At the time, Cigna didn’t have a policy for when IVIG should be used, so Day developed one based on the scientific evidence available at the time. Day said this saved millions of dollars and that Cigna rewarded her with bonuses and stock options.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">“In my head I truly believed that you could marry good health care with business,” she said.</p>

<hr>

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">As Day neared the end of her first decade at Cigna, the company closed regional offices in favor of a nationwide review system, she said. With medical directors working from home, Day could no longer pop down the hallway to consult with doctors in other specialities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Cigna had used a productivity dashboard for years, but by 2019, these metrics began playing a more prominent role in the company’s evaluations of medical directors, Day said. Now, making a fast decision seemed more important than making the right decision, she said. In February 2019 emails to her managers, Day openly questioned this system.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Her boss responded: “We all understand that many cases are involved and take more time,” he wrote. “We have tried to account for that additional time in the allotment allowed for certain cases.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Still, he made it clear that transaction volume — the metric on the dashboard that was similar to a productivity score — was one of the factors “we use to determine merit raises, bonus” and stock awards. When asked about this, Cigna said that “any assertion that our Medical Directors’ compensation (cash or stock) is tied to denials or their handle time for cases is false.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">In that same 2019 email, Day’s boss added, “We want to assist every medical director who wishes to improve his or her efficiency.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.1">Day shot back, “Some of our newer MDs are quite terrified of the ‘counting,’” she wrote. “All ask — ‘how is quality measured?’”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.2">Soon, Day realized that her boss wasn’t talking in the abstract about improving efficiency; he was talking about her. She learned that managers were going to help her pick up the pace of her reviews.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.3">When bosses reached out, they didn’t discuss whether she was making the right call, only how long it took her to decide, she said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">By then, Day said, Cigna had shifted much of the nursing work to the Philippines. She found mistakes in the case files that these nurses sent. In an email to Day, a fellow medical director lamented the amount of time it took to untangle one case and said the reports by “the overseas nurses” were “messes.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Some of the more astonishing problems that Day spotted have stayed with her. In a case involving a newborn who needed an epilepsy evaluation, Day noticed that a Cigna nurse had listed the mother’s name as the patient, rather than the baby’s. Day fixed that mistake, avoiding what certainly would have been a denial. In another case, a nurse recommended denying payment for an ultrasound of the neck because the treatment wasn’t medically necessary. But the nurse had gotten the body part wrong. It was a hip that was injured, and the imaging was needed. An appeal that landed on Day’s desk involved Cigna’s decision to reject payment for a test because it wasn’t medically necessary for a patient with a sexually transmitted disease. But Day figured out that the patient had toenail fungus, not an STD.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Day said her bosses didn’t want to hear that she was catching errors. By October 2020, Cigna had placed Day on a performance improvement plan that required her to raise her “productivity level” — referring to the score on the dashboard — to at least 70%, which would be a significant jump for her but was slightly below the median for medical directors. The company made the consequences crystal clear: If she failed to successfully complete the plan, she could be terminated.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">ProPublica and The Capitol Forum asked Cigna how it calculated that score, but the company wouldn’t say. “Transaction volume helps gauge productivity and efficiency — the amount of work done, not the speed at which it is done,” a Cigna spokesperson wrote. The company said this metric measured the time a medical director spent on tasks involving medical judgment versus other work, such as internal meetings or training.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">On the early 2022 productivity dashboard, though, a different calculation could explain Day’s score, and this math reflects how fast medical directors reviewed cases. ProPublica and The Capitol Forum multiplied the number of cases Day handled by the time Cigna allotted for each type of case, then divided that total by the hours she worked that month. The resulting percentage equaled her score. Medical directors who spent every available minute of their workdays clearing cases within the time constraints Cigna set would score at least 100%. Indeed, some medical directors had scores greater than 100%, meaning they cleared cases in even less than the allotted time. The newsrooms’ formula accurately reproduced the scores of 87% of the Cigna doctors listed; the scores of all but one of the rest fell within 1 to 2 percentage points of the number generated by this formula. When asked about this formula, Cigna said it may be inaccurate but didn’t elaborate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">Day said her bosses told her that the way to boost her score was to review more cases during her normal work hours.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">Responding to questions, Cigna said the productivity dashboard was “primarily used to ensure that we have enough medical directors to perform the amount and type of work that needs to be done.” It is not used, the company said, to evaluate the performance of medical directors or track the speed at which individual doctors do their work.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Cigna, however, later said of the dashboard that “in the unusual situation that a medical director is a significant outlier to peers performing similar types of reviews, managers might use this metric as one data point to understand and discuss the variance with the medical director.” It also said Day was placed on a performance improvement plan “to help her meet the most basic standards to support patient care.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">During the time Day spent on the performance improvement plan, she refused to change her approach, which she felt was necessary to make the right call.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">In December 2020, she appealed to the human resources department, figuring that colleagues there would see that it was wrong to fire a medical director for taking care to decide critical medical questions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">She was wrong.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">“You feel that the time constraints/metrics, which are in place to review these cases are unreasonable, for some cases are very complex consisting of multiple pages to review,” a Cigna human resources employee wrote, summing up Day’s feelings as the matter escalated.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">And while Day’s supervisor “appreciates your attention to detail,” the human resources employee wrote, he “also realizes that there are metrics in place that he must hold everyone to.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">When asked about this, Cigna said, “Dr. Day raised questions about her performance improvement plan through appropriate internal ethics channels available to all employees, and there was no wrongdoing found.”</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">Eventually, the daily stress of being pushed to work faster coupled with the threat of being fired took a toll on Day. Sleepless and fighting depression, Day was at the breaking point.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.1">“I actually sort of had a mental breakdown,” she recalled.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.2">The supervisor said he heard Day’s concerns “loud and clear” but warned that “at the end of the day, we need to get your productivity up and we don’t have a lot of time to do that.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">The focus on metrics was proof Cigna was losing its way, Day told her boss. When she started working at Cigna 15 years earlier, there was a “commitment to quality and taking care of our customers.” Day said that it was still important to her and other medical directors that “we go home at the end of the day and think we’ve done a good job for Cigna.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">In a response to questions, Cigna said the supervisor, who works in California, was unaware that he was being recorded and that under that state’s laws, it is illegal to record a private phone call without all parties’ consent.

                                    <p>Prefixes are treacherous little beasts. Just when you think you've come to an understanding, prefixes such as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in-"><em>in</em>-</a> will come along and carry meanings such as “not,” “in, within,” “into,” “toward,” or “put into or onto.” And to make things worse, some of the beginnings of words which appear to be prefixes aren’t prefixes at all, even if they seem to function in the same manner. </p>

<p>Why are we bringing this up? Well, we didn’t want to tell you in this way, but we didn’t want you to hear it from someone else, either. There’s a new sense of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonplussed"><em>nonplussed</em></a> that people have been using, and…well, we’d just like to give you fair warning in case our descriptivist nature causes us to take action. This new sense appears to stem from a mistaken belief that the first three letters of <em>nonplus</em> are there to indicate that someone is something other than “plussed” (although what being plussed would entail here remains a mystery). </p>

We'll never know.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It’s somewhat questionable whether the <em>non</em> in <em>nonplus</em> is actually a prefix at all; the word came into English in the 16th century, and was taken from the Latin <em>non plus</em>, which means “no more.” When it first appeared in our language it was used as a noun, with the meaning of “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quandary">quandary</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was then, and is now, the answere to that friuolous obiection, and this is the Nonplus that the Libeller vaunteth of.<br>—Thomas Cooper, <em>An Admonition to the People of England</em>, 1589</p>
  
  <p>I am brought to a nonplus, O Lorde what shall I saie?<br>—Edward Hutchins, <em>Davids Sling Against Great Goliath</em>, 1593</p>
  
  <p>So that now we are much beholding to M. Deacon, and M. Walker, that haue put all fooles and mad men to a perpetuall non plus, whose tongues would otherwise continually bee tampring.<br>—John Darrel, <em>The Replie of Iohn Darrel</em>, 1602</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the early 17th century <em>nonplus</em> was being used as a verb, with the meaning of “to cause to be at a loss as to what to say, think, or do.” Then, as now, the word is often encountered in its participial form (<em>nonplussed</em>), with a meaning that is nearly synonymous with “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perplexed">perplexed</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here may the Non-plust wooer fetch a wile 
  <br>To breake all Remora's, plots to beguile 
  <br>All Fortune's crosses: and if language faile, 
  <br>Here may he learne to court, triumph, bewaile 
  <br>I'th eloquentest straines.<br>—Achilles Tatius, <em>The Loves of Clitophon and Leucippe</em>, 1638</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the next three hundred and some years <em>nonplus</em> remained on the straight and narrow, avoiding the temptations of demon rum and semantic drift, and as a result of this managed to keep its meaning remarkably unchanged. And then in the early 20th century some people began to use <em>nonplus</em> to mean “unruffled, unconcerned,” and ever since then the word just hasn’t been the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I came just in time to see two policemen pushing the car to one side so that the firewagon could get near the plug.
  <br>Of course anyone knows that under very embarrassing circumstances one is to appear non-plussed, as they say, and smoke a cigarette.<br>—<em>The Pittston Gazette</em> (Pittston, PA), 15 Aug. 1930</p>
  
  <p>The onlooker at the right appears nonplussed at the game the posters offer, but then—she’s only a mannequin.<br>—<em>The Mason City Globe-Gazette</em> (Mason City, IA), 16 Apr. 1948</p>
  
  <p>Twelve-year-old E. B. “Buzzie” Barker Jr. remained nonplussed yesterday despite the attention and congratulations that he was receiving for having won the Peninsula’s Soap Box Derby Sunday.
  <br>”I think we are more excited than he is,” his mother, Mrs. Barton Barker, commented. “He is just about as unconcerned about the whole thing,” she said, but didn’t finish.<br>—<em>Daily Press</em> (Newport News, VA), 28 Jun. 1955</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “unruffled” sense of <em>nonplussed</em> increased as the 20th century went on, although when it was noticed this sense has been categorically rejected as a mistake. Mistake it may well be, but the fact remains that this sense of the word is in widespread use today, and may be found often enough in well regarded and highly edited, publications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While senior officials in the Israeli Foreign Ministry fume over the diplomatic mess caused by the implications of the Dubai assassinations, those who know Mr Dagan say he is nonplussed by the row.<br>—<em>The Times</em> (London, UK), 18 Feb. 2010</p>
  
  <p>There is also the stumbling conversation of the other blind novitiates,but we are all really dependent on the voice of our guide, Romeo Edmead, a vigorous, charming man, completely nonplussed by the tumult we find around us.<br>—Edward Rothstein, <em>The New York Times</em>, 19 Aug. 2011</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a lesson here, it is that you should never trust prefixes (or anything that looks like one). It may leave you <em>nonplussed</em>.</p>

This type of agent can reason over which of the tools to use next to further the response, feed inputs into the selected tool, and repeat the process with the output until it determines that the answer is satisfactory.</li>
<li>Current tool suite:
While we didn't emphasize equipping the agent with many tools, we hope to see memary help agents in the community equipped with a vast array of tools covering multi-modalities.
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Location</strong> - determines the user's current location and nearby surroundings using geocoder and googlemaps.</li>
<li><strong>CV</strong> - answers a query based on a provided image using gpt-4-vision-preview.</li>

<li>KGs vs other knowledge stores
<ul dir="auto">
<li>KGs provide more depth of essential context that can be easily retrieved.</li>
<li>The knowledge store's graph structure allows information to be centered around certain entities and their relationships with other entities, thus ensuring that the context of the information is relevant.</li>
<li>KGs are more adept at handling complex queries, as the varying relationships between different entities in the query can provide insight into how to join multiple subgraphs together.</li>

<li>memary uses a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.18059.pdf" rel="nofollow">recursive retrieval</a> approach to search the KG, which involves determining what the key entities are in the query, building a subgraph of those entities with a maximum depth of 2 away, and finally using that subgraph to build up the context.</li>
<li>When faced with multiple key entities in a query, memary uses <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/knowledge-graphs-llms-multi-hop-question-answering/" rel="nofollow">multi-hop</a> reasoning to join multiple subgraphs into a larger subgraph to search through.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>What is the memory module?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The memory module comprises the Memory Stream and Entity Knowledge Store. The memory module was influenced by the design of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.06318.pdf" rel="nofollow">K-LaMP</a> proposed by Microsoft Research.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The Memory Stream captures all entities inserted into the KG and their associated timestamps. This stream reflects the breadth of the users' knowledge, i.e., concepts users have had exposure to but no depth of exposure is inferred.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Timeline Analysis: Map out a timeline of interactions, highlighting moments of high engagement or shifts in topic focus. This helps in understanding the evolution of the user's interests over time.</li>
<li>Extract Themes: Look for recurring themes or topics within the interactions. This thematic analysis can help anticipate user interests or questions even before they are explicitly stated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Entity Knowledge Store tracks the frequency and recency of references to each entity stored in the memory stream. This knowledge store reflects users' depth of knowledge, i.e., concepts they are more familiar with than others.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Rank Entities by Relevance: Use both frequency and recency to rank entities. An entity frequently mentioned (high count) and referenced recently is likely of high importance, and the user is well aware of this concept.</li>
<li>Categorize Entities: Group entities into categories based on their nature or the context in which they're mentioned (e.g., technical terms, personal interests). This categorization aids in quickly accessing relevant information tailored to the user's inquiries.</li>
<li>Highlight Changes Over Time: Identify any significant changes in the entities' ranking or categorization over time. A shift in the most frequently mentioned entities could indicate a change in the user's interests or knowledge.</li>
<li>Additional information on the memory modules can be found <a href="https://github.com/seyeong-han/KnowledgeGraphRAG">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Purpose in larger system
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compress/summarize the top N ranked entities in the entity knowledge store and pass to the LLM’s finite context window alongside the agent's response and chat history for inference.</li>
<li>Personalize Responses: Use the key categorized entities and themes associated with the user to tailor agent responses more closely to the user's current interests and knowledge level/expertise.</li>
<li>Anticipate Needs: Leverage trends and shifts identified in the summaries to anticipate users' future questions or needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future contributions
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We currently extract the top N entities from the entitiy knowledge store and pass these entities into the context window for inference. memary can future benefit from more advanced memory compression techniques such as passing only entities that are in the agent's response to the context window. We look forward to related community contributions.</li>

<p dir="auto">Currently memary is structured so that the ReAct agent can only process one query at a time. We hope to see <strong>multiprocessing</strong> integrated so that the agent can process many subqueries simultaneously. We expect this to improve the relevancy and accuracy of responses. The source code for both decomposing the query and reranking the many agent responses has been provided, and once multiprocessing has been added to the system, these components can easily be integrated into the main <code>ChatAgent</code> class.

<p dir="auto">What is query decomposition?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A preprocessing technique that breaks down complex queries into simpler queries to expedite the LLM’s ability to answer the prompt. It is important to note that this process leaves simple queries unchanged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Why decompose?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>User queries are complex and multifaceted, and base-model LLMs are often unable to fully understand all aspects of the query in order to create a succinct and accurate response.</li>
<li>Allows an LLM of similar capabilities to answer easier questions and synthesize those answers to provide an improved response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">How it works</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Initially, a LlamaIndex fine-tuned query engine approach was taken. However, the LangChain query engine was found to be faster and easier to use. LangChain’s <code>PydanticToolsParser</code> framework was used. The query_engine_with_examples has been given 87 pre-decomposed queries (complex query + set of subqueries) to determine a pattern. Users can invoke the engine with individual queries or collate them into a list and invoke them by batch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Individual Invocation: <code>sub_qs = query_analyzer_with_examples.invoke( {"question": "What is 2 + 2? Why is it not 3?"} )</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Batch Invocation:
<code>questions = [ "Where can I buy a Macbook Pro with an M3 chip? What is the difference to the M2 chip? How much more expensive is  the M3?", "How can I buy tickets to the upcoming NBA game? What is the price of lower bowl seats versus nosebleeds? What is the view like at either seat?", "Between a Macbook and a Windows machine, which is better for systems engineering? Which chips are most ideal? What is the price difference between the two?",] </code></p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Purpose in larger system</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In a parallel system, the agent will be able to parse multiple queries at once. The query decomposer (QD) will pass all subqueries (or original query if no subqueries exist) to the agent at once.</li>
<li>Simultaneously, QD will pass the original query to the reranking module to rerank the agent responses based on their relevance to the pre-decomposed query.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>What is reranking?
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Reranking is the process of scoring nodes based on their relevancy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why rerank agent responses?
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ensure that the various responses to subqueries, when merged, are relevant to the original query prior to decomposition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our Approach
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We benchmarked three models to determine which one would best work for reranking: BM25 Reranking Fusion, Cohere Rerank, and ColBERT Rerank. After testing BM25, it was clear that the model was not able to classify the different responses and provide a simple merged answer. Instead of answering the question, it combined all the information on the page, introducing irrelevant information.</li>
<li>Next, when testing out Cohere, the model performed better than BM25 but was still not classifying the paragraphs well. The reranking was not always accurate, as it performed well for some questions but was not able to rank others. Furthermore, the ranking was still pretty inaccurate, performing between 0.25 - 0.5 out of 1.</li>
<li>Finally, we tested ColBERT rerank, and it was found that this model performed best compared to the other two. ColBERT was able to synthesize results from the given data and ranked them very accurately, with reranking scores between 0.6 - 0.7 out of 1. With this, ColBERT had the most potential, being able to determine which responses were most related and important to answering the query.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purpose in larger system
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Passes the reranking result to the knowledge graph for storage and to the model as one source of context for inference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future contributions
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Once agent multiprocessing is integrated, reranking can be integrated into the <code>ChatAgent</code> class.</li>
<li>Future Benchmarking: Include the Cohere Rerank 3 model and others in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHzvgktqnHcg7wbIuKHr6W5NMYk6UVlJkRQfSqzk9e4/edit" rel="nofollow">reranking analysis</a>.

                        The "thorium transition", which physicists have been looking for for decades, has now been excited for the first time with lasers. This paves the way for revolutionary high precision technologies, including nuclear clocks.
                    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Physicists have been hoping for this moment for a long time: for many years, scientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state of thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological applications. It could be used, for example, to build an nuclear clock that could measure time more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today. It could also be used to answer completely new fundamental questions in physics - for example, the question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change in space and time.</p><p>Now this hope has come true: the long-sought thorium transition has been found, its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been possible to use a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher energy and then precisely track its return to its original state. This makes it possible to combine two areas of physics that previously had little to do with each other: classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. A crucial prerequisite for this success was the development of special thorium-containing crystals. A research team led by Prof. Thorsten Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now published this success together with a team from the National Metrology Institute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal "Physical Review Letters".</p><h3>Switching quantum states</h3><p>Manipulating atoms or molecules with lasers is commonplace today: if the wavelength of the laser is chosen exactly right, atoms or molecules can be switched from one state to another. In this way, the energies of atoms or molecules can be measured very precisely. Many precision measurement techniques are based on this, such as today's atomic clocks, but also chemical analysis methods. Lasers are also often used in quantum computers to store information in atoms or molecules.</p><p>For a long time, however, it seemed impossible to apply these techniques to atomic nuclei. "Atomic nuclei can also switch between different quantum states. However, it usually takes much more energy to change an atomic nucleus from one state to another – at least a thousand times the energy of electrons in an atom or a molecule," says Thorsten Schumm. "This is why normally atomic nuclei cannot be manipulated with lasers. The energy of the photons is simply not enough."</p><p>This is unfortunate, because atomic nuclei are actually the perfect quantum objects for precision measurements: They are much smaller than atoms and molecules and are therefore much less susceptible to external disturbances, such as electromagnetic fields. In principle, they would therefore allow measurements with unprecedented accuracy.</p><h3>The needle in the haystack</h3><p>Since the 1970s, there has been speculation that there might be a special atomic nucleus which, unlike other nuclei, could perhaps be manipulated with a laser, namely thorium-229. This nucleus has two very closely adjacent energy states – so closely adjacent that a laser should in principle be sufficient to change the state of the atomic nucleus.</p><p>For a long time, however, there was only indirect evidence of the existence of this transition. "The problem is that you have to know the energy of the transition extremely precisely in order to be able to induce the transition with a laser beam," says Thorsten Schumm. "Knowing the energy of this transition to within one electron volt is of little use, if you have to hit the right energy with a precision of one millionth of an electron volt in order to detect the transition.” It is like looking for a needle in a haystack – or trying to find a small treasure chest buried on a kilometer-long island.</p><h3>The thorium crystal trick</h3><p>Some research groups have tried to study thorium nuclei by holding them individually in place in electromagnetic traps. However, Thorsten Schumm and his team chose a completely different technique. "We developed crystals in which large numbers of thorium atoms are incorporated," explains Fabian Schaden, who developed the crystals in Vienna and measured them together with the PTB team. "Although this is technically quite complex, it has the advantage that we can not only study individual thorium nuclei in this way but can hit approximately ten to the power of seventeen thorium nuclei simultaneously with the laser – about a million times more than there are stars in our galaxy." The large number of thorium nuclei amplifies the effect, shortens the required measurement time and increases the probability of actually finding the energy transition.</p><p>On November 21, 2023, the team was finally successful: the correct energy of the thorium transition was hit exactly, the thorium nuclei delivered a clear signal for the first time. The laser beam had actually switched their state. After careful examination and evaluation of the data, the result has now been published.</p><p>"For us, this is a dream coming true," says Thorsten Schumm. Since 2009, Schumm had focused his research entirely on the search for the thorium transition. His group as well as competing teams from all over the world have repeatedly achieved important partial successes in recent years. "Of course we are delighted that we are now the ones who can present the crucial breakthrough: The first targeted laser excitation of an atomic nucleus," says Schumm.</p><h3>The dream of the atomic nucleus clock</h3><p>This marks the start of a new exciting era of research: now that the team knows how to excite the thorium state, this technology can be used for precision measurements. "From the very beginning, building an atomic clock was an important long-term goal," says Thorsten Schumm. "Similar to how a pendulum clock uses the swinging of the pendulum as a timer, the oscillation of the light that excites the thorium transition could be used as a timer for a new type of clock that would be significantly more accurate than the best atomic clocks available today."</p><p>But it is not just time that could be measured much more precisely in this way than before. For example, the Earth's gravitational field could be analyzed so precisely that it could provide indications of mineral resources or earthquakes. The measurement method could also be used to get to the bottom of fundamental mysteries of physics: Are the constants of nature really constant? Or can tiny changes perhaps be measured over time? "Our measuring method is just the beginning," says Thorsten Schumm. "We cannot yet predict what results we will achieve with it. It will certainly be very exciting."</p><h3>Original publication</h3><p>Laser excitation of the Th-229 nucleus, Physical Review Letters:<br><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><p>Full paper (preprint): <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Picture download</h3><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/tu-wien/aktuelles/news/news/bilderdownload" target="_blank">Download pictures provided by TU Wien and PTB<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Further reading</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/die-lange-suche-nach-dem-thorium-uebergang" target="_blank">Historical Background: The Long Search for the Thorium Transition<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/von-atomkern-uhren-und-den-grundkonstanten-der-natur" target="_blank">Applications: Nuclear Clocks and the Fundamental Constants of Nature<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/high-tech-edelsteine-fuer-die-forschung" target="_blank">The Crystal Trick:&nbsp;High-tech Gemstones for Nuclear Science<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Info_Package.pdf" title="thorium" target="_blank">Download full info package (PDF)<span>, opens a file in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Contact</h3><p>Prof. Thorsten Schumm<br> Institute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics<br> TU Wien<br> +43 1 58801 141896<br><span>thorsten.schumm<span>@</span>tuwien.ac.at</span></p><p>Text: Florian Aigner</p></div></div>]]></description>

Looked back on with the blessing of hindsight, there exists a discrete before and after the moment, but for those who lived it, the moment may have had a very long "during" period. Those who live in the "during" find themselves impatient, looking to be on the other side of the event, anxiously waiting for "now" to be "history". They want to live to see the thing complete. They want it to be done.</p><p>For when "now" becomes history, there is a sense of peace of mind, a complete loop, a chord that resolves into something.</p><blockquote>
<p>History cannot be told while it is happening, therefore, not only because the people involved are too busy or too confused to puzzle it out, but because what is happening can’t be made sense of until its implications have been resolved.</p>

Even when they were doing timesharing, they talked in terms of virtual card readers and virtual card punches. Everything was still 80-column records.

This claim began to come true years later with the release of the GPT Store (<a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-42/"><em>discussed in issue #42</em></a>). Suddenly, individual people – not at the organization level – found themselves being able to create their own solutions to their unique, idiosyncratic problems.</p><blockquote>Idiosyncratic technology creates a natural world.</blockquote><p>By writing detailed instruction sets and using tactics like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/semantic-search?ref=bramadams.dev">semantic search</a> and <a href="https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/function-calling?ref=bramadams.dev#:~:text=Function%20calling%20is%20a%20powerful,with%20external%20APIs%20and%20services.">function calling</a>, LLMs <strong>leverage</strong> the effort of the individual into emergent and complex processes. </p><p>This <strong>leverage</strong> is the same leverage that made personal computing so ubiquitous, so quickly. The leverage created a new asset class, data. It gave us (you and me) superpowers of communication, and those of us who could communicate with the programs themselves (programmers) found themselves solving problems that gave them access to near limitless wealth.</p><blockquote>It’s cheaper to reuse existing software components than to write code from scratch, which also makes it possible for entrepreneurs to start software companies with fewer up-front costs. The entire software industry owes its financial success to leveraging this arbitrage.</blockquote><p><em>-- Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em></p><h3 id="personal-library-science-is-leverage-for-ones-library">Personal Library Science Is Leverage For One's Library</h3><p>Personal Library Science is the <strong>leverage of LLM technology, applied to a personal library.</strong> </p><p>A <em>personal</em> <em>library</em> differs from a <em>impersonal</em> <em>library</em> in the fact that a personal library is an <strong>interpretation</strong> of a source material. These interpretations include: photographs from different photographers at the same event, or favorite scenes from a movie, or favorite passages from books, parts of songs that bring you to tears, etc. Importantly, these interpretations create unique sets that go on to create unique problems which require unique, idiosyncratic solutions. Sound familiar?</p><blockquote>While a painting or a prose description can never be other than a narrowly selective interpretation, a photograph can be treated as a narrowly selective transparency. But despite the presumption of veracity that gives all photographs authority, interest, seductiveness, the work that photographers do is no generic exception to the usually shady commerce between art and truth. Even when photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, they are still haunted by tacit imperatives of taste and conscience. The immensely gifted members of the Farm Security Administration photographic project of the late 1930s (among them Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, Russell Lee) would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right look on film—the precise expression on the subject’s face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry. In deciding how a picture should look, in preferring one exposure to another, photographers are always imposing standards on their subjects. Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are. Those occasions when the taking of photographs is relatively undiscriminating, promiscuous, or self-effacing do not lessen the didacticism of the whole enterprise. This very passivity—and ubiquity—of the photographic record is photography’s “message,” its aggression.</blockquote><p><em>-- On Photography</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="848" height="1200" srcset="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg 600w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In <a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-54/">issue #54</a>, I wrote: </p><blockquote>...personal library science is focused on&nbsp;<strong>your relationship with your information</strong>. How do we&nbsp;<strong>store</strong>&nbsp;information so that it useful at a later date? How do we&nbsp;<strong>transform</strong>&nbsp;our information into new valuable assets in different creative domains? How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of&nbsp;<strong>eight billion distinct individuals</strong>? How do we <strong>chronicle</strong> the information diet of a single person as they learn new things, interact with the world at different phases in their life? How do we make sure we can <strong>pass down</strong> our best knowledge to generations below?</blockquote><p>Many of these questions were asked and solved by the existence of personal computing. The existence of software has had a foundational impact on the types of solutions we can create to solve these large, incalculable problems. By solving them over and over in slightly different ways that make sense to an individual the problem eventually dissolves. </p><p>In fact, I'd argue that the history of personal computing teaches us that <strong><em>all top down solutions are less complete – and therefore less useful – than bottom up emergent solutions</em></strong>.</p><p>The issue is that we are now deluged with data, our interpreter antenna is going haywire trying to calculate, to store, to relate, to understand.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.affuture.org/post/9-context/">https://www.affuture.org/post/9-context/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40192204">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>California legislators, under the influence of Effective Altruism activists, are trying to sneak through a disastrous bill for open-source AI and the technology industry generally.</p>
<p>SB 1047 creates an unaccountable Frontier Model Division that will be staffed by EAs with police powers, and which can throw model developers in jail for the thoughtcrime of doing AI research. It’s being fast-tracked through the state Senate. Since many cloud and AI companies are headquartered in California, this will have worldwide impact.</p>
<p>We need your help to stop this now. It only takes a few minutes, and three steps, but you need to do them soon, ideally this week. Non-California residents are very welcome to comment, and indeed many of the supporters are not from California.</p>
<p>1. Submit a position letter to the bill author, which ensures that your position shows up on all future bill analyses that state Senators read. Go to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047</a>, click on “Comments to the Author”, register an account and submit an opposition letter.</p>
<p>Use your own words for the letter, and feel free to borrow liberally from or cite friend of AFTF Context Fund’s analysis of the bill (<a href="https://www.context.fund/policy/sb_1047_analysis.html">https://www.context.fund/policy/sb_1047_analysis.html</a>). One of key arguments being advanced is that this is “pro-little guy”, so if you’re involved in the open source movement, are a startup founder, or an investor, heavily cite your experience and how the bill affects you personally.</p>
<p>If it’s still before May 5th, also submit comments to the Senate Appropriations Committee: <a href="https://sapro.senate.ca.gov/position-letters">https://sapro.senate.ca.gov/position-letters</a>. Unfortunately, you have to submit to both the committee and the author to make sure the position letter is fully considered at the hearing.</p>
<p>2. Also add your public comment to the Context Fund analysis document (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk8uRTs0tiQ8O4k6ZVkwnOQX5n2PSdFhh0sXeXoDNM4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk8uRTs0tiQ8O4k6ZVkwnOQX5n2PSdFhh0sXeXoDNM4/edit</a>).</p>
<p>3. Tell your friends about this and introduce it to the media, publications you are connected to, and your own social media followings, especially those serving the ML, tech and startup audiences.</p>
<p>Most builders and investors who would be affected by this bill are not aware of it, but the special interests are. We need to change that quickly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Until recently, the dominance of ultra-processed food and alcohol companies has seemed unassailable. With corporate food engineers cranking out more and more hyper-palatable products, the negative health impacts seemed to only be moving in one direction.&nbsp; The tide might be about to turn.</p><p><span>Morgan Stanley recently did a survey of people taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Mounjaro.&nbsp; CNBC and Quartz got private looks at the survey results.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://qz.com/ozempic-drugs-alcohol-tobacco-use-1851430022" rel="">Quartz wrote</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The investment bank also surveyed about 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. Analysts at the bank have previously cautioned that the growing use of GLP-1s will put some longterm pressure on fast food sales, as users have reported spending less money at restaurants…</p><p>While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1.</p><p>Morgan Stanley found similar results when it asked respondents about their use of alcohol. About 56-62% of alcohol consumers on GLP-1s reported drinking less alcohol since starting the medications, with about 14-18% cutting their alcohol consumption entirely.</p></blockquote><p><span>And here’s how </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/20/weight-loss-drug-patients-spend-less-on-restaurants-takeout-survey.html" rel="">CNBC reported it</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The findings add to the mounting concerns that soaring demand for GLP-1s could take a bite out of the bottom lines of some of the biggest restaurant companies and makers of packaged snacks like Doritos, Oreos and Hershey’s Kisses. GLP-1s include Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly’s popular weight loss treatment Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro.&nbsp;</p><p>The rising demand for these four drugs isn’t expected to ease anytime soon. In the new survey, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth $105 billion by 2030. They also estimate that 31.5 million people, or around 9% of the U.S. population, will take GLP-1s by 2035.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is growing evidence that the drugs have a meaningful impact on consumer behavior and spending on groceries and restaurants,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in the survey. “All of these dynamics suggest GLP-1 drugs’ impact across consumer sectors is set to increase as drug uptake grows and the drugs reshape behavior among a demographic group that represents a disproportionate share of calorie consumption.”</p></blockquote><p><span>It’s pretty amazing that a reporter can write with a straight face that people eating less Doritos and Oreos is a ‘mounting concern’!&nbsp; Will CNBC soon report ‘mounting concerns’ that Purdue Pharma’s sales of OxyContin could decline?  This survey is not exactly ‘science’ but it aligns with </span><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/27-reddit-users-describe-how-ozempic" rel="">patient reports</a><span> and </span><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/news-roundup-will-glp-1-drugs-revolutionize" rel="">recent studies</a><span> showing a broad reduction in cravings for food and substances among patients taking GLP-1s.</span></p><p>If GLP-1s prove effective for addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and anxiety–areas being studied and showing promise– the percentage of the population taking using them could far exceed 9%.&nbsp;&nbsp;While replacing a dependence on corporate processed food brands with a dependence on big pharma might sound like a mixed blessing, the broad health, longevity, and mortality benefits for those eligible appear to overwhelmingly justify the trade-off.  As more GLP-1 competitors come to market and prices fall, the benefit to the public will easily outweigh the costs.  </p><p><span>There are also opportunities for regulators, particularly in the US, to impose price controls on GLP-1s that ensure equitable access across class and race.  States that are </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/16/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-medicaid-coverage-glp-1" rel="">restricting medicaid access</a><span> to GLP-1s for weight loss are exacerbating the already vast health outcome inequalities in the United States. A policy of cost-restriction and access guarantees would bring massive public health benefits.</span></p><p>We are doing in-depth research on GLP-1 studies of addiction and mental health and will be publishing more articles soon on the science and medical uses.&nbsp; We hope you will share and subscribe (it’s free).</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/growing-concerns-that-ozempic-will?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/growing-concerns-that-ozempic-will?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>For more of our writing and research on GLP-1 and addiction, please subscribe (it’s free!) and see these recent articles:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/ozempic-is-showing-us-that-a-cure" rel="">Ozempic is Showing Us That a Cure for Addiction is Possible</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/news-roundup-will-glp-1-drugs-revolutionize" rel="">News Roundup: Will GLP-1s Revolutionize Addiction Treatment?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/27-reddit-users-describe-how-ozempic" rel="">27 patients describe how Ozempic and Mounjaro reduced their urge to drink alcohol</a></p></li></ul><p>If you are interested in getting involved with our group, we are always looking for PhD, MD, and other experts in the field of addiction to join the effort.

<p id="Ogo4DO">Low-slung station wagons are <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/1000830/bring-back-station-wagons">all but extinct</a> on American roads, and even sedans have become an endangered species. (Ford, producer of the iconic Model T a century ago, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/448349/ford-explains-killing-off-sedan/">no longer sells any sedans</a> in its home market.) Bulky SUVs and pickup trucks — which have themselves steadily<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/27/suvs-gm-ford-toyota-chevrolet/4408728002/"> added pounds and inches</a> — now comprise more than <a href="https://jalopnik.com/trucks-and-suvs-are-now-over-80-percent-of-new-car-sale-1848427797">four out of every five new cars sold</a> in the US, up from just over half in 2013, even as national household size <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/">steadily declines</a>.</p>

<p id="fF4PSD">The expanding size of automobiles — <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/12/cars-trucks-suv-sales-electric-safety-risk.html">a phenomenon I call car bloat</a> — has deepened a slew of national problems. Take road safety: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-03/why-us-traffic-safety-fell-so-far-behind-other-countries">Unlike peer nations</a>, the US has endured a steep rise in traffic deaths, with fatalities among pedestrians and cyclists, who are at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pedestrian-cyclist-deaths-safe-cars-afcf8e6fd1b1cbfbd1a5360a29f08308#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMany%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,organs%2C%20rather%20than%20the%20legs.">elevated risk</a> in a crash with a huge car, recently hitting <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-says-traffic-deaths-fell-slightly-first-nine-months-2022-2023-01-09/">40-year highs</a>. Vehicle occupants face danger as well. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2019.1632442">2019 study</a> concluded that compared to a smaller vehicle, an SUV or a pickup colliding with a smaller car was 28 percent and 159 percent, respectively, more likely to kill that car’s driver.</p>
<p id="UmXKlY">Car bloat also threatens the planet. Because heavier vehicles require more energy to move, they tend to gulp rather than sip the gasoline or electricity that powers them, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Extra weight also accelerates the erosion of <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">roadways</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/car-tires-6ppd-pollution-epa.html">tires</a>, straining highway maintenance budgets and releasing microplastics that damage ecosystems.</p>

<p id="el1OJ7">What lies behind this shift? Some Americans prefer bigger cars, especially when gas prices are low, for their ample storage space, ability to see over other vehicles on the road, and perceived safety benefits (more on that later). But shifting consumer demands tell only part of the story.</p>
<p id="4Klv9c">For half a century, a litany of federal policies has favored large SUVs and trucks, pushing automakers and American buyers toward larger models. Instead of counteracting car bloat through regulation, policymakers have subtly encouraged it. That has been a boon for car companies, but a disaster for everyone else.</p>
<p id="zdEawh">Here are some of the most egregious examples.</p>
<h3 id="ZsvvYC">Why we let bigger cars pollute more</h3>
<p id="FFBhtm">After the 1970s OPEC oil embargo triggered a spike in gas prices, the federal government adopted an array of policies intended to reduce energy demand.</p>
<p id="Cvt5Af">One of Congress’s most consequential moves was creating the <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards#:~:text=First%20enacted%20by%20Congress%20in,of%20cars%20and%20light%20trucks.">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) standards, which require that the average fuel economy (miles per gallon, or MPG) of a carmaker’s vehicles remain below a set threshold.</p>
<p id="OI4H7Q"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Mighty-Dangerous-Rise-Suv/dp/B000A176P6" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/High-Mighty-Dangerous-Rise-Suv/dp/B000A176P6?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Pressed by auto lobbyists</a>, Congress made a fateful decision when it established CAFE. Instead of setting a single fuel economy standard that applies to all cars, CAFE has two of them: one for passenger cars, such as sedans and station wagons, and a separate, more lenient standard for “light trucks,” including pickups and SUVs. In 1982, for instance, the <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10562">CAFE standard</a> for passenger cars was 24 mpg and only 17.5 mpg for light trucks. </p>
<p id="W24lfu">That dual structure didn’t initially seem like a big deal, because in the 1970s SUVs and trucks together accounted for <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a2108816/definition-truck-cafe-loophole-critics-say/">less than a quarter </a>of new cars sold. But as gas prices fell in the 1980s, the “light truck loophole” encouraged automakers to shift away from sedans and churn out more pickups and SUVs (which were also more profitable). </p>
<p id="f8gRdx">Car ads of the 1980s and 1990s frequently featured owners of SUVs and trucks <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=349512193261157">taking family trips</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9fYfKlPltI">going out with friends</a>, activities that could also be done in a sedan or station wagon. The messaging seemed to resonate: By 2002, light trucks comprised <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-714-february-13-2012-light-truck-sales-rise">more than half of new car sales</a>.</p>
<p id="14FtbS">In the early 2000s, the federal government made these distortions even worse.</p>
<p id="wxXTXh">During the George W. Bush administration, CAFE was <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2011/04/20/driving-to-545-mpg-the-history-of-fuel-economy">revised</a> to further loosen rules for the biggest cars by tying a car model’s efficiency standard to its physical footprint (which is basically the shadow cast by the vehicle when the sun is directly above it). President Obama then incorporated <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/obama-announces-new-national-fuel-policy-two-harmonized-standards-with-fleet-average-of-355-mpg-250-.html">similar footprint rules </a>into new greenhouse gas emissions standards that are overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
<p id="HCO78I">Dan Becker, who led the Sierra Club’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate" data-source="encore">global warming</a> program from 1989 to 2007, told me that he and others <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna30327904">warned</a> federal lawmakers that adopting footprint-based standards was a mistake. “People like me were saying, ‘give carmakers another loophole and they’ll use it,’” he said. “But we lost.” </p>
<p id="yKEYkZ">Those concerns proved justified. The average vehicle footprint expanded 6 percent between 2008 and 2023, a “historic high,” according to an <a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/download-automotive-trends-report">EPA report</a>, which also found that some carmakers, such as General Motors, actually had lower average fuel economy and higher average carbon emissions in 2022 than in 2017. To its credit, the EPA recently announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html">revisions</a> to its vehicle GHG rules that would narrow (but not close) the gaps between standards for large and small cars.</p>
<p id="UWQqBt">But the shift toward <a href="https://www.vox.com/electric-vehicles" data-source="encore">electric vehicles</a> may further entrench car bloat. The EPA’s rules assume that all EVs, regardless of their design, generate no emissions — a questionable assumption, because EVs create emissions indirectly through the production and transmission of power that flows into their <a href="https://www.vox.com/batteries" data-source="encore">batteries</a>. A huge or inefficient battery requires more electricity, which can lead to significant pollution (especially in regions where <a href="https://www.vox.com/fossil-fuels" data-source="encore">fossil fuels</a> dominate the energy mix). </p>
<p id="VLqKd6">The EPA’s policy of treating all EVs equally makes a monstrously wasteful vehicle <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90790197/yes-to-electric-cars-but-not-the-hummer-ev">like the Hummer EV</a> seem cleaner than it is, encouraging carmakers to manufacture more of them. </p>
<p id="hbwZCy">To counteract EV bloat, Peter Huether, a senior research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, would like to see the EPA revise its GHG rules to consider emissions from power generation and transmission: “If these standards look at upstream emissions, it could have a downstream effect on shape and size of EVs.” </p>
<h3 id="tpqxH3">Blocking smaller cars from abroad</h3>
<p id="LtlL12">What does a 60-year-old trade dispute have to do with car bloat? More than you might imagine.</p>
<p id="tKiFnM">In the early 1960s, Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/10/archives/the-chicken-war-a-battle-guide.html">raised the ire</a> of American officials by slapping a 50 percent tariff on chicken exported from the United States. In retaliation, the US enacted a 25 percent tax on pickup trucks imported from abroad. The dispute is long forgotten, but the “Chicken Tax” lives on.</p>
<p id="LW144y">Although the tariff was initially aimed at Germany’s immense auto industry (<a href="https://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2009/05/the-chickens-have-come-home-to-roost.html">Volkswagen in particular</a>), it also applies to pickups imported from newer automaking powers such as Japan and South Korea, where carmakers are often adept at building vehicles much smaller than those available to Americans. </p>
<p id="SeqRZ5">Toyota’s <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/toyota-hilux-double-cab-2020.html#aeng_toyota-hilux-double-cab-2020-24l-d-4d-6mt-150-hp">Hilux Double Cab pickup</a>, for instance, weighs several hundred pounds less than a 2024 <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/f-150">Ford F-150 Tremor or Lariat</a> and is about half a foot shorter. But Americans who might want it are out of luck. Toyota does not sell the Hilux in the US (but does in countries like <a href="https://www.toyotabharat.com/showroom/hilux/">India</a> and <a href="https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/hilux">Britain</a>); the 25 percent tariff would make it prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p id="GJgd8v">“The Chicken Tax has prevented competitive Asian or European truck makers from entering the US market,” said Jason Torchinsky, a co-founder of the Autopian, a media outlet focused on the auto industry. “American manufacturers have really never had to compete.” John Krafcik, who previously led Hyundai, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/06/19/415671756/how-a-tax-on-chicken-changed-the-playing-field-for-u-s-automakers">has called</a> the Chicken Tax “one of the most important determinants of how the [auto] industry looks today and how it operates today in the US.” </p>
<p id="VXeqPf">The tariff has been condemned by everyone from the Libertarian <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/hidden-costs-tariffs#:~:text=In%20retaliation%2C%20President%20Lyndon%20B,tax%20on%20light%20trucks%20remains.">Cato Institute</a>, the center-right <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-anti-consumer-25-chicken-tax-on-imported-trucks-has-insulated-the-big-3-from-foreign-competition-for-50-years/">American Enterprise Institute</a>, and the left-leaning <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/does-chicken-tax-encourage-people-purchase-larger-trucks">Tax Policy Center</a>. “Tariffs in general hurt consumers, and the Chicken Tax is no exception,” wrote Robert McClelland of the Tax Policy Center.</p>
<p id="xcYkLf">There are other protectionist rules blocking smaller vehicles from abroad: Carmakers from China, an emerging automaking behemoth, face a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-want-biden-hike-tariffs-chinese-made-vehicles-2023-11-08/">25 percent tariff</a> enacted by Donald Trump. As a result, Americans <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">cannot buy small Chinese EV sedans</a> like the BYD Seagull that cost around $10,000, <a href="https://www.livenowfox.com/news/average-price-for-new-car-used-falling-us-2024">barely a fifth</a> the price of an average American car. </p>

<p id="Pk5DuO">And those hoping to import a kei truck, a miniature pickup common in Japan, must navigate a labyrinth of <a href="https://keitruckconnect.com/how-to-import-a-kei-truck-into-the-usa/#:~:text=If%20you're%20looking%20to,year%20exemption%20rule%20for%20importation.">federal</a> and <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/travel/miniature-japanese-imports-owners-hire-laywer-legislature-fails/85-f707d2b4-d82a-4c35-8535-f5130b2ae7a2">state</a> rules. (Even Afghanistan seems ahead of the US in minitruck offerings, as the Wichita Eagle’s Dion Lefler noted in a <a href="https://www.kansas.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dion-lefler/article274837471.html">tongue-in-cheek 2023 </a>column: “In the land of the free, why can’t we have mini-pickup trucks like the Taliban?”)</p>
<p id="LEZdYh">These policies have established a regulatory moat protecting US automakers whose profits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/suv-sales-best-sellers.html">disproportionately come from pricey, hulking SUVs and trucks</a>. </p>
<h3 id="suXAIE">The Hummer Tax Loophole</h3>
<p id="7ciqVw"><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/public-laws-and-legislative-history/deficit-reduction-act-of-1984-p.l-98-369-div-a/dsyf">In 1984</a>, Congress stopped allowing small business owners to take a tax deduction for the purchase price of cars used for work. But the bill included a giant loophole: To protect those who need a heavy-duty vehicle (think farmers or construction workers), Congress made an exception, known as Section 179, for cars that weigh over 6,000 pounds when fully loaded with passengers and cargo. Today such behemoths are eligible for a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946#:~:text=Section%20179%20deduction%20dollar%20limits.,-For%20tax%20years&amp;text=deduction%20is%20%241%2C220%2C000.-,This%20limit%20is%20reduced%20by%20the%20amount%20by%20which%20the,beginning%20in%202024%20is%20%2430%2C500.">tax deduction of up to $30,500</a>, while business owners who opt for a smaller car can claim nothing at all.</p>
<p id="a4drJE">Few car models were heavy enough to qualify for the tax break 40 years ago, but that is no longer the case: A<a href="https://www.hummer1.com/specs"> Hummer 1, for instance,</a> weighs about 10,300 pounds (leading Section 179 to be dubbed the “<a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5476-section-179.html">Hummer Tax Loophole</a>”). Other huge cars, such as a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/suburban-2024/specs">Chevrolet Suburban</a> or an <a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/super-duty/models/f250-xlt/">F-250 Ford Super Duty truck</a> can qualify, too. </p>
<p id="gWou5F">“Few folks at EPA know about Section 179,” said Becker, the former Sierra Club executive. “But every auto dealer does.” Some car dealerships even offer <a href="https://www.kengrodyfordsandiego.com/ford-section-179-tax-deduction-san-diego-ca-dtw/">handy Section 179 guides</a> on their websites. The tax advantage of buying a behemoth may be powerful enough to tilt the vehicle purchase decisions of individuals like <a href="https://corofy.com/can-real-estate-agents-take-section-179-deductions-for-specialized-equipment-vehicles/#:~:text=Section%20179%20deduction.-,This%20deduction%20allows%20real%20estate%20agents%20to%20deduct%20the%20full,to%20succeed%20in%20their%20industry.">real estate agents</a>, who use their vehicles for both professional and personal use. And as cars electrify, the added tonnage from batteries will allow more models to qualify for favorable tax treatment.</p>
<p id="6JYKqq">If Section 179 sounds crazy, consider another federal loophole that has endured for decades. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/gas-guzzler-tax">In 1978</a>, Congress established the “Gas Guzzler Tax,” requiring automakers to pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/gas-guzzler-tax/">between $1,000 and $7,700</a> for every car produced that gets less than 22.5 miles per gallon. But the tax only applies to passenger vehicles like sedans and station wagons. SUVs and pickups, which often have much worse gas mileage, are exempt. That omission makes no sense from a policy perspective, but it is good news for carmakers producing inefficient behemoths.</p>
<h3 id="A1jVfR">Freezing the gas tax</h3>
<p id="avZwl2">Every time a car owner fills her gas tank, a portion of the bill goes into the federal <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-highway-trust-fund-and-how-it-financed">Highway Trust Fund</a>, a central source of funding for roads and <a href="https://www.vox.com/transportation" data-source="encore">mass transit</a>. That tax rate is set at $0.184 per gallon, a level that has <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm#:~:text=The%20Omnibus%20Budget%20Reconciliation%20Act,to%20the%20Highway%20Trust%20Fund.">been frozen since 1993</a>, when Bill Clinton was less than a year into his presidency. Congressional proposals to increase the gas tax to close a <a href="https://enotrans.org/article/running-on-empty-the-highway-trust-fund/">yawning highway budget gap</a>, or at least tie it to inflation, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/11/infrastructure-bill-gas-tax-faq/">gone nowhere</a>. </p>
<p id="97MZwn">Over the last 31 years, consumer prices have risen <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">113 percent</a>, making the real value of the gas tax less than half what it was in 1993. That decline has reduced the cost of powering a huge SUV or truck with abysmal gas mileage, like the 6,270-lb 2024 Cadillac Escalade that gets around <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/cadillac/escalade-escalade-esv">16 mpg</a>.</p>
<p id="dckPbz">A <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/oecd-gas-tax/">2018 OECD study</a> found that the US had the lowest average gas tax (including both federal and state taxes) among rich nations, which averaged $2.24 per gallon — four times the typical US rate. “Why are European cars so small?” said McClelland, of the Tax Policy Center. “One reason has got to be the much higher gasoline tax.” </p>
<h3 id="zd7OaT">Federal policy ignores crash risk for anyone outside a car</h3>
<p id="Wk5ERo">A vehicle’s design affects not just the safety of its occupants, but also people walking, biking, or inside other cars. Although seemingly obvious, this basic truth has eluded federal regulators for decades.</p>
<p id="O9UiWt">Car safety rules are laid out in the encyclopedic Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), which touches on everything from power windows to seat belts. But the FMVSS revolves around protecting a vehicle’s occupants; nothing within its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Federal-Standards-Regulations-Amendments-Interpretations/dp/1379016444" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Federal-Standards-Regulations-Amendments-Interpretations/dp/1379016444?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">562 pages</a> limits a car’s physical design to protect someone who might come into contact with it in a collision. That omission invites <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">an arms race of vehicle size</a> — precisely what the US is experiencing.</p>
<p id="CNPeic">Nor does the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) consider pedestrians, cyclists, or other car occupants when calculating its safety ratings from crash tests. Unlike safety ratings in Europe and elsewhere, the American crash ratings program also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-18/fix-the-crash-test-dummies">ignores</a> the danger that vehicle designs pose to those walking and biking.</p>
<p id="knrFhp">NHTSA’s myopic focus on car occupants is a boon for the heaviest and tallest cars, which pose disproportionate risk to those outside of them. Weightier vehicles exert more force in a crash, and they require additional time to come to a halt when a driver slams on the brakes. A <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians">2023 study</a> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that vehicles with tall, flat front ends (common on big pickups and SUVs) are significantly more likely to kill pedestrians in crashes. <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/suvs-other-large-vehicles-often-hit-pedestrians-while-turning#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20possible%20that%20the%20size,Senior%20Transportation%20Engineer%20Wen%20Hu.">An earlier IIHS study</a> found that large cars also make it harder to see pedestrians at intersections.</p>

<p id="OnQvlU">With pedestrian and cyclist deaths <a href="https://www.vox.com/23784549/pedestrian-deaths-traffic-safety-fatalities-governors-association">now soaring</a>, NHTSA last year took its first, tentative step toward protecting so-called vulnerable road users by proposing that <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-proposes-new-crashworthiness-pedestrian-protection-testing-program">its vehicle safety ratings be revised</a> to include an evaluation of automatic pedestrian braking technology, which can force a vehicle to halt before striking someone on foot. But even if adopted, it would not affect NCAP’s 5-star safety rating, the hallmark of the program.  </p>
<p id="pWciBT">And NHTSA’s focus on automatic pedestrian braking, an imperfect tech fix, ignores car bloat, a root cause of America’s traffic safety crisis. Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377261425_Unreliable_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Driver_Alerting_in_Intelligent_Vehicles">paper</a> co-authored by former NHTSA executive Missy Cummings gave an ominous <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377261425_Unreliable_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Driver_Alerting_in_Intelligent_Vehicles">assessment</a> of automatic braking systems, concluding that they did not work consistently. By contrast, the potential safety benefits of constraining vehicles’ <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/808569">weight</a> and <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians#:~:text=Vehicles%20with%20hoods%20more%20than,of%2030%20inches%20or%20less.">height</a> have been well established.</p>
<h3 id="IfGpBy">Why can’t we fix things?</h3>
<p id="AmGQZ4">All of these policies have distorted the US car market, leading the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics/#:~:text=Sources-,National%20Car%20Ownership%20Statistics%20at%20a%20Glance,in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202022.">278 million vehicles</a> plying American roads to become ever bigger, more dangerous, and more destructive. So why have they remained on the books after the growing societal costs of car bloat became impossible to miss?</p>
<p id="rOzXDp">To find an answer, consider who benefits from oversized vehicles. American carmakers like Ford and GM (which are headquartered in Michigan, a crucial swing state) rely on juicy margins from big SUVs and pickups, which are more expensive and <a href="https://www.ttnews.com/articles/plunging-pickup-truck-sales">profitable</a> than smaller models. They enjoy protection from foreign competition through tariffs like the Chicken Tax, as well as favorable policies like CAFE’s light-truck loophole. </p>
<p id="wTy7jU">The regulatory status quo suits domestic automakers just fine — and they act as a roadblock to even modest attempts to change it. In 2022, for example, the largest auto industry association <a href="https://x.com/DavidZipper/status/1532427288792518657?s=20">lobbied</a> District of Columbia council members against a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">proposal</a> to charge owners of the most egregiously oversized cars $500 per year, seven times more than a light sedan (the District adopted the policy anyway).</p>

<p id="6UhWi8">As American sales of big SUVs and trucks have surged, their owners are likely to resist policy moves they see as penalizing them. Many are likely to be unaware of the federal loopholes and policy oversights that have distorted their vehicle choices.</p>
<p id="92QZ6I">The negative externalities of supersized cars — in emissions, crash deaths, and the erosion of tires and pavement — are what economists call a market failure, since their costs are borne by society writ large, not the people who buy big pickups and SUVs. Left unaddressed, those societal costs will grow as more people replace their modest-sized cars with big SUVs or trucks. After all, everyone else seems to be doing it — why not do the same, if only for self-preservation?</p>
<p id="vNu1jQ">Regulation can end such a cycle toward enormity. Countries including <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201015-government-u-turn-as-france-slaps-weight-tax-on-heavy-cars-suvs-climate-pollution">France</a> and <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/norway-became-an-ev-paradise-now-it-s-imposing-a-weight-tax-and-bringing-back-the-vat-200685.html#:~:text=EV%20owners%20will%20also%20have,powered%20cars%20(including%20hybrids)">Norway</a> have enacted weight-based taxes to counteract car bloat’s collective costs and avoid giving huge vehicles implicit subsidies. But American policymakers have done the exact opposite, and they rarely even acknowledge the problem. Asked explicitly about ways that the Department of Transportation could address car bloat, Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90841997/this-is-a-preventable-crisis-pete-buttigieg-on-spending-800-million-to-eliminate-traffic-deaths">ducked</a>, calling merely for “further research.”</p>
<p id="Adhh7h">With the feds refusing to lead, it has fallen on state and local leaders to try and address car bloat themselves. <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2023/09/29/colorado-pedestrian-safety-suv-truck-owners/">Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/california-charge-owning-trucks-suvs-17771795.php">California</a>, for instance, have proposed weight-based vehicle registration fees, following the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">District of Columbia</a>’s lead. But such moves are an imperfect solution to a national problem (vehicles can, after all, be driven across state lines). A true policy fix will require action from Congress, NHTSA, and the EPA.  </p>
<p id="bgFcNL">It need not begin with new regulations or taxes. Federal leaders could do a world of good if they simply unwind the ill-advised policies already on the books.</p>

<h2>Workplace surveillance is coming for you (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/21/great-taylors-ghost/#solidarity-or-bust">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>If you want to do something terrible with technology, you can't just roll it out on people with money and social capital. They'll complain and your idea will tank. Successful shitty tech rollouts start with people you can abuse with impunity (prisoners, kids, migrants, etc) and then work their way up the privilege gradient. I call it the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve.</p>
<p>The point of the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve is to normalize technological oppression, one group at a time. 20 years ago, if you were eating your dinner under the unblinking eye of a video-camera, it was because you were in a supermax prison. Now, thanks to "luxury surveillance," you can get the same experience in your middle-class home with your Google, Apple or Amazon "smart" camera. Those cameras climbed the curve, going from prisons to schools to workplaces to homes.</p>
<p>The pandemic was a great accelerant for late-stage capitalism, converting our homes to rent-free annexes of our employers' facilities, and turning "work from home" into "live at work." Bossware, a fringe technological category, experienced a massive boom, rocketing up the privilege gradient.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware</a></p>
<p>For most of its history, bossware was used to police the most marginalized, oppressed workers, like the mostly Black, mostly female workforce at Arise, a company that charges workers for their own training and then fines them if they quit.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless</a></p>
<p>But when lockdown turned high-status white collar workers into home-workers, their bosses rolled out incredibly invasive spyware, including tools that watched them through their cameras, listened to their microphones, logged their keystrokes, scoured their hard-drives and read their text messages.</p>
<p>This was the second coming of Taylorism, AKA "scientific management," an early 20th Century pseudoscience practiced by high-priced, unaccountable consultants who would fan out on factory floors in literal science cosplay, including lab-coats and clipboards, and loom over workers, watching their every movement, often going so far as to film them.</p>
<p>Then the consultants would go back to their workplace, soup the negatives, and produce completely arbitrary workplace rules about how workers must stand, hold their limbs and heads, and move – it was a kind of corporate anti-yoga whose asanas were designed to make workers <em>look</em> productive to their bosses, who often had no idea how to perform or evaluate their jobs.</p>
<p>The pandemic's new Taylorists do not confine themselves to the factory floor. Thanks to digital tools, they can come right into your home, and they can take high-frequency measurements of unimportant things in great detail, and then produce scores that your boss can use to decide whether and how much to pay you.</p>
<p>Bossware is the subject of an <em>excellent</em> <em>New York Times</em> feature by Jodi Kantor, Arya Sundaram, Aliza Aufrichtig and Rumsey Taylor, which documents the ways that "Worker Productivity Scores" undermine the workers' ability to perform their jobs, while also allowing their bosses to steal their wages:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html</a></p>
<p>Their case-studies are a trip up the Shitty Tech Adoption Curve, and includes $200/hour finance exec Carol Kraemer, who discovered that her boss was tracking her time in 10-minute increments and docking her pay for stretches where she took her fingers off her keyboard – to think, say, or make notes with pen and paper.</p>
<p>Kraemer discovered that the only way to avoid wage-theft was to do "mindless busywork" that produced the clicks that her bossware demanded, even if it got in the way of her work. This is yet more proof that "you treasure what you measure," or, more formally, "any measurement becomes a target" (AKA Goodhart's Law).</p>
<p>The decline of worker productivity in pursuit of metrics is an inescapable failure mode of bossware. In 2020, I reported on a reader's experience working in an engineering shop where her boss evaluated her performance based on the number of trouble-tickets she closed, turning her into "a ticket-closing machine."</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism</a></p>
<p>Being an engineer, this worker applied herself to the problem in a methodical fashion, and realized that she could juke her stats by closing tickets prematurely by marking them "did not respond" – and also that she could close and re-open the same tickets over and over, racking up points.</p>
<p>She closed by saying, "Your execs should fucking well know this: how would THEY like to be evaluated based on, like, how many emails they send in a day? Do they believe that would be good for the business? Or would they object that they are tasked with the holistic success of the org, and that their roles are too complex to reduce to a set of metrics without context?"</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that bossware is now coming for execs, and, what's more, they lack the engineering skills to optimize their work so they can get a high score <em>and</em> do the job, so they have to settle for just getting the score – and hang the job itself.</p>
<p>In the <em>NYT</em> story, the authors profile a wide range of people who are deliberately doing a worse job in order to get higher scores, including a group of hospice chaplains who are given points based on their work with dying patients and their families, scored in a way that is utterly disconnected from providing compassionate care.</p>
<p>Activities are scored based on their priority to management, without regard to the comfort they provide: 0.25 points for a phone call with a grieving relation; one point for a visit with a dying patient, 1.75 points for presiding over a funeral.</p>
<p>Chaplains' ability to accumulate points was undermined by patients – who would take longer than anticipated to draw their final breaths, or break down in tears, or cancel appointments as they made their peace with their impending deaths. To maintain their wages, chaplains resorted to "spirtual care drive-bys" – like sticking their head in a room where a patient was unconscious, exchanging a brief word with a nurse, and marking it down as a "patient visit."</p>
<p>Healthcare offers a fascinating window into the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve, as doctors' and nurses' work has been transformed by the electronic health record and its relationship to billing – so that now these high-paid, high-demand, high-skill professionals have to organize their work around data-entry on a system designed without their input and without regard to their priorities.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> reporters dig into the social workers, therapists and addiction counselors at Unitedhealth, a private-equity-backed healthcare monopoly. They get marked as "idle" if they stop typing to talk with their patients. If those conversations go on too long, they are marked as "derelict" and risk employment sanctions.</p>
<p>Social workers with masters' degrees are compensated based on the number of keystrokes they generate on the job. For Unitedhealth admin workers who work from home, glitches in the system can imperil their jobs, for example, if the system hangs when you log out for the day, it can mark you as "idle" all night, killing your average score. Workers facing these problems are advised by their managers to jiggle their mouses periodically to keep the division's score from falling.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting part of the <em>Times</em> feature is the work it does profiling the pseudoscientists who created and marketed this junk software. There's Federico Mazzoli, co-creator of Worksmart, who explained the benefits of his product: "Once you see those metrics, those insights, something changes: You realize how much you waste doing nothing, or just multitasking and not accomplishing stuff."</p>
<p>Mazzoli seems to have either not used his product, or, if he did, did so under conditions where <em>he</em> was in charge of it – using it the way an athlete might use a stopwatch to time their own sprints, and not the way a boss might: to decide whether to dock your pay or fire you.</p>
<p>This inability to understand the difference between <em>using</em> a technology and having the same technology <em>used against you</em> is endemic to the industry. Take Crossover, which bills itself as "the Fitbit of productivity," but whose customers rhapsodize about the product giving them "powers of near X-ray vision." The point of a Fitbit is to help <em>you</em> improve something that matters to you – but Crossover's customers want to use it to <em>punish other people</em> for failing to follow orders. It's the difference between a Fitbit and a prisoner-tracking cuff – which make crossover "the ankle-braclet of productivity."</p>
<p>Ironically, the <em>Times</em> reports that Crossover's own employees so resented the company's intrusive monitoring of them (as they created and sold intrusive monitoring tools) that Crossover hemorrhaged employees and struggled to hire replacements. Eventually, Crossover had to turn off its most intrusive features so that it could keep the employees needed to make and sell its bossware product.</p>
<p>One major focus of "productivity trackers" is measuring bathroom breaks and punishing workers for pissing. Piss-tracking tools are another shitty technology that has been racing up the privilege gradient, making the leap to white-collar workers after being imposed on blue-collar workers, like the Amazon warehouse workers and drivers who have to piss in bottles to satisfy their bossware:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex">https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex</a></p>
<p>The next step on the gradient was students – children have slightly more privilege than nonunion blue-collar workers, it seems – with 1,000+ US schoools handing public money to E-hallpass, a company that tracks children's urination:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom">https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom</a></p>
<p>As the metaphor of corporate personhood has become more and more concrete (for example, through the Supreme Court's <em>Citizen's United</em> decision, which ruled that limits on corporate political spending violated their corporate persons' free speech rights) many have pondered the question, "What sort of person is a corporation?"</p>
<p>The 2003 documentary "The Corporation" investigated this, declaring the if corporations are people, they are psychopaths – remorseless and totally lacking in empathy. Science fiction writers have claimed that corporations are "slow AIs" (Charlie Stross), or Skynet (Ted Chiang) or immortal colony organisms that use humans as gut flora (me):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card</a></p>
<p>But the rise and rise of bossware implies another personality archetype for the corporation: the abusive alcoholic dad, whose own life is spinning out of control and who finds comfort by seeking to control the lives of others in humiliating ways that ultimately leads to his own destruction.</p>
<p>Because bossware doesn't just radically reduce productivity by shifting the point of work from getting the job done to getting the boxes ticked – it also exposes the businesses who use it to existential risks. Take Office 365, the cloud-based word processing/spreadsheet/email system from convicted monopolist Microsoft.</p>
<p>Office 365 went from being an online version of Microsoft Office to being a bossware delivery-system. The Office 365 sales-pitch focuses on fine-grained employee tracking and comparison, so bosses can rank their workers' performance against each other. But beyond this automated gladiatorial keystroke combat, Offce 365's analytics will tell you how your company performs against <em>other companies.</em></p>
<p>That's right – Microsoft will spy on your competitors and sell you access to their metrics. It's wild, but purchasing managers who hear this pitch seem completely oblivious to the implication of this: that Microsoft will also spy on <em>you</em> and deliver your metrics to your competitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge</a></p>
<p>Even wilder is the further implication: that Microsoft might use the data its product gathers on your business – every keystroke made by every worker in the entire company! – to <em>compete</em> with <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>A century ago, "scientific management experts" tricked bosses out of fat consulting fees by promising to turn managers' preference for "a smartly turned out workforce" into a scientific best-practice. This is pure empiricism-washing, where an irrational bias is encoded in mathematics and declared to be scientific truth.</p>
<p>Bossware companies target employers' insecurity about their workers' power to actually undermine the employers' businesses, transforming productive workers into efficient metric-satisfiers, while raiding the company for valuable market-intelligence.</p>
<p>The bossware problem is a <em>boss</em> problem, in other words. It follows that fixing the bossware problem is the <em>workers'</em> job, and indeed, the <em>Times</em> feature notes that Amazon has been dismantling its bossware surveillance in a bid to reduce its workers' support for unionization, which promises to ban bossware from Amazon workplaces.</p>
<p>Bosses deride unions as reducing "freedom" – but just the <em>threat</em> of unions delivers more freedom to workers than any right-to-work law ever could. Bossware-infected jobsites are Stalinist dystopias, where workers are punished for <em>looking in the wrong direction</em> or failing to hit the keys fast enough, irrespective of whether they're getting the job done.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, I wrote about this in "Affordances," a short story for Slate Future Tense, which set out to explore how the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve may start with the most downtrodden and immiserated among us – but how, left unchecked, it will come for each and every one of us:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Williams-Sonoma could be paying a hefty fine for claiming a small chunk of its products were "Made in USA" when they weren't.</p><p>In a federal court filing on Monday, the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to sign an order that would fine the luxury home goods company $3.18 million for violating a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/07/ftc-approves-final-order-settling-charges-williams-sonoma-inc-made-overly-broad-misleading-made-usa" data-cms-ai="0">2020 order</a> regarding the same false label claims. Williams-Sonoma settled those charges and was required to pay $1 million to the FTC, and the following year, it submitted a report describing how it had complied with every provision in the order.</p><p>However, the FTC's new claims state the company has violated the order with multiple deceptive U.S.-origin claims in the years since — including on three products in July 2021, when it filed the compliance order.</p><p>One such claim, which the FTC says Williams-Sonoma made between April 2022 and August 2023, involved certain PBTeen mattress pads that were advertised as "crafted in America from domestic and imported materials." The federal body said in numerous instances, those products were actually "wholly imported" from China.</p><p>The FTC said this finding led them to discover six other products on the retailer's websites that were advertised as American-made despite either containing foreign components or being processed internationally. It states Williams-Sonoma couldn't demonstrate the validity of its own claims, and the retailer admitted to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/williams-sonoma-is-fined-by-us-ftc-over-made-usa-claims-2024-04-23/" data-cms-ai="0">Reuters</a> that the allegations made in the complaint were true.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma ranked No. 1,469 on Forbes' largest companies in the world list last year. With brands under its own moniker, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more, the company raked in nearly $8.7 billion in sales last year.</p><p>It's interesting to question, however, if U.S.-made labels have at all contributed to the company's success.</p><p>One survey last year found two-thirds of its 1,000 respondents said they regularly sought out "Made in America" products, and 50% said they'd be willing to pay more for them. Another survey from the <a href="https://reshoringinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/made-in-usa-survey.pdf" data-cms-ai="0">Reshoring Institute</a>in 2020 found over 69% of respondents preferred American-made products, and more than 80% were willing to pay 10% to 20% more for them.</p></div><p>Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc.
