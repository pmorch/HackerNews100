<p>The Donald Trump administration has cut off vital support for F-16 jamming capabilities.</p>

<p>The United States, having decided to end its support for Ukraine, cannot simply turn off the Ukrainian Air Force’s U.S.-designed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unian.net/world/f-16-dlya-ukrainy-aviaekspert-nazval-veroyatnuyu-prichinu-zaderzhki-postavki-belgiyskih-istrebiteley-12937956.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F-16</a>&nbsp;fighters . But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/03/07/france-to-the-rescue-french-made-mirage-2000-jets-could-become-ukraines-most-important-aerial-radar-jammers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">However, as Forbes</a>&nbsp;analyst David Ax writes&nbsp;, the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.</p>



<p>As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.</p>



<p>But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.</p>



<p>However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.</p>



<p>The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.</p>



<p>“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.</p>



<p>Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.</p>



<p>In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://newatlas.com/biology/stem-cell-therapy-reverses-irreversible-damage-cornea/">https://newatlas.com/biology/stem-cell-therapy-reverses-irreversible-damage-cornea/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43306734">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eye injuries that damage the cornea are usually irreversible and cause blindness. But a new clinical trial has repaired this damage in patients thanks to a transplant of stem cells from their healthy eyes.</p><p>The cornea is the outer layer of the eye, which focuses light towards the retina. Since it’s on the frontline of potential hazards from the outside world, the cornea features a population of limbal epithelial stem cells, which repair minor damage to keep the surface smooth and functional.</p><p>Unfortunately, injuries like thermal or chemical burns can damage the cornea beyond the capability of these resident stem cells. There’s not much else that can be done – even a <a href="https://newatlas.com/human-corneas-3d-printed/54837/" data-cms-ai="0">cornea transplant</a> won’t take hold if the damage is too severe.</p><p>The new study, conducted by scientists at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, investigated a new treatment called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells (CALEC). This involves removing stem cells from a patient’s uninjured eye, growing their population in the lab for a few weeks, then surgically transplanting them into the injured eye.</p><p>The phase 1/2 trial recruited 14 patients to undergo the procedure, and followed them for 18 months afterwards. Success was primarily judged by how effectively the treatment repaired the cornea’s surface, while a secondary test analyzed improvements to visual acuity.</p><p>By the first checkup at three months, the corneas of seven (50%) of the participants had been completely restored. By the 12-month mark, that number had increased to 11 (79%) patients. Two other participants met the definition for partial success, so the team claims an overall success rate of 92% for CALEC.</p><p>It’s worth noting that three participants did require a second transplant of stem cells, with one of them going on to reach the mark of complete success by the end of the study. In tests of visual acuity in the damaged eye, the majority of patients regained some sight, with some advancing from legally blind to low vision.</p><p>No serious adverse effects that were attributed to the procedure were seen in the patients, in either the donor or recipient eyes. The researchers say that this success paves the way for further trials with larger cohorts and longer follow-ups, before CALEC is submitted for FDA approval.</p><p>The research was published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56461-1" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><i>Nature Communications</i></a>.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/calec-stem-cell-therapy-clinical-trial-repairs-corneal-damage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Massachusetts General Brigham</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>The internet <em>loves</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">theanine</a>. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.</p>

<p><em>Many</em> people try theanine and report <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/15kpfl9/ltheanine_wow/"><em>wow</em></a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ekbrgl/anyone_have_good_experiences_with_ltheanine/lgke7ys/"><em>great for ADHD</em></a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/o7smk5/l_theanine_cured_my_social_anxiety_im_blown_away/"><em>cured my (social) anxiety</em></a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ethltn/ltheanine_is_changing_my_life/"><em>changing my life</em></a>. And it’s not just the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nootropics/">placebo enthusiast</a> community. This <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41765607">hacker news thread</a> is full of positive reports, and <a href="https://gwern.net/nootropic/nootropics#defaults">gwern</a> uses it regularly.</p>

<p>But does it really work?</p>

<p>Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)">glutamate</a> (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine#In_vitro">complicated</a> effects on glutamate receptors.</p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of supplements that <em>could</em> act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier">thin layer of cells</a> that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1271/bbb.63.615"><em>can</em></a> get through these cells and into the brain.</p>

<p>So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on <a href="https://dynomight.net/aspartame/#the-european-food-safety-authority-efsa">these kinds of issues</a>, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2238">assessment</a> in 2011 and found:</p>

<p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/theanine/">Examine</a> is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found <em>low quality evidence</em> for <em>near zero effect</em>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-00771-5">2020 review</a> of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine <em>might</em> help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam">alprazolam</a> (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s <em>impossible</em>, and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.</p>

<p>After 2020, the only major trial I could find was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2020.4803">this 2021 study</a> that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-did-this">Why I did this</h2>

<p>I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I <em>do</em> find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)</p>

<p>Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?</p>

<p>Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.</p>

<p>Everyone agrees theanine is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/182086/download">safe</a>. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t <em>disproven</em> one either. Given the vast <em>anecdotal</em> evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>

<p>First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?</p>

<p>So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.</li>
  <li>Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.</li>
  <li>Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.</li>
  <li>Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.</li>
  <li>Both capsules are almost but not <em>quite</em> the same color.</li>
  <li>Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.</li>
  <li>The capsules themselves aren’t made from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin">skin and bones and connective tissues of dead animals</a> (personal preference).</li>
</ol>

<p>After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules:</p>

<p><strong>Capsule A:</strong> 200 mg L-Theanine</p>

<p><strong>Capsule B:</strong> 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin D</p>

<p>These are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and <em>very</em> close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are <em>slightly</em> more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re <em>acute</em>, that you’d feel them within an hour.</p>

<p>For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.</p>

<p>Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.</p>

<p>Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.</p>

<p>Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/capsules.jpg" alt="capsules"></p>

<p>This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.</p>

<p>For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.112.166371">enough</a> to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.</p>

<p>After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had <em>too</em> much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-results">What are the results?</h2>

<p>Bad.</p>

<p>Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Alternatively, here’s the <em>difference</em> in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/diff.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/diff.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress_beforeafter.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/stress_beforeafter.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/probs.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/theanine/probs.svg" alt=""></a></p>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>

<p>Ooof.</p>

<p>My stress level <em>did</em> usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was <em>terrible</em> at guessing what I’d taken.</p>

<p>Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.</p>

<p>So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.</li>
  <li>Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.</li>
  <li>Theanine works, but I was unlucky.</li>
  <li>Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.</li>
  <li>Theanine works on some people, but not me.</li>
  <li>Theanine doesn’t work.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I <em>really</em> tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect <em>any</em> sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that <em>this</em> time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>So, cards on the table, here are my <a href="https://dynomight.net/bayes/">made-up probabilities</a> for each of the possible explanations:</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <th>Explanation</th>
      <th>belief</th>

    <tr>

      <td>1%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Doesn’t work</td>
      <td>55%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other <em>good</em> self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by <a href="https://niplav.site/nootropics#LTheanine">Niplav</a>, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.</p>

<p>What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:</p>

<p>Stimulants work! But for everything else…</p>

<p>I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.</p>

<p>I’ve seen <em>many</em> other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I liked to them. People often mention that <em>hypothetically</em> this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.</p>

<p>So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.</p>

<p>I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-ok-fine-lets-argue-about-statistics">Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statistics</h2>

<p>Do you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?</p>

<p>I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a <em>little</em> statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a <em>lot</em> of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.</p>

<p>If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.</p>

<p>While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t <em>independent</em> or <em>identically distributed</em>. If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.</p>

<p>But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:</p>

<p>Stress went down, p &lt; .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:</p>

<p>Stress <em>also</em> went down.</p>

</table>

<p>Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly <em>higher</em> with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly <em>higher</em> probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.</p>

<p>Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>Building an open-source Wi-Fi MAC layer for the ESP32</h2><p>The ESP32 is a low-cost microcontroller with Wi-Fi connectivity.
Currently, the Wi-Fi MAC layer of the ESP32 is closed-source.
This project aims to change that: by reverse engineering the hardware registers and software, we can build a networking stack that is open-source up to the hardware, instead of having to use the proprietary MAC layer.</p><p>This will improve security auditability, open up the possibility for features not supported in the proprietary implementation (for example, standards-compliant mesh networking), improve interoperability and make research into Wi-Fi networks with lots of nodes more affordable.</p><p>The source code is under <a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/">the esp32-open-mac organisation on GitHub</a>.
There are currently two implementations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/esp32-open-mac">esp32-open-mac</a> (we know it's confusing that one reference implementation has the same name as the overarching project, but bear with us)
This is a reference implementation that demonstrates how the hardware works, written in C and Rust: the hardware abstraction and initialization is written in C; the MAC stack (parsing packets and deciding which packets to send when) is written in Rust.
This relies on two FreeRTOS tasks; one to handle the hardware, one to handle the MAC stack.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/FoA">Ferris-on-Air (FoA)</a>: this is a reference implementation in pure async Rust. It builds on Embassy and the patches in the esp-hal we submitted to add support for the Wi-Fi peripheral.</li></ul><p>If you want to help out with developing or want to contact us, feel free to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#esp32-open-mac:matrix.org">the Matrix room</a></p></div><section><ul><li><span>March 7, 2025</span>

<p dir="auto">Deploying side-projects doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Kubernetes, Platform as a Service (PaaS) and CI/CD pipelines are a powerful and exciting solutions, but sometimes they're more complex than your project requires. If you enjoy managing your server, it can be significantly cheaper and offer greater control over the technical details.</p>
<p dir="auto">I want to automate this process and deploy easily to my own server. That's why I've created <strong>Airo</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li>🐳 <strong>Build and push Docker images directly from your local machine to a container registry</strong>.</li>
<li>⚡️ <strong>Deploy instantly</strong> with a single command from your computer.</li>
<li>🔑 <strong>Easily update configurations and containers securely</strong> using SSH.</li>

<p><strong>MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong> is a new open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
<p>Think of MCP like a USB-C port but for AI agents: it offers a uniform method for connecting AI systems to various tools and data sources.</p>
<p>This post breaks down MCP, clearly explaining its value, architecture, and how it differs from traditional APIs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-mcp">What is MCP?<a href="#what-is-mcp" aria-label="Direct link to What is MCP?" title="Direct link to What is MCP?">​</a></h2>
<p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that connects AI agents to various external tools and data sources. Imagine it as a USB-C port - but for AI applications.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="What is MCP?" src="https://norahsakal.com/assets/images/mcp_overview-641a298352ff835488af36be3d8eee52.png" title="What is MCP?" width="1920" height="1080"></p>
<p>The <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> is a standardized protocol that connects AI agents to various external tools and data sources</p>
<p>Just as USB-C simplifies how you connect different devices to your computer, MCP simplifies how AI models interact with your data, tools, and services.</p>

<p>Traditionally, connecting an AI system to external tools involves integrating multiple APIs. Each API integration means separate code, documentation, authentication methods, error handling, and maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="why-traditional-apis-are-like-having-separate-keys-for-every-door">Why traditional APIs are like having separate keys for every door<a href="#why-traditional-apis-are-like-having-separate-keys-for-every-door" aria-label="Direct link to Why traditional APIs are like having separate keys for every door" title="Direct link to Why traditional APIs are like having separate keys for every door">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Metaphorically Speaking:</strong> APIs are like individual doors - each door has its own key and rules:</p>

<p>Traditional APIs require developers to write custom integrations for each service or data source</p>

<p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) started as a project by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic ↗</a> to make it easier for AI models - like Claude - to interact with tools and data sources.</p>
<p>But it's not just an Anthropic thing anymore. MCP is open, and more companies and developers are jumping on board.</p>
<p>It's starting to look a lot like a new standard for AI-tool interactions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single protocol:</strong> MCP acts as a standardized "connector," so integrating one MCP means potential access to multiple tools and services, not just one</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic discovery:</strong> MCP allows AI models to dynamically discover and interact with available tools without hard-coded knowledge of each integration</li>
<li><strong>Two-way communication:</strong> MCP supports persistent, real-time two-way communication - similar to WebSockets. The AI model can both retrieve information and trigger actions dynamically</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>MCP Hosts:</strong> These are applications (like Claude Desktop or AI-driven IDEs) needing access to external data or tools</li>
<li><strong>MCP Clients:</strong> They maintain dedicated, one-to-one connections with MCP servers</li>
<li><strong>MCP Servers:</strong> Lightweight servers exposing specific functionalities via MCP, connecting to local or remote data sources</li>
<li><strong>Local Data Sources:</strong> Files, databases, or services securely accessed by MCP servers</li>
<li><strong>Remote Services:</strong> External internet-based APIs or services accessed by MCP servers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visualizing MCP as a bridge makes it clear:</strong> MCP doesn't handle heavy logic itself; it simply coordinates the flow of data and instructions between AI models and tools.</p>

<p>In practice, an MCP client (e.g., a Python script in <code>client.py</code>) communicates with MCP servers that manage interactions with specific tools like <strong>Gmail, Slack, or calendar apps</strong>.</p>
<p>This standardization removes complexity, letting developers quickly enable sophisticated interactions.</p>

            <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 18:11:46 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/">https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43302132">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>
We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
</p>
<p>We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.</p>
<p>But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.</p>
<p>Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.</p>
<p>Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.</p>
<p>Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.</p>
<p>The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Facebook_leak">They know</a> that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.</p>
<p>With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.</p>
<p>We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.</p>
<p>Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this <a href="https://youtu.be/QEJpZjg8GuA">algorithmic complacency</a>, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.</p>
<h2 id="take-the-power-back">Take the Power Back</h2>
<p>It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.</p>
<p>We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.</p>
<p>So what can we do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.</li>
<li>Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.</li>
<li>Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-rss-feeds/">RSS feeds</a></li>
<li>Be mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.</li>
<li>Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

It did remove a previous proposal that would compel Google to sell its stakes in AI startups, however, after Anthropic told the government that it needs the company's money to continue operating. Instead of banning AI investments altogether, the government wants to require the company to notify federal and state officials before making investments in artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, the <em>Financial Times </em><a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-is-investing-another-billion-dollars-in-anthropic-145548826.html" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> that Google was investing another billion dollars in Anthropic.</p><p>Google is expected to file its own proposal for its final set of alternative remedies.

Google suggested allowing it continue paying partners like Apple and Mozilla to offer Google Search, but also to allow them to form agreements with other partners across different platforms. Apple could, for instance, offer different default search engines for iPhones and iPads. Meanwhile, browser companies could change default search engines every 12 months.</p><p>As <em>The Post</em> notes, the Justice Department's filing could be an indicator of how the Trump administration will handle antitrust cases involving tech companies. It could be strict on big tech like the Biden administration was despite tech leaders supporting the new President and his policies. Google donated to the Trump campaign when he ran last year and just recently <a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-reportedly-changing-course-on-its-diversity-initiatives-too-223644402.html" data-ylk="slk:halted efforts;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">halted efforts</a> to hire employees from diverse backgrounds. It said that it was "no longer set hiring targets to improve representation in its workforce."

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
<p><strong>Kagi, the company behind a paid, private search engine</strong><sup data-fn="85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05"><a id="85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05-link" href="#85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05">1</a></sup><strong> of the same name, has announced it’s bringing its Webkit-based <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Orion</em> web browser</a> to Linux.</strong></p>



<p>In a post on BlueSky, Kagi said: <em>“We’re thrilled to announce that development of the Orion Browser for Linux has officially started!”</em>. </p>



<p><em>Orion</em> is currently only available on macOS and iOS but was built to be better than Apple’s own Safari, and best Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and other browsers in many areas.</p>



<p>Orion is a zero-telemetry browser; has built-in ad and tracking blocking; and reportedly offers lower memory usage, faster page speeds, and greater battery efficiency on Apple devices than other browsers. It also supports both Chrome and Firefox extensions.</p>

<p>Whether all of those USPs can be carried over to Linux—a less defined ‘platform’ than macOS if targeting things like power efficiency—remains to be seen. Kagi is hopeful; they say the Orion Linux build will have feature-parity with the macOS version by next year.</p>







<p>Obviously, Orion’s (current) closed-source nature will not endear it to everyone. Plenty of Linux users simply can’t countenance using <em>Steam</em>, <em>Spotify</em>, <em>Vivaldi</em>, <em>Slack</em>, <em>Discord</em>, <em>Google Chrome</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em> or other non-free apps, tools, or services.</p>



<p>—That’s fair; we’re free to choose the software that works for us on whatever level that matters, be it utility, integration, or indeed license model.</p>



<p>Yet, the idea of being able to run a fast, user-friendly, and flexible WebKit-based web browser on Linux is a promising development for choice, if nothing else. GNOME Web/Epiphany shows the promise WebKit offers – Orion may bring the polish.</p>



<p>Kagi has started work on open-sourcing <a href="https://github.com/OrionBrowser">many components</a>&nbsp;used in Orion and plans to open source more — the small team is the bottleneck; forking WebKit, porting hundreds of APIs, and building a browser from scratch takes resources.</p>



<p><em>“Properly maintaining an open-source project takes time and resources we’re short on at the moment, so if you want to contribute at this time, please consider becoming active on&nbsp;orionfeedback.org,” they add. </em></p>



<p>If you’re interested in learning more about Orion (for macOS) check out the <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/">Orion landing page</a> on the Kagi website, or read through a <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comprehensive FAQ</a>.  To sign-up for news on the upcoming Linux version, plug in an e-mail in the sign-up form.</p>



<p>The saying goes “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product” —<em>unless open-source</em>, I tend to add if I hear someone say it! Alas, Mozilla’s recent faux-pas suggests that even noble projects aren’t immune to the shiny glint of <em>ick</em>.</p>



<p><em>Thanks Sambot!</em></p>

              <p>Tucker Carlson’s interview with disgraced crypto CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, which was distributed <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sbf-suggests-dems-didnt-save-him-because-he-gave-money-to-republicans-too-2000572852">online Thursday,</a> appeared to be a transparent ploy to get media attention with the goal of ultimately scoring a pardon from President Donald Trump. But it sounds like SBF is now paying a price for the interview. The former billionaire has reportedly been tossed into solitary confinement because the interview wasn’t approved by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, according to a new report from the New York Times.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/technology/sam-bankman-fried-pardon-trump.html">the Times</a>, the Bureau of Prisons has strict rules about how interviews are conducted with inmates, and the federal agency confirmed to the newspaper that it did not give permission for the interview with Carlson to go forward. We don’t know when the interview actually took place, though clues suggest it was Wednesday, the day before it was published online to social media platforms like Rumble and X. SBF is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.</p> <p>It’s also not clear what kind of equipment was used to allow SBF and Carlson to communicate. It’s entirely possible SBF simply used a smuggled smartphone to talk with Carlson, and while that does seem like the most straightforward way to accomplish an interview like this, that’s purely speculative.&nbsp; SBF suggested in his chat with Carlson that he was really missing having high-tech devices at his disposal, though the topic only came up when the former Fox News host asked if the crypto executive was previously on stimulants before he entered prison. SBF blamed his erratic appearance in old interviews on being distracted by tech devices. Carlson took the opportunity to say that tech wasn’t healthy.</p> <p>The new report from the New York Times seems to confirm what anyone with a little bit of common sense assumed when Carlson’s interview dropped: SBF, who’s currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud after his crypto company FTX collapsed in 2022, is angling for a pardon from President Trump.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried’s parents, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, are two law professors at Stanford and are reportedly consulting with Kory Langhofer, an Arizona lawyer who previously worked on Trump’s presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020, according to the Times. Langhofer would presumably have deep connections in Trump World, but the newspaper reports they haven’t had direct contact with Trump. At least, not yet.</p>

 <p>But it seems like it could be an uphill climb for SBF and his family to get a pardon from Trump. The Times says the effort “does not appear to have gained traction,” and it’s easy to guess that SBF’s old associations with high-profile Democrats may be hurting his chances. However, SBF himself admitted once he was in jail that he was also secretly donating to Republicans before the implosion of FTX.</p> <p>SBF said in the Thursday episode of Carlson’s show that he doesn’t believe Democrats “saved” him while being prosecuted during the Joe Biden years because they knew he was giving to Republicans as well. Carlson kept acting throughout the interview as though it’s just normal and reasonable for wealthy people who donate to politicians to expect corrupt favors from those same people in their time of need. But SBF didn’t really take the bait, saying that it would have been “inappropriate” to ask for help.</p>

 <p>Trump recently <a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-pardons-silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht-2000553405">pardoned Ross Ulbricht</a>, the Silk Road founder convicted in 2015 who was serving a 40-year sentence for money laundering, among a host of other charges related to the darknet site. Ulbricht’s pardon was actually a campaign promise made by Trump in the lead up to the election, largely seen as a favor to the crypto community, which considers Ulbricht a hero.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried never explicitly asked for a pardon from Trump during his interview either, and it seems pretty clear at this point that no matter how desperate he is to get out of prison, he’s going to let things happen behind the scenes rather than go begging. But who knows what might happen in the future. SBF turned 33 on Thursday and has only served a couple of years of a 25-year sentence.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.viblo.se/posts/no-need-redis/">https://www.viblo.se/posts/no-need-redis/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43301432">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is arguably the most well regarded tech
  of all. My impression is that not even PostgreSQL has the same kind of
  positive aura around it. And of all tech available Redis is at the top of
  things you "need" to have in your tech stack. Maybe this will change with
  their latest
  <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">licencing change</a>, but that remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
  It's not difficult to see why, Redis is after all a very well architected and
  impressive piece of technology and this post is not arguing against any
  technical merits of Redis. What I will argue is that despite no technical flaw
  in Redis itself you still might not need it!
</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>
  In the last 3 places I worked (10+ years) I have seen the same pattern. A
  problem comes up, Redis is seen as a great fit and here we go.
</p>
<p>
  However, when looking closer at the actual use case it turns out that Redis
  didn't improve things, or did not fix the underlying problem. It just added
  complexity for complexity's sake.
</p>

<h2>First time, at Tantan</h2>
<p>
  First time Redis was proposed was at
  <a href="https://tantanapp.com/">Tantan</a>, the second largest dating app in
  China and a sort of Chinese Tinder. At the time we had 50-100 very powerful
  database servers running PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p>
  To not make this post too long I will simplify the architecture a bit: Each
  server stored a subset of the users 'swipes', sharded by the UserId so that a
  specific user only had data on one server. To add new swipes, the code would
  locate the server belonging to the user, and then run an insert SQL statement.
  If you are curious I have held a couple of talk of Tantan's DB architecture,
  see <a href="https://www.viblo.se/talks/">here</a> for a more in depth overview.
</p>
<p>
  The need arose to keep track of a little piece of additional data, namely the
  count of swipes. Basically a single integer value for each user, with two
  important properties: The value would be updated very often since 'swipe'
  where the most common action of a user, and the value would often be read, to
  always show the correct value.
</p>
<p>
  Our first thought (mine as well), where to put this data in Redis. A small
  amount of data, frequently updated and often requested felt like a perfect
  match for Redis. A single beefy Redis (many cores, lots of RAM type of
  machine) should be able to handle the load, so we would only need a couple
  (for redundancy). We bought (no cloud!) and installed the machines and started
  to configure Redis. While doing this a question rose in my mind - 'Why can't
  we just store this data on the shards in PostgreSQL, next to the swipes?'. The
  data itself would be microscopic in comparison and the additional load would
  also be microscopic in comparison to what these servers were already doing.
  After discussions in the team, they agreed! It would just add complexity to
  our relatively simple stack to add Redis!
</p>
<p>
  Guess what, after deployment the added load couldn't barely be seen on the db
  servers. Success!
</p>
<p>
  This is one of my favorite architecture moments. Something I think back to
  whenever someone proposes adding new tech, but the reasoning behind is not
  thought through all the way.
</p>

<h2>Second time, at Bannerflow</h2>
<p>
  After I left Tantan I joined a ad tech company called
  <a href="https://www.bannerflow.com/">Bannerflow</a>. There we built a "CMP",
  a web-platform for our enterprise users to create and publish ads online.
</p>
<p>
  At Bannerflow, one team were building a new set of microservices to configure
  and publish ads to social networks like Facebook. While there are certainly
  complexities in regard to how format the ads to fit the various social
  network's API contracts, get access etc., this was not a high load scenario
  like at Tantan.
</p>
<p>
  The team decided to add a Redis instance, for some cache of sorts. Note that
  this was for a system with a load not even 0.1% of Tantan's.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I will not be able to explain why Redis was (thought to be)
  needed in this post, because I don't know the reasoning either. After the
  initial developer left, no-one in the team could explain it to me when we
  discussed it! Looking at the code, or the number of calls or any other metric
  I could not see any reason, and we could agree that given a bit of spare time
  the best would be to remove it. (Now, running a managed Redis in Azure is not
  a lot of work, so I could not justify rearchitect it just for simplicity, but
  the long term plan was clear)
</p>
<p>
  I have to take this on me for not staying close enough to the team while they
  were designing and building the new feature, and despite skilled developers we
  had a (in this case) useless Redis sneaked in there. Lesson learned!
</p>

<h2>Third time, at MAJORITY</h2>
<p>
  And finally, as of 2024 I now work at the fintech company
  <a href="https://www.majority.com/">MAJORITY</a>. And surprise, surprise, they
  had just introduced Redis in the months before I joined!
</p>
<p>
  The first usage was to cache the result of an external API call to lookup
  geolocation of users, so that the service in question could process location
  requests quicker, and also run cheaper. What I think is interesting here is
  that it is very reasonable to want to cache this data, no objection here.
</p>
<p>
  What is less clear is what Redis added. By chance this specific service did
  two things for the lookup, one DB call (to a Azure SQL Database), and one
  Redis call. This made it very easy to compare and evaluate.
</p>
<p>
  The service in question had its own DB, sharing a DB cluster with other
  services. This specific DB had so low amount of load that it did not even show
  up when looking at the cluster load in Azure. Moving the Redis usage over to
  the DB would result in ~2x that load, which is a big
  <em>relative</em> increase, but in <em>absolute</em> numbers a very minor
  increased load on the DB when the original load was more or less 0!
</p>
<p>
  Of course, when a new tech is introduced into a tech stack, more and more
  parts will start using it. Same here. Soon the need arose to have locks shared
  between several instances of the same microservice. Since Redis was already in
  use, it was natural to use it for this as well.
</p>
<p>
  But, looking closer it was easy to see that these locks could just as well use
  the locking mechanism inside the main DB (Azure SQL). Some mentioned
  performance and to not put more load on the DB, but just as before it was not
  a high performance use case, actually not anywhere near even 1 lock per
  second.
</p>
<p>
  Just like in Bannerflow, the implementation were already done by the time I
  really understood it. And same as in Bannerflow, we decided to try and move
  away from Redis.
</p>

<h2>Ending</h2>
<p>
  Each of the three cases were unique, with different tech stacks, different
  domains and different load. But somehow they were still unified by the desire
  to use Redis!
</p>
<p>
  If you nod in agreement, or are at least open for more on the same topic,
  there's this quite well known talk by Dan McKinley I recommend to check out:
  <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">Choose Boring Technology</a> By pure
  coincidence it's also about Redis...

<p><img alt="ESP32" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/03/07/esp32.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>The ubiquitous ESP32 microchip made by Chinese manufacturer Espressif and used by over 1 billion units as of 2023 contains an undocumented backdoor that could be leveraged for attacks.</p>

<p>The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices, unauthorized data access, pivoting to other devices on the network, and potentially establishing long-term persistence.</p>

<p>This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security, who <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25554812-2025-rootedcon-bluetoothtools/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">presented</a> their findings yesterday at <a href="https://reg.rootedcon.com/cfp/schedule/talk/5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">RootedCON</a> in Madrid.</p>

<p>The researchers warned that ESP32 is one of the world's most widely used chips for Wi-Fi + Bluetooth connectivity in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, so the risk of any backdoor in them is significant.</p>

<div>

<h2>Discovering a backdoor in ESP32</h2>

<p>In their RootedCON presentation, the Tarlogic researchers explained that interest in Bluetooth security research has waned but not because the protocol or its implementation has become more secure.</p>

<p>Instead, most attacks presented last year didn't have working tools, didn't work with generic hardware, and used outdated/unmaintained tools largely incompatible with modern systems.</p>

<p>Tarlogic developed a new C-based USB Bluetooth driver that is hardware-independent and cross-platform, allowing direct access to the hardware without relying on OS-specific APIs.</p>

<p>Armed with this new tool, which enables raw access to Bluetooth traffic, Targolic discovered hidden vendor-specific commands (Opcode 0x3F) in the ESP32 Bluetooth firmware that allow low-level control over Bluetooth functions.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="ESP32 memory map" height="534" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/March/diagram.jpg" width="751"><figcaption><strong>ESP32 memory map</strong><br><em>Source: Tarlogic</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>In total, they found 29 undocumented commands, collectively characterized as a "backdoor," that could be used for memory manipulation (read/write RAM and Flash), MAC address spoofing (device impersonation), and LMP/LLCP packet injection.</p>

<p>Espressif has not publicly documented these commands, so either they weren't meant to be accessible, or they were left in by mistake.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="Script that issues HCI commands" height="408" width="821" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/March/demo.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/March/demo.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Script that issues HCI commands</strong><br><em>Source: Tarlogic</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The risks arising from these commands include&nbsp;malicious implementations on the OEM level and supply chain attacks.</p>

<p>Depending on how Bluetooth stacks handle HCI commands on the device, remote exploitation of the backdoor might be possible via malicious firmware or rogue Bluetooth connections.</p>

<p>This is especially the case if an attacker already has root access, planted malware, or pushed a malicious update on the device that opens up low-level access.</p>

<p>In general, though, physical access to the device's USB or UART interface would be far riskier and a more realistic attack scenario.</p>

<p>"In a context where you can compromise an IOT device with as ESP32 you will be able to hide an APT inside the ESP memory and perform Bluetooth (or Wi-Fi) attacks against other devices, while controlling the device over Wi-Fi/Bluetooth," explained the researchers to BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>"Our findings would allow to fully take control over the ESP32 chips and to gain persistence in the chip via commands that allow for RAM and Flash modification."</p>

<p>"Also, with persistence in the chip, it may be possible to spread to other devices because the ESP32 allows for the execution of advanced Bluetooth attacks."</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Espressif for a statement on the researchers' findings, but a comment wasn't immediately available.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://glthr.com/discovering-errors-in-donald-knuths-taocp">https://glthr.com/discovering-errors-in-donald-knuths-taocp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43301342">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>As Donald Knuth <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news.html">has just published</a> Volume 4, Fascicle 7 of <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> (TAOCP), on constraint satisfaction, I would like to provide more information about the errors I discovered in 2019 in other volumes, for which I received two <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">Knuth reward checks</a>. To date, my account balance on his “bank”, the Bank of San Serriffe, <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html">is still 0x$2.40</a> (hexadecimal dollars). 0x$2.00 for two errors, and 0x$0.40 for two “valuable suggestions.”</p>
<p>His response to my errors reports was faster than I expected: I emailed him four times to report different errors from December 18, 2019, to January 1, 2020 (although Knuth does not typically use email, <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">there is an email address reserved for reporting TAOCP errors</a>, which his assistant prints). He updated the errata on January 1 and responded with a postal mail on January 9, 2020.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449823270/f986b0e9-3965-4064-b940-e5806c8011d5.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>The envelope contained my printed emails with his handwritten notes in pencil and two checks (dated December 24, 2019, and January 1, 2020).</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450804963/8e01e6e3-791c-4c2a-be48-d0627d634795.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>

<p>Some reward recipients have shared their letters online, here and there; however, I will paraphrase Knuth’s responses instead of reproducing them verbatim, as they are part of private correspondence (this can change in the future—per express authorization, for instance—; in that case, I will update this article to share a full scan of the letters). A notable exception is an excerpt of a letter containing generic information and a good anecdote: Knuth wished me a “<em>Joyeux Noël</em>” (French for “Happy Christmas”) because, probably without realizing it, I sent him an email on December 25.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449873242/48a85378-ad42-4f28-9766-ce34ffae92f3.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<hr>

<p>I was familiar with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">Algorithm X</a> before reviewing Volume 4 Pre-Fascicule 5c (published as Volume 4, Fascicule 5)—because <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover">exact cover problems</a> are fantastic! I did not expect to find fundamental errors, as Algorithm X has probably been one of the sections most thoroughly reviewed by its creator.</p>
<p>At that time, I kept track of Algorithm X’s states manually (I was on a flight without a computer). I maintained a record of the memory state with pen and paper, an experience that allowed me to focus on the essential details and discover small errors and imprecisions that led to minor corrections.</p>
<h2 id="heading-reported-errors">Reported Errors</h2>
<h3 id="heading-local-variables-not-declared">Local Variables Not Declared</h3>
<p>While the local variables of the first algorithmic step, <code>cover(i)</code>, are identified as such, the variables of the subsequent steps are not.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449975708/c6b68b0b-ed08-4be1-be8a-afd124182b52.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741449985590/bcbb0bd1-4cc6-4bfb-be27-077b6a69c5b9.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Though this is not particularly problematic (this is trivially inferable from the context), Knuth recognized that it would have been beneficial to state this characteristic for each step explicitly. However, <strong>he decided against breaking up Algorithm X between different pages due to space constraints and, therefore, could not add clarifications for each step</strong>; he then appropriately quoted Voltaire: “<em>The secret of being a bore is to tell everything.</em>” Nevertheless, Knuth ultimately found an elegant solution (see below).</p>
<p><em>Reward: 32¢ (0x20¢)</em></p>
<h3 id="heading-unused-memory-fields">Unused Memory Fields</h3>
<p>When it was time to simulate the impact of the algorithm on the memory state, I was confused by this:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450032507/cc4b9308-f844-4892-9f6e-6c97923c89b7.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>My interpretation was that a program attempting to access one of these unused fields would fail, as I assimilated them as being in an uninitialized state. And indeed, my pen-and-paper program failed when reaching the hide step for the last spacer. Using the memory dump table as an example, covering one of the last nodes after some iterations leads to set <code>q</code> to 30 and, therefore, to <code>d ← DLINK(30)</code>. If an unused field means an uninitialized memory location, then the algorithm's execution should prematurely stop as, in this example, <code>DLINK(30) = —</code>. However, <strong>Knuth clarified that he did not explicitly state the variable was <em>uninitialized</em>; instead, it must be assumed to be initialized, but its value has no impact on the algorithm.</strong></p>
<p><em>Reward: 32¢ (0x20¢)</em></p>
<h3 id="heading-unused-variables">Unused Variables</h3>
<p>Finally, <code>N</code> and <code>Z</code> were set during the algorithm initialization step, but I did not need to utilize them when manually tracking the memory state.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450118831/c747ea0f-b896-422a-9adf-d38b8bb79a86.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>According to Knuth, they were, in fact, used in the exercises, notably exercise 83.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450128565/b1d90f0a-2a9a-49a4-aeb3-b07d1e0f8172.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>To ensure this was the case, he reviewed it and noticed an error: <code>N</code> should be <code>N₁</code>.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450237068/cc7b2f39-264a-417a-8adf-e23710e8ed1b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>He graciously rewarded me for helping him discover this error. (I transitively found this error, so to say.)</p>
<p><em>Reward: $2.56 (0x$1.00)</em></p>
<h2 id="heading-corrections">Corrections</h2>
<p>Corrections arising from my emails, all dated back to January 1, 2020, can be found in the <em>Errata for Volume 4 Fascicle 5, long-form</em> (available <a target="_blank" href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">here</a>). Specifically, they are listed on pages 5 and 13 of the downloadable compressed PostScript file.</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450294503/f4408f9d-58fe-4061-958f-74b803127c9b.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450300109/59a51bd1-fe77-477b-914c-8481f5283cc7.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>It appears that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Knuth clarified what “unused” field means by implicitly stating that they are implicitly but necessarily initialized but "<em>can contain anything</em>".</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of listing all local variables, he refers to <code>p</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>r</code> as being part of a <em>non-exhaustive</em> list of local variables (“<em>Undeclared variables like p, l, r are local</em>”).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Last, in his answer 83, he replaced <code>N</code> with <code>N₁</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heading-small-aside-using-a-heartbeat-arrow-as-delimiter">Small Aside: Using a “HeartBeat-Arrow” as Delimiter</h3>
<p>Notice how Knuth uses a bespoke symbol (a “heartbeat-arrow”) to indicate the transition from the error to its correction:</p>
<p><img data-zoomable="true" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741450382338/8d04fd5a-8624-4bf4-80a7-73617f926bad.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>This is because he, as his corrections are inline/embedded (no table), he needed a symbol that is necessarily not already present in his books; otherwise, it could have been confused with a corrected symbol (typically, a simple right-pointing arrow, →, would have most probably been confused with a corrected material implication, and so forth). I believe this is an illustration of a <em>delimiter</em>, a special marker that cannot use the same symbols or structure as the regular text (<a target="_blank" href="https://glthr.com/first-order-second-order-expressions-and-delimiters-in-languages">in my previous blog post</a>, I develop this general idea).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="heading-erroneous-reference-to-an-obscure-article">Erroneous Reference to an Obscure Article</h2>
<h2 id="heading-reported-error">Reported Error</h2>
<p>When reading the section on Hamiltonian paths in antiquity from Volume 4, pre-fascicule 8a, I stumbled upon the reference to a French article about icosahedral objects inscribed with Greek letters: P. Perdrizet, in <em>Bulletin de l’Institut français du Caire</em> 30 (1930), 1-16. I did not find this article in the journal, but instead <a target="_blank" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b53180372w">located it</a> in <em>Bulletin de l’Institut français d’archéologie orientale</em>.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the error, <strong>Knuth took the time to review some articles in this journal and strongly recommended a volume about Egyptian poetry:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/31424.pdf"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/31424.pdf" target="_blank">ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/31424.pdf</a></strong>. Although he did not specify an article, I believe he referred to Vikentiev, V. (n.d.). The metrical scheme of the « Shipwrecked Sailor ». B<em>ulletin de l’Institut français d’archéologie orientale</em>, 35(1), 1–40. It is indeed remarkable for that time (see notably Planche 1, page 18 of the PDF).</p>
<p><em>Reward: $2.56 (0x$1.00)</em></p>
<h2 id="heading-correction">Correction</h2>
<p>There is no erratum, as it is a pre-fascicule that is directly edited.</p>
<p>Here is, as a substitute, a comparison of a version from November 2019, retrieved with Wayback machine, and the current one (March 2025):</p>

<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This event has left me with an immense sense of respect for Donald Knuth’s dedication to accuracy and attention to detail. It was an honor to contribute to the improvement of his work, even if it was just a small (to be honest: minuscule) part. I look forward to continuing my exploration of the latest published TAOCP volume, and discovering more errors to correct.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>There are many things about this which are nice.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's just a single file - easy to backup and version control.</li>
<li>It's composable - I can easily write code to answer unexpected questions (eg how much did I spend on currency conversions this year) or use the computed data in other calculations (eg runway projections).</li>
<li>It's easy - I just pretty-printed the data-structures I was already using instead of having to build a UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the workflow isn't always great. When I run the code above, I see:</p>
<pre data-lang="clj"><code data-lang="clj"><span>&gt; clj accounts.clj
</span><span>[[</span><span>:untagged
</span><span>  [{</span><span>:date #inst "2022-05-10T10:33:04.011-00:00"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>:amount -20.0</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>:text </span><span>"e-Transfer to: John Smith"</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span>:tag nil</span><span>}]]
</span><span> [</span><span>:total-per-tag
</span><span>  {</span><span>:eating-out -3.3</span><span>, </span><span>:things -72.79</span><span>, </span><span>:medical -90.0</span><span>, </span><span>nil -20.0</span><span>}]]
</span></code></pre>
<p>That transfer to John Smith isn't covered by any of the tagging rules. So I select the date, switch to the editor window and paste the date into the date-&gt;tag definition:</p>
<pre data-lang="clj"><code data-lang="clj"><span>(def </span><span>date-&gt;tag
</span><span>  {</span><span>#inst "2022-05-12T00:01:03.264-00:00" :things
</span><span>   </span><span>#inst "2022-05-10T10:33:04.011-00:00" :eating-out</span><span>})
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now I see:</p>
<pre data-lang="clj"><code data-lang="clj"><span>&gt; clj accounts.clj
</span><span>[[</span><span>:untagged </span><span>[]]
</span><span> [</span><span>:total-per-tag
</span><span>  {</span><span>:eating-out -23.3</span><span>, </span><span>:things -72.79</span><span>, </span><span>:medical -90.0</span><span>}]]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Multiply this by a thousand transactions and it becomes tedious.</p>
<p>Pretty-printing also makes it difficult to decide the amount of detail I should print. Sometimes I want to see which transactions contribute to each tag total. But if I always print them all then it's hard to see the totals themselves without a lot of scrolling.</p>
<p>It's also hard to share this workflow with someone non-technical. I have to setup and maintain the correct environment on their machine, teach them how to use a text editor to change the tagging rules, how to interpret syntax errors, how to use git to share changes etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could solve these kinds of problems by writing a web app and storing <code>txs</code>, <code>date-&gt;tag</code> and <code>text-&gt;tag</code> in a database.</p>
<p>Then I could put controls on the transaction itself that allow changing the tag in place. And I could add an expandable section next to each total, so that it's easy to see the transactions for that tag when I want to but they don't take up space by default.</p>
<p>Plus sharing becomes trivial - everyone has a web browser.</p>
<p>But this is a big leap in effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>A database introduces a different data model - I have to translate between database data-types and my programming languages native data-types.</li>
<li>A database introduces a different language, or at least a new api that differs from the way I access native data-structures.</li>
<li>Rather than using a familiar text editor to read and change data, I can only access it via some query language or api.</li>
<li>I have to shuffle data back and forth between database and program at the correct times.</li>
<li>It isn't easy to version control the contents of the database.</li>
<li>Before I can add interactive elements, I have to map my existing data-structures to gui elements (eg to html and css) instead of just printing them.</li>
<li>I have to add an extra layer of state management to manage the state of the gui itself.</li>
<li>All of this work has to be repeated whenever I have a new question I want to answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is insurmountable, but it's definitely much more work than the original script.</p>
<p>So a simple script is low-effort but produces a low-quality experience. And a custom app can produce a high-quality experience but is high-effort.</p>
<hr>
<p>So I made a thing.</p>
<p>It is very hacky and easy to break. But it will hang together just long enough to convey the idea.</p>
<p>It's kind of like a notebook. There are cells where you can write code and the resulting values will be nicely rendered:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>;; converted from statement.csv
</span><span>(def txs
</span><span>  [{:date #inst "2022-05-13T11:01:56.532-00:00"
</span><span>    :amount -3.30
</span><span>    :text "Card transaction of 3.30 CAD issued by Milano Coffee Roasters VANCOUVER"}
</span><span>   {:date #inst "2022-05-12T10:41:56.843-00:00"

<p>Funtions render a little differently.</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(defn text-&gt;tag [text]
</span><span>  (first
</span><span>    (for [[keyword tag] keyword-&gt;tag
</span><span>          :when (clojure.string/includes? text keyword)]
</span><span>      tag)))
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you type <code>"Joe's Coffee Hut"</code> (including the <code>"</code>!) into the textbox above and hit the <code>text-&gt;tag</code> button, you'll see the result of running the <code>text-&gt;tag</code> function on that input.</p>
<p>Functions aren't limited to just returning values though. They can modify the values stored in other cells:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def txs-with-tags
</span><span>  (vec 
</span><span>    (for [tx txs]
</span><span>      (assoc tx 
</span><span>        :tag (or
</span><span>               (date-&gt;tag (:date tx))
</span><span>               (text-&gt;tag (:text tx)))
</span><span>        :actions [(fn ignore []
</span><span>                    (edit! 'date-&gt;tag assoc (:date tx) :ignore))
</span><span>                  (fn tag [tag] 
</span><span>                    (edit! 'date-&gt;tag assoc (:date tx) tag))]))))
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you type <code>:eating-out</code> into the one of the textboxes above and then hit the <code>tag</code> button, it will change the <code>date-&gt;tag</code> cell to contain an entry for the date of that transaction with the tag <code>:eating-out</code>.</p>
<p>And then any downstream cells will update, so you'll see the tag for that transaction change to <code>:eating-out</code>.</p>
<p>These actions are just values so they can be passed around like any other value. For example, if I make a list of untagged transactions then I'll still have access to the same actions:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def untagged
</span><span>  (vec
</span><span>    (for [tx txs-with-tags
</span><span>         :when (nil? (:tag tx))]
</span><span>      tx)))
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can also attach metadata to values to control how they render:</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def hidden-vec
</span><span>  (with-meta
</span><span>    [1 2 3]
</span><span>    {:preimp/hidden true}))
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you click on the <code>+</code> above it will reveal the contents of the vec. This is useful for controlling the default level of detail.</p>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(defn hidden [v]
</span><span>  (with-meta v {:preimp/hidden true}))
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="preimp"><code data-lang="preimp"><span>(def total-per-tag
</span><span>  (reduce 
</span><span>    (fn [totals tx]
</span><span>      (if (= :ignore (:tag tx))
</span><span>        totals
</span><span>        (update-in totals [(:tag tx)] 
</span><span>          (fn [total+txs]
</span><span>            (let [[total txs] (or total+txs [0 (hidden [])])]
</span><span>              [(+ total (:amount tx))
</span><span>               (conj txs (update-in tx [:actions] hidden))])))))
</span><span>    {}
</span><span>    txs-with-tags))

<p>You can click on a <code>+</code> above to reveal the transactions for that tag.</p>

<p>The demo on this page is ephemeral - you could do something similar in many notebook environments using mutable data-structures.</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://github.com/jamii/preimp">preimp repo</a> contains a server which persists the entire history of the notebook to disk, and also syncs changes between different clients to allow (coarse-grained) collaborative editing.</p>

<p>This tiny extension to the notebook model allows writing simple ugly crud apps with very little effort. You simply provide the logic and preimp gives you storage, sharing and UI for free. But the result is not an opaque image, nor is it tied to the preimp environment - you can export everything into a regular script and run it in the repl.</p>
<p>TODO rest of this section</p>
<p>required:
rich data model, which can be roundtripped through text
some way of attaching metadata to values, to control their rendering without interfering with execution in the repl</p>
<p>needed:
no declaration order
no mutable environment
no side-effects (other than edit!)
integrity constraints
perf (compiler latency) (thoughput only needs to be better than spreadsheet)</p>
<p>extensions:
much more ui options
selection (+ actions on the side)
dropdowns
understand types / destructuring
render values as copyable text (cf ?)
undo/vc (have whole history in db)
live repl, sandboxing
distribution - single binary, single-file db, optional server (like fossil)</p>
<p>research:
finer-grained collaboration (what data model?)
bidirectional editing / provenance</p>
