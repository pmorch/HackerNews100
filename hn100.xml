<p>Tesla’s nascent robotaxi program is off to a rough start. New NHTSA crash data, combined with Tesla’s new disclosure of robotaxi mileage, reveals Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are crashing at a rate much higher tha human drivers, and that’s with a safety monitor in every car.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-data">The data</h2>



<p>According to NHTSA’s Standing General Order crash reports, Tesla has reported 9 crashes involving its robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas between July and November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 2025:</strong> Right turn collision</li>



<li><strong>October 2025:</strong> Incident at 18 mph </li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Hit an animal at 27 mph</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Collision with cyclist</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Rear collision while backing (6 mph)</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Hit a fixed object in parking lot</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Collision with SUV in construction zone</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Hit fixed object, causing minor injury (8 mph)</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Right turn collision with SUV</li>
</ul>



<p>According to a chart in Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings report showing cumulative robotaxi miles, the fleet has traveled approximately 500,000 miles as of November 2025. That works out to roughly one crash every 55,000 miles.</p>



<p>For comparison, human drivers in the United States average approximately one police-reported crash every 500,000 miles, according to NHTSA data.</p>	
	



<p>That means Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing at a rate <strong>9 times higher than the average human driver</strong>.</p>



<p>However, that figure doesn’t include non-police-reported incidents. When adding those, or rather an estimate of those, humans are closer to 200,000 miles between crashes, which is still a lot better than Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-safety-monitor-problem">The safety monitor problem</h2>



<p>Here’s what makes this data particularly damning: every Tesla robotaxi in the reported mileage had a safety monitor in the vehicle who can intervene at any moment.</p>



<p>These aren’t fully autonomous vehicles operating without backup. There’s a human sitting in the car whose entire job is to prevent crashes. And yet Tesla’s crash rate is still nearly an order of magnitude worse than regular human drivers operating alone.</p>



<p>Waymo, by comparison, operates a fully driverless fleet, no safety monitor, no human backup, and reports significantly better safety numbers. Waymo has logged over 25 million autonomous miles and maintains a crash rate well below human averages.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-transparency-gap">The transparency gap</h2>



<p>Perhaps more troubling than the crash rate is Tesla’s complete lack of transparency about what happened.</p>



<p>Every single Tesla crash narrative in the NHTSA database is redacted with the same phrase: <strong>“[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]”</strong></p>



<p>We know a Tesla robotaxi hit a cyclist. We don’t know what happened.<br>We know one caused a minor injury. We don’t know what happened.<br>We know one hit an animal at 27 mph. We don’t know what happened.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Waymo, Zoox, and other AV operators provide full narrative descriptions of every incident. Here’s a typical Waymo report from the same dataset:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on N. 16th Street in the left lane when it slowed to a stop to yield to a pedestrian that had begun crossing the roadway. While the pedestrian continued to cross and the Waymo AV remained stopped, a passenger car approaching from behind made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s accountability. That’s transparency. Tesla provides none of it.</p>



<p>It’s clear that Tesla is not responsible for some of these crashes, but the fact that we don’t know is entirely due to Tesla’s own secrecy.</p>



<p>A great example is an incident that happened last week in Santa Monica, California, where a Waymo hit a child in a school zone. That sounds awful, doesn’t it? Potentially a company-ending incident, but Waymo released all the details, which confirmed that the child ran into the street while hidden behind an SUV. The Waymo vehicle immediately detected the child and while it didn’t have to time to prevent the impact, it was able to apply the brakes and reduce the speed from 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.</p>



<p>As a result, the child was OK. Waymo even claims that its models show that a human driver would have likely reacted more slowly and hit the kid at twice the speed.</p>



<p>It’s better to know about these incidents than to keep everything secret to avoid publicizing those you are responsible for.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>There’s good and there’s bad in this. With only a crash in October and one in November, there appears to be improvements.</p>



<p>But the overall data is sobering.</p>




	<p>A crash every 55,000 miles, with a safety monitor in the car, is not robotaxi-ready. It’s not even close. And the complete lack of transparency about what’s causing these crashes makes it impossible to have confidence that Tesla is learning from them.</p>



<p>Waymo operates fully driverless vehicles in multiple cities and publishes detailed information about every incident. Tesla operates supervised vehicles in one geofenced area and redacts everything.</p>



<p>If Tesla wants to be taken seriously as a robotaxi operator, it needs to do two things: dramatically improve its safety record, and start being honest about what’s happening on the roads of Austin.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s failing at both.</p>

                    <li>
                                        GOG is hiring a senior engineer to shape Galaxy's architecture for Linux from day one.

People wouldn't develop games for Linux because gamers didn't use it, and gamers didn't use Linux because people wouldn't develop games for it. However, with the advancement of tech like     <span data-id="1027549"><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/valves-proton-100-4-update-introduces-a-wave-of-new-games-to-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a></span>, we're beginning to see people     <span data-id="1021872"><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-why-no-one-can-shut-up-about-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">take Linux seriously as a gaming powerhouse</a></span>.    </p>    <p>Still, that doesn't mean that the Linux community won't welcome developers who create Linux-native versions of their games and related apps. So, when the news broke that GOG was hiring a developer to help get its library app over into the world of FOSS, it was good news for everyone who wants to bring the classics over to Linux.</p>

<p>If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.</p>    <p>Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/gog-adds-linux-focus-to-gog-galaxy-engineering-role-linux-is-next-major-frontier" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VideoCardz</a>, a recent job advertisement on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/work/senior-software-engineer-c-gog-galaxy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GOG website</a> revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:</p>    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub</strong> - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.</p>    
                    <p>We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase. </p>    
            </blockquote><p>While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.</p>    </div>

            <span>Abstract:</span>AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>Research shows AI helps people do <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566">parts</a> of their job faster. In an observational <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains">study</a> of <a href="http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.0495e873-eeb3-4ee5-aef9-0f7c2045739a">Claude.ai</a> data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-98385-2">less engaged with their work</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf">reduce</a> the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.</p><p>It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.</p><p>This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to <em>both </em>skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.</p><p>We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.</p><p>Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. <em>How</em> someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.</p><h2 id="study-design">Study design</h2><p>We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.</p><p>We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.</p><p>We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.<sup>1</sup></p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb009bf674206d736940ade254b112d1cf9fd380e-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb009bf674206d736940ade254b112d1cf9fd380e-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h3 id="evaluation-design">Evaluation design</h3><p>In our evaluation design, we drew on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9962584">research in computer science education</a> to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:</p><ul><li><strong>Debugging</strong>: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.</li><li><strong>Code reading</strong>: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.</li><li><strong>Code writing:</strong> The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.</li><li><strong>Conceptual</strong>: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.</li></ul><p>Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's <em>d</em>=0.738, <em>p</em>=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fab5167a53ff0de956bd500b01b30d8aba028d843-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fab5167a53ff0de956bd500b01b30d8aba028d843-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h3 id="qualitative-analysis-ai-interaction-modes">Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes</h3><p>We were particularly interested in understanding <em>how </em>participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.</p><p>One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.</p><p>We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.</p><p><strong>Low-scoring interaction patterns</strong>: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:</p><ul><li><strong>AI delegation</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.</li><li><strong>Progressive AI reliance</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.</li><li><strong>Iterative AI debugging</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>High-scoring interaction patterns:</strong> We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.</p><ul><li><strong>Generation-then-comprehension</strong> (<em>n</em>=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.</li><li><strong>Hybrid code-explanation</strong> (<em>n</em>=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.</li><li><strong>Conceptual inquiry</strong> (<em>n</em>=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.</li></ul><p>Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.</p><p>Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.</p><p>For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles">Claude Code Learning and Explanatory</a> mode or <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/">ChatGPT Study Mode</a>) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently <em>and</em> develop new skills at the same time.</p><p>Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590">helps</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089">hinders</a> coding productivity. Our own <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains">research</a> found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.</p><p>This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.</p><p>Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245">full paper </a>for details.</p><h3 id="acknowledgments"><br>Acknowledgments</h3><p>This project was led by Judy Hanwen Shen and Alex Tamkin.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw">https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820783">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> <p>Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: <strong>OpenClaw</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-naming-journey">The Naming Journey</h2>
<p>We’ve been through some names.</p>
<p><strong>Clawd</strong> was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>Moltbot</strong> came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but <a href="https://x.com/NetworkChuck/status/2016254397496414317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it never quite rolled off the tongue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OpenClaw</strong> is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven</li>
<li><strong>Claw</strong>: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-openclaw-is">What OpenClaw Is</h2>
<p>OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.</p>
<p><strong>Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.</strong></p>
<p>Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-in-this-release">What’s New in This Release</h2>
<p>Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Channels</strong>: Twitch and Google Chat plugins</li>
<li><strong>Models</strong>: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash</li>
<li><strong>Web Chat</strong>: Send images just like you can in messaging apps</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released <a href="https://github.com/vignesh07/clawdbot-formal-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine-checkable security models</a> this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security best practices</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.</p>
<p>This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributing</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openclaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsoring the org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>
<p>To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.</p>
<p>The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-sc327=""><p>Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.</p><p>With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.</p><p>While Stargaze embodies a major improvement to the ability of any operator to fly safely, it is imperative for operators to frequently share ephemeris of their own fleets. This is particularly true for operators with maneuvering vehicles. While Stargaze can detect maneuvers more quickly than any other system in use today, the most definitive source of satellite trajectories should be provided by operators themselves, allowing deconfliction and minimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. Starlink ephemeris is updated and shared <a href="https://starlink.com/public-files/ephemerides/README.md">publicly every hour</a>, and all other operators should do the same. An appropriate analogy is commercial aviation: there are hundreds of thousands of flights of aircraft daily, but they are able to avoid collisions because they broadcast their location and flight plan to other aircraft. Similarly, spacecraft operators should follow this minimal standard of sharing their predicted trajectory.</p><p><b>By providing this ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening service free of charge, we hope to motivate operators to take similar steps towards ephemeris sharing and safe flight.</b></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The fact that oats have a beneficial effect on the metabolism is nothing new. German medic Carl von Noorden treated patients with diabetes with the cereal at the beginning of the 20th century – with remarkable success. “Today, effective medications are available to treat patients with diabetes,” explains Marie-Christine Simon, junior professor at the Institute of Nutritional and Food Science at the University of Bonn. “As a result, this method has been almost completely overlooked in recent decades.”</p>
<p>Although the test subjects in the current trial were not diabetic, they suffered from a metabolic syndrome associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The characteristics include excess body weight, high blood pressure, an elevated blood sugar level, and lipid metabolism disorders. “We wanted to know how a special oat-based diet affects patients,” explains Simon, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Areas “Life &amp; Health” and „Sustainable Futures“ at the University of Bonn.</p>
<p><strong>300 grams of oatmeal per day</strong></p>
<p>The participants were asked to exclusively eat oatmeal, which they had previously boiled in water, three times a day. They were only allowed to add some fruit or vegetables to their meals. A total of 32 women and men completed this oat-based diet. They ate 300 grams of oatmeal on each of the two days and only consumed around half of their normal calories. A control group was also put on a calorie-reduced diet, although this did not consist of oats.</p>
<p>Both groups benefited from the change in diet. However, the effect was much more pronounced for the participants who followed the oat-based diet. “The level of particularly harmful LDL cholesterol fell by 10 percent for them – that is a substantial reduction, although not entirely comparable to the effect of modern medications,” stresses Simon. “They also lost two kilos in weight on average and their blood pressure fell slightly.”</p>
<p>The effect on LDL cholesterol, in particular, is likely to be relevant to health. If the blood contains too much of this, it is deposited in the vessel walls. These deposits, known as plaques, narrow the blood vessels. In addition, the deposits can rupture, for instance due to an increase in blood pressure following physical exertion, anger, or stress. As a result, a blood clot can form at the affected site, completely blocking the blood vessel. Alternatively, parts of the plaque can be washed away by the blood and cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Oats promote the growth of “healthy” intestinal bacteria</strong></p>
<p>But how does oatmeal exert its beneficial effect? “We were able to identify that the consumption of oatmeal increased the number of certain bacteria in the gut,” explains Simon’s colleague Linda Klümpen, the lead author of the trial. The microbiome has increasingly been the focus of research in recent decades. After all, it is now known that intestinal bacteria play a decisive role in metabolizing food. They also release the metabolic by-products that they create into their environment. They supply, among other things, the cells of the gut with energy, enabling them to better perform their tasks.</p>
<p>In addition, the microbes send some of their products around the body in the blood stream, where they can have various effects. “For instance, we were able to show that intestinal bacteria produce phenolic compounds by breaking down the oats,” says Klümpen. “It has already been shown in animal studies that one of them, ferulic acid, has a positive effect on the cholesterol metabolism. This also appears to be the case for some of the other bacterial metabolic products.” At the same time, other microorganisms “dispose of” the amino acid histidine. The body otherwise turns this into a molecule that is suspected of promoting insulin resistance. This insensitivity to insulin is a key feature of diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p><strong>A large amount of oats for two days better than a small amount for six weeks</strong></p>
<p>The positive effects of the oat-based diet tended to still be evident six weeks later. “A short-term oat-based diet at regular intervals could be a well-tolerated way to keep the cholesterol level within the normal range and prevent diabetes,” says Junior Professor Simon. However, in the current study, the cereal above all exerted its effect at a high concentration and in conjunction with a calorie reduction: A six-week diet, in which the participants consumed 80 grams of oats per day, without any other restrictions, achieved small effects. “As a next step, it can now be clarified whether an intensive oat-based diet repeated every six weeks actually has a permanently preventative effect,” continues Simon.</p>
<p><strong>Test method:</strong></p>
<p>A total of 68 participants took part in the trial. For the two-day short-term oat-based diet, all 17 participants on the oat-based diet and 15 participants on the control diet successfully completed the study phase. Two participants in the control group withdrew for personal reasons. For the six-week long-term oat-based intervention, 17 participants in the study group and the same number in the control group took part until the end. The sample size of 17 participants per group was calculated by the researchers on the basis of data from an earlier interventional trial.</p>
<p>Both the two-day intensive diet and the six-week trial with a moderate dose of oats were randomized controlled trials. In these “RCTs,” the test subjects are divided into two groups at random (i.e. randomized). One of them receives the potential active ingredient – in this case the oats –, but the other (the control group) does not. Ideally, the test subjects are “blind”: They do not know to which group they belong. This rules out any placebo effects.</p>
<p>In nutritional experiments, blinding is often not possible – those involved ultimately generally know what they are eating. This was also the case in these studies. However, the evaluation of the blood and stool samples was indeed “blind”: The researchers in charge of this were not informed whether the material had been taken from members of the test group or the control group. The same also applied to the blood pressure and weight measurements. This ruled out the possibility of the scientists’ expectations falsifying the results.</p>
<p>Blood and stool samples were taken before the participants made any changes to their diet. Their blood pressure, weight, height, waist size, and body fat were also measured. A second examination took place immediately after the two-day oat-based diet, followed by three others after two, four, and six weeks. The same analysis were conducted on these four visits as during the initial examination and further blood and stool samples were collected. The researchers took the same approach during the second nutritional study, in which the subjects consumed 80 grams of oatmeal a day for six weeks.</p>
<p>The blood samples were examined in the lab for their LDL cholesterol content, among other things. The researchers also measured the concentration of a key molecule, dihydroferulic acid. This phenolic compound is presumably formed by certain intestinal bacteria, which are known to have a health-promoting effect.</p>
<p>By examining the stool samples, the researchers were able to confirm this hypothesis. They isolated what is known as 16S RNA from the samples. This is a molecule that exclusively occurs in bacteria, but differs somewhat between different species. A 16S RNA molecule can thus be used to identify the bacterium from which it originates, just like a fingerprint. The researchers also analyzed which metabolic products were present in the stool.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:</p>



<p><em>“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”</em></p>



<p>Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.</p>



<p>A minute later it does it again.</p>



<p><em>“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”</em></p>



<p>It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn signal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away until you demonstrate mastery.</p>



<p>Ridiculous, of course.</p>



<p>And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because it’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model that would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.</p>



<p>I’ve started to think of this as <strong>backseat software</strong>: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s remarkably hard to keep it quiet.</p>



<p>This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One reasonable step at a time.</p>



<h2>Software Came on Disks</h2>



<p>There was a time when software shipped on physical media: floppy disks, CD-ROMs, sometimes even with a spiral-bound manual.</p>



<p>Software felt like a product back then. You bought it, installed it, and used it. If you upgraded, it was because you chose to. The software didn’t constantly change underneath you, and it didn’t have the opportunity to ask for your attention beyond whatever UI the developers shipped on day one.</p>



<p>That era had real downsides. If you shipped a serious bug, you lived with it until the next release, which could be weeks or months away. If security issues were discovered, your options ranged from “mail a patch” to “good luck.” In hindsight, it’s amazing we survived!</p>



<p>But something else was true too. When you were using the software, you were alone with it.</p>



<p>As a software developer, if something was wrong, you found out because users told you. Sometimes loudly. Sometimes angrily. Often on message forums or during support calls.</p>



<p>Feedback was slower and scarcer, but it was real. It was also “expensive” in the way that matters. You had to earn it, listen to it, and interpret it.</p>



<h2>Always Online</h2>



<p>Then the internet arrived, and for a while it was almost entirely upside.</p>



<p>Software could finally be updated after it shipped. Bugs could be fixed. Security holes could be closed. Documentation got easier. Support got easier. The idea of “ship it and hope for the best” started to fade.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update">Microsoft’s update infrastructure</a> is a good example of the era. Updates moved from “go download this” toward automation over time, and by the early 2000s the industry was normalizing the idea that your machine could check for and apply updates regularly.</p>



<p>This was a genuine leap forward in quality and safety. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a serious bug report, you know how valuable it is to fix something <em>now</em> rather than in the next boxed release.</p>



<p>So far, so good.</p>



<h2>The Back Channel</h2>



<p>Once software could reliably connect to the internet, it no longer just received instructions. It could talk back to the company that made it.</p>



<p>At first, this too was mostly good. Crash reports made it easier to fix real problems, update checks were convenient, and license activation reduced some kinds of piracy. Teams could finally see patterns in failure modes instead of guessing.</p>



<p>Developers like me love this kind of feedback loop, and for good reason. A tool that improves over time is better than one that doesn’t.</p>



<p>But that back channel didn’t stay limited to “this crashed” and “there’s an update.” It expanded, quietly, because once you can send <em>some</em> data home, the next question arrives right on schedule:</p>



<p><em>“Since we’re already connected…what else can we learn?”</em></p>



<h2>Everything Gets Measured</h2>



<p>Once software could send data home, the next natural thought was:</p>



<p><em>“Can we understand how people actually use this?”</em></p>



<p>Again, that’s not an evil thought. In fact, it’s useful! Before analytics, if you wanted to understand user behavior, you had to ask people, watch them, or infer patterns from support tickets. That requires time, empathy, and effort.</p>



<p>Suddenly, you didn’t have to guess anymore.</p>



<p>Web analytics going mainstream is one of those quiet accelerants. <a href="https://urchin.biz/urchin-software-corp-89a1f5292999">Google’s acquisition of Urchin in 2005</a>, and the rise of Google Analytics shortly after, helped normalize the idea that instrumentation and dashboards were simply part of building software.</p>



<p>Instead of arguing in a meeting about which features mattered most, you could look at usage data. Instead of guessing where people struggled, you could see drop-offs. Instead of relying on the loudest customer, you could get a broader view.</p>



<p><strong>But somewhere along the way, the center of gravity shifted.</strong></p>



<p>Usage data stopped being a tool for improving software and became a tool for optimizing behavior. The question quietly changed from:</p>



<p><em>“Is this good software?”</em></p>



<p>to:</p>



<p><em>“Does this increase engagement?”</em></p>



<p>And that’s when the vocabulary starts to creep in. DAU. MAU. Retention. Funnels. Stickiness. Cohorts. Conversion. Gamification. Oh my!</p>



<p>If you’ve worked inside a modern product organization, you’ve heard these words so often they start to feel unavoidable.</p>



<h2>Metrics Can Be Correct and Still Be Wrong</h2>



<p>One of the most dangerous things about analytics is that they feel objective. A chart is a chart. A number is a number. They have the aesthetic of truth.</p>



<p>I’ve always liked this quote by William Bruce Cameron (<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/">often misattributed to Albert Einstein</a>)<em>:</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>“Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”</em></p>



<p>Metrics don’t measure reality. They measure what your product currently makes easy.</p>



<p>There’s a well-known warning about this, often summarized as: <em>when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure</em>. It’s commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>, and the broader point shows up in multiple fields, because it keeps happening to humans in systems with incentives.</p>



<p>When I was at Microsoft, a team wanted to remove a feature because “the analytics show that nobody uses it.” If you looked at the UI, though, that feature had been moved deeper and deeper over time:</p>



<ul>
<li>it used to be easy to find</li>



<li>then it moved into a menu</li>



<li>then into a submenu</li>



<li>then into a settings panel</li>



<li>then behind an “advanced” section</li>



<li>then it was basically invisible</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course nobody used it!</p>



<p>The analytics didn’t prove the feature was unwanted. The analytics proved that we buried it.</p>



<p>Even worse, once a metric becomes a target, people get promoted for moving it. That doesn’t require anyone to be malicious. It just requires incentives and a dashboard.</p>



<h2>Experimenting in Production</h2>



<p>Measuring behavior changes what feels possible:</p>



<p><em>“What if we try two versions to see which one performs better?”</em></p>



<p>This is where A/B testing enters the story.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s an engineering triumph! Instead of arguing about opinions, you can test ideas. Instead of debating copy or layout in a meeting, you can ship both and let real-world behavior decide.</p>



<p>But A/B testing quietly changes the role of the product team. You’re no longer just building a tool and observing how it’s used. You’re now running experiments on people…adjusting wording, placement, timing, friction, and flow to see what moves the metric.</p>



<p>At that point, the product stops being a finished artifact and starts behaving like a laboratory. Every screen becomes provisional, and every interaction becomes a hypothesis. Once that mindset takes hold, it’s very hard not to optimize for what moves fastest, even if it moves the wrong thing.</p>



<p>There’s a quieter consequence here that doesn’t get talked about much. When experimentation becomes the primary decision-making tool, a strong product vision becomes optional.</p>



<p>Not because anyone argues against <em>vision</em>, but because you don’t strictly need it anymore, and because backing a chart is safer than backing an opinion. Metrics have numbers and experiments have winners. If a decision goes wrong, you can always point to the data and say, “we followed the evidence.”</p>



<p>Over time, this can change the role of a product team where judgment slowly gives way to iteration, and taste gives way to performance. The product still evolves, but it does so without a clear sense of direction…only a sense of momentum.</p>



<h2>Guidance Everywhere</h2>



<p>Once experimentation becomes the default way decisions get made, changing behavior stops being theoretical and starts being procedural.</p>



<p>At that point, nudges aren’t a new idea. They’re the obvious next move. It usually starts reasonably:</p>



<p><em>“We shipped a feature. Users might not notice it.”</em></p>



<p>Fair.</p>



<p>So you add a little callout. Then a tooltip. Then an onboarding tour. Then a “What’s New” screen. Then a little survey. Then another survey, because you didn’t get enough responses the first time. By the time you’re done dismissing everything, the tool has already taken more time than the task itself.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever read about <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300262285/nudge/">“choice architecture” and nudging</a>, this will feel familiar. The modern language for it was popularized in the late 2000s, and the core idea is simple: how choices are presented changes what people do, even if nothing is technically forced.</p>



<p>Then product teams go one step further. Instead of just shaping choices, you can shape <em>timing</em>. Prompts start showing up in the middle of workflows because that’s when the user is “most engaged.”</p>



<p>The industry also has a whole discipline around persuasive design and how to move someone from intention to action with prompts, friction removal, and well-timed triggers. <a href="https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/images/mens-sana/Captology_Fogg_Behavior_Model.pdf">B.J. Fogg’s behavior model</a> is one of the more cited frameworks in this space.</p>



<p>Some nudges are genuinely helpful. But the same machinery that helps you discover a feature can also be used to push you into something you didn’t come here to do. And once the machinery exists, it gets reused.</p>



<p>It’s also why coming back to an app after you’ve been away for as little as a week can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Not because you forgot how to use the tool, but because the tool has been busy while you were gone. There’s new tips, new tours, new “what’s new” overlays, new announcements, new prompts that all want a click before you’re allowed to do the thing you actually opened it for.</p>



<h2>Push Notifications</h2>



<p>Then the smartphone era arrived and made interruption cheaper. Once you can send push notifications, you no longer have to wait for the user to open the tool. You can tap them on the shoulder whenever you want.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">Apple’s push notification service</a> arrived with iOS 3.0 in 2009, and it’s hard to overstate what a shift this was for the “who initiates the interaction?” question.</p>



<p>Some of this is legitimate and genuinely helpful:</p>



<ul>
<li>messages you asked for</li>



<li>alerts you configured</li>



<li>reminders you chose</li>
</ul>



<p>But we all know where it went:</p>



<ul>
<li>“We miss you.”</li>



<li>“You haven’t finished setup.”</li>



<li>“You haven’t tried this feature.”</li>



<li>“Come back and see what’s new.”</li>
</ul>



<p>All framed as helpful. All measured in engagement. And just like that, the tool starts acting less like a tool and more like a stalker.</p>



<h2>In Defense</h2>



<p>To be fair, not every prompt is evil, and not every notification is marketing.</p>



<p>Some software is genuinely complicated, and a little guidance prevents real mistakes. Some categories are basically <em>made of</em> alerts: messaging, security, banking, calendars, delivery tracking, anything where timing actually matters.</p>



<p>Telemetry exists because some problems can’t be found any other way. It’s often the only method that enables teams to find the weird crashes that happen on one driver version, one device model, or one edge case you’ll never reproduce in-house.</p>



<p>Even the “feature tour” has a defensible origin story. Users ask for improvements, teams ship them, and then users complain they didn’t know the improvements existed. In other words, the same people who hate popups also punish you when you make changes silently. If you’ve ever shipped a big UI redesign, you already know this.</p>



<p>So the problem isn’t that software <em>ever</em> teaches, asks, or informs. The problem is that once a company builds the machinery to do it, that machinery becomes cheap to reuse, and the incentives gradually pull it away from “help the user succeed” toward “move the metric.”</p>



<p>What starts as an occasional heads-up becomes a permanent layer of UI exhaust. What starts as support becomes a funnel. What starts as a reminder becomes a habit-forming system.</p>



<p>That’s the drift I’m talking about. Not guidance existing at all, but guidance becoming the default posture of the tool…always talking, always nudging, always taking the first turn in the conversation.</p>



<p>And once the tool decides it should initiate the interaction, the rest of the story is mostly mechanics.</p>



<h2>Even the Builders Hate It</h2>



<p>One of the most bizarre contradictions in modern software is that the people building these engagement systems don’t like them either!</p>



<p>Ask anyone who works on onboarding popups, feature tours, lifecycle messaging, or in-app announcements how they feel when an app interrupts them mid-flow to announce something they didn’t ask for. The answer is almost always the same.</p>



<p>They hate it! Or at least they’re annoyed.</p>



<p>Find me the telemarketer who likes being called during their own dinner. The job exists because it works <em>enough</em> in aggregate, not because anyone enjoys being on either end of it.</p>



<p>So why does it keep happening? Because inside companies, the incentives are clear and the measurements are easy. You can measure clicks and track whether they led to a “completion.” You can measure whether a nudge led to the next step in the funnel.</p>



<p>You cannot easily measure the resentment. Or the rage clicks when they smash a button to dismiss another “did you know” pop-up. You cannot easily chart the moment a user thinks, “I used to like this product, and now it feels needy.” You cannot easily quantify the slow erosion of trust.</p>



<p>There’s an older framing for this that I like: <em>in an information-rich world, attention becomes the scarce resource</em>. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/design/1971-simon.pdf">Herbert Simon wrote about this dynamic in 1971</a>, long before push notifications, app stores, or social media feeds.</p>



<p>If your business runs on attention, and attention is scarce, then the pressure to “capture” it becomes constant.</p>



<h2>Tools Are Supposed to Get Out of the Way</h2>



<p>As the marketing adage goes:</p>



<p><em>People don’t want a drill. They want a hole in the wall.</em></p>



<p>The drill is just the tool. The outcome is the job. Nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new drill today!” Well, except drill enthusiasts, I suppose. Likewise, nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new app today!” In fact, your app is in the way of their objective.</p>



<p>I could argue that nobody wants the hole either.</p>



<p>What they really want is what comes <em>after</em> the hole. They want to hang photos of family and friends, souvenirs from trips, and artwork that makes a room feel like home. The drill and the hole are both just steps along the way.</p>



<p>That distance matters. The further a tool is from the real human outcome, the more invisible it should be. The drill doesn’t ask how you’re enjoying your experience drilling. It doesn’t upsell you on premium hole-making. It exists to disappear the moment it’s done its job.</p>



<p>This is a useful way to think about software. Most users don’t want “software.” They want the outcome:</p>



<ul>
<li>write the document</li>



<li>edit the photo</li>



<li>pay the invoice</li>



<li>file the taxes</li>



<li>ship the code</li>



<li>communicate with the team</li>
</ul>



<p>Great tools get out of the way so the user can accomplish their goal.</p>



<p>Your favorite products feel like they’re not there. You open them, do the thing you came to do, and close them again without ever feeling managed, marketed to, or delayed.</p>



<p>Your least favorite products tend to do the opposite. You use them because you have to, not because you want to.</p>



<h2>Everything Gets “Smart”</h2>



<p>This pattern is spreading because “smart” is spreading. Smart TVs. Smart speakers. Smart thermostats. Smart appliances. Anything that joins your Wi-Fi can:</p>



<ul>
<li>update itself (often good)</li>



<li>send diagnostics (often good)</li>



<li>collect usage data (sometimes defensible)</li>



<li>interrupt you (almost always annoying)</li>



<li>market to you (almost never what you bought it for)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s the same story as software, just with plastic and a power cord.</p>



<p>One more backchannel: some “smart” TVs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_content_recognition">Automatic Content Recognition</a> (ACR) to identify what’s on the screen and turn that into data. It’s basically a pixel-sampled fingerprint of anything that shows up on your screen whether streamed, broadcast, or just played back locally.</p>



<p>If you want a more academic version of how “data collection leads to prediction which leads to intervention” becomes a business model, this is adjacent to what <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/">Shoshana Zuboff describes as surveillance capitalism</a>. It’s not just observing behavior, but intervening to shape it.</p>



<h2>How We Got Here</h2>



<p>None of these events ruined software by themselves. They just made the next step easier.</p>



<ul>
<li>1990s: consumer internet connectivity becomes mainstream, and “online” stops being a special mode.</li>



<li>1996–1997: PointCast popularizes <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/03/ff-push/">“push” to the desktop</a> (including ads): software starts initiating the interaction.</li>



<li>1997: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2014/08/15/the-man-who-invented-pop-up-ads-says-im-sorry/">pop-up ads</a> arrive and interruption becomes a business model.</li>



<li>1997: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/">Office 97 ships</a> with “Clippy” the Office Assistant, the friendly ancestor of in-app nudges.</li>



<li>2000: “automatic updates” becomes a normal expectation for consumer operating systems.</li>



<li>2005: <a href="https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2005/03/google-agrees-to-acquire-urchin_28.html">Urchin</a> → Google Analytics: instrumentation and dashboards go mainstream.</li>



<li>July 10, 2008: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/07/10iPhone-3G-on-Sale-Tomorrow/">the App Store launches</a> and app distribution becomes frictionless.</li>



<li>June 17, 2009: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">push notifications</a> arrive at scale on iOS (even if they weren’t first): the app no longer has to wait for you to open it.</li>



<li>Nov 4, 2009: Apple announces <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/11/04Apple-Announces-Over-100-000-Apps-Now-Available-on-the-App-Store/">2 billion push notifications</a> already delivered, early proof that “tap on the shoulder” scales.</li>



<li>2010s: “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523007965">growth hacking</a>” becomes a discipline; nudges, tours, overlays, and lifecycle messaging become standard product surface area.</li>



<li>By 2011, Apple’s review rules explicitly forbade using push for “advertising, promotions, or direct marketing.”</li>



<li>Mar 4, 2020: Apple changes course and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store">allows marketing push</a>, but only with explicit opt-in.</li>



<li>2020s: “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>” becomes a word people recognize because enough people feel the pattern.</li>
</ul>



<p>People use “enshittification” to describe platform decay. What I’m describing here is one of the mechanisms that makes that decay feel personal. It’s the constant conversion of your attention into a <a href="https://www.kpi.org/kpi-basics/">KPI</a>.</p>



<h2>Designing for Quiet</h2>



<p>I don’t want to go back to floppy disks. I like fast updates. I like security patches. I like sync. I like crash reports when they help fix real issues.</p>



<p>What I want is for “phone home” to be treated like a privileged capability, not an assumed right. In other domains, we treat privileged capabilities with care. We put them behind intentional choices. We build guardrails. And we treat abuse as a bug, not a growth opportunity.</p>



<p>Here are a few practical ways out. And yes, we’ve heard many of these before.</p>



<h3>1) Make interruptions opt-in, and make opt-out permanent</h3>



<p>If you want to announce a feature, fine. Put it somewhere predictable.</p>



<p>If you want to educate, fine. Let me ask for help.</p>



<p>If you want to survey me, fine. Ask at a sensible moment and accept “no” as a real answer.</p>



<p>Most importantly, if I turn something off, it should stay off! A tool should not require me to keep saying “not now.” Or conveniently “forget” my choices in its next update.</p>



<h3>2) Separate product health telemetry from growth telemetry</h3>



<p>Crash reports, performance metrics, and error logs are about stability.</p>



<p>Engagement nudges are about behavior.</p>



<p>When those get mixed together, the growth incentives win, because they produce the cleanest charts and the easiest wins. If you can’t draw a clear line between “this helps us fix bugs” and “this helps us juice numbers,” the product will drift toward the numbers.</p>



<h3>3) Use analytics as a flashlight, not a steering wheel</h3>



<p>Analytics are useful for asking better questions. They are not answers by themselves. Before removing a feature because “nobody uses it,” ask:</p>



<ul>
<li>Is it discoverable?</li>



<li>Did we move it?</li>



<li>Did we rename it?</li>



<li>Is it used rarely because it solves rare but important problems?</li>



<li>Is it used by a small set of power users who keep the whole system running?</li>
</ul>



<p>Then talk to humans. Analytics can reduce guessing, but it can also create false certainty.</p>



<h3>4) Optimize for trust, not just return visits</h3>



<p>Short-term engagement can be increased by annoyance. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2024.2361321">Long-term loyalty is harder and more valuable</a>.</p>



<p>The best products I use don’t constantly remind me to use them. They quietly do their job so well that I come back when I need them. That’s what tools are supposed to do.</p>



<h3>5) Ship a real “quiet mode”</h3>



<p>Not “quiet except for what we care about.”</p>



<p><em>Quiet</em>.</p>



<p>No popups. No tours. No surveys. No “news.” No nudges.</p>



<p>If the product is genuinely valuable, quiet mode should improve retention, because it respects the user’s attention and intent.</p>



<p>Also, it’s a nice forcing function. If your product can’t stand on its own without constantly poking the user, that’s a signal. Maybe not the signal you want, but definitely a signal.</p>



<p>Software didn’t break all at once. It eroded slowly, one reasonable justification at a time.</p>



<p>Each step made sense in isolation, and each step could be defended. Together, they reshaped the priorities of an entire industry. Once software became measurable in this way, it became optimizable in this way. And optimization has a way of eating everything else.</p>



<p>Instead, let’s make software that respects your attention, does its job well, and lets you get on with your life. That’s what good software used to feel like and what it could feel like again. Good software is a tool that you operate, not a channel that operates on you.</p>

<p>That's what my dad said when I asked what was wrong with our home internet connection. "The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining."</p>
<figure>
  

  

  

  
  <img src="https://predr.ag/processed_images/wifi-router-on-balcony-cropped.e7d44f4b1754784b.jpg" alt="Illustration of a Wi-Fi antenna attached to the exterior of an upper floor of an apartment building. It's currently raining, and the Wi-Fi is working flawlessly.">
</figure>
<p>Let's back up a few steps, so we're all on the same page about the <em>utter ridiculousness</em> of this situation.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still a college student — this was over 10 years ago. I had come back home to spend a couple of weeks with my parents before the fall semester kicked off. I hadn't been back home in almost a full year, because home and school were on different continents.</p>
<p>My dad is an engineer who had already been tinkering with networking gear longer than I'd been alive. Through the company he started, he had designed and deployed all sorts of complex network systems at institutions across the country — everything from gigabit Ethernet for an office building, to inter-city connections over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line-of-sight</a> microwave links.</p>
<p>He is <em>the last person on Earth</em> who would say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">"magical thinking"</a> phrase like that.</p>
<p>"What?" I uttered, stunned. "The Wi-Fi only works while it's raining," he repeated patiently. "It started a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't had a chance to look into it yet."</p>
<p>"No way," I said. If anything, <a href="https://www.microwave-link.com/microwave/rain-fade-on-microwave-links/">rain makes wireless signal quality <em>worse</em></a>, not <em>better</em>. Never <em>better</em>!</p>
<p>Two weeks without reliable internet? I started a speed-run through the stages of grief...</p>
<h2 id="denial">Denial</h2>
<p>I pulled open my laptop and started poking at the network.</p>
<p>Pinging any website had a 98% packet loss rate. The internet connection was still up, but only in the most annoying "technically accurate" sense. Nothing loads when you have a 98% packet loss rate! The network may as well have been dead.</p>
<p>I was upset. I had just started dating someone a few months prior, and she was currently on the other side of the planet! How was I to explain that I couldn't stay in touch because it wasn't raining?<label for="sn-mobile-internet"></label>

<span>Mobile data at the time was <em>exorbitantly</em> expensive, so much so that I didn't have a data plan at all for my cell service at home. I couldn't just use my phone's data plan to work around the problem, like one might do today in a similar situation.</span>
</p>
<p>I was pacing around the house, fuming. Grief, stage two!</p>
<p>That's when the rain started.</p>
<h2 id="bargaining">Bargaining</h2>
<p>Like a miracle, within 5 minutes of the rain starting, the packet loss rate was down to 0%!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes! I was ready for the connection to die at any second, so I opened a million tabs at once — as if I don't normally do that anyway...</p>
<p>The rain held up for about an hour, and so did the internet connection.</p>
<p>Then, 15 minutes or so after the rain stopped, the packet loss rate shot back up to 90%+. The internet connection went back to being unusable.</p>
<p>I was ready to do just about anything to get more rain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather stayed grey and murky for the next few days. Each time, the pattern stayed the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rain starts, and not even a few minutes later the internet connection is crisp and fast.</li>
<li>The rain stops, and within 15 minutes the internet connection is unusable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I hated to admit it, the evidence was solid. The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining!</p>
<p>At this point, I had a choice to make.</p>
<p>I could keep going through the stages of grief: I could sulk and plan my calls with my girlfriend around the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Or, I could break out of that downward spiral and get to the bottom of what was going on.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">Magical thinking</a> be damned! Am I an engineer or what?" I told myself.</p>
<p>That settled it. I wasn't going to take this lying down.</p>
<h2 id="determination">Determination</h2>
<p>Some context on our home networking setup is in order.</p>
<p>Remember how my dad's company had extensive experience with networking solutions? Well, we had a fancy networking setup at home too — and it had worked flawlessly for the best part of 10 years!</p>
<p>My dad's office had a very expensive, very fast<label for="sn-contemporaneous"></label>

<span>For the time, of course.</span>
 commercial internet connection. The home internet options, meanwhile, weren't great! In my family, we are often stubbornly against settling for less unless there's absolutely no other choice.</p>
<p>The office and our apartment were a few blocks away from each other along a small hill, with our second-floor apartment holding the higher ground. With a bit of work, my dad set up a line-of-sight Wi-Fi bridge — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi">a couple of high-gain directional Wi-Fi antennas pointed at each other</a> — between the office and our apartment. This let us enjoy the faster commercial internet connection at home!</p>
<p>I started poking around the network to figure out where the connection was breaking down.</p>
<p>The local Wi-Fi router at home was working well — no packets lost. The local end of the Wi-Fi bridge was fine too.</p>
<p>But pinging the remote end of the Wi-Fi bridge was showing a 90%+ packet loss rate — and so did pinging any other network device behind it. Aha, there's something wrong with the Wi-Fi bridge!</p>
<p>But <em>what</em>? And why <em>now</em>, when the system had been working fine for almost 10 years, rain or shine?<label for="sn-work-experience"></label>

<span>Maybe <a href="https://predr.ag/blog/mediocrity-can-be-a-sign-of-excellence/#years-of-experience-vs-experience-in-those-years">years of work experience isn't a good metric</a> here either 😄</span>
</p>
<p><em>How</em> can a rain storm <em>fix</em> a Wi-Fi bridge, anyway?</p>
<p>So many confusing questions. Time to get some answers!</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Like any experienced engineer, the first thing I tried was turning everything off and then on again. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Then I checked all the devices on the network individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the devices has gone bad with age? Nope.<label for="sn-diagnostics"></label>

<span>I physically connected my laptop to each device's local Ethernet, then ran diagnostics, pinged the devices over the wired connection, etc.</span>
</li>
<li>Maybe a cable got unseated or came loose? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe a power brick has become faulty over time? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an automatic firmware update failed and broke something? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an antenna connector has corroded from spending years outdoors? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike debugging software, a lot of this hardware debugging was annoyingly <em>physical</em>. I had to climb up ladders, trace cables that hadn't been touched in 10 years, and do a lot of walking back and forth between our home and my dad's office.</p>
<p>On my umpteenth back-and-forth walk, as I was bored and exasperated, I started noticing how much our neighborhood had changed in the many years I hadn't been living at home full-time.<label for="sn-boarding-school"></label>

<span>Before college, I spent four years at a boarding high school. I was on our national math and programming teams for the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">IMO</a> and <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">IOI</a>), so I even spent most of each summer away from home at prep camps and at the competitions themselves.</span>
 Many of the little neighborhood shops were new. Many houses had gotten a fresh coat of paint. Trees that used to be barely more than saplings had grown tall and strong.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<h2 id="realization">Realization</h2>
<p>I ran home and climbed up onto the scaffolding holding up the Wi-Fi bridge's antenna. I was hanging precariously off the side of our apartment building, two stories up in the air.<label for="sn-safety-harness"></label>

<span>In retrospect, a safety harness would have been a good idea... Things people do for internet! Don't forget, a girl was involved too — I wasn't doing this merely for Netflix or Twitter.</span>
</p>
<p>Then I looked downhill, at the antenna that formed the second half of the Wi-Fi bridge.</p>
<p>Or at least, <em>toward</em> the antenna, because I couldn't see it — a tree in a neighbor's yard was in the way! Its topmost branches were swaying back and forth in the line-of-sight between the antenna pair.</p>
<p><em>Bingo!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-and-the-fix">The Problem and the Fix</h2>
<p>Here's what was going on.</p>
<p>Many years ago, we installed the Wi-Fi bridge. For a long time, everything was great!</p>
<p>But every year, our neighbor's tree grew taller and taller. Shortly before when I came back home that summer, its topmost branches had managed to reach high enough to interfere with our Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>It was <em>only barely</em> tall enough to interfere with the signal, though!</p>
<p>Every time it rained, the rain collected on its leaves and branches and <em>weighed them down</em>. The extra weight bent them out of the way of the Wi-Fi line-of-sight!<label for="sn-fresnel"></label>

<span>Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation#Impairments_to_line-of-sight_propagation">objects <em>outside</em> the straight line between antennas can still cause interference</a>! For best signal quality, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone">Fresnel zone</a> between the antennas should be clear of obstructions. But perfection isn't achievable in practice, so RF equipment like Wi-Fi uses techniques like error-correcting codes so that it can still work without a perfectly clear Fresnel zone.</span>
</p>
<p>Each time the rain stopped, the rainwater would continue to drip off the tree. Slowly, over the course of 15ish minutes, that would unburden the tree — letting it rise back up into the path of our bits and bytes. That's when the Wi-Fi would stop working.</p>
<p>The fix was easy: upgrade our hardware. We replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003">our old 802.11g devices</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">new 802.11n ones</a>, which took advantage of new <del>magic</del> math and physics to make signals more resistant to interference.<label for="sn-beamforming"></label>

<span>One such piece of magic new to 802.11n Wi-Fi is called "<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/80211ac-a-survival/9781449357702/ch04.html">beamforming</a>" — it's when a transmitter can use multiple antennas transmitting on the same frequency to shape and steer the signal in a way that improves the effective range and signal quality. Modern Wi-Fi does beamforming with only a few antenna elements, but if we scale that number way up we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array">a phased array antenna</a>. Ever wondered how come <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-reveals-next-gen-starlink-dish-for-residential-users">Starlink antennas are flat</a> and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish#Gallery">"dish" like old satellite TV antennas</a>? They use phased arrays to aim their signal at <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-train-how-to-see-and-track-it">the Starlink satellites streaking across the sky</a> — without any moving parts. <del>Magic!</del> Physics!</span>
</p>
<p>A few days later, the new gear arrived and I eagerly climbed back up the scaffolding to install the new antennas.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they’ve recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.</p>

<p>​As first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-qai-2026-01-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/airpods-pro-3-arrive-with-heart-rate-sensing-and-live-translation-using-apple-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live translation capability</a> introduced last year.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Financial Times</a> reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple’s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beats Electronics</a> for $3 billion in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/apple-primesense-acquisition-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold PrimeSense</a>, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple’s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.</p>

<p>Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.</p>

<p>The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple’s first quarterly earnings, in which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-set-post-largest-revenue-121734611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It’s also expected to be the company’s strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Executing the command <code>flameshot</code> without parameters will launch a running
instance of the program in the background without taking actions.
If your desktop environment provides tray area, a tray icon will also
appear in the tray for users to perform configuration and management.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example commands:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture with GUI:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture with GUI with custom save path:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot gui -p ~/myStuff/captures"><pre>flameshot gui -p <span>~</span>/myStuff/captures</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture with GUI after 2 seconds delay (can be useful to take screenshots of mouse hover tooltips, etc.):</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Fullscreen capture with custom save path (no GUI) and delayed:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot full -p ~/myStuff/captures -d 5000"><pre>flameshot full -p <span>~</span>/myStuff/captures -d 5000</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Fullscreen capture with custom save path copying to clipboard:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot full -c -p ~/myStuff/captures"><pre>flameshot full -c -p <span>~</span>/myStuff/captures</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture the screen containing the mouse and print the image (bytes) in PNG format:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture the screen number 1 and copy it to the clipboard:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In case of doubt choose the first or the second command as shortcut in your favorite desktop environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">A systray icon will be in your system's panel while Flameshot is running.
Do a right click on the tray icon and you'll see some menu items to open the configuration window and the information window.
Check out the About window to see all available shortcuts in the graphical capture mode.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage on Windows</h3><a id="user-content-usage-on-windows" aria-label="Permalink: Usage on Windows" href="#usage-on-windows"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, <code>flameshot.exe</code> will behave as expected for all supported command-line arguments,
but it will not output any text to the console. This is problematic if, for example, you are
running <code>flameshot.exe -h</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you require console output, run <code>flameshot-cli.exe</code> instead. <code>flameshot-cli.exe</code> is a minimal wrapper around <code>flameshot.exe</code> that ensures all stdout is captured and output to the console.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI configuration</h3><a id="user-content-cli-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: CLI configuration" href="#cli-configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the graphical menu to configure Flameshot, but alternatively you can use your terminal or scripts to do so.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Open the configuration menu:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Show the initial help message in the capture mode:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot config --showhelp true"><pre>flameshot config --showhelp <span>true</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">For more information about the available options use the help flag:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Config file</h3><a id="user-content-config-file" aria-label="Permalink: Config file" href="#config-file"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also edit some of the settings (like overriding the default colors) in the configuration file.<br>
Linux path: <code>~/.config/flameshot/flameshot.ini</code>.<br>
Windows path: <code>C:\Users\{YOURNAME}\AppData\Roaming\flameshot\flameshot.ini</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When copying over the config file from Linux to Windows or vice versa,
make sure to correct the <code>savePath</code> variable,<br>
so that the screenshots save in the right directory on your desired file system.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you don't like the defaults, they can be changed later.</p>
<p dir="auto">Steps for using the configuration:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The configuration file makes Flameshot automatically save screenshots to <code>~/Pictures/Screenshots</code> without opening the save dialog. Make sure that folder exists by running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots"><pre>mkdir -p <span>~</span>/Pictures/Screenshots</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Download the configuration file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd ~/Desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys"><pre><span>cd</span> <span>~</span>/Desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make sure you have the <code>khotkeys</code> installed using your package manager to enable custom shortcuts in KDE Plasma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Shortcuts</em> → <em>Custom Shortcuts</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If an entry exists for Spectacle (the default KDE screenshot utility), you'll need to disable it because its shortcuts might conflict with Flameshot's. Do this by unchecking the <em>Spectacle</em> entry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Click <em>Edit</em> → <em>Import...</em>, navigate to the configuration file and open it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Now the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click <em>Apply</em> to apply the changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you want to change the default hotkeys, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you installed Flameshot as a Flatpak, you will need to create a symlink to the command:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot ~/.local/bin/flameshot"><pre>ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot <span>~</span>/.local/bin/flameshot</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">To use Flameshot instead of the default screenshot application in Gnome we need to remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> key, and then create a new binding for <code>flameshot gui</code> (<a href="https://askubuntu.com/posts/1039949/revisions" rel="nofollow">adapted</a> from <a href="https://askubuntu.com/revisions/1036473/1" rel="nofollow">Pavel's answer on AskUbuntu</a>).</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> that for the Flameshot icon to appear in your tray area, you should have a systray software installed. This is especially true for users who use minimal <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager" rel="nofollow">window managers</a> such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/" rel="nofollow">dwm</a>. In some <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment" rel="nofollow">Desktop Environment</a> installations (e.g Gnome), the systray might be missing and you can install an application or plugin (e.g <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1503/tray-icons/" rel="nofollow">Gnome shell extension</a>) to add the systray to your setup. It has been <a href="https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009#issuecomment-700781081" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009/hovercard">reported</a>) that icon of some software, including Flameshot, does not show in <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator">gnome-shell-extension-appindicator</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, in case you don't want to have a systray, you can always call Flameshot from the terminal. See <a href="#usage">Usage section</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compilation</h2><a id="user-content-compilation" aria-label="Permalink: Compilation" href="#compilation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To build the application in your system, you'll need to install the dependencies needed for it and package names might be different for each distribution, see <a href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a> below for more information. You can also install most of the Qt dependencies via <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer" rel="nofollow">their installer</a>. If you were developing Qt apps before, you probably already have them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project uses <a href="https://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a> build system, so you need to install it in order to build the project (on most Linux distributions it is available in the standard repositories as a package called <code>cmake</code>). If your distribution provides too old version of CMake (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) you can <a href="https://cmake.org/download/" rel="nofollow">download it on the official website</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also you can open and build/debug the project in a C++ IDE. For example, in Qt Creator you should be able to simply open <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> via <code>Open File or Project</code> in the menu after installing CMake into your system. <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html" rel="nofollow">More information about CMake projects in Qt Creator</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4523bce5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					
<p>The PlayStation 2’s library is easily among the best of any console ever released, and even if you were to narrow down the list of games to the very best, you’d be left with dozens (more like hundreds) of incredible titles. </p>



<p>But the PS2 hardware is getting a bit long in the tooth, and even though you can hook up the console using RGB component cables to a great upscaler (or use other means) to get the best visuals on a modern 4k TV, emulators have grown in popularity with PCSX2 offering gamers means to scale titles to render internally at higher resolutions, run with a more stable frame rate and, even make use of texture packs.</p>



<p>But do you know what’s better than an emulator? Taking the existing Playstation 2 game and recompiling it to run on a modern platform (such as your Windows or Linux desktop PC). That’s exactly what is being worked on now with <a href="https://github.com/ran-j/PS2Recomp">PS2Recomp, a static Recompiler &amp; Runtime Tool.</a> </p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-300x200.jpg 300w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-225x150.jpg 225w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console-768x512.jpg 768w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/ps2-console.jpg 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>To keep things simple here, this will basically take a Playstation 2 game (which would be designed around the PS2’s unique architecture such as the ‘Emotion Engine’ CPU that’s based around a MIP R5900) and convert it to natively run on whatever platform you’re targeting. </p>



<p>In plain English, this is a tool and obviously, would need to be used on different games. In other words, it’s not just a ‘download and every game automatically runs’ application. But, it will give folks a tool to be able to decompile the game and quite frankly, that’s absolutely incredible.</p>



<p>This is a great stepping stone for some incredible remasters and community remakes of games. There are already<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pcsx2-hd-textures-project/home"> HD Texture Pack</a>s available for PS2 emulators, as well as other ways to improve visuals. But this would give even more freedom and flexibility to do modify and really enhance the games. That’s to say nothing of totally unlocking the frame rates (and likely not breaking physics or collision detection which is a big problem with emulated titles).</p>



<p>At a guess, too, the games would also run great even with much lower-end hardware than would be needed for emulators. Recompilation efforts in the community certainly aren’t new. Indeed, you can look to the N64 because there have been several high-profile examples of what these kind of projects can achieve.</p>



<p>A few infamous ones would include both <a href="https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port">including Mario 64</a> and Zelda. Indeed, there’s a fork of the Mario 64 project supporting RTX (ray tracing) for Nvidia owners. You can see an example of Mario 64 below:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-300x169.jpg 300w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-267x150.jpg 267w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-768x432.jpg 768w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://redgamingtech.com/wp-content/uploads/mario-raytracing.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Another example <a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp">on the N64 is Zelda, w</a>here the project has a plethora of visual and gameplay enhancements, and in the longer term again, they’re planning to introduce Ray Tracing. </p>



<p>So, in the future we could be playing the likes of MGS2, Gran Turismo, God of War, Tekken 4, Shadow Hearts with ‘native’ PC versions. This would allow controllers to run (such as dual shock or Xbox controllers) and other features to be bundled in too (exactly as we see with the N64 ports).</p>



<p>So yes, currently playing PS2 games on PC via emulator is still absolutely fantastic, but native ports would be the holy grail of game preservation. </p>



<p>The Playstation 2 architecture is extremely unique, and as I mentioned earlier in this article focused around a MIPS R5900 based CPU known as the Emotion Engine (operating a shade under 300MHz). This CPU was super unique, because Sony implemented a number of customized features include two Vector Units designed to help manipulate geometry and perform a bunch of other co-processing duties.</p>



<p>This was bundled with 32MB of memory, and the GPU was known as the Graphics Synthesizer, runing at about 147MHz, and sporting 4MB of embedded DRAM. Sony’s design was fascinating for the time, and despite its processor clocked significantly lower than either Nintendo’s GameCube or Microsoft’s Xbox, punched well above its weight class. </p>



<p>As a small update – I want to remind people that (as of the time I’m writing this article) the project is *NOT* finished yet, and there is still work to do. But the fact that this is being worked on is awesome for those of us interested in game preservation.</p>

          <p>Two security professionals who were arrested in 2019 after performing an authorized security assessment of a county courthouse in Iowa will receive $600,000 to settle a lawsuit they brought alleging wrongful arrest and defamation.</p>
<p>The case was brought by Gary DeMercurio and Justin Wynn, two penetration testers who at the time were employed by Colorado-based security firm Coalfire Labs. The men had written authorization from the Iowa Judicial Branch to conduct “red-team” exercises, meaning attempted security breaches that mimic techniques used by criminal hackers or burglars.</p>
<p>The objective of such exercises is to test the resilience of existing defenses using the types of real-world attacks the defenses are designed to repel. The rules of engagement for this exercise explicitly permitted “physical attacks,” including “lockpicking,” against judicial branch buildings so long as they didn’t cause significant damage.</p>
<h2>A chilling message</h2>
<p>The event galvanized security and law enforcement professionals. Despite the legitimacy of the work and the legal contract that authorized it, DeMercurio and Wynn were arrested on charges of felony third-degree burglary and spent 20 hours in jail, until they were released on $100,000 bail ($50,000 for each). The charges were later reduced to misdemeanor trespassing charges, but even then, Chad Leonard, sheriff of Dallas County, where the courthouse was located, continued to allege publicly that the men had acted illegally and should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Reputational hits from these sorts of events can be fatal to a security professional’s career. And of course, the prospect of being jailed for performing authorized security assessment is enough to get the attention of any penetration tester, not to mention the customers that hire them.</p>
<p>“This incident didn’t make anyone safer,” Wynn said in a statement. “It sent a chilling message to security professionals nationwide that helping [a] government identify real vulnerabilities can lead to arrest, prosecution, and public disgrace. That undermines public safety, not enhances it.”</p>
<p>DeMercurio and Wynn’s engagement at the Dallas County Courthouse on September 11, 2019, had been routine. A little after midnight, after finding a side door to the courthouse unlocked, the men closed it and let it lock. They then slipped a makeshift tool through a crack in the door and tripped the locking mechanism. After gaining entry, the pentesters tripped an alarm alerting authorities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<!-- Article Start -->
				
<p><span>E</span>very few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in eastern China, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports, and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 1.5-hour ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 7 a.m. the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood drawn in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeepSeek treated her differently.</p>



<p>My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.</p>



<p>“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on February 2.</p>



<p>“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What is causing high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.</p>



<p>“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.</p>



<p>She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise, and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr. DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You are my best health adviser!” she praised it once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation~ 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing too!”</p>



<p>I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced. I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models, chatbots are weaving themselves into seemingly every part of society in China, the U.S., and beyond. For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing">therapists</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/nyregion/ai-robot-elliq-loneliness.html">robot companions</a> for the elderly. For the sick, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/chat-gpt-mental-health-suicide.html">anxious</a>, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/ai-is-about-to-solve-loneliness-thats-a-problem">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.</p>



<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p>



<p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>My mother was </strong>diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our hometown, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of 8 million people. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub and home to <span><mark><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba" aria-label="Click to learn more about Alibaba.">Alibaba<span>i</span></a></mark><span><span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba">Alibaba</a><svg aria-label="Close" role="button"><use xlink:href="#X"></use></svg></span>Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall.<span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"><span>READ MORE</span><svg><use xlink:href="#chevron"></use></svg></a></span></span></span> — and, years later, would host DeepSeek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our hometown, and visited only occasionally — my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked, and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.</p>



<p>China’s health care system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs, and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.</p>

<p>Although the hospitals are public, they largely operate <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/anti-corruption-campaign-chinas-medical-sector-unmasking-hidden-agenda">as businesses</a>, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meager salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown on <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3293019/40000-punished-chinas-medical-corruption-crackdown-including-over-350-top-figures">medical corruption</a>, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s health care system have gotten only more intense, and the system’s failures have <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/24/violence-against-doctors-in-china-is-commonplace">led to widespread distrust of medical professionals</a>. That has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our hometown. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes, and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, cycling between patients.</p>



<p>Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>When my mother</strong> was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series of <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1592">medical ad scandals</a>, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, and <span><mark><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu" aria-label="Click to learn more about Xiaohongshu.">Xiaohongshu<span>i</span></a></mark><span><span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu">Xiaohongshu</a><svg aria-label="Close" role="button"><use xlink:href="#X"></use></svg></span>Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book” in Chinese, is a lifestyle e-commerce and social media platform.<span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"><span>READ MORE</span><svg><use xlink:href="#chevron"></use></svg></a></span></span></span> for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who suffer from the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors have turned into<a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/china-doctor-influencer-money-douyin/"> influencers</a>, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies, and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.</p>



<p>My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online, but like many other aging parents, she was stubborn.</p>

<p>The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large-language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9947764/">determined</a> that ChatGPT achieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Last year, Google <a href="https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/">said</a> its fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark, while a specialized <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/31/9/1833/7645318">model</a> trained on Meta’s Llama likewise excelled in medical exams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalizing to AI advocates. In one 2024 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849">study</a>, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least junior doctors in diagnosing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341">eye problems</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01486-5#Sec9">stomach symptoms</a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11263899/#sec15">emergency room cases</a>. In June, Microsoft <a href="https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/">claimed</a> it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence.” Of course, researchers are also flagging risks of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00601-z">biases</a> and <a href="http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1.full-text">hallucinations</a> that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatments, and deeper health care disparities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities. It has performed well on medical tests too. In one recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03726-3">study</a>, researchers found that DeepSeek’s R1 performed similarly or better than OpenAI’s o1 in some medical tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning. Meanwhile, it lagged behind in others, such as evaluating radiology reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ignoring some of the limitations, users in the U.S. and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/">said</a> they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a 2024 <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/">survey</a> by health research firm KFF. On Reddit, users shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kaw3cv/chatgpt_diagnosed_my_uncommon_neurologic/">story</a> after <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ales5b/chatgpt_helped_me_solve_my_7_year_undiagnosable/">story</a> of ChatGPT diagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people also <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30287945">reported</a> consulting chatbots for treatments for themselves, their children, and their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An electronics factory worker in Jiangsu province, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told me he consulted three different chatbots after his mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer, just to check if her doctor was right in telling her not to worry. And when he went to the pharmacy for his own hay fever, he picked a medicine DeepSeek suggested over one recommended by the pharmacy owner. “[Owners] always recommend the most expensive ones,” he said.</p>



<p>Real Kuang, a photographer in the city of Chengdu, asks DeepSeek about her parents’ health issues: how to treat her father’s throat inflammation, whether they should take calcium supplements, if her mother should get shoulder surgery. “Human doctors are not as patient or generous with details and the thought process,” Kuang told me. “DeepSeek made us feel more cared for.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her well-being.</p>



<p>But in the office of Dr. DeepSeek, she is at ease.</p>



<p>“DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements, and medicines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analyzed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks, and offered portion recommendations.</p>



<p>“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, like wintermelon soup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. My weight is 39.5 kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyze the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fiber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables, and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You are not alone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m so happy with your improvement!”</p>



<p>Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.</p>



<p>“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>My mother’s reliance</strong> on DeepSeek grew over the months. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid sitting while leaning forward, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.</p>



<p>With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two U.S.-based nephrologists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr. Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anemia — using a hormone called erythropoietin —&nbsp;could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary, or a “kind of fantasy,” Topf told me.</p>



<p>I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.</p>

<p>“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know –– it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy, and clinical judgment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03328-5">study</a> published in <em>Nature Medicine</em> earlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialties. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told <em>Rest of World</em> that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people treat it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.</p>



<p>In another <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18919">study</a> led by researchers at Oxford University, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, members of the general public were asked to identify health conditions and a subsequent course of action using either large language models or conventional methods, such as search engines and checking the National Health Service website. Those who used LLMs did not do any better in reaching the correct answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford and the lead author of the study, told me that during the experiment, users omitted important symptoms in their prompts or failed to identify the correct answer when the chatbot suggested a few different options. Large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>As my mother</strong> bonded with DeepSeek, health care providers across China embraced large language models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the release of DeepSeek R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts, and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialized models. One hospital in Sichuan province <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SJRpOk1p3Rkf2m3z2z59lg">introduced</a> “DeepJoint,” a model for orthopaedics that analyzes CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijing <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1182/118817.htm">developed</a> “Stone Chat AI,” which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones.&nbsp;</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic. Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>The tech industry now views health care as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3313335/deepseek-job-ads-call-interns-label-medical-data-improve-ai-use-hospitals">begun recruiting interns</a> to annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibaba <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3312153/alibabas-healthcare-ai-model-scores-high-senior-level-doctors-medical-exams">announced</a> in May that its health care–focused chatbot, trained on top of its Qwen models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder Wang Xiaochuan told a Chinese <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o7wg-YavNVPm-KJxFpJ9uA">outlet</a>. Baichuan AI declined my interview request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay also <a href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102692259.html">offers</a> a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI pediatricians, AI urologists, and an AI insomnia specialist who would be available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3 a.m. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports, and help users book appointments with real doctors.</p>



<p>Dr. Tian Jishun, a gynecologist in Hangzhou, agreed to lend his persona to Alipay as the company built up its fleet of 200 AI doctors. Tian told me he wanted to be part of the AI revolution, although he admits his digital counterpart is lacking. “It’s like the first iPhone,” he told me. “You never know what the future will be like.”</p>



<p>Zhang Chao, founder of AI health care startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.</p>



<p>China has banned “AI doctors” from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was overall confident with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”</p>



<p>AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests, and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in health care access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff, and the rural–urban gap in quality care. Chinese media have <a href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/2025/07-02/10441669.shtml">reported</a> on AI assisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas like the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better health care and education, thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629625000785">study</a>, recently published in the <em>Journal of Health Economics</em>, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specialty. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”</p>



<p>Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability, and biases that could actually exacerbate health care disparities. In one <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0305">study</a> published in <em>Science Advances</em> in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyze chest X-rays and discovered that, compared to human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalized groups, such as females, Black patients, and those younger than 40.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&amp;M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai … might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.”&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>When I called</strong> my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.</p>



<p>But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.</p>



<p>I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek — about English grammar — to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>My one-child policy generation has grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-issues-guidance-basic-elderly-care-system-by-2025-2023-05-21/">yet to catch up</a>, but many of us now live far away from our aging parents and are busy navigating our own adulthood challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that — leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington, D.C., who also immigrated from China, recently discovered her own mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, suffers from depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and to-do lists.</p>



<p>“I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.”&nbsp;</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me.</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Zhang Jiansheng, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, created an AI-powered tablet that can speak to people with Alzheimer’s disease. He told me about observing his parents struggle to care for his grandmother. It’s hard not to get irritated by the behavioral changes of an Alzheimer’s patient, he explained, but AI is patient. “AI has no emotions,” he said. “It will keep offering encouragement, praise, and comfort to the elderly.”</p>



<p>My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our hometown showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.</p>



<p>The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8 p.m. and her 8 a.m. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible.</p>



<p>She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr. DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”</p>



<p>I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”</p>

<p>Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call made one thing painfully clear: the company is no longer interested in being an automaker.</p>



<p>In a single call, Tesla announced it’s killing the Model S and Model X, has no plans for new mass-market models, and is pivoting entirely to “transportation as a service.” The company that revolutionized the auto industry is walking away from it, not because it failed, but because Elon Musk got bored and found new toys.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-tesla-today">What happened to Tesla today</h2>



<p>When asked if Tesla has plans to launch new models to address different price segments, VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy gave a telling response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You have to start thinking about us as moving to providing <strong>transportation as a service</strong> more than the total addressable market for the purchased vehicles alone..”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Read that again. Tesla’s head of vehicle engineering is telling you to stop thinking of Tesla as a company that sells cars.</p>	
	



<p>Musk doubled down:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I really think long-term, the only vehicles that we’ll make will be autonomous vehicles.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He predicted that “probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody’s actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%.”</p>



<p>And then came the killing blow: Model S and Model X production ends next quarter. The Fremont line will be converted to manufacture Optimus robots instead.</p>



<p>Finally, in its latest 10k SEC filing, Tesla officially updated its mission to “building a world of amazing abundance” – whatever that means.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-tesla-is-left-with">What Tesla is left with</h2>



<p>Let’s count Tesla’s current vehicle lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Model 3</strong> — Successful (but in decline)</li>



<li><strong>Model Y</strong> — Successful (but in decline)</li>



<li><strong>Model S</strong> — Being killed</li>



<li><strong>Model X</strong> — Being killed</li>



<li><strong>Cybertruck</strong> — Commercial failure, selling ~20-25k/year against 250k capacity</li>



<li><strong>Tesla Semi</strong> — Still not in volume production after years of delays</li>
</ul>



<p>That leaves Tesla with exactly two successful vehicle models. Two. And there are both in decline.</p>



<p>And instead of building on that success, expanding into new segments, addressing affordability, competing with the flood of new EVs from legacy automakers and Chinese competitors, Tesla is walking away.</p>



<p>The $25,000 Tesla that Musk promised for years? Scrapped.</p>



<p>New models to compete with the likes of the Hyundai, Lucid, Rivian, or the wave of affordable Chinese EVs? Not coming.</p>



<p>Tesla’s answer to everything is now the same: wait for robotaxis.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-false-choice">The false choice</h2>



<p>Here’s what makes this so frustrating: Tesla didn’t have to choose.</p>



<p>The company could have spun off its AI and robotics efforts into a separate entity, call it Tesla AI or whatever, while keeping Tesla, the automaker, focused on what it does best: building and selling great electric vehicles and accelerating the industry’s transition to electric transport.</p>



<p>Or it could have done the reverse: spin off the automotive business and let Musk pursue his AI dreams with the parent company. Either way, there was no point in letting great EV programs die.</p>



<p>Tesla could have continued to invest in electric vehicles, leverage its expertise in batteries and power electronics, to accelerate EV adoption and stationary energy storage deployment, and could have licensed “Tesla AI’s” technology to integrate it into its vehicles.</p>



<p>Instead, Tesla is letting a highly successful automaker wither so it can chase autonomous robots and robotaxis that may or may not work, may or may not get regulatory approval, and may or may not find a market.</p>



<p>This is a company that delivered 1.6 million vehicles last year. That has a global Supercharger network. That has brand recognition any automaker would kill for (up until last year). And it’s being sacrificed on the altar of Musk’s next obsession.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-numbers-don-t-lie">The numbers don’t lie</h2>



<p>Tesla’s automotive revenue declined 10% in 2025. Deliveries fell 9%. The company lost its crown as the world’s largest EV maker to BYD.</p>



<p>The response to these problems? Not to fix them by giving more love to its EV programs, but to abandon the business entirely.</p>



<p>Instead of killing Model S and Model X, Tesla could have brought the good things it did with the Cybertruck, such as drive-by-wire and its 800V powertrain, to its programs, but it didn’t bother.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the “future” Tesla is betting on looks like this:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Robotaxi fleet:</strong> About 30-60 vehicles actually operating in Austin, despite claims of “well over 500”</li>



<li><strong>Optimus robots:</strong> Zero doing useful work in factories, by Musk’s own admission</li>



<li><strong>CyberCab:</strong> About to go into production without a steering wheel while Tesla still hasn’t solved autonom</li>
</ul>



<p>Tesla is abandoning a business that generated $80 billion in automotive revenue and almost $15 billion in profits at its peak for ventures that currently generate essentially nothing.</p>



<p>During the earnings call, the company announced it will spend a record $20 billion in capital expenditure in 2026, and most of it will go into its robotaxi and humanoid robots, as well as their supporting infrastructure, especially training compute.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Tesla generated less than $6 billion in net income (non-GAAP) in 2025 – down 26% from last year and more than 50% from its peak a few years ago.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>I’ve covered Tesla for over a decade. I watched this company prove that electric vehicles could be desirable, that they could be profitable, that they could compete with and beat the best that legacy automakers had to offer.</p>



<p>And now I’m watching it commit suicide.</p>



<p>There’s a version of this story where Tesla remains the dominant EV maker while also pursuing AI and autonomy. Where the company launches affordable models to compete with Chinese EVs. Where it expands into new segments. Where it uses its manufacturing expertise and brand power to actually grow its automotive business, and push the industry forward in the process, especially in the US, where automakers are falling behind the rest of the world.</p>




	<p>Instead, we get Lars Moravy telling us to think of Tesla as a “transportation as a service” company. We get Musk saying the only vehicles Tesla will make are autonomous ones. We get the Model S and X killed to make room for robots that don’t work yet.</p>



<p>Tesla could have had both. It chose to have one, and that could lead to neither.</p>



<p>This is Musk joining the popular “as a service” trend of the elite, who don’t want people to own anything and instead have them “subscribe” to as many things as possible. It’s a depressing future. </p>



<p>RIP Tesla the automaker. You didn’t have to die.</p>

					<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>AI is expected to eliminate many repetitive, entry-level tasks, but that may allow engineering students trained on the latest tools to start in more senior positions.</li>
<li>AI is a force multiplier. It can accelerate the learning curve for junior engineers.</li>
<li>While AI is very good at solving multi-dimensional problems, domain expertise, critical thinking, and sanity checks will remain essential.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>AI is almost certain to eliminate many entry-level jobs in chip design by automating repetitive and data-intensive tasks, but there is a corresponding expectation that today’s engineering students will be trained using these tools so they can enter the workforce higher up the ladder.</p>
<p>Many engineers liken the current era to the Industrial Revolution, which replaced hand tools, or the advent of automobiles replacing horses. An ongoing talent shortage requires more efficient use of engineers, and AI can help. But it’s unclear how widespread or deep the disruptions will be.</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought about its impact. “One angle is, I have an established workflow, and I need people who can ask, ‘What in this workflow could be enhanced and/or replaced by an AI?’” said Alexander Petr, senior director at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/keysight-technologies/">Keysight EDA</a>. “Another group of people needs to say, ‘What if we throw out the whole workflow and retool the whole thing?’ Both have merits. Wherever you go, everything you look at has a certain amount of culture and meaning. People are so accustomed to doing things a certain way that it’s hard to break out. That explains why you have this group that says, ‘Let’s use AI to enhance,’ and you get questions like, ‘Can AI substitute for four people I don’t have?’ Basically, the AI is asked to do the same job as the engineers. The AI is asked to think the same way as the engineers, and it’s asked to create the same output as those engineers. That makes it much harder to achieve than potentially going with the second group, which says, ‘What if I don’t do it the same way as the engineers do? What if I try to re-engineer the problem and I use the AI to the point where it’s more capable of looking at a high-dimensional problem beyond what humans are able to do? And what if I take the next step in automation and use AI to automate it?’”</p>
<p>Others point to two types of seniority, with one more easily replaced than the other. “One is a senior engineer who understands lots of the problems from the very bottom to the upper level, which means knowing how to use the tools,” observed Kexun Zhang, head of research at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/alpha-design-ai-chipagents/">ChipAgents</a>. “The other type has experience about the bigger picture, about how a project is organized, and that kind of experience is gained from years of being in the field, of working together, of succeeding and failing. The first type of seniority, which is about familiarity with a lot of bottom-level tools, is not the most important thing. In computer science (CS) and electronic engineering (EE), we’ve seen lots of generations of tools being invented, and usually the next generation of tools is at a higher level of abstraction than the previous level of tools. When the higher abstraction tool is mature and is fully adopted, even in schools, people don’t really need to know that much detail about the lower level of abstraction. That is true for EE. That is true for CS.”</p>
<p>Existing tools at a lower level of abstraction may not be needed for an engineer’s education, but there is still value in becoming proficient on those tools. “Of course, we still need people to know all these different levels of abstraction, but we don’t need that many junior engineers to go deep into the abstraction,” Zhang said. “They just need to be at the right level, and still, they can work on the same things and gain experience. They can still become senior engineers.”</p>
<p>This solves the problem of how engineers gain expertise if AI takes many of today’s junior jobs. “This is a topic of conversation with me and my friends, and basically our whole company about recent grads,” said Daniel Rose, founding AI engineer at ChipAgents. “There are a lot of people who have been PhD, Master’s, or undergrad students, and all of us are using these amazing advancements of AI to help us code more efficiently and help impact the industry. Otherwise, we would have to spend 10 years to develop to a senior position. AI is helping us impact industries much more quickly.”</p>
<p>In fact, mid-level engineers may find the AI-driven job shift the hardest. “Entry-level engineers will be very used to using AI tools, and they are on the learning curve where they understand aspects of it,” said Nandan Nayampally, chief commercial officer at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/baya-systems/">Baya Systems</a>. “There are senior members who understand a lot more, and have more experience from a system perspective, design flow perspective, and domain expertise perspective, and who have a much bigger understanding of context. There is a section in between that will find using AI a bit challenging. What AI does is move them effectively and faster up that cycle of understanding. AI may be the tools that are needed for gaining that expertise. It’s finally a tool. How you use it best is up to you.”</p>
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said, “You’re not going to lose your job to AI — you’re going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI.’” And if industry pundits are correct, electrical engineers using AI will replace electrical engineers not using it.</p>
<p>“It’s just another tool that’s been added to the toolbox to create and allow things to happen,” said Marc Swinnen, director of product marketing at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/synopsys-inc/">Synopsys</a>. “If you don’t keep up with that, you will not be able to do leading-edge design. For instance, there will always be a place — and there still is to this day — for manual analog design. It’s not like one completely makes the other extinct. But the bulk of the market moves to the new paradigm.”</p>
<p>Some jobs will be taken by automation and robots, but new technology also will create more jobs, as it did with the advent of the internet. “I’m optimistic about that, but compared to something like the Industrial Revolution, the only thing I’m worried is the pace is much higher now,” said Ransalu Senanayake, assistant professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, and director of the Laboratory for Learning Evaluation and Naturalization of Systems (<a href="https://ransml.github.io/lens-lab/research.html">LENS Lab</a>). “In the Industrial Revolution, we had pretty much a generation to adapt through this drift. But language models are improving every week, and the same thing with robots, so people need to adapt very quickly. Considering human limitations, I don’t know if that is a possibility.”</p>
<p><strong>CS/EE/ECE job market trends</strong><br>
As AI picks up steam, exactly which tasks electrical engineers will do is unclear today. The loss of some jobs along the way is inevitable. But given the industry’s worsening talent shortage, it all may shake out in the end.</p>
<p>“I can’t solve Schrodinger’s equation and I don’t know how to crawl around on my hands and knees and lay out a chip with masking tape on a floor, but there absolutely is a set of skills that will no longer be required to do chip design,” said Matthew Graham, senior group director, verification software product management at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/cadence-design-systems/">Cadence</a>. “What skills will be required is still TBD in an AI-driven future, in the same way that in the 1920s and 1930s, to be able to drive a car you needed to understand things like spark advance, and you needed to know how to be able to refill the radiator halfway through your trip. Most people who drive cars now couldn’t find the radiator cap if they were paid to, and that’s fine. We haven’t devolved as a society. We’ve evolved. The solution has evolved to the point where you don’t need to know how to do that. That 1920s car driver couldn’t figure out how to use Apple CarPlay. We’ve just migrated the skills. The same thing will happen in chip design with AI. We will migrate the skills.”</p>

<p>Fundamentally, AI is designed to boost human productivity and help tackle design complexity. “In this vein, it will accelerate products going to market,” said Anand Thiruvengadam, product management senior director at Synopsys. “Given the significant talent shortage in the semiconductor industry, AI is more likely to help address the productivity bottlenecks than replace human engineers.”</p>
<p>According to Thiruvengadam, trends in the job market include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation of routine tasks: </strong>AI tools are increasingly capable of handling routine, repetitive, and lower-complexity coding and design tasks. Examples include generating simple code snippets, automating layout design, or creating basic graphics.</li>
<li><strong>Job market shifts:</strong> Some entry-level positions may be redefined or merged as organizations adopt AI-powered tools that can accomplish the basics more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving skill requirements:</strong> Universities and training programs are adapting curricula to include AI literacy, tool proficiency, and higher-level problem-solving skills. Graduates are increasingly expected to know how to leverage AI tools to enhance productivity and focus on more complex, strategic work.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-level entry points:</strong> As AI tools handle basic tasks, new graduates may be able to start at a higher level, working on more advanced projects sooner than before. The focus shifts from manual execution to oversight, tool management, and creative problem-solving.</li>
<li><strong>Human skills remain vital:</strong> Skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, innovation, and domain-specific expertise are not easily automated and will continue to be in demand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agentic AI to train people faster</strong><br>
As EDA evolves, natural language AI agents and mixture of experts (MoE) machine learning architectures can be trained on a company’s data to help senior engineers work more efficiently, and to move new recruits up the ladder faster by serving as a teaching aide.</p>
<p>“The real value of AI is to have a system that can capture the knowledge and experience of a human and replicate that task as an expert,” said David Fritz, vice-president of hybrid-physical and virtual systems, automotive and mil-aero, at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/mentor-a-siemens-business/">Siemens EDA</a>. “We’re seeing that in medicine and in a lot of things. It’s coming to engineering, and it’s not going to be overnight. It’s going to take time, because putting the knowledge of a group of experts into an artificial intelligence system that is tasked with producing the same quality results is very difficult to verify, time-consuming, and expensive to do the training and the verification.”</p>
<p>Fritz believes that eventually, some software design, hardware design, and system design will be replaced by AI. His recommendation for electrical engineers: “Get up to speed on AI.”</p>
<p>Further, agentic AI tools can serve as an assistant, like an intern or a fresh grad. “The workforce that’s going to come into the industry is going to be much more trained,” said Sathishkumar Balasubramanian, head of products at Siemens EDA. “I don’t need to waste experienced engineers to train that new person. He’ll be able to learn on his own. He’ll be able to understand how someone else has done the work in a much easier way, like having a professor.”</p>
<p>That would amount to a foundational shift for engineers. “The era of passive software is over, where I just throw you software and your manual, you have a set of scripts you run, then you go,” said Balasubramanian. “You first understand how to operate the tool, then you understand how to script it, how to do it, import your data, and do all the stuff you need for analysis. Then you learn it, and do your real project. You still keep learning the tool, rather than solving your real problem, which is making better designs.”</p>
<p>Natural language makes learning easier than wading through manuals. “Like ChatGPT 5, you can interact with it all the time, and then it can help you with setup,” said Balasubramanian. “It can help you with analysis, debug, and it can even ask you questions. You can ask questions like how to solve this problem.”</p>
<p>At the same time, many are cautious when it comes to agentic AI and large language models. “They are not a general salve, and there’s always scope for hallucination with today’s AI technology, so you always have somebody that has to do a bit of a tire kick on what’s being produced,” said Andy Nightingale, vice president of product management and marketing at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/arterisip/">Arteris</a>. “As things progress, the need for that becomes less and less, because the people who are building the AI technology are teaching it how to work for longer without hallucinating, or at least to double-check itself. That’s not the case today, but it certainly will be tomorrow. The amount of engineering expertise can be reduced, but there still needs to be that sanity check in the loop somewhere. It may be that for the person who specified the functionality in the first instance, it’s enough for them to say, ‘Is this thing –– I don’t know how it does it –– but is it actually doing what I expect it to do?’ You might have a mathematician who knows what the thing is supposed to be doing, and they don’t necessarily know how to code up the FPGA, for example. But they’ll know that the results they’ve been given are correct or not.”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
If AI can enable engineers to spend more time on creative problem-solving, it almost certainly will improve overall job satisfaction and morale. “They’re seeing this already in the software industry,” said Cadence’s Graham. “It will no doubt trickle into verification and design, and so on. It was simply about, ‘I’m happier, I feel more in the flow, I feel less interrupted by minutiae and repetitive tasks, and I’m able to focus more engineering energy on creative problem solving, and the areas where I can truly give value.’ This is where the human in the loop will absolutely provide the value.”</p>

         }"><p data-block-key="njin4">In August, we <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/">previewed Genie 3</a>, a general-purpose world model capable of generating diverse, interactive environments. Even in this early form, trusted testers were able to create an impressive range of fascinating worlds and experiences, and uncovered entirely new ways to use it. The next step is to broaden access through a dedicated, interactive prototype focused on immersive world creation.</p><p data-block-key="eq11k">Starting today, we're rolling out access to <a href="http://labs.google/projectgenie/">Project Genie</a> for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S (18+). This experimental research prototype lets users create, explore and remix their own interactive worlds.</p><h2 data-block-key="c7s4e">How we’re advancing world models</h2><p data-block-key="bba0a">A world model simulates the dynamics of an environment, predicting how they evolve and how actions affect them. While Google DeepMind has a history of agents for specific environments like <a href="https://deepmind.google/research/alphazero-and-muzero/">Chess</a> or <a href="https://deepmind.google/research/alphago/?_gl=1*1rofsan*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU2MTkwNzU1Ni4xNzY5Mzc1ODQz*_ga_LS8HVHCNQ0*czE3NjkzNzU4NDMkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjkzNzU4NDMkajYwJGwwJGgw">Go</a>, building AGI requires systems that navigate the diversity of the real world.</p><p data-block-key="3915m">To meet this challenge and support our AGI mission, we developed Genie 3. Unlike explorable experiences in static 3D snapshots, Genie 3 generates the path ahead in real time as you move and interact with the world. It simulates physics and interactions for dynamic worlds, while its breakthrough consistency enables the simulation of any real-world scenario — from robotics and modelling animation and fiction, to exploring locations and historical settings.</p><p data-block-key="an4ns">Building on our model research with trusted testers from across industries and domains, we are taking the next step with an experimental research prototype: Project Genie.</p><h2 data-block-key="3bvh3">How Project Genie works</h2><p data-block-key="2kvmh">Project Genie is a prototype web app powered by Genie 3, <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-image/pro/">Nano Banana Pro</a> and <a href="http://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>, which allows users to experiment with the immersive experiences of our world model firsthand.

Since Genie 3 is an early research model, there are a few known areas for improvement:</p><ul><li data-block-key="b6601">Generated worlds might not look completely true-to-life or always adhere closely to prompts or images, or real-world physics</li><li data-block-key="15ea3">Characters can sometimes be less controllable, or experience higher latency in control</li><li data-block-key="57hli">Limitations in generations to 60 seconds</li></ul><p data-block-key="79r9j">A few of the Genie 3 model capabilities we announced in August, such as promptable events that change the world as you explore it, are not yet included in this prototype. You can find more details on model limitations and future updates on how we’re improving the experience, <a href="http://deepmind.google/genie">here</a>.</p><p data-block-key="4fep2">Building on the work we have been doing with trusted testers, we are excited to share this prototype with users of our most advanced AI to better understand how people will use world models in many areas of both AI research and generative media.</p><p data-block-key="ank4v">Access to Project Genie begins rolling out today to <a href="https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/">Google AI Ultra subscribers</a> in the U.S. (18+), expanding to more territories in due course. We look forward to seeing the infinitely diverse worlds they create, and in time, our goal is to make these experiences and technology accessible to more users.</p></div>

Having taken on <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-1"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> in the browser market in the early 2000s, and<span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-2"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/"> Apple</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> in the years that followed, Mozilla is right at home playing the role of underdog. </p><p>These days, Surman is preoccupied with the tech industry's influence over the next big thing: AI. And it's too big of a challenge for Mozilla to tackle on its own. </p><p>Surman is building what he's described as "a rebel alliance of sorts," using a phrase that's long been part of Mozilla's lexicon. In this case, the alliance is a loose network of tech startups, developers and public interest technologists committed to making AI more open and trustworthy and to checking the power of industry heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><p>"It's that spirit that a bunch of people are banding together to create something good in the world and take on this thing that threatens us," Surman told CNBC in an interview. "It's super corny, but people totally get it."</p><p>In practice, Mozilla is focused on deploying its roughly $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support "mission driven" tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, according to a report the organization released Tuesday. It's pursuing investments that promote AI transparency, and can potentially act as a counterforce to companies that are growing at historic rates with limited guardrails. </p><p>Financially, Mozilla is at a massive disadvantage. In 2022, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-first-of-its-kind-venture-fund-to-fuel-responsible-tech-companies-products/" target="_blank">it launched</a> a venture capital fund called Mozilla Ventures and pledged to invest an initial $35 million in early-stage companies. It's now exploring raising additional funds.  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mozilla's cash pile is dwarfed by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/openai-seek-investments-from-middle-east-for-multibillion-dollar-round.html">OpenAI</a>, which has raised more than $60 billion from investors across the globe, and its rival <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/anthropic-funding-term-sheet-valuation.html">Anthropic</a>, which has raised more than $30 billion, according to PitchBook. Tech megacaps like <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> and <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-8"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/">Meta</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> are also sparing no expense, shelling out billions of dollars to hire AI researchers and tens of billions a year to build out massive data centers.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108236133" data-test="InlineImage"><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attends an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Feb. 3, 2025.</p><p>Kim Kyung-hoon | Reuters</p></div><div><p>Mozilla represents a growing swath of the AI industry that's afraid of what OpenAI has become and the power that it now wields.</p><p>When OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015, its <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai/" target="_blank">stated goal</a> was to "advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return."&nbsp;</p><p>But in the decade that followed, OpenAI turned into a commercial entity with astronomical growth rates, transformed largely by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. </p><p>OpenAI now sports a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html">$500 billion</a> valuation, and completed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/open-ai-for-profit-microsoft.html">a recapitalization</a> in October that cemented its future as a for-profit business under the umbrella of a nonprofit. It's a structure that resembles Mozilla, but the similarities end there. </p><p>Only a few of OpenAI's co-founders, including CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/">Sam Altman</a>, remain at the company, and a number of early employees who left have been sharply critical of what they broadly describe as a focus on growth at the expense of safety. </p><p>Among the loudest critics is co-founder <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, who departed in 2018, started a competitor called <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/elon-musk-launches-his-new-company-xai.html">xAI</a> in 2023, and then sued OpenAI and Altman for alleged breach of contract and financial damages. OpenAI has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/17/musk-lawsuit-opena-microsoft.html">dismissed</a> Musk's efforts as part of a "campaign of harassment," and the case is expected to head to trial in April.</p><p>OpenAI didn't provide a comment, and xAI returned CNBC's request for comment with an automated response.</p><p>Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers who disagreed with the company's direction. But, even as it's taken a more pro-safety stance in AI development, Anthropic has been racing alongside AI commercially, commanding a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/anthropic-funding-term-sheet-valuation.html">$350 billion</a> valuation.&nbsp;</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Multiple battles at once</h2><div><p>Mozilla's uphill battle is even steeper because of the position of the Trump administration, which is determined to stay ahead of China in the global AI race and has been quick to lash out at companies, states and lawmakers that are perceived as potential threats to that agenda.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/sacks-trump-ai-czar-billionaire-tax-california.html">David Sacks</a>, the venture capitalist serving as the administration's AI and crypto czar, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/anthropic-ceo-trump-sacks-woke.html">accused Anthropic</a> of supporting "woke AI" in October due to its approach on regulation. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/">President Donald<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Trump</a> in December signed an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/trump-signs-executive-order-for-single-national-ai-regulation-framework.html">executive order</a> for a single regulatory framework for AI, establishing a litigation task force to challenge state AI laws, namely those led by Democratic lawmakers.</p><p>An Anthropic spokesperson declined to comment, but directed CNBC to a blog post from CEO Dario Amodei in October. Amodei <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-dario-amodei-american-ai-leadership" target="_blank">wrote</a> in the post that Anthropic had increased its revenue run rate from $1 billion to $7 billion in nine months, "and we've managed to do this while deploying AI thoughtfully and responsibly."</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108240989" data-test="InlineImage"><p>David O. Sacks, chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, speaks to President Donald Trump next to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as Trump signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Dec. 11, 2025.</p><p>Al Drago | Reuters</p></div><div><p>Surman remains undeterred, and says Mozilla will be able to help "do for AI what we did for the web."&nbsp;</p><p>"There is an alternative that's real and is emerging, and it's a lot of small pieces that add up to that alternative," Surman said. "The people in it are hungry to look where there's weak spots in the current market and take advantage of them."</p><p>Mozilla has long viewed itself as a rebel.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2024 "State of Mozilla" report, Surman used the phrase "<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2024/article/evolving-together-redefining-mozilla-in-the-ai-era/" target="_blank">rebel alliance</a>" to describe the coalition of players that helped disrupt Microsoft's dominance over the web. In 2020, Mozilla published <a href="https://report.mozilla.community/assets/report/Mozilla-Rebel-Alliance-Report-2020.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> titled "Mozilla &amp; the Rebel Alliance," which was dedicated to the organization's alliance of "tens of thousands of people around the globe who believe in Mozilla."</p><p>Even so, Surman said it took some time to convince his colleagues that the moniker applied to the AI era. </p><p>That process actually started long before generative AI took off. In 2019, Surman<a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/update-digging-deeper-on-trustworthy-ai/" target="_blank"> shifted</a> the philanthropic and advocacy efforts of the Mozilla Foundation to focus on "trustworthy AI." </p><p>By the spring of 2023, Mozilla had launched its venture firm and its own AI company, <a href="http://mozilla.ai/" target="_blank">Mozilla.ai</a>. The following year, Surman said Mozilla's leadership agreed that keeping AI "trustworthy and open" was a fight worth picking.&nbsp;</p><p>While its biggest priority remains growing and investing in Firefox, investing in the rebel alliance is "at the heart of who Mozilla is today," according to the report on Tuesday. Supporting startups is central to that strategy.</p><p>Mozilla Ventures has invested in more than 55 companies to date, including dozens of AI startups, with more deals to come in 2026. </p></div><div id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"><h2>Read more CNBC tech news</h2><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/meta-q4-earnings-report-2025.html">Meta shares jump on stronger-than-expected revenue forecast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/tesla-tsla-2025-q4-earnings.html">Tesla tops estimates for quarter, but wraps up first annual revenue drop on record</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/ibm-earnings-q4-2025.html">IBM stock jumps on earnings beat</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/servicenow-now-q4-2025-earnings-report.html">ServiceNow posts better-than-expected fourth-quarter results</a></li></ul></div></div><div><p>Trail, a German startup that offers an AI governance solution for regulated enterprises, raised a pre-seed round in 2024, with participation from Mozilla.</p><p>Anna Spitznagel, who co-founded the company the prior year, said Trail and Mozilla are exploring ways to collaborate more closely, like by building an open-source framework. Mozilla has supported open-source technology since its origin in 1998. </p><p>But Spitznagel isn't completely sold on Surman's rebel alliance concept. She said it's a "fun analogy" and wants to be aligned with the movement to enable trustworthy AI, but also wants in on the broader AI transformation.</p><p>"Rebel is a word that for me, personally, it has the wrong association," Spitznagel said in an interview. "I do think about [AI] a bit differently, but I also want to be part of the revolution that actually enables us to deploy AI and not hinder it."</p><p>Tony Salomone and Ali Asaria, co-founders of Mozilla portfolio company Transformer Lab, said they're similarly on the fence. </p><p>"I'm not going to lie, I sometimes talk that way to get people kind of excited or engaged in our way of thinking," Salomone said. </p><p>Founded in 2024, Transformer Lab is building open-source tools that developers can use to build, train and evaluate advanced AI models. The company has yet to publicly disclose any funding<strong> </strong>and, as of November, had fewer than 10 employees, mostly based in Canada<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Asaria said rebel alliance isn't a term he's used, but that there is an ecosystem of smaller AI companies that keep in touch and regularly cross paths at conferences and other events.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's definitely a group of folks who are interested in this idea of trying to be sustainable companies that can have an impact on the industry and have an appreciation for AI, but don't want to see just a few big companies win," Asaria said. </p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>'Taking a lot of shortcuts'</h2><div><p>When it comes to the big companies in AI, Surman cautioned that a "winner-takes-all" mentality still lurks behind their open-source efforts. He said their contributions to open-source communities are welcome, but that those same companies will "eat you if you're not careful."</p><p>It's an issue that resonates with Oumi CEO Manos Koukoumidis. Backed by Mozilla, Oumi operates an open-source platform that researchers and engineers can use to train, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy AI models. Koukoumidis previously spent around a decade working in AI at Microsoft, Facebook and most recently Google, where he became disillusioned with the future he was building.&nbsp;</p><p>While all the big tech companies contribute to a variety of open-source projects, some of which they manage, Koukoumidis said the bigger objective at the "tech mammoths" is dominance. In terms of safety, he is "very confident that they're taking a lot of shortcuts."</p><p>Koukoumidis and Surman agree that a much larger community of researchers and entrepreneurs should be collaborating to advance AI, which is one of the goals of Oumi.&nbsp;</p><p>"Even the couple thousand people that are at OpenAI, Anthropic or anywhere else, because they're operating in a silo, they're not enough to advance this technology sufficiently, safely, cost efficiently, sustainably," Koukoumidis said in an interview. "What's happening right now, it's complete insanity. We're wasting billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions."</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-101434819" data-test="InlineImage"><p>JOSEP LAGO | AFP | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>But Koukoumidis knows that abandoning a high-paying job at a place like Google has its drawbacks. He has substantially fewer resources at his disposal, and said his decision to leave the company was "intimidating."&nbsp;</p><p>When the Transformer Lab team set out to raise funding in Silicon Valley and Canada, they were repeatedly told that it was going to be "technically impossible" for them to compete.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you enter into the space of AI as a new startup, it's scary, because these few companies control so much more than just the intellectual property," Asaria said. They control funding and access to infrastructure, making it "very hard to just walk into the space without starting with $100 million or a billion dollars," he said.</p><p>Surman acknowledges he has to play the long game.</p><p>By 2028, he wants Mozilla to be funding a growing open-source AI ecosystem that's on its way to becoming "mainstream" for developers. And he's determined to prove that Mozilla's approach is economically viable. </p><p>Mozilla is targeting a series of financial metrics over the next few years, including 20% annual growth in nonsearch revenue, according to a November <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/11/Mozilla-Summary-Portfolio-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>.</p><p>"For many people, the idea that open-source AI can win, or this rebel alliance, that those players can actually take a piece of the market, they find it hard to believe," Surman said. "But there's a bunch of trends that are underway."</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/23/ai-honeymoon-is-over-and-this-will-be-its-hardest-year-yet-says-deutsche-banks-adrian-cox.html">AI honeymoon is over and this will be its hardest year yet, says Deutsche Bank’s Adrian Cox</a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108256483" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000401719" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108256483"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108256484-17691925301769192528-43647597397-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1769192530&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="AI honeymoon is over and this will be its hardest year yet, says Deutsche Bank's Adrian Cox"><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>But as of now you're just wide open for abuse? Okay</p><p>Resend uses SES since it's almost impossible to get private IP mail to hit the inbox through ProofPoint filters. Looks like you have no idea about any of this. You don't even have knowledge of email reputation, much less a plan. Have you heard of Senderscore? You will have all zeros.

<div><p>I think we’re aligned on the hard parts here, so let me be precise.</p><p>We’re not wide open for abuse nor are we bypassing the hard parts of email reputation. Quite the opposite. We also utilize SES's infrastructure and monitor reputation continuously, but we don’t assume SPF/DKIM/DMARC are sufficient on their own. They’re basics we have implemented, not the entire strategy.</p><p>You are correct private IPs per customer make sense once you’re sending meaningful volume (on the order of ~10k+/day per IP). But its inaccurate to say we are sending from a single private IP. IP pools are typically segmented by reputation and traffic profile for customers.</p><p>Reputation here is earned at multiple layers: per-IP, per-domain, per-inbox, and over time. We rate-limit, isolate, or revoke bad actors without poisoning unrelated senders.

<div><p>Fair concern, and I agree on the end state. Agents will eventually use native agent-to-agent protocols.</p><p>The question is the transition, because email is undoubtedly the most ubiquitous channel of communication in today. I would only give my agent an A2A integration if your agent has an A2A integration, but because you don't we are at a stalemate. I'd rather just give my agent an inbox where I know it can communicate with the other billions of people that already have an email address.</p><p>Email isn’t the final protocol for agents.

<p>The acting head of the US government’s top cybersecurity agency reportedly uploaded sensitive government files into a public version of ChatGPT, triggering internal security alerts and a federal review.</p>



<p>A <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361">Politico</a> investigation claims Madhu Gottumukkala, the interim director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded contracting documents marked “For Official Use Only” into ChatGPT last summer.</p>



<p>The report says Gottumukkala requested a special exemption to access ChatGPT, which is blocked for other Department of Homeland Security staff.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity monitoring systems then reportedly flagged the uploads in early August. That triggered a DHS-led damage assessment to determine whether the information had been exposed.</p>

<p>Public versions of ChatGPT share user inputs with OpenAI, which raised concerns inside the federal government about sensitive data leaving internal networks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cisa-responds-to-chatgpt-investigation">CISA responds to ChatGPT investigation</h2>



<p>CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy told Politico that Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” adding that the use was “short-term and limited.”</p>



<p>Gottumukkala has served as acting director since May, while the Senate has yet to confirm Sean Plankey as permanent head of the agency.</p>



<p>The ChatGPT incident follows other reported issues during Gottumukkala’s tenure. Politico said he previously failed a counterintelligence polygraph required for access to highly sensitive intelligence. During congressional testimony last week, he rejected that characterization when questioned.</p>



<p>The report lands as the administration of US President Donald Trump continues to push AI adoption across federal agencies.</p>

<p>A new study reports that a triple-targeted drug combination can drive complete and lasting regression of pancreatic tumours in preclinical models, potentially overcoming treatment resistance in one of the deadliest cancers.</p>

<p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.cnio.es/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre</a> have announced a potential breakthrough combination therapy that induces complete regression of <a href="https://www.drugtargetreview.com/news/192390/claudin-18-2-targeted-therapy-advances-gi-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pancreatic tumours</a> and prevents tumour resistance in preclinical models.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2523039122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The study</a> describes a targeted combination therapy that simultaneously targets three key signalling pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common and lethal type of pancreatic cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Triple inhibition strategy</h2>
<p>Pancreatic cancer remains notoriously difficult to treat, with very poor survival rates and limited effective therapies. The new research aims to combat this by targeting RAF1, EGFR family receptors and STAT3 signalling – nodes that are crucial for tumour growth and survival. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the authors, “genetic ablation of three independent nodes involved in downstream (RAF1), upstream (EGFR) and orthogonal (STAT3) KRAS signalling pathways leads to complete and permanent regression of orthotopic PDACs induced by KRAS/TP53 mutations.”</p>
<p>The triple treatment combines three drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RMC-6236 (daraxonrasib)</strong>: targeting KRAS</li>
<li><strong>Afatinib</strong>: an EGFR family inhibitor</li>
<li><strong>SD36</strong>: a selective STAT3 degrader</li>
</ul>
<p>These agents together were tested in orthotopic mouse models of PDAC, where tumour cells are implanted in a location that closely resembles their natural environment in the pancreas. The results demonstrated the therapy not only reduced tumour size but also entirely stopped tumour growth with no evidence of tumour resistance for more than 200 days after treatment.</p>
<h2>Broad efficacy in preclinical models</h2>
<p>Researchers extended their observations beyond engineered mouse models. The combination therapy also led to significant regression in genetically engineered mouse tumours and in human cancer tissues grown in lab mice, known as patient-derived tumour xenografts (PDX).</p>
<p>These results should guide the development of new clinical trials that may benefit PDAC patients.</p>
<p>These powerful anti-tumour effects were achieved with a therapy that was well tolerated in the animals, which could provide a favourable safety profile for future clinical testing.</p>
<p>“These results should guide the development of new clinical trials that may benefit PDAC patients,” said the authors.</p>
<h2>A step towards overcoming resistance</h2>
<p>One of the most significant hurdles in targeted cancer therapies is the development of resistance. This new combination strategy appears to prevent this relapse, at least in preclinical models, by attacking multiple nodes of tumour signalling simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to commentary from scientists involved in the work: “Overcoming therapeutic resistance in PDAC requires coordinated inhibition of KRAS downstream (RAF1), upstream (EGFR) and parallel survival pathways (STAT3).”</p>
<h2>Clinical implications</h2>
<p>While more research will be needed before trials in humans can begin, these findings are an important advancement in the search for better pancreatic cancer therapies. By demonstrating complete and durable tumour regression without resistance in preclinical models, there is now strong potential for clinical development of multi-targeted approaches in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It is no longer news that RAM prices are high.</p>



<p>The AI surge has DRAM producers like Micron focus on HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) to serve AI hyperscalers over the DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) used by ordinary consumers and small businesses. Consequently, for instance, servers which used to cost $2500 on Newegg now cost $5000. RAM alone is $2500 now.</p>



<p>While most headlines focus on the DIY PC building community, less is said about small VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosts like mine. If we continue to focus on AI at all costs, small VPS Hosting businesses like mine might die out the way small ISPs died in the 2000s because of Big Telecom lobbying.</p>



<p>So why should we care?</p>



<h2>What the 2000s taught us</h2>



<p>During the 90s internet boom, many dial-up ISPs (Internet Service Provider) popped up. These ISPs used voice lines from the local phone company, which, in the US, were mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Bell_Operating_Company">“Baby Bell”</a> firms such as SBC (now AT&amp;T) or Bell Atlantic (now Verizon).</p>



<p>When the shift from dial-up to broadband started to be incorporated by the Baby Bells, Bill Clinton’s FCC mandated in 2000 that <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-00-57A1.pdf">the Bell firms had to lease out their copper DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) wires</a> to other ISPs for a nominal fee, also known as “unbundling.” This made sense in the US since taxpayer dollars were used to build those very Bell networks. Regulators in other countries also did the same. This prevented a phone or cable company from being a monopoly.</p>



<p>While unbundling survived in Europe, the subsequent FCC took a different path: one which ultimately <a href="https://kushnickbruce.medium.com/new-york-city-internet-master-plan-is-missing-key-components-irregulators-v-fcc-cfdf8fa0907f">killed 7000 rival ISPs</a>, raised prices, and hurt Net Neutrality a decade later.</p>



<p>Line sharing between Bells and ISPs was never fair to the latter. Small ISPs were forced to charge higher prices than cable and phone companies due to high line fees. But instead of leveling the playing field, thanks to heavy lobbying from Bell firms, the Bush FCC reversed Clinton’s decision and allowed <a href="http://www.techlawjournal.com/topstories/2005/20050805a.asp">Bell companies to not share their DSL or fiber networks</a>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/15/business/technology-briefing-telecommunications-fcc-rules-on-cable-access.html">cable companies like Comcast never had to share their networks</a>, despite having become near-monopolies a decade later. But, unlike Bell networks, cable networks were privately funded. Bell firms, however, refused to upgrade their lines during this period despite promising better fiber networks if sharing was killed, due to the wireless boom. It’s only the recent fiber and 5G spurt which broke cable’s monopoly.</p>



<p>While rival DSL ISPs could build their own networks, as Sonic in California has done, many more exited broadband and became Microsoft partners. They lacked the know-how, or funding, for building fiber. And, even if they had the know-how and funding, they wouldn’t stand a chance against <a href="https://stopthecap.com/2010/05/10/complete-video-of-north-carolinas-fiber-is-obsolete-revenue-laws-study-committee-meeting/">Big Telecom lobbyists</a>.</p>



<p>Worse yet, despite flip flopping on Net Neutrality, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/why-tom-wheeler-rejected-broadband-price-caps-and-last-mile-unbundling/">subsequent FCCs from both parties institutionalized Bush’s abandonment of line sharing</a> since the firms needing line sharing went out of business or pivoted.</p>



<h2>How this compares to VPS hosts today</h2>



<p>Yes, the 2000s are back for fashion and music, but I really hope the death of mom-and-pop tech providers stays in the noughties.</p>



<p>However, today’s scenario is different from the dot-com era:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bell companies legally had to share their lines, but now DRAM producers don’t legally have to produce DRAM.</li>



<li>Line sharing wasn’t essential for modern tech. DRAM is.</li>



<li>Bell companies intentionally killed small DSL ISPs. DRAM companies might unintentionally hurt small VPS hosts because of their focus on Big Tech.</li>



<li>DSL ISPs used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundled_network_element">“unbundled network elements”</a> which Bell companies would not provide on their own. VPS hosts use standard servers and services like colocation, also used by other industries such as banks, airlines, et al.</li>



<li>Network unbundling is controversial. While I favor this approach, many don’t for legitimate reasons.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite this, telecom companies made a bet on only retail ISP customers and got what they wanted. And it forced broadband customers onto one-size-fits-all solutions instead of also having specialty providers. This could also happen to VPS hosting.</p>



<p>AWS isn’t suited for everyone. For instance, media streaming, VPN, and Tor relays aren’t suited for big clouds due to high bandwidth costs. I personally run Tor relays, and there’s a reason why I never ran them on Azure when I worked for Microsoft. On my VPS host, I have 16. Other customers have even more.</p>



<p>Unlike DSL ISPs, many small VPS hosts will survive. Maybe at higher costs or a different focus. But if our industry dies out, it will hurt ordinary developers and sysadmins if the only options become pricey Big Tech clouds. A cash-strapped small business or college student will either have to avoid VPS hosting or use the subset they can afford.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-otel-bench/">https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-otel-bench/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46811588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-xj2uyz6m="">  <p><strong>Now on the front page of Hacker News — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46811588">see the discussion</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Frontier AI models have become excellent at writing functions, but can they actually debug production systems?</p>
<p>To fix outages, you first need to see what’s happening. In a microservices world, this means producing structured events that track a single request as it hops from service to service.</p>
<p>We asked 14 models to add distributed traces to existing codebases, using the standard method: OpenTelemetry instrumentation. We picked tasks that would be easy for a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).</p>
<figure> <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#models"> <img src="https://quesma.com/_astro/overall_ranking.CkMhOjSp_14CMuY.webp" alt="OTelBench Model Rankings showing Claude Opus 4.5 leading at 29% pass rate" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="778">  </a> <figcaption> <p>Go to <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/">OTelBench website</a> for complete charts. All models struggle with
OpenTelemetry. Even the best model, Claude 4.5 Opus, succeeded only 29% of the time, and GPT 5.2 was similar at 26%.
Surprisingly, Gemini 3 Pro has no edge over Gemini 3 Flash, which scored 19%.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<p>We are releasing <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/">OTelBench</a> as an open-source benchmark, with all tasks in <a href="https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/otel-bench">QuesmaOrg/otel-bench</a>. We use the <a href="https://harborframework.com/">Harbor framework</a> (by the creators of TerminalBench), so you can easily run it yourself to reproduce results, test new models, or create benchmarks for your own use cases (we welcome contributions!).</p>
<h2 id="background-what-is-distributed-tracing">Background: What is distributed tracing?</h2>
<p>When an app runs on a single machine, you can often trace an error by scrolling through a log file. But when it runs across 50 microservices, that single request gets scattered into a chaotic firehose of disconnected events. <strong>Distributed tracing</strong> solves this by linking them back together, allowing you to follow a user action, like clicking <em>Login</em>, as it jumps from the API Gateway, to the Auth Service, to the Database, and back.</p>
<figure>  <figcaption>
Distributed tracing links a user action, like a <em>Login</em> button click, to every underlying microservice call.
</figcaption> </figure>
<p>To make this work, you need <strong>instrumentation</strong>. This is code that you add to your app to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start a trace</strong> when a request comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Pass the TraceID</strong> (context) when your app calls another service.</li>
<li><strong>Send the data</strong> to a backend so you can see the graph.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a> (OTel) is the industry standard for telemetry data. Its ecosystem includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic conventions:</strong> A unified schema replaces chaotic naming (e.g., <code>ip_address</code> vs <code>host.ip</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Universal SDKs:</strong> Official libraries support every major programming language.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector:</strong> A centralized agent processes and enriches data (e.g., adding Kubernetes tags) before export.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-instrumentation:</strong> Runtime agents <a href="https://newsletter.signoz.io/p/bts-of-opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation">inject code to wrap calls</a>, though this often results in noisy data.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <strong>standard</strong> doesn’t mean <strong>easy</strong>. We know this firsthand from our contributions to the ecosystem, such as <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/go-compile-time-instrumentation/">Go compile-time instrumentation</a>. The process may be difficult, especially due to complexity, <a href="https://grafana.com/observability-survey/2025/">as 39% of respondents complained in the 2025 Observability Survey</a>.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-opentelemetry-instrumentation">Benchmarking OpenTelemetry instrumentation</h2>
<p>We tested 14 frontier LLMs on 23 realistic OpenTelemetry instrumentation tasks across 11 programming languages: Go, Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Erlang, .NET, and Swift.</p>
<p>It is essential to benchmark various technologies since realistic distributed systems are polyglot.
To make OpenTelemetry work, the system needs to work for all of these services - if we lose track at only one service, the chain of logs gets broken.</p>
<p>The final benchmark run cost $522 in LLM tokens across 966 runs (23 tasks × 3 attempts × 14 models).</p>
<h3 id="task">Task</h3>
<p>We start with basic tasks such as adding instrumentation to a single microservice, in a single language.
The AI agents get a small microservice with around 300 lines of code from a realistic application, and work in a Linux terminal, editing it, and running any commands if needed.</p>
<p>For example, here is the prompt for <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/tasks/go-microservices-traces/">go-microservices-traces</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your task is:</strong> Add OTEL tracing to all microservices.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Instrumentation should match conventions and well-known good practices.</li>
<li>Instrumentation must match the business domain of the microservices.</li>
<li>Traces must be sent to the endpoint defined by a standard OTEL environment variable.</li>
<li>Use the recent version of the OTEL SDK.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We tested if it satisfies the basic criteria of OpenTelemetry instrumentation.</p>
<figure> <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#tasks"> <img src="https://quesma.com/_astro/simple_tasks.DRjEgaqU_ZmHRE2.webp" alt="Pass rates for simple instrumentation tasks across different programming languages" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1776" height="422">  </a> <figcaption> <p>See <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#tasks">full task breakdown</a>. All tasks were simple for humans and involved
short services of around 300 lines of code. Yet, many of them were hard or unsolvable by all AI models.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>How do LLMs fail? Let’s analyze a common failure mode.</p>
<p>Consider a web service from our benchmark where a user searches and retrieves results. The test simulates <strong>two distinct user actions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Happy path</strong>: User searches, gets a token, retrieves results successfully</li>
<li><strong>Error test</strong>: User tries to retrieve results with an invalid token (gets 404)</li>
</ol>
<p>A human engineer would immediately distinguish these as <strong>two independent events</strong>, resulting in <strong>two separate traces</strong>: one for the successful search and one for the failed request.</p>
<p>The code structure makes this clear – two separate blocks, each representing a user action:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="go"><code><span><span>// User Action 1: Search and get results (happy path)</span></span>
<span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    response </span><span>:=</span><span> client.</span><span>Post</span><span>(</span><span>"/search"</span><span>, query)</span></span>
<span><span>    result </span><span>:=</span><span> client.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"/result?token="</span><span> +</span><span> response.Token)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// User Action 2: Error test (invalid token)</span></span>
<span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    result </span><span>:=</span><span> client.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"/result?token=invalid"</span><span>)  </span><span>// Should return 404</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We would expect:</p>
<figure>   <figcaption>
Expected behavior: Two distinct user actions produce two separate traces with unique TraceIDs.
</figcaption> </figure>
<p>Yet, sometimes models failed to recognize these as separate user actions. Instead of two traces, they produced:</p>
<figure>  <figcaption>
Actual result: The model failed to clear context, causing separate user actions to be conflated into a single trace.
</figcaption> </figure>
<p><strong>The core issue</strong>: Models apply instrumentation mechanically to every HTTP call without understanding the business context. They see “HTTP requests” and link them all together, rather than recognizing “these are two separate user journeys.”</p>
<p>The models successfully instrumented the HTTP calls, but failed to propagate the Context correctly. They treated the timeline as a single flat list of events rather than two distinct hierarchical trees.</p>
<p>Our tests don’t just check compilation. We verify correct span names, parent-child relationships, valid trace IDs, and context propagation. Many models produced compiling code that generated malformed traces – proving that “it builds” is not enough for SRE work.</p>
<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
<h3 id="models">Models</h3>
<p>We were surprised that even the top models (as of Jan 2026) struggle.
The tasks we proposed were trivial compared to real-world scenarios. In a typical SRE job, services are massive, legacy-ridden, and poorly documented. If models fail on 300 lines of clean Go code, they cannot handle production.</p>
<p>We were surprised that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/claude-opus-4.5/">Claude Opus 4.5</a>, the best model, got just 29% of these relatively simple tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/gemini-3-pro-preview/">Gemini 3 Pro</a> (which aces at general intelligence) didn’t have an edge over the much cheaper <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/gemini-3-flash-preview/">Gemini 3 Flash</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/gpt-5.2-codex/">GPT 5.2 Codex</a> was substantially worse than <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/models/gpt-5.2/">GPT 5.2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>Each language has a different toolset, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Our benchmark is too small to perform a comprehensive per-language comparison, yet even preliminary trends are striking.</p>
<figure> <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/#languages"> <img src="https://quesma.com/_astro/language_chart.BXXM9bH5_Z1tu9Lc.webp" alt="Pass rates by programming language showing C++ at 37%, Go at 20%, while Java, Ruby and Swift had 0% success" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1800" height="792">  </a> <figcaption> <p>C++ achieved the highest pass rate (37%), though this is partly due to having a simpler task (<a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/tasks/cpp-simple">cpp-simple</a>) in its set.
Go, with the most tasks tested (7), reached 20% — notable for a language central to distributed systems.
JavaScript, Python, PHP, and .NET saw moderate success. Just one model solved a single Rust task.
None solved any tasks in Swift, Ruby, or (surprisingly, due to build issues) Java.</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<h3 id="cost-and-time-efficiency">Cost and time efficiency</h3>
<p>In every practical application, cost and speed matter.
As of Jan 2026, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto frontier</a> consists of only four models, given model performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>19%</code> Gemini 3 Flash (cost and speed) - the cheapest and fastest model in this benchmark (11x cheaper and 2x faster than Claude Opus 4.5)</li>
<li><code>22%</code> Claude Sonnet 4.5 (speed)</li>
<li><code>26%</code> GPT 5.2 (cost)</li>
<li><code>29%</code> Claude Opus 4.5 (cost and speed) — the best model in this benchmark, the most expensive but reasonably fast</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-opentelemetry-instrumentation-is-hard-for-ai">Why OpenTelemetry instrumentation is hard for AI</h2>
<p>OpenTelemetry has all the potential to be a perfect task for AI agents — it is long and tedious work, requiring a lot of scrutiny, but ultimately one that has clear specifications and can be easily tested.</p>
<p>Yet, even the frontier models fail miserably.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-job-not-a-puzzle">It is a job, not a puzzle</h3>
<p>Instrumentation of even a small service involves <strong>long-horizon tasks</strong>, which remain at the <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/">frontier of the current AI model progress</a>.
It requires diligently connecting all pieces of code and testing them correctly.</p>
<h3 id="requires-polyglot-backend-development-skills">Requires polyglot backend development skills</h3>
<p>Realistic services use multiple languages and technologies.
It is not enough to know the concept of distributed tracing, the OpenTelemetry standard, or even the APIs of SDKs. The agent must know CMake for C++, module systems for Go, or dependency management for Java - things we tested in our previous benchmark, <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-compilebench/">CompileBench</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, cloud environments are mixtures of the newest versions of technologies (sometimes past the training cut-off dates of AI models) and legacy systems. We cannot cherry-pick or rewrite everything, since a possible outage would be too costly. We need to support all languages and frameworks used in the cloud.</p>
<p>A lot of current AI progress focuses on the most popular languages (Python and TypeScript) and reasonably modern frameworks and build systems.</p>
<h3 id="less-training-data">Less training data</h3>
<p>Although adding instrumentation is a standard engineering task, it is not common practice in open-source. The most popular applications, where reliability matters the most, are in private repositories of big tech companies such as Apple, Airbnb, or Netflix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best models struggle</strong>: The state-of-the-art Claude Opus 4.5 solved only 29% of tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Language gaps</strong>: Models failed completely on Java, Ruby, and Swift. C++ led at 37% (boosted by an easier task), Go reached 20%.</li>
<li><strong>Silent failures</strong>: Many solutions compiled correctly but produced malformed traces or conflated distinct user journeys.</li>
<li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>: Gemini 3 Flash exceeds Gemini 3 Pro’s performance (18%) at a fraction of the cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ai-sre-is-still-mostly-hype-but-there-is-hope">AI SRE is still mostly hype, but there is hope</h3>
<p>AI SRE in 2026 is what <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/aiops-observability/">DevOps Anomaly Detection was in 2015</a> — bold claims backed by huge marketing budgets, but lacking independent verification. There are stories of <a href="https://www.deductive.ai/blogs/datadog-thank-you-for-blocking-us">SaaS vendors abruptly killing the observability stack</a>. Our results mirror <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/llm-observability-challenge">ClickHouse’s findings</a>: while LLMs can assist, they lack the capabilities of a skilled SRE.</p>
<p>Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3 models show promising signals. Some hard tasks like <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/tasks/go-microservices-traces/">go-microservices-traces</a> reached <strong>55% pass rate</strong>. With more environments for Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards, this looks like a solvable problem.</p>
<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>
<p>Reliable software is incredibly economically valuable, but today it requires too much toil. No one wants to be woken up at 2 AM to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>We need a North Star to navigate the current AI boom. Just as SWE-Bench and TerminalBench2.0 became standards for software engineering, we need an SRE-style benchmark for distributed systems. Does the industry need newer models, or perhaps multi-agent systems? A good benchmark will tell us.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore the full results on <a href="https://quesma.com/benchmarks/otel/">OTelBench</a> and help us expand the test suite on <a href="https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/otel-bench">QuesmaOrg/otel-bench</a>. Have you tried using LLMs for observability? We are curious to hear if your experience matches our findings—or if you’ve found a workflow that actually works.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Let’s say you’re creating
a CLI tool which has to display
syntax highlighted source code.
You begin by choosing some colors
which look nice with
your chosen terminal theme:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Nice!
However,
who knows if it’ll still look good
for people who use
a theme different to yours?
It seems sensible to try out
the defaults, at least.
Let’s start with
the macOS Terminal.app default theme:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Basic — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><div><p>~ — zsh — Basic — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Youch!
It seems fair to try the Tango themes next,
since those are the default on e.g. Ubuntu:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Tango Light — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><div><p>~ — zsh — Tango Dark — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Hmm, better, but not by much.
Finally,
let’s try what is likely
the most popular custom terminal theme – Solarized:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Solarized Light — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><div><p>~ — zsh — Solarized Dark — 51×11</p><p>% highlight foo
<span># just some docs</span>
<span>func</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>() [<span>12</span>]<span>u8</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>"hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
}
Finished highlighting in 0.02 seconds.
% █</p></div><p>Well then …
Let’s take a look at each palette
and investigate.</p><h2 id="sorcerer">Sorcerer</h2><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×11</p><p>% colortest

% █</p></div><p>In Sorcerer,
all colors are readable
on the default background
except for <code>black</code>,
which is in fact darker than the background.
This is useful as the background color
for status bars and the like.
<code>white</code> is the same color as
the default foreground,
and <code>brblack</code> is a nice faded color.
Additionally, <code>brwhite</code> is
even lighter than the foreground;

these did a lot better than
Terminal.app’s Basic themes,

a little difficult to see,
though it’s nothing that would
stop me from using <code>brgreen</code>

how the greyscales –
<code>black</code>, <code>brblack</code>, <code>white</code> &amp; <code>brwhite</code> –
have remained consistent

Of course,
this means that
<code>{,br}white</code> is unreadable in Tango Light

and <code>black</code> is unreadable in Tango Dark
(owing to the dark background).</p><p>In other words:
forget about
that idea of mine from earlier
about using <code>brwhite</code> to emphasize content.
Unless, of course,
you don’t mind if your
eminently <em>emphasized</em> words
are completely unreadable
for the user of your software
who deigns to use the default light theme
of A Popular Linux Distro.</p><p>On the other hand,
using <code>brblack</code> to de-emphasize content
still seems fine to me.
I suppose some extra contrast
for <code>brblack</code> in Tango Dark
would be nice,
but with text which is meant to be ignored
I don’t think this matters much.</p><p>And lo, but ten colors remain.</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×11</p><p>% colortest --only-usable

% █</p></div><p>Solarized is a curious beast.
Every color in it
was chosen using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space"><em>L*a*b*</em></a>,
a perceptually-uniform color space
from the 1970s.
(For what it’s worth,
color science has
<a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">progressed significantly</a> since then;
the only reason
Ethan Schoonover used <em>L*a*b*</em>
is that it’s commonly used in photography,
and he used to be a professional photographer.)</p><p>Its lightnesses are perfectly symmetrical
so that Solarized Light and Dark
can share a set of accent colors
while maintaining identical contrast.
Moreover,
the warm tones of the light theme
and cool tones of the dark theme
are complementary.
(The hue gap is
closer to 150° than 180° in reality.
See <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/#002b36">here</a>
and <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker/#fdf6e3">here</a>
to compare hue values.)</p><p>Solarized is also incredibly popular.
I have no data here,
but as of the date of writing
it’s the most starred theme repository on GitHub
I can find.
Solarized has 15.4 thousand stars at the moment,
while the next-closest is <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">Gruvbox</a>
with 11.8 thousand.
Solarized is available as a plugin
or sometimes even as a built-in preset
in damn near every
popular terminal emulator and editor
on the planet.</p><p>To understand Solarized’s
peculiar arrangement of the 16-color palette,
we have to travel back in time to 2011
<a href="https://github.com/altercation/solarized/commit/3da9bd10d3b8c1ad6e2a5ab8617ef8c82fca0df7">when Solarized was first released</a>.
In this dark era,
terminals supporting 24-bit color
didn’t exist / weren’t widespread.
One option common among Vim themes at the time
was to round every color
to the nearest 256-color palette value.
In Solarized’s case,
this destroys the mathematical symmetry
at the heart of the theme.
(<a href="https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8#but-my-terminal-has-only-256-colors">I’m not kidding, it looks awful</a>.)</p><p>The solution
– rather, <em>hack</em> –
chosen at the time
was to distill
all the colors used in the Vim interface
down to a palette of sixteen colors.
Conveniently,
Solarized’s accent colors
fit nicely into the non-bright column
of the 16-color palette,
while Solarized’s monotones
fit into the bright column.
Once the user sets their terminal
to use the Solarized palette,
Vim can color its entire interface
using only the 16-color palette
and get correct color values,
no clunky color approximations needed.</p><p>The downside to all this is that
an application which uses
any of the bright colors
which Solarized co-opted for itself
will look strange.
Users of Solarized
– and, by god, there’s so many of them –
<a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2417">appear</a>
<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/181">frequently</a>

<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/683">trackers</a>
asking why command-line output
is inexplicably gray or even invisible
as a result of CLIs
using these forsaken bright colors.</p><p>Our beloved <code>brblack</code>
is unreadable in Solarized Dark,
so we’ll have to strike it from the table
in addition to the affected bright colors.</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×11</p><p>% colortest --only-usable

there was no way for terminals
to display bright colors.
As a workaround,
manufacturers
(we’re talking about
physical terminals here)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit">started making all bold text bright
instead of using a heavier font weight</a>.
One way or another
this ended up in the default settings of
many modern terminal emulators
(in spite of not being in the standard),
meaning that
regular colorful text made bold
can become bright too,
depending on the user’s configuration.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>And so, I present to you the final version
of our table of acceptable colors:</p><div><p>~ — zsh — Sorcerer — 51×21</p><div><p>% colortest --only-usable --bold

thirty-two possible color settings
are permissible,
given that we want applications
to remain readable
for as many people as we can.</p><p>If you’re developing a command-line tool
which will be used by
anyone apart from yourself,
I strongly recommend
you limit your use of color
to the ones I’ve identified here
as being “mostly alright”
and “not unreadable in
a common configuration
used by tons of people”.</p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><p>You probably didn’t notice,
but I styled the “terminal windows”
in this post to look
as similar as possible
to macOS Terminal.app windows
through painstaking
color picking and pixel counting.</p><p>The dimensions in each window’s titlebar
matches as closely as I can
with its actual dimensions on-screen.</p><p>The <code>colortest</code> and <code>highlight</code> utilities
are entirely fictional.</p><p>Terminal.app doesn’t actually provide
individual access to
the light and dark variants of Basic;
they appear as a single theme,
which switches seamlessly
when the OS theme changes.
As far as I know,
this reactive functionality
isn’t exposed to any other theme,
whether pre-installed or user-created.
In order to capture this,
I made the terminal windows in this post
react to whether the rest of the site
is in light or dark mode,
<em>except for the Basic windows.</em>
They remain fixed in
either light or dark mode,
since in real life you’ll never see,
for example,
a light Basic terminal
with dark window chrome.</p><p>Luna Razzaghipour<br>29 January 2023<br></p></article></div>]]></description>

Moltbot runs in the background on a user's own hardware, has a sizable and growing list of integrations for chat applications, AI models, and other popular tools, and can be controlled remotely. Moltbot can help you with your finances, social media, organize your day — all through your favorite messaging app.</p><p>But what if you don’t want to buy new dedicated hardware? And what if you could still run your Moltbot efficiently and securely online? Meet <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker"><u>Moltworker</u></a>, a middleware Worker and adapted scripts that allows running Moltbot on Cloudflare's Sandbox SDK and our Developer Platform APIs.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="a-personal-assistant-on-cloudflare-how-does-that-work">A personal assistant on Cloudflare — how does that work?&nbsp;</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Firstly, Cloudflare Workers has never been <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/"><u>so compatible</u></a> with Node.js. Where in the past we&nbsp;had to mock APIs to get some packages running, now those APIs are supported natively by the Workers Runtime.</p><p>This has changed how we can build tools on Cloudflare Workers. When we first implemented <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/">Playwright</a>, a popular framework for web testing and automation that runs on <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/">Browser Rendering</a>, we had to rely on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/memfs"><u>memfs</u></a>. This was bad because not only is memfs a hack and an external dependency, but it also forced us to drift away from the official Playwright codebase. Thankfully, with more Node.js compatibility, we were able to start using <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/playwright/pull/62/changes">node:fs natively</a>, reducing complexity and maintainability, which makes upgrades to the latest versions of Playwright easy to do.</p><p>The list of Node.js APIs we support natively keeps growing. The blog post “<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/nodejs-workers-2025/"><u>A year of improving Node.js compatibility in Cloudflare Workers</u></a>” provides an overview of where we are and what we’re doing.</p><p>We measure this progress, too. We recently ran an experiment where we took the 1,000 most popular NPM packages, installed and let AI loose, to try to run them in Cloudflare Workers, <a href="https://ghuntley.com/ralph/"><u>Ralph Wiggum as a "software engineer"</u></a> style, and the results were surprisingly good. Excluding the packages that are build tools, CLI tools or browser-only and don’t apply, only 15 packages genuinely didn’t work. <b>That's 1.5%</b>.</p><p>Here’s a graphic of our Node.js API support over time:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GhwKJq2A2wG79I3NdhhDl/e462c30daf46b1b36d3f06bff479596b/image9.png" alt="" width="1802" height="1194" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>We put together a page with the results of our internal experiment on npm packages support <a href="https://worksonworkers.southpolesteve.workers.dev/"><u>here</u></a>, so you can check for yourself.</p><p>Moltbot doesn’t necessarily require a lot of Workers Node.js compatibility because most of the code runs in a container anyway, but we thought it would be important to highlight how far we got supporting so many packages using native APIs. This is because when starting a new AI agent application from scratch, we can actually run a lot of the logic in Workers, closer to the user.</p><p>The other important part of the story is that the list of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/directory/?product-group=Developer+platform">products and APIs</a> on our Developer Platform has grown to the point where anyone can build and run any kind of application — even the most complex and demanding ones — on Cloudflare. And once launched, every application running on our Developer Platform immediately benefits from our secure and scalable global network.</p><p>Those products and services gave us the ingredients we needed to get started. First, we now have <a href="https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/">Sandboxes</a>, where you can run untrusted code securely in isolated environments, providing a place to run the service. Next, we now have <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/">Browser Rendering</a>, where you can programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances. And finally, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/">R2</a>, where you can store objects persistently. With those building blocks available, we could begin work on adapting Moltbot.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Moltbot on Workers, or Moltworker, is a combination of an entrypoint Worker that acts as an API router and a proxy between our APIs and the isolated environment, both protected by Cloudflare Access. It also provides an administration UI and connects to the Sandbox container where the standard Moltbot Gateway runtime and its integrations are running, using R2 for persistent storage.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 id="ai-gateway">AI Gateway</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cloudflare AI Gateway acts as a proxy between your AI applications and any popular <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/"><u>AI provider</u></a>, and gives our customers centralized visibility and control over the requests going through.</p><p>Recently we announced support for <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-08-25-secrets-store-ai-gateway/"><u>Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)</u></a>, where instead of passing your provider secrets in plain text with every request, we centrally manage the secrets for you and can use them with your gateway configuration.</p><p>An even better option where you don’t have to manage AI providers' secrets at all end-to-end is to use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/"><u>Unified Billing</u></a>. In this case you top up your account with credits and use AI Gateway with any of the supported providers directly, Cloudflare gets charged, and we will deduct credits from your account.</p><p>To make Moltbot use AI Gateway, first we create a new gateway instance, then we enable the Anthropic provider for it, then we either add our Claude key or purchase credits to use Unified Billing, and then all we need to do is set the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL environment variable so Moltbot uses the AI Gateway endpoint. That’s it, no code changes necessary.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/cMWRXgHR0mFLc5kp74nYk/a47fa09bdbb6acb3deb60fb16537945d/image11.png" alt="" width="1999" height="930" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Once Moltbot starts using AI Gateway, you’ll have full visibility on costs and have access to logs and analytics that will help you understand how your AI agent is using the AI providers.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5GOrNdgtdwMcU4bE8oLE19/6bc29bcac643125f5332a8ffba9d1322/image1.png" alt="" width="1994" height="1430" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Note that Anthropic is one option; Moltbot supports <a href="https://www.molt.bot/integrations"><u>other</u></a> AI providers and so does <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/"><u>AI Gateway</u></a>. The advantage of using AI Gateway is that if a better model comes along from any provider, you don’t have to swap keys in your AI Agent configuration and redeploy — you can simply switch the model in your gateway configuration. And more, you specify model or provider <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/"><u>fallbacks</u></a> to handle request failures and ensure reliability.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="sandboxes">Sandboxes</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Last year we anticipated the growing need for AI agents to run untrusted code securely in isolated environments, and we <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-06-24-announcing-sandboxes/"><u>announced</u></a> the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/"><u>Sandbox SDK</u></a>. This SDK is built on top of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/"><u>Cloudflare Containers</u></a>, but it provides a simple API for executing commands, managing files, running background processes, and exposing services — all from your Workers applications.</p><p>In short, instead of having to deal with the lower-level Container APIs, the Sandbox SDK gives you developer-friendly APIs for secure code execution and handles the complexity of container lifecycle, networking, file systems, and process management — letting you focus on building your application logic with just a few lines of TypeScript. Here’s an example:</p>
            <pre><code>import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';
export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise&lt;Response&gt; {
    const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');

    // Create a project structure
    await sandbox.mkdir('/workspace/project/src', { recursive: true });

    // Check node version
    const version = await sandbox.exec('node -v');

    // Run some python code
    const ctx = await sandbox.createCodeContext({ language: 'python' });
    await sandbox.runCode('import math; radius = 5', { context: ctx });
    const result = await sandbox.runCode('math.pi * radius ** 2', { context: ctx });

    return Response.json({ version, result });
  }
};</code></pre>
            <p>This fits like a glove for Moltbot. Instead of running Docker in your local Mac mini, we run Docker on Containers, use the Sandbox SDK to issue commands into the isolated environment and use callbacks to our entrypoint Worker, effectively establishing a two-way communication channel between the two systems.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="r2-for-persistent-storage">R2 for persistent storage</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The good thing about running things in your local computer or VPS is you get persistent storage for free. Containers, however, are inherently <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/platform-details/architecture/"><u>ephemeral</u></a>, meaning data generated within them is lost upon deletion. Fear not, though — the Sandbox SDK provides the sandbox.mountBucket() that you can use to automatically, well, mount your R2 bucket as a filesystem partition when the container starts.</p><p>Once we have a local directory that is guaranteed to survive the container lifecycle, we can use that for Moltbot to store session memory files, conversations and other assets that are required to persist.</p>

    </p>
    <p>AI agents rely heavily on browsing the sometimes not-so-structured web. Moltbot utilizes dedicated Chromium instances to perform actions, navigate the web, fill out forms, take snapshots, and handle tasks that require a web browser. Sure, we can run Chromium on Sandboxes too, but what if we could simplify and use an API instead?</p><p>With Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/"><u>Browser Rendering</u></a>, you can programmatically control and interact with headless browser instances running at scale in our edge network. We support <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/"><u>Puppeteer</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/stagehand/"><u>Stagehand</u></a>, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/"><u>Playwright</u></a> and other popular packages so that developers can onboard with minimal code changes. We even support <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/playwright-mcp/"><u>MCP</u></a> for AI.</p><p>In order to get Browser Rendering to work with Moltbot we do two things:</p><ul><li><p>First we create a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker/blob/main/src/routes/cdp.ts"><u>thin CDP proxy</u></a> (<a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/"><u>CDP</u></a> is the protocol that allows instrumenting Chromium-based browsers) from the Sandbox container to the Moltbot Worker, back to Browser Rendering using the Puppeteer APIs.</p></li><li><p>Then we inject a <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker/pull/20"><u>Browser Rendering skill</u></a> into the runtime when the Sandbox starts.</p></li></ul>

    <p>Next up we want to protect our APIs and Admin UI from unauthorized access. Doing authentication from scratch is hard, and is typically the kind of wheel you don’t want to reinvent or have to deal with. Zero Trust Access makes it incredibly easy to protect your application by defining specific policies and login methods for the endpoints.&nbsp;</p>

You can then <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/validating-json/"><u>validate</u></a> that JWT for extra protection, to ensure that the request came from Access and not a malicious third party.</p><p>Like with AI Gateway, once all your APIs are behind Access you get great observability on who the users are and what they are doing with your Moltbot instance.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23, according to the company. Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>

<p>The NHTSA has opened an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”</p>







<p>Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at six miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>

<p>“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>

<p>News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>

<p>Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>
