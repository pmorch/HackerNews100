<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a cornerstone of the Internet, helping to load web pages, stream videos, and fetch data for your favourite apps.</p>



<p>Last year&nbsp;a new version of the protocol, HTTP/3, was standardized&nbsp;by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the organization in charge of defining Internet technologies. Since then, HTTP/3 and the related QUIC protocol have seen a rapid uptake on the public web. The exact numbers depend on the source and measurement methodology, with HTTP/3 support ranging from&nbsp;<a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web#h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19%</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://2023.apricot.net/assets/files/APPS314/2023-03-01-quic-apri_1677636425.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50+%</a>&nbsp;of web servers and networks worldwide.</p>







<p>Because these new protocols are heavily used by large companies such as Google and Meta, we can safely say that&nbsp;a large chunk of current Internet traffic already uses HTTP/3 today. In fact, the blog post you’re reading right now was probably loaded over HTTP/3!</p>



<p>In this series, I’ll provide some context on what problems HTTP/3 solves, how it performs, why it’s seen such swift adoption, and what limitations it is still working to overcome.</p>



<h2>Why do we need HTTP/3?</h2>



<p>A network protocol describes how data is communicated between two entities on the network, typically the user’s device and a web server. As there are many different companies building software for the web, the protocol needs to be standardized so that all this software can be ‘interoperable’, that is, they can all understand each other because&nbsp;they follow the same rules.</p>



<p>In practice,&nbsp;we don’t use a single protocol but a combination of several at the same time, each with its own responsibilities and rules (Figure 1). This is to make things flexible and reusable — you can still use the exact same HTTP logic, regardless if you’re using Wi-Fi, cable, or 4G/5G.</p>

<p>Many of the original protocols for the Internet were standardized in the 80s and 90s, meaning they were built with the goals and restrictions of those decades in mind.&nbsp;While some of these protocols have stood the test of time, others have started to show their age. Most problems have been solved by workarounds and clever tricks. However, it was clear something would have to change. This is especially true for the Transport Control Protocol (TCP), which ensures your data reliably gets across the Internet.</p>



<h2>Why TCP is not optimal for today’s web</h2>



<p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 rely on TCP to successfully do their job.&nbsp;Before a client and server can exchange an HTTP request/response, they must establish a TCP connection.</p>



<p>Over time, there have been many efforts to update TCP and resolve some of its inefficiencies —&nbsp;TCP still loads webpages as if they were single files instead of a collection of hundreds of individual files. Some of these updates have been successful, but most of the more impactful ones (for example, TCP multipath and TCP Fast Open)&nbsp;took nearly a decade to be practically usable on the public Internet.</p>



<p>The main challenge with implementing changes to TCP is thousands of devices on the Internet all have their own implementation of the TCP protocol. These include phones, laptops, and servers, as well as routers, firewalls, load balancers, and other types of ‘middleboxes’. As such,&nbsp;if we want to update TCP, we have to wait for a significant portion of all these devices to update&nbsp;their implementation, which in practice can take years.</p>



<h3>The QUIC solution</h3>



<p>This became a problem to the point that the most practical way forward was to replace TCP with something entirely new.&nbsp;This replacement is the QUIC protocol, though many still (jokingly) refer to it as TCP 2.0. This nickname is appropriate because QUIC includes many of the same high-level features of TCP but with a couple of crucial changes.</p>



<p>The main change is that&nbsp;QUIC heavily integrates with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. TLS is responsible for encrypting sensitive data on the web — it’s the thing that provides the S (secure) in HTTPS. With TCP, TLS only encrypts the actual HTTP data (Figure 2). With QUIC,&nbsp;TLS also encrypts large parts of the QUIC protocol itself. This means that metadata, such as packet numbers and connection-close signals, which were visible to (and changeable by) all middleboxes in TCP, are now only available to the client and server in QUIC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png" alt="Figure 2 — Encryption differences between TCP+TLS and QUIC. QUIC encrypts much more than just the HTTP data." srcset="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1.png 1024w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-300x156.png 300w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-768x398.png 768w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fig2-tcp-vs-quic-packetization-1024x531-1-624x324.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2 — Encryption differences between TCP+TLS and QUIC. QUIC encrypts much more than just the HTTP data.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Furthermore, because QUIC is more extensively encrypted, it will be much easier than it was for TCP to change it or to add new features — we only need to update the clients and servers, as the middleboxes can’t decrypt the metadata anyway. This makes&nbsp;QUIC a future-proof protocol that will allow us to more quickly solve new challenges.</p>



<p>Of course,&nbsp;this extra encryption is good for the general security and privacy of the new protocol too. While TCP + TLS are perfect for securing sensitive personal data, such as credit cards or email content, they can still be vulnerable to complex (privacy) attacks, which have become ever more practical to execute due to recent advances in AI. By further encrypting this type of metadata, QUIC is more resilient to sophisticated threat actors.</p>



<p>QUIC also has many other security-related features, including defences against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with features such as amplification prevention and RETRY packets.</p>



<p>Finally,&nbsp;QUIC also includes a large amount of efficiency and performance improvements compared to TCP, including a faster connection handshake (see Figure 3),&nbsp;<a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2020/head-of-line-blocking-in-quic-and-http-3-the-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the removal of the ‘head-of-line blocking’ problem</a>, better packet loss detection/recovery, and ways to deal with users switching networks (I’ll go into more detail on this in my next post).</p>

<h2>We didn’t need HTTP/3; what we needed was QUIC</h2>



<p>Initially, there were attempts to keep HTTP/2 and make minimal adjustments so we could also use QUIC in the lower layers (after all, that’s the whole point of having these different cooperating and reusable protocols). However, it became clear QUIC was just different enough from TCP to make it HTTP/2-incompatible. As such, the decision was made to make a new version of HTTP, just for QUIC, which eventually became HTTP/3.</p>



<p>HTTP/3 is almost identical to HTTP/2. They mainly differ in the technical implementation of the features on top of QUIC or TCP. However, because HTTP/3 can use all of QUIC’s new features,&nbsp;it is expected to be more performant when loading web pages and streaming videos. In practice, it’s especially this aspect that has led to HTTP/3’s rapid adoption.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2023/10/02/how-quic-helps-you-seamlessly-connect-to-different-networks/">next post</a>, I’ll go into more detail on a common connectivity problem you’ve most likely experienced and how QUIC can help reduce calls and videos from cutting out when your mobile device changes from using Wi-Fi to cellular connectivity.</p>

        <p dir="auto">In case you’re asking if the <em>patch</em> to libcurl will require a redistribution of pycurl: most distros ship pycurl with dynamic linkage of libcurl (rather than static linkage). In that case, pycurl would <em>almost certainly</em> benefit from the changes to the (dynamically linked) libcurl without repackaging/redistribution.</p>
<p dir="auto">(I say “almost certainly” because the libcurl patch might introduce a relevant ABI change which would require changes to pycurl but I find that very unlikely since there’s no such notice in the OP above.)</p>

        <p dir="auto">Well "this one software project" is one of the most critical ones out there... And I think we all know that OpenSSL is far from perfect (even though I think they improved a lot over the last years) - but guess what ,everyone was happy that they announced it in advance so people could prepare to patch ASAP when the patch hit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do you seriously prefer to be surprised - maybe on your day off, away from a proper computer - with an urgent update you need to install, instead of knowing some days in advance that you may need to quickly install a patch on a given day?</p>

<p>The suspect components — which Delta declined to identify — were found on an unspecified number of its engines, a company spokesman said Monday. Those engines account for less than 1% of the more than 2,100 power plants on its mainline fleet, the spokesman said. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Delta would not say if the engines with the fraudulently documented parts had been on planes while they were in service. The problematic pieces, which were certified by AOG, were detected during engine work by an unnamed third party, the spokesman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As many as 21 of Delta’s engines could have been affected, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data provided by the airline, which would represent the most among US carriers that have disclosed a number. As many as 96 total engines were impacted by parts supplied by AOG, GE has said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Delta has been informed by one of our engine service providers that a small number of engines they overhauled for us contain certain parts that do not meet documentation requirements,” the company said in a statement. “Working with the overhaul provider, we are in the process of replacing those parts and remain in compliance with all FAA guidelines.”</p>



<p>None of Delta’s aircraft are currently flying with unapproved parts, and the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/discovery-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="">discovery</a> hasn’t affected flight operations, the Delta spokesman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Airlines, maintenance providers and regulators across the globe have been scouring records to hunt down AOG-supplied parts with forged airworthiness documents after European authorities in August determined the parts broker had supplied suspect components.

<p>AOG last month was ordered by a London judge to hand over records to help identify additional suspect parts after GE and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/safran/" target="_blank" rel="">Safran</a> filed a lawsuit seeking documents relating to “every single sale of products.”</p></div><div id="text1_wrapper" data-cy="subscriptionPlea">

                                    <p>The purpose of this article is to plot a fascinating story in the history of mathematics. The 4000-year-old story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is worthy of recounting – even for the math-phobic readership. It is more than a <i>math</i> story, as it tells a history of two great civilizations of antiquity rising to prominence 4000 years ago, along with historic and legendary persons, who not only define the period, but whose individual life stories are quite engaging. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs. In addition, a 350-year-old generalized version of the Pythagorean Theorem, which was proposed by an amateur mathematician, was finally solved, and made the front-page of the <i>New York Times</i> in 1993.</p><div id="Sec1-section" data-title="BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS"><h2 id="Sec1">BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS</h2><div id="Sec1-content"><p>The Greek mathematician Pythagoras has high name recognition, not only in the history of mathematics. Everyone who has studied geometry can recall, well after the high school years, some aspect of the Pythagorean Theorem. However, the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is not well known. Some story plot points are: the famous theorem goes by several names grounded in the behavior of the day (discussed later in the text), including the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras’ Theorem and notably Euclid I 47. The Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the most <i>famous</i> statement in mathematics, and the fourth most <i>beautiful</i> equation.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Journal Physics World (2004), as reported in the New York Times, Ideas and Trends, 24 October 2004, p. 12." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d94401022e279">1</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Maor, E.

However, ironically, not much is really known about him – not even his likeness. What is <i>known</i> about Pythagoras is generally considered more <i>fiction</i> than fact, as historians who lived hundreds of years later provided the <i>facts</i> about his life. There are definite details of Pythagoras’ life from early biographies that use original sources, yet are written by authors who attribute divine powers to him, and present him as a deity figure.

He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics, yet relatively little is known about his mathematical achievements. Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, who wrote a number of books, there are no writings by Pythagoras. However, there is evidence that Pythagoras founded a school (in what is now Crotone, to the east of the heel of southern Italy) named <i>the Semicircle of Pythagoras</i> – half-religious and half-scientific, which followed a code of secrecy. Because secrecy is often controversial, Pythagoras is a mysterious figure. The members of the Semicircle of Pythagoras – the Pythagoreans – were bound by an allegiance that was strictly enforced. However, the Semicircle was more than just a school that studied intellectual disciplines, including in particular philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="

The latter is reflected in the Pythagorean motto: <i>Number Rules the Universe</i>.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Maor, E.

Pythagoreans consumed vegetarian dried and condensed food and unleavened bread (as matzos, used by the Biblical Jewish priestly class (the Kohanim), and used today during the Jewish holiday of Passover).<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="

Moreover, out of respect for their leader, many of the discoveries made by the Pythagoreans were attributed to Pythagoras himself; this would account for the term ‘Pythagoras’ Theorem’. Consequently, of Pythagoras’ actual work nothing is known. On the other hand, his school practiced collectivism, making it hard to distinguish between the work of Pythagoras and that of his followers; this would account for the term ‘Pythagorean Theorem’. Therefore, the true discovery of a particular Pythagorean result may never be known. Regardless of the uncertainty of Pythagoras’ actual contributions, however, his school made outstanding contributions to mathematics.</p><p>Is seems that Pythagoras was the first person to define the consonant acoustic relationships between strings of proportional lengths. Specifically, strings of equal tension of proportional lengths create tones of proportional frequencies when plucked. For example, a string that is 2 feet long will vibrate <i>x</i> times per second (that is, hertz, a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second), while a string that is 1 foot long will vibrate twice as fast: 2<i>x</i>. Furthermore, those two frequencies create a perfect octave.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="

The Pythagoreans were so troubled over the finding of irrational numbers that they swore each other to secrecy about its existence. It is known that one Pythagorean did tell someone outside the school, and he was never to be found thereafter, that is, he was murdered, as Pythagoras himself was murdered by oppressors of the Semicircle of Pythagoras.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="

The number immediately under the horizontal diagonal is 1; 24, 51, 10 (this is the modern notation for writing Babylonian numbers, in which the commas separate the sexagesition ‘digits’, and a semicolon separates the integral part of a number from its fractional part). Writing this number in the base-10 system, one gets 1+24/60+51/60<sup>2</sup>+10/60<sup>3</sup>=1.414213, which is nothing other than the decimal value of the square root of 2, accurate to the nearest one hundred thousandth.</p><p>The conclusion is inescapable. The Babylonians knew the relation between the length of the diagonal of a square and its side: <i>d</i>=square root of 2. This was probably the first number known to be irrational. However, this in turn means that they were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem – or, at the very least, with its special case for the diagonal of a square (<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>=<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>=2<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>) – more than a thousand years before the great sage for whom it was named.

First, it proves that the Babylonians knew how to compute the square root of a number with remarkable accuracy. The unknown scribe who carved these numbers into a clay tablet nearly 4000 years ago showed a simple method of computing: multiply the side of the square by the square root of 2. But there remains one unanswered question: Why did the scribe choose a side of 30 for his example? Probably, 30 was used for convenience, as it was part of the Babylonian system of sexagesimal, a base-60 numeral system. From this one derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 min in an hour and 360 (60 × 6) degrees in a circle.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="

The manuscript was prepared in 1907 and published in 1927. A revised second edition appeared in 1940, and this was reprinted by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 1968 as part of its ‘Classics in Mathematics Education’ series. Loomis received literally hundreds of new proofs from after his book was released up until his death, but he could not keep up with his compendium. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether certain proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Befitting of someone who collects solutions of the Pythagorean Theorem (I belittle neither the effort nor its value), Loomis, known for living an orderly life, extended his writing to his own obituary in 1934, which he left in a letter headed ‘For the Berea Enterprise immediately following my death’. He died on 11 December 1940, and the obituary was published as he had written it, except for the date of his death and the addresses of some of his survivors.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/math/Ohio-section/bicen/esloomis.html." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d94401022e685">21</a></sup></p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-7" data-title="Figure 7"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig7" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 7</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16/figures/7" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fjt.2009.16/MediaObjects/41495_2009_Article_BFjt200916_Fig7_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig7" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fjt.2009.16/MediaObjects/41495_2009_Article_BFjt200916_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="figure 7" loading="lazy"></picture></a></div><p>Elisha Scott Loomis.</p></div><p><a data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16/figures/7" data-track-dest="link:Figure7 Full size image" aria-label="Full size image figure 7" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div></div></div><div id="Sec5-section" data-title="A 12-YEAR-OLD EINSTEIN ‘PROVES’ THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM"><h2 id="Sec5">A 12-YEAR-OLD EINSTEIN ‘PROVES’ THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM</h2><div id="Sec5-content"><p>According to his autobiography, a preteen Albert Einstein (<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.16#Fig8">Figure 8</a>)

Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which – though by no means evident – could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me. For example I remember that an uncle told me the Pythagorean Theorem before the holy geometry booklet had come into my hands.

Fermat conjectured that there were no non-zero integer solutions for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> when <i>n</i> was greater than 2. He did not leave a proof, though. Instead, in the <i>margin</i> of a textbook, he wrote that he knew that this relationship was not possible, but he did not have enough room on the page to write it down. His conjecture became known as <i>Fermat's Last Theorem</i>. This may appear to be a simple problem on the surface, but it was not until 1993 when Andrew Wiles of Princeton University finally proved the 350-year-old marginalized theorem, which appeared on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="

It is therefore surprising to find that Fermat was a <i>lawyer</i>, and only an <i>amateur</i> mathematician. Also surprising is the fact that he published only one mathematical paper in his life, and that was an anonymous paper written as an appendix to a colleague's book.</p><p>Because Fermat refused to publish his work, his friends feared that it would soon be forgotten unless something was done about it. His son Samuel undertook the task of collecting Fermat's letters and other mathematical papers, comments written in books and so on with the goal of publishing his father's mathematical ideas. Samuel found the <i>marginal</i> note (<i>the proof</i> could not fit on the page) in his father's copy of Diophantus's <i>Arithmetica</i>.

He earned his BA in 1974 after study at Merton College, Oxford, and a PhD in 1980 after research at Clare College, Cambridge. His graduate research was guided by John Coates beginning in the summer of 1975. Together they worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication using the methods of Iwasawa theory.</p><p>He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over <i>Q</i> and soon afterwards generalized this result to totally real fields. Taking approximately 7 years to complete the work, Wiles was the first person to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, earning him a place in history. Andrew Wiles’ most famous mathematical result is that all rational semi-stable elliptic curves are modular, which, in particular, implies Fermat's Last Theorem.</p><p>Wiles was introduced to Fermat's Last Theorem at the age of 10. He tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves under the supervision of John Coates.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, a connection between elliptic curves and modular forms was conjectured by the Japanese mathematician Goro Shimura based on some ideas that Yutaka Taniyama posed. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a paper by André Weil. With Weil giving conceptual evidence for it, it is sometimes called the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture. It states that every rational elliptic curve is modular. The full conjecture was proven by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor in 1998 using many of the methods that Andrew Wiles used in his 1995 published papers.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="

                      <p>So many people, young and old, famous and not famous, <i>have touched</i> the Pythagorean Theorem. The eccentric mathematics teacher Elisha Scott Loomis spent a lifetime collecting all known proofs and writing them up in <i>The Pythagorean Proposition,</i> a compendium of 371 proofs. The manuscript was published in 1927, and a revised, second edition appeared in 1940. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether some proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs.</p>

A 12-year-old Albert Einstein was touched by the earthbound spirit of the Pythagorean Theorem. The wunderkind provided a proof that was notable for its elegance and simplicity. However, the spirit of the Pythagoras’ Theorem was not finished with young Einstein: two decades later he used the Pythagorean Theorem in the Special Theory of Relativity (in a four-dimensional form), and in a vastly expanded form in the General Theory of Relativity. That Einstein used Pythagorean Theorem for his Relativity would be enough to show Pythagorean Theorem's value, or importance to the world. But, people continued to find value in the Pythagorean Theorem, namely, Wiles.</p>

                      <p>The theorem's spirit also visited another youngster, a 10-year-old British Andrew Wiles, and returned two decades later to an unknown Professor Wiles. Young Wiles tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods, and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves, which provided the path for proving Fermat's Theorem, the news of which made to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> in 1993.

      <article role="main">
        <p><em>Minor terminological nitpick.</em></p>

<p>People often describe the LLM as ‘hallucinating’ information whenever it makes up information which seems like it should fit for a given query even when it is trivially false. While evocative, this isn’t actually correct terminology. We already have a perfectly word for this precisely phenomenon in psychology: confabulation.</p>

<p>Confabulation is typically used in a psychiatric context when people have some kind of brain damage, especially to memory, which causes them not to be able to explain or answer questions correctly. For instance, if an amnesiac patient is asked questions about an event they were previously at, instead of admitting they do not know, they would invent a plausile story. Similarly, in split-brain patients, where the corpus callosum is severed so each half of the brain cannot talk to each other, patients can invent elaborate explanations for why the other half of their body is doing a specific thing, even when the experimenter knows this is not the case because they have prompted it with something differently.  In general, people confabulating invent plausible sounding justifications which have no basis in fact. This is usually not conscious with an intent to deceive but instead appear to strongly believe in the story they have just reported. This behaviour is identical to what LLMs do. When they are forced to give an answer using a fact they do not know, they cannot say that they don’t know, since in training such examples would be followed by the actual fact. Instead, they make up something plausible. They confabulate.</p>

<p>More importantly, if we recognize that what LLMs are really doing is confabulating, we can try to compare and contrast their behaviour with that of humans. Humans confabulate in a wide variety of circumstances and especially with some neural pathologies such as with memory impairments and in split-brain patient. Funnily enough, these are similar to a LLM. What are LLMs but humans with extreme amnesia and no central coherence?</p>

This kind of surveillance could nudge some employees to quit, but the labor market is cooler now than during the Great Resignation.</p>


<p>The recent tech sector layoffs can largely be attributed to overhiring during the pandemic boom, rising inflation and interest rates and an economic slowdown in the United States. With tech companies looking to cut costs, significant layoffs took hold in mid-2022 and permeated the following year. According to <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank" title="https://layoffs.fyi/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://layoffs.fyi/" aria-label="Layoffs.fyi">Layoffs.fyi</a>, more than 238,000 tech professionals were let go in 2023, and nearly 165,000 in 2022.</p>

<p>Hired, an AI-driven job marketplace that matches top tech and sales talent with companies looking to hire, recently released its 2023 <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2023/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2023-sots-blog)" target="_blank" title="https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2023/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2023-sots-blog)" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://hired.com/state-of-tech-salaries/2023/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=(a-all)(l-all)(r-all)(2023-sots-blog)" aria-label="State of Tech Salaries">State of Tech Salaries</a> report to provide insights into the tech job market.</p>


<h2>State Of The Tech Sector</h2>
<p>Hired’s data reveals that demand for job postings on the <a href="https://hired.com/products/tech-hiring-platform/" target="_blank" title="https://hired.com/products/tech-hiring-platform/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://hired.com/products/tech-hiring-platform/" aria-label="tech hiring platform">tech hiring platform</a> lowered from 45% in 2019 to 25% in the first half of 2023.</p>

<p>According to the report, when adjusting for inflation, tech salaries plunged to their lowest point in the past five years, decreasing 9% from $141,000 to $129,000 from 2022 to mid-2023.</p>
<p>Additionally, salaries experienced their most significant year-over-year decline, dropping by 3% from $161,000 to $156,000. However, despite economic volatility, job seekers in the U.S. maintained their salary expectations at around $146,000.</p>

<p>Amid the rise of artificial intelligence and corporate belt-tightening, junior talent with less than four years of experience has experienced the most significant salary decrease–nearly 5% year-over-year.</p>

<p>Tech professionals have been moving from expensive cities to lower-cost locations. U.S. inflation-adjusted remote salaries have been higher on average. Employers have decreased the number of open roles in high-cost-of-living markets by 19% and have nearly quadrupled the number of positions in low-cost-of-living markets to 9% since 2020. Most notably, the San Francisco Bay Area saw the most significant decrease in role volume on Hired’s platform. Nevertheless, it continues to command the highest average salary of $178,000</p>


<p>Experienced engineers who can efficiently resolve issues are in high demand, particularly with the introduction of AI tools and increased cybersecurity challenges. Engineering managers earn the highest salaries at $202,000 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Employers on Hired’s marketplace have a higher demand for specialized engineers, especially for AI applications, such as machine learning, as well as cybersecurity, data, and backend engineers. However, nearly half of employers (47%) project they will leverage AI to reduce headcounts by 2029.</p>

But other scientists “are still a little bit in the dark about the extent of the problem”, David says. He decided he needed some data.</p><p>The independent biologist in Pontypridd, UK, spent the best part of several months poring over hundreds of papers in one journal, looking for any with duplicated images. Then he ran the same papers through an artificial-intelligence (AI) tool. Working at two to three times David’s speed, the software found almost all of the 63 suspect papers that he had identified — and 41 that he’d missed. David described the exercise last month in a preprint<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, one of the first published comparison of human versus machine for finding doctored images.</p><p>The findings come as academic publishers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03807-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03807-6" data-track-category="body text link">reckon with the problem of image manipulation</a> in scientific papers. In a 2016 study<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z" data-track-category="body text link">renowned image-forensics specialist Elisabeth Bik</a>, based in San Francisco, California, and her colleagues reported that almost 4% of papers she had visually scanned in 40 biomedical-science journals contained inappropriately duplicated images.</p><p>Not all image manipulation is done with nefarious intent. Authors might tinker with images by accident, for aesthetic reasons or to make a figure more understandable. But journals and others would like to catch images with alterations that cross the line, whatever the authors’ motivation. And now they are turning to AI for help.</p><h2>Fraud busters</h2><p>Some 200 universities, publishers and scientific societies already rely on Imagetwin, the tool that David used for his study. The software compares images in a paper with more than 25 million images from other publications — the largest such database in the image-integrity world, according to Imagetwin‘s developers.</p><p>Bik has been using Imagetwin regularly to supplement her own skills and calls it her “standard tool”, although she emphasizes that the AI has weaknesses as well as strengths — for instance, it can miss duplications in images with low contrast. She and David both get free access to the software from ImageTwin AI, the Vienna-based company that developed Imagetwin, and provide feedback to the developers.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Some publishers have turned to other AI tools. Journals published by the American Association for Cancer Research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, screen papers with the AI tool Proofig. Frontiers in Lausanne, Switzerland, has developed its own software to check papers for its family of journals. A spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes <i>Nature</i>, says that the company is “continuing to explore and develop tools for image checking”. (<i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)</p><p>Part of the draw of Imagetwin, specialists say, is that it looks for duplications in two ways. The software makes “something like a fingerprint” for every image in a paper, says Patrick Starke, one of its developers. It then scans the entire paper for repeats of that fingerprint. It also scans its large database to see whether that fingerprint appears in past papers — a process that takes only five to ten seconds.</p><h2>A long slog</h2><p>For his study, David sifted through more than 700 papers with relevant images published between 2014 and 2023 in <i>Toxicology Reports</i>, a journal he chose in part because it contains a lot of pictures and in part because in 2021, the journal’s publisher, Elsevier in Amsterdam, added an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100216X" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475002100216X" data-track-category="body text link">expression of concern</a> to an entire special issue of the journal.</p><p>After checking the papers visually, David gave the AI a go and found that it worked “much faster than me very carefully staring at images for a long time”, although it did miss four papers that he had flagged. All told, there were duplications in around 16% of the analysed papers with relevant images.</p><p>That’s considerably higher than the 4% Bik calculated, but she says David’s figure isn’t surprising. In her analysis, individual journals had duplications in between 0.3% and 12% of their papers, with higher-impact journals tending to have fewer duplications.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>It is “entirely plausible” that 16% of a journal’s images could include duplications, agrees Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press in Heidelberg, Germany, who has free access to Imagetwin and uses it along with other software. In her work looking over papers before they are published, Christopher flags about one-third for further investigation.</p><p>David posted his study on the preprint server bioRxiv on 5 September. It has not yet been peer reviewed. An Elsevier spokesperson says: “We are aware of the preprint and have launched an internal investigation that is under way at this time.” The editor-in-chief of <i>Toxicology Reports</i>, Lawrence Lash, says he has nothing to add to that statement.</p><p>Bik finds Imagetwin especially useful for “complex figures with lots of panels”. It can perform nearly instant scans of Images that can take her more than half an hour to dissect on her own.</p><p>“It’s really nice to have a software as a second pair of eyes,” agrees Christopher. But like Bik, she says Imagetwin has its shortcomings. “I often find additional [problems] that aren’t duplications and even duplications that the software didn’t flag,” Christopher says.</p><h2>Part of the process</h2><p>The end goal, Christopher says, is to incorporate AI tools such as Imagetwin into the paper-review process, just as many publishers routinely use software to scan text for plagiarism. But AI on its own isn’t enough. “You have to use your own expertise and question these things. None of the flags you receive [from Imagetwin] are a definite ‘This is fraud,’” she says.</p><p>Starke says that universities are using Imagetwin to review papers that their faculty members are submitting to journals. He declined to provide detailed numbers or to name any of the software’s users.</p><p>Christopher hopes that the roll-out of more AI tools could democratize the ability for journals to screen papers. “I think we need to shed the idea that it’s a luxury — it actually adds value to the journal.”</p>

<h2 id="why-is-there-an-a320-in-a-field"> Why is there an A320 in a field? </h2>
<p>The 17-year-old Ural Airlines A320 with registration RA-73805 was operating flight U6 1383, a domestic flight from Sochi (AER) to Omsk (OMS), Russia, when it suffered a reported hydraulic failure on the approach to its final destination. The flight had 165 passengers and crew onboard.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1044} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>Following the execution of a missed approach, or 'go around,' the crew climbed the aircraft back up to 18,000ft and subsequently elected to divert to Novosibirsk Airport (OVB), which has a longer runway that would facilitate a landing possibly without the use of brakes and spoilers, among other systems.</p>

<p>The crew's initial calculations indicated that the aircraft would have had enough fuel to reach the alternative airport. However, with the crew being unable to retract the main landing gear doors due to the hydraulic failure this increased the fuel consumption during the diversion, an issue exacerbated by stronger-than-predicted headwinds during the flight.</p>

<p>After realizing they could not make it to Novosibirsk, the crew landed in the wheat field with the landing gear extended. The location is reportedly on the outskirts of Kamenka, a rural village about 180 km (110 mi) from Novosibirsk.</p>

<p>It has been widely speculated that the incident occurred due to Russian airlines having difficulty sourcing spares for their civil aircraft due to Western sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, Ural Airlines has denied facing such an issue or using any non-certified spare parts to keep its fleet in the air.</p>

<p>A similar incident occurred in August 2019 when another Ural Airlines-operated aircraft <a href="https://simpleflying.com/ural-a321-birdstrike-cornfield/">landed in a cornfield near Moscow</a>. The Airbus A321 involved in that incident suffered a dual-engine failure following a bird strike. In that case, the aircraft sustained substantial damage and was eventually disassembled in the field where it landed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all passengers and crew survived, and the captain was considered a hero. However, like the more recent incident, experts suggested that the pilots could have handled the situation differently and that, in both cases, better decision-making at crucial points in both flights could have avoided the off-airport landings.</p>

Some users of 1.1.1.1 or products like WARP, Zero Trust, or third party DNS resolvers which use 1.1.1.1 may have received SERVFAIL DNS responses to valid queries. We’re very sorry for this outage. This outage was an internal software error and not the result of an attack. In this blog, we’re going to talk about what the failure was, why it occurred, and what we’re doing to make sure this doesn’t happen again. </p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">Domain Name System (DNS)</a>, every domain name exists within a DNS zone. The zone is a collection of domain names and host names that are controlled together. For example, Cloudflare is responsible for the domain name cloudflare.com, which we say is in the “cloudflare.com” zone. The .com top-level domain (TLD) is owned by a third party and is in the “com” zone. It gives directions on how to reach cloudflare.com. Above all of the TLDs is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone">the root zone</a>, which gives <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db">directions on how to reach TLDs</a>. This means that the root zone is important in being able to resolve all other domain names. Like other important parts of the DNS, <a href="https://www.iana.org/dnssec/procedures">the root zone is signed with DNSSEC</a>, which means the root zone itself contains cryptographic signatures.</p><p>The root zone is published on <a href="https://root-servers.org/">the root servers</a>, but it is also common for DNS operators to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806">retrieve and retain a copy of the root zone automatically</a> so that in the event that the root servers cannot be reached, the information in the root zone is still available. Cloudflare’s recursive DNS infrastructure takes this approach as it also makes the resolution process faster. New versions of the root zone are normally published twice a day. 1.1.1.1 has a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">WebAssembly app</a> called static_zone running on top of the main DNS logic that serves those new versions when they are available.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image2-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="951" height="604"></figure><h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2><p>On 21 September, as part of <a href="https://blog.verisign.com/security/root-zone-zonemd/">a known and planned change in root zone management</a>, a new resource record type was included in the root zones for the first time. The new resource record is named <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8976.html">ZONEMD</a>, and is in effect a checksum for the contents of the root zone.</p><p>The root zone is retrieved by software running in Cloudflare’s core network. It is subsequently redistributed to Cloudflare’s data centers around the world. After the change, the root zone containing the ZONEMD record continued to be retrieved and distributed as normal. However, the 1.1.1.1 resolver systems that make use of that data had problems parsing the ZONEMD record. Because zones must be loaded and served in their entirety, the system’s failure to parse ZONEMD meant the new versions of the root zone were not used in Cloudflare’s resolver systems. Some of the servers hosting Cloudflare's resolver infrastructure failed over to querying the DNS root servers directly on a request-by-request basis when they did not receive the new root zone. However, others continued to rely on the known working version of the root zone still available in their memory cache, which was the version pulled on 21 September before the change.</p><p>On 4 October 2023 at 07:00 UTC, the DNSSEC signatures in the version of the root zone from 21 September expired. Because there was no newer version that the Cloudflare resolver systems were able to use, some of Cloudflare’s resolver systems stopped being able to validate DNSSEC signatures and as a result started sending error responses (SERVFAIL). The rate at which Cloudflare resolvers generated SERVFAIL responses grew by 12%. The diagrams below illustrate the progression of the failure and how it became visible to users.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1337" height="1999"></figure><h2 id="incident-timeline-and-impact">Incident timeline and impact</h2><p><strong>21 September 6:30 UTC</strong>: Last successful pull of the root zone.<br><strong>4 October 7:00 UTC</strong>: DNSSEC signatures in the root zone obtained on 21 September expired causing an increase in SERVFAIL responses to client queries.<br><strong>7:57</strong>: First external reports of unexpected SERVFAILs started coming in.<br><strong>8:03</strong>: Internal Cloudflare incident declared.<br><strong>8:50</strong>: Initial attempt made at stopping 1.1.1.1 from serving responses using the stale root zone file with an override rule.<br><strong>10:30</strong>: Stopped 1.1.1.1 from preloading the root zone file entirely.<br><strong>10:32</strong>: Responses returned to normal.<br><strong>11:02</strong>: Incident closed.</p><p>This below chart shows the timeline of impact along with the percentage of DNS queries that returned with a SERVFAIL error:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image1-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1431" height="414"></figure><p>We expect a baseline volume of SERVFAIL errors for regular traffic during normal operation. Usually that percentage sits at around 3%. These SERVFAILs can be caused by legitimate issues in the DNSSEC chain, failures to connect to authoritative servers, authoritative servers taking too long to respond, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unwrap-the-servfail/">and many others</a>. During the incident the amount of SERVFAILs peaked at 15% of total queries, although the impact was not evenly distributed around the world and was mainly concentrated in our larger data centers like Ashburn, Virginia; Frankfurt, Germany; and Singapore.</p><h2 id="why-this-incident-happened">Why this incident happened</h2><h4 id="why-parsing-the-zonemd-record-failed">Why parsing the ZONEMD record failed</h4><p>DNS has a binary format for storing resource records. In this binary format the type of the resource record (TYPE) &nbsp;is stored as a 16-bit integer. The type of resource record determines how the resource data (RDATA) is parsed. When the record type is 1, this means it is an A record, and the RDATA can be parsed as an IPv4 address. Record type 28 is an AAAA record, whose RDATA can be parsed as an IPv6 address instead. When a parser runs into an unknown resource type it won’t know how to parse its RDATA, but fortunately it doesn’t have to: the RDLENGTH field indicates how long the RDATA field is, allowing the parser to treat it as an opaque data element.</p><figure><pre><code>                                   1  1  1  1  1  1

</code></pre><figcaption>Example records taken from <a href="https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone">https://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone</a></figcaption></figure><p>When we run into an unknown resource record it’s not always easy to know how to handle it. Because of this, the library we use to parse the root zone at the edge does not make an attempt at doing so, and instead returns a parser error.</p><h3 id="why-a-stale-version-of-the-root-zone-was-used">Why a stale version of the root zone was used</h3><p>The static_zone app, tasked with loading and parsing the root zone for the purpose of serving the root zone locally (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7706">RFC 7706</a>), stores the latest version in memory. When a new version is published it parses it and, when successfully done so, drops the old version. However, as parsing failed the static_zone app never switched to a newer version, and instead continued using the old version indefinitely. When the 1.1.1.1 service is first started the static_zone app does not have an existing version in memory. When it tries to parse the root zone it fails in doing so, but because it does not have an older version of the root zone to fall back on, it falls back on querying the root servers directly for incoming requests.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/image5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1417"></figure><h3 id="why-the-initial-attempt-at-disabling-staticzone-didn%E2%80%99t-work">Why the initial attempt at disabling static_zone didn’t work</h3><p>Initially we tried to disable the static_zone app through override rules, a mechanism that allows us to programmatically change some behavior of 1.1.1.1. The rule we deployed was:</p><pre><code>phase = pre-cache set-tag rec_disable_static
</code></pre><p>For any incoming request this rule adds the tag rec_disable_static to the request. Inside the static_zone app we check for this tag and, if it’s set, we do not return a response from the cached, static root zone. However, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">to improve cache performance</a> queries are sometimes forwarded to another node if the current node can’t find the response in its own cache. Unfortunately, the rec_disable_static tag is not included in the queries being forwarded to other nodes, which caused the static_zone app to continue replying with stale information until we eventually disabled the app entirely.</p><h3 id="why-the-impact-was-partial">Why the impact was partial</h3><p>Cloudflare regularly performs rolling reboots of the servers that host our services for tasks like kernel updates that can only take effect after a full system restart. At the time of this outage, resolver server instances that were restarted between the ZONEMD change and the DNSSEC invalidation did not contribute to impact. If they had restarted during this two-week period, they would have failed to load the root zone on startup and fallen back to resolving by sending DNS queries to root servers instead. In addition, the resolver uses a technique called serve stale (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8767">RFC 8767</a>) with the purpose of being able to continue to serve popular records from a potentially stale cache to limit the impact. A record is considered to be stale once the TTL amount of seconds has passed since the record was retrieved from upstream. &nbsp;This prevented a total outage; impact was mainly felt in our largest data centers which had many servers that had not restarted the 1.1.1.1 service in that timeframe.</p><p>This incident had widespread impact, and we take the availability of our services very seriously. We have identified several areas of improvement and will continue to work on uncovering any other gaps that could cause a recurrence.</p><p>Here is what we are working on immediately:</p><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: We’re adding alerts to notify when static_zone serves a stale root zone file. It should not have been the case that serving a stale root zone file went unnoticed for as long as it did. If we had been monitoring this better, with the caching that exists, there would have been no impact. It is our goal to protect our customers and their users from upstream changes.</p><p><strong>Resilience:</strong> We will re-evaluate how we ingest and distribute the root zone internally. Our ingestion and distribution pipelines should handle new RRTYPEs seamlessly, and any brief interruption to the pipeline should be invisible to end users.</p><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Despite having tests in place around this problem, including tests related to unreleased changes in parsing the new ZONEMD records, we did not adequately test what happens when the root zone fails to parse. We will improve our test coverage and the related processes.</p><p><strong>Architecture</strong>: We should not use stale copies of the root zone past a certain point. While it’s certainly possible to continue to use stale root zone data for a limited amount of time, past a certain point there are unacceptable operational risks. We will take measures to ensure that the lifetime of cached root zone data is better managed as described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806">RFC 8806: Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>We are deeply sorry that this incident happened. There is one clear message from this incident: do not ever assume that something is not going to change! &nbsp;Many modern systems are built with a long chain of libraries that are pulled into the final executable, each one of those may have bugs or may not be updated early enough for programs to operate correctly when changes in input happen. We understand how important it is to have good testing in place that allows detection of regressions and systems and components that fail gracefully on changes to input. We understand that we need to always assume that “format” changes in the most critical systems of the internet (DNS and BGP) are going to have an impact.</p><p>We have a lot to follow up on internally and are working around the clock to make sure something like this does not happen again.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Modern code generation tools use AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate functional and complete code. While such tools are becoming popular and widely available for developers, using these tools is often accompanied by security challenges. Therefore, it is important to assess the quality of the generated code, especially in terms of its security. Researchers have recently explored various aspects of code generation tools, including security. However, many open questions about the security of the generated code require further investigation, especially the security issues of automatically generated code in the wild. To this end, we conducted an empirical study by analyzing the security weaknesses in code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot that are found as part of publicly available projects hosted on GitHub. The goal is to investigate the types of security issues and their scale in real-world scenarios (rather than crafted scenarios). To this end, we identified 435 code snippets generated by Copilot from publicly available projects. We then conducted extensive security analysis to identify Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) instances in these code snippets. The results show that (1) 35.8% of Copilot generated code snippets contain CWEs, and those issues are spread across multiple languages, (2) the security weaknesses are diverse and related to 42 different CWEs, in which CWE-78: OS Command Injection, CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, and CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions occurred the most frequently, and (3) among the 42 CWEs identified, 11 of those belong to the currently recognized 2022 CWE Top-25. Our findings confirm that developers should be careful when adding code generated by Copilot (and similar AI code generation tools) and should also run appropriate security checks as they accept the suggested code.

<p dir="auto">In the arrow file generation, sha256 digest is used to detect duplication/etc.
This inflates the size of the rows. Even tho it's slightly less than long directory names.
Perhaps using short rev-parse for sha256 may be better, find something like 7-characters unique combinations
And use that instead of the long sha256 form.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-version-compatibility" dir="auto"><a href="#version-compatibility">version compatibility.</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">After a bit of testing, it seems most of the types are compatible between versions, so only when they differ would they make part of the protocol version.
Since I started this exercise on protocol87702, all types would be relative to it. That is, most modules would re-use protocol87702 as much as possible.
This explains why old-er versions such as 75689 would still reference 87702 as much as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">The generator above thus would show example code <code>S2ProtoResult</code> created in favour of unwrapping/panic'ing.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-is-becoming-its-own-company/">https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-is-becoming-its-own-company/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37769962">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>Today we’re <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231004777364/en/Yahoo-Spins-Out-Vespa-Its-Enterprise-AI-Scaling-Engine-as-an-Independent-Company">announcing</a> that we’re spinning Vespa.ai out of Yahoo 
as a separate company: <a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa.ai</a>.
Vespa began as a project to solve Yahoo’s use cases in search, recommendation, and ad serving. 
Since we open-sourced it in 2017, it has grown to become the platform of choice for 
applying AI to big data sets at serving time.</p>

<p>Those working with large language models such as ChatGPT and vector databases turn to Vespa when 
they realize that creating quality solutions that scale involves much more than just looking up vectors. 
Enterprises with experience with search or recommender systems come to Vespa for the AI-first approach 
and unrivaled operability at scale.</p>

<p>Even with the support built into the Vespa platform, running highly available stateful systems in 
production with excellence is challenging. We’ve seen this play out in Yahoo, which is running 
about 150 Vespa applications. To address the scalability needs, we created a centralized cloud service 
to host these systems, and in doing so, we freed up the time of up to 200 full-time employees and reduced 
the number of machines used by 90% while greatly improving quality, stability, and security.</p>

<p>Our cloud service is already available at <a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/">cloud.vespa.ai</a>, 
helping people with everything from running quick Vespa experiments, to serving 
business-critical applications. In total we serve over 800.000 queries per second.</p>

<p>While we’re separating Vespa from Yahoo, we’re not ending our relationship. Yahoo will own a<br>
stake in the new company and will be one of Vespa’s biggest customers for a long time to come. 
Vespa will continue to serve Yahoo’s personalized content, search and run new use cases leveraging 
large language models to provide new personalized experiences, something that can only be done 
at scale with Vespa.</p>

<p>Creating a company around Vespa will enable us to bring these advantages to the rest of the world 
on a massive scale, allowing us to bring the efficiencies of our cloud service to enterprises 
already relying on Vespa, as well as help more companies solve problems involving AI and big data online. 
It will also let us accelerate development of new features to empower Vespa users to create even 
better solutions, faster and at lower cost, whether deploying on our cloud service or sticking with 
the open-source distribution. For, while Vespa offers features and scalability far beyond any 
comparable technology thanks to our decades-long focus on combining AI and big data online, 
there is so much more to do. As the world is starting to leverage modern AI to solve 
real business problems online, the need for a platform that provides a solid foundation 
for these solutions has never been stronger. As engineers, we admit this is the part that excites us the most.</p>

<p>We look forward to empowering all of you to create online AI applications ever better and faster, 
and we hope you do too!</p>

<p dir="auto">Sqinn-Go is a Go (Golang) library for accessing SQLite databases in pure Go.
It uses Sqinn <a href="https://github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn">https://github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn</a> under the hood.
It starts Sqinn as a child process (<code>os/exec</code>) and communicates with
Sqinn over stdin/stdout/stderr. The Sqinn child process then does the SQLite
work.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want SQLite but do not want cgo, Sqinn-Go can be a solution.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pure-go-almost" dir="auto"><a href="#pure-go-almost">Pure Go, almost</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Sqinn-Go is pure Go, as it does not use cgo, nor does it depend on third-party
cgo packages. However, Sqinn-Go has a runtime dependency on Sqinn, which is a
program written in C. Sqinn has to be installed separately on each machine
where a Sqinn-Go application is executing. For this to work, Sqinn has to be
compiled for every target platform. As an alternative, pre-built Sqinn binaries
for common platforms can be downloaded from the Sqinn releases page
<a href="https://github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn/releases">https://github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn/releases</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-no-databasesql-driver" dir="auto"><a href="#no-databasesql-driver">No database/sql driver</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Database/sql is Go's default abstraction layer for SQL databases. It is widely
used and there are many third-party packages built on top of it. Sqinn-Go does
not implement the database/sql interfaces. The reason is that the sql package
provides low-level function calls to prepare statements, bind parameters, fetch
column values, and so on. Sqinn could do that, too. But, since for every
function call, Sqinn-Go has to make a inter-process communication
request/response roundtrip to a sqinn child process, this would be very slow.
Instead, Sqinn-Go provides higher-level Exec/Query interfaces that should be
used in favor of low-level fine-grained functions.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-concurrency" dir="auto"><a href="#concurrency">Concurrency</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Sqinn/Sqinn-Go performs well in non-concurrent as well as concurrent settings,
as shown in the Performance section. However, a single Sqinn instance
should only be called from one goroutine. Exceptions are the Exec and Query
methods, these are mutex'ed and goroutine safe. But, since Sqinn is inherently
single-threaded, Exec and Query requests are served one-after-another.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want true concurrency at the database level, you can spin up multiple
Sqinn instances. You may even implement a connection pool. But be aware that
when accessing a SQLite database concurrently, the dreaded SQLITE_BUSY error
might occur. The PRAGMA busy_timeout might help to avoid SQLITE_BUSY errors.</p>
<p dir="auto">We recommend the following: Have one Sqinn instance. You may call Exec/Query on
that single Sqinn instance from as many goroutines as you want. For
long-running tasks (VACUUM, BACKUP, etc), spin up a second Sqinn instance on
demand, and terminate it once the long-running work is done. Use PRAGMA
busy_timeout to avoid SQLITE_BUSY.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-only-one-active-statement-at-a-time" dir="auto"><a href="#only-one-active-statement-at-a-time">Only one active statement at a time</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">A Sqinn instance allows only one active statement at a time. A statement is
<em>active</em> from the time it is prepared until it is finalized.  Before preparing
a new statement, you have to finalize the current statement first, otherwise
Sqinn will respond with an error.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is why we recommend using Exec/Query: These methods do a complete
prepare-finalize cycle and the caller can be sure that, once Exec/Query
returns, no active statements are hanging around.</p>

Wireless charging and being able to use phone as a navigator was a tempting option. However, when I also had my amateur radio handheld tranceiver inside with me monitoring the local frequencies I noticed the scan stopping on 2m band (145 MHz) and awful noise was getting through the squelch.

<p><strong>International criminals used Estonia’s deficient cryptocurrency regulation to turn the small country into a hub of financial crime where over a billion euros have been laundered or defrauded from victims. Now the same actors are relocating to other countries who repeat all the same mistakes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Over the last 5 years Estonia became a global hotspot for crypto companies: </span><span>as of mid-2021, nearly 55% of all virtual currency service providers in the world were registered in Estonia.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Estonia’s liberal crypto licensing system enabled such companies – often with non-resident owners and clients – to promote themselves as EU-licensed financial services.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>VSquare and partners analysed close to 300 crypto companies and discovered dozens of cases of massive fraud, money laundering, sanctions evasion and illicit financing of criminal enterprises and paramilitary organizations.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>VSquare and partners identified multiple cases where the anti-money laundering (AML) officers and managers of crypto companies were clearly inadequate and underprepared for the work and in dire financial situations: taxi drivers, a welder and a person living on social benefits were responsible for dozens of crypto firms.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>When the Estonian state began tightening the regulation and stripping companies of their licenses, many of them moved to new countries in Europe, such as Lithuania. This shows that fixing the system in one country doesn’t change much at all.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>“Usually I was just a shell; I didn’t work with the transactions. I didn’t know what kind of millions went through there,” says Sergei Bezrodny, an unemployed plumber from the Estonian town of Tartu. His public LinkedIn profile claims he has almost 20 years of experience in finance and banking, but Bezrodny is surprised to learn about it and says it is a “mistake”.</p>
<p>And yet, Bezrodny is a former director of 24 international cryptocurrency firms.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk about it really. It was a while ago in the past and I had enough problems with that,” he says.</p>
<p>He now claims to be unemployed as his career in Estonia’s finance sector was cut short after banks started to close his accounts because of fear of money laundering.</p>
<p>“I had to open all my accounts in Lithuania,” the unemployed plumber explains.</p>
<p>“Now I just sit at home.”</p>
<p>The “virtual assets” licensing system established in 2017, which the Estonian state sold to the world as pioneering and innovative, metastasized into a Wild West of shadowy firms operating in the jurisdiction, resulting in massive amounts of illicit funds flowing through the European Union.</p>
<p>The term “licensed in the EU” became a selling point for international fraudsters who used the jurisdiction to inject trust in their illegal operations. As a result, during the last six years, 1644 licensed cryptocurrency companies have operated in Estonia: one for every 800 residents in the country.</p>
<p>Forty percent of those are related to just three company formation agencies in Estonia.Two of them provided “AML (anti-money laundering) compliance officers” to the companies. VSquare and its partners Delfi (Estonia), Siena (Lithuania), Fronstory.pl (Poland), Paper Trail Media, <span>Der Spiegel, ZDF (Germany) and Der Standard (Austria)</span> have established that many of the “specialists” hired by these crypto firms had no background whatsoever in money laundering compliance and were people with financial difficulties seeking a quick paycheck.</p>
<p>We identified a taxi driver in deep debt, a welder banned from any business activities, a person living in subsidized housing, and an unemployed plumber, who collectively were responsible for more than 60 crypto companies as either an official director or AML officer.</p>
<p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="<iframe src=&quot;https://r.muu.ee/55069/111397/index.html&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;></iframe>" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking through <a href="https://r.muu.ee/55069/111397/index.html">hundreds of licensed companies</a>, we found Russian intelligence ties, vast money laundering operations, dozens of cases of international fraud, and a serious lack of transparency: hired actors, fake profiles, and fraudulent owners of the companies.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Our methodology:</strong></p>
<p>We requested data on virtual service provider licenses in Estonia from 2017-2022 from the <a href="https://mtr.ttja.ee/"><span>Estonian Registry of Economic Activity</span></a>. The data included 1644 companies, license numbers, dates, addresses, bank accounts and information about the people applying for the license on behalf of the companies. Then we combined this data with financial and historical records from the Estonian company registry, shedding light on international affiliations and beneficial owners.</p>
<p>Next, we combined this data with similar datasets from Lithuania and cross-referenced all the companies with crowd-sourced financial intelligence service <a href="https://fintelegram.com/"><span>Fintelegram</span></a> for any existing public warnings. After analyzing the data we identified and looked further into 291 out of the 1,644 companies that matched several of our specific criteria: they hadn’t voluntarily waived the license; they had established ties with a crypto-licenced company in Lithuania; they had connections to a country flagged for money laundering concerns; or they had a hit in Fintelegram.</p>
</div>
<p>Although over 1500 crypto companies have lost their licenses since the Estonian state started to fix its broken regulation, it didn’t mean that the operators stopped their activities. Many of them moved to other European jurisdictions like Lithuania, which now hosts over 800 virtual assets companies.</p>
<h2><b>AML office in public housing</b></h2>
<p>According to Estonian crypto license applications acquired and analyzed by our data reporters, eight crypto companies are related to a single address in Tallinn, Paagi st 10. This is a social accommodation building owned by the city government meant for underprivileged people who are not able to secure a place of residence for themselves and who need help to cope with everyday life. The address in question is the residence of a 65-year-old Estonian citizen, Igor Torsin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10857"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Igor-Torshin-credit-Rauno-Volmar-Delfi-Estonia.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="615" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Igor-Torshin-credit-Rauno-Volmar-Delfi-Estonia.jpg 1000w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Igor-Torshin-credit-Rauno-Volmar-Delfi-Estonia-600x369.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10857">Torsin complained about drunk and troublesome neighbors in his subsidized housing in 2017. By 2020 he was responsible for eight crypto companies’ AML compliance operating from the room pictured here. Source: Rauno Volmar / Delfi Estonia</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, until June 2022 Torsin was the management board member and AML officer in BITEEU DCX OÜ, a company that still has a valid crypto service license in Estonia. Biteeu is a European branch of Kazakhstan’s exchange Intebix, co-founded in 2019 by Kazakh businessmen Talgat Dossanov and Shukhrat Ibragimov, the son of local oligarch Alijan Ibragimov.</p>
<p>FinTelegram, a website which regularly publishes investor warnings for cryptocurrency companies, names Steveyx, Venus Exchange Services and Paytechno as scam facilitators providing payment services to fraudulent operators. Torsin has been in charge of AML procedures in all of them.</p>
<p>Asking about investor warnings against his companies, Torsin says that he left Paytechno when Interpol started asking questions, but also insists that these matters are confidential. He denies being a nominee director and officer for hire but insists he is a real anti-money laundering specialist. “They told me that you need to study and I studied so much,” he says. When asked, who are “they”, he only says: “Those who invited me.”</p>
<p>Looking at other licenses of Estonian crypto companies, one can see a pattern. People with obvious financial difficulties and no experience in the field have been used as AML officers in dozens of international crypto companies. For example, a welding specialist, Kirill Saksen, has been bankrupt as a private person with a ban from practicing business since September 2021. Saksen is associated with 22 crypto companies, in five of them as an official AML expert. One of them, ReliabilityStabilityIncome OÜ, which operated a Russian exchange called RSI Capital, has been blacklisted by the Russian Central Bank since 2021 under suspicion of being a financial pyramid.</p>
<p>Saksen says he has since quit working in the field of cryptocurrency AML.</p>
<p>“I’d rather go and weld something,” the penniless welder-AML officer told us now. “I like to do more stuff by hand,” he explains, saying being a welder is more profitable than being in crypto.</p>
<p>Providing AML experts is a common service among the company formation agencies in Estonia who have been attracting international crypto-investors to Estonia en masse. About 668 crypto companies can be traced back to only three formation agencies. For example, Eesti Firma (translates as “Estonian Company”), a company associated with 266 crypto firms alone, is related to Igor Torsin’s companies. It lists “implementation and integration of effective payment and AML/KYC (know your client) solutions” as its official service on their webpage.</p>
<p>The company’s representative, Ilja Nikiforov, says that he has no reason to doubt Torsin’s competence.</p>
<p>“We are not going to share retrospective competence assessments of people’s activities, but we can say that their competence has been checked by the Estonian FIU and FIU has deemed them to be in compliance with the requirements arising from the law,” he explained.</p>
<p>Questions arise about how the AML services were implemented when Eesti Firma took on Garantex Europe OÜ as a client.</p>
<h2><b>Donations to Russian mercenaries and funds from drugs</b></h2>
<p>“They smelled great,” explains Russian mercenary Alexei Milchakov in an infamous interview to Czar.tv. Milchakov was describing how he deeply enjoys the smell of burning bodies of his enemies and loves to collect body parts from Ukrainians as trophies.</p>
<p>In his youth, he went viral for decapitating a puppy.</p>
<p>He is the founder and leading figure of the neo-nazi Rusich private military group, which has fought in Ukraine since the Russian invasion of the country’s Eastern region in 2014. Rusich – which was at the heart of the foundation of Wagner PMC – is one of the most infamous military groups who has fought for Russia in Ukraine.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="666" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4.jpg 593w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image4-534x600.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10851">Rusich Telegram channel applauded the video of the beheading of an Ukrainian prisoner of war (without taking responsibility for it), explaining: “You will be surprised how many of these videos will gradually pop up”.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Donating money to this kind of organization via the traditional banking system would be very difficult, because of the tight money laundering regulations and SWIFT sanctions against Russia, but Rusich’s numerous crypto wallets show how the military group has been able to amass hundreds of thousands of euros in donations via cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In April 2022, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the cryptocurrency company with offices in the Moscow Federation building but operated from the Estonian jurisdiction – Garantex Europe OÜ. Earlier, in November 2021, it had already sanctioned another Estonian company related to Chatex (Izibits OÜ, formerly managed by plumber Bezrodnoi), a Telegram-based crypto exchange which also operates from the same highrise in Moscow. Both exchanges are associated with huge criminal revenues.</p>
<p>With the help of OCCRP’s Investigative Dashboard we looked into nine Rusich cryptocurrency wallets used in its fundraising campaigns. The Elliptic blockchain analysis tool indicates that the crypto wallets related to Rusich have raised around 200 000 EUR in total. For example, Elliptic indicates that about $8,697.26 has traveled from Garantex to Rusich and $5,122.92 from Rusich to Garantex. This means that whoever ran Rusich donation campaigns used (among others) Garantex to circumvent the sanctions regimes of Western countries and the banking sector.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10848"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1.png" alt="" width="1009" height="444" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1.png 1009w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image1-600x264.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10848">A cluster of wallets transact between each other mixing the Rusich and Garantex Europe funds making it very difficult to track the source of these funds. This is an example on one of the eight Rusich wallets we analyzed.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The flow to Rusich wallets represents only a small part of the illicit funds funneled via the Garantex exchange. According to materials provided to us by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) citing the Global Ledger blockchain analysis tool, Garantex has exchanged huge revenues with Hydra – a now-defunct Russian darknet market dealing in illegal goods, drugs, documents and enabling money laundering services.</p>
<p>Hydra’s wallets received about 2,505 bitcoins originating from Garantex between April 2021 and April 2022, while it was operated from Estonia. In turn, 966 bitcoins originating from Hydra wallets reached Garantex Europe wallets. According to bitcoin’s value in that timeframe, that amounts to at least 138,6 million euros in revenue connected to a criminal marketplace selling drugs and offering money laundering services.</p>
<p>For example, Garantex also has a connection to a number of wallets transacting with the Lazarus Group, a North-Korean cyber criminal group, and with Ivan Vasilyevich Vakhromeyev (a.k.a. “Mushroom”), a wanted cybercriminal connected to Conti, a cybercriminal group with Russian intelligence ties. According to the US, Garantex’ illicit transactions with Conti amount to $6 million. Also in this network is Blacksprut, a Russian-language, drug-focused darknet marketplace which has won over many of Hydra’s former clients.</p>
<p>In December 2021, five months before Garantex got sanctioned in the US, its “offices” (actually a room provided by a law firm) in Tallinn were raided by the Estonian FIU. The FIU determined from their findings that in 90% of the cases, Garantex had not checked the identities of their clients at all. The company did not present suspicious activity reports to the FIU.</p>
<p>The FIU stripped Garantex Europe’s license on February 24 2022 (the day when Russia started the full-fledged war against Ukraine) but that didn’t stop the company from continuing business. VSquare partner Delfi found out that as a result, Estonia’s state prosecutors’ office started a criminal investigation into Garantex Europe and its management board in Estonia on the basis of unauthorized economic activities. <span>According to the sources of Russian investigative journalists from Dossier Center, Garantex has been active during the war in Ukraine, enabling people to convert cash into cryptocurrency and move it abroad during the sanctions regimes, and its ownership also has ties to people associated with Russian intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<h2><b>The anonymous ruble problem</b></h2>
<p>On June 26,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-26/russians-appeared-to-seek-refuge-in-crypto-during-wagner-revolt?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner"><span> Bloomberg reported</span></a> how the short-lived uprising of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his private army Wagner PMC in Russia generated significant traffic in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting that blockchain has become an important channel for moving Russian assets.</p>
<p>Another Estonian-related crypto exchange called Coinsbit is among the contributors to this phenomenon, enabling users to convert their Russian rubles into bitcoin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10862" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10862"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-16-600x500.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="500" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-16-600x500.jpg 600w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-16.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10862">“There are no restrictions for Russian citizens on our exchange,” a representative of Coinsbit explained in February 2023 and October 2022 in the official Telegram chat of the company.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We can find a reference to the Estonian company ITEcosystem OÜ on the company’s website, which actually lost its crypto license already in July 2020. Coinsbit was co-founded by Ukrainian IT businessman Nikolai Udyansky. However, he has claimed he sold his stake in Coinsbit in 2019, and the current owner is unknown.</p>
<p>Officially, ITEcosystem was founded and owned by a Ukrainian national named Yaroslav Yarovenko, according to the Estonian business register. Managing an international company with a huge turnover has been a great success story for Yarovenko, who was convicted in 2014 of stealing women’s shoes from the Kyiv Zara clothing store.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian former small-time thief, who operated an international crypto company, has no public connection with the business. At the same time, cryptocurrency worth billions of dollars is being transacted via Coinsbit monthly. There is no public profile or contacts on Yarovenko anywhere to be found so VSquare was unable to track him down. Coinsbit did not respond to VSquare’s questions sent via email.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of warnings about scams associated with Coinsbit’s services on the internet. According to Trustpilot, its trustscore is 2.2 out of 5 from 212 reviews.<b> </b></p>
<p>Although the website still has a reference to the Estonian company, which was its main operator at least a few years ago, Coinsbit’s official operating company has now been moved to the Seychelles which doesn’t get us any closer to understanding who is the owner of this multi-billion enterprise.</p>
<h2><b>The creation of broken law</b></h2>
<p>For decades, Estonia has built its international reputation through its ‘e-Estonia’ brand: a small country with a booming information technology sector that has also been the frontrunner in several initiatives, such as e-governance and e-residency. Another success story contributing to that narrative was becoming the first country in the EU in 2017 to establish a ‘licensing’ system for cryptocurrency companies.</p>
<p>However, the regulation went horribly wrong.</p>
<p>“This is a prime example of bad legislation. It could never have worked ,” explains a former government official who was involved in the creation of the virtual assets licensing law and who only agreed to talk to us off the record.</p>
<p>The law was adopted, and by the end of 2017, only four companies had the virtual assets license in the country. However, everything changed rapidly the following year when company formation agencies turned Estonian cryptolicensing into a business model and began to attract non-residents en masse.</p>

</div>
<p>A company formation agency called E-Advisors has provided services to 69 Estonian crypto companies. Its owner, Estonian lawyer Richard Witismann, describes how the licensing system became a profitable business. “Apparently, the country did not really understand what this would entail. But for us, this was an opportunity,” he explains. “The world was full of entrepreneurs who needed to say that their activities were licensed for marketing. Our clients wanted an opportunity to say that a country had taken a position on the legitimacy of their business.”</p>
<p>Asking if his company had clients who planned to defraud their clients from the start, Witismann says: “It’s very hard for me to say we didn’t, we probably did.”</p>
<p>The FIU soon realized that, according to the law, they had very few options for denying licenses to anyone who wanted them. Consequently, when they denied an application and the requesting company appealed in court, the FIU repeatedly lost the disputes.</p>
<p>“In spring 2018, I received a call from the FIU. They informed me that the situation was dire: whenever they didn’t issue the licenses, they were sued,” the official explains. “I told them they should ask for more resources and not hand out licenses to everyone!”</p>
<p>As the situation worsened, the FIU started receiving more and more complaints about fraud from international partners, but their hands were tied.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10854"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="509" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7.jpg 720w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image7-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10854">Cryptocurrency companies started to use Estonian licensing to inject trust into their activities. Although the license number cited in here is genuine, the “certificate” originating from a Chinese company formation agency website is completely made up and a hammer and sickle symbol has been added for unknown reasons.</figcaption></figure>
<p>“At some point, Estonians realized that they had no control over it. Most of these companies were shell companies that had nothing to do with the local economy. They did not [pay] taxes, did not employ [anyone], and exposed the country to a loss of reputation”, adds Polish lawyer Artur Kuczmowski, who specializes in registering companies in Estonia.</p>
<p>According to the Estonian financial intelligence unit (FIU), as of mid-2021, nearly 55% of all virtual currency service providers in the world were registered in Estonia.</p>


<p>From then on, Estonia initiated a massive reform to clean up the system. As most of the companies did not agree (or were not able) to follow new regulations, only 78 licensed crypto companies now remain out of 1644 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The head of Estonia’s FIU, Matis Mäeker, confirms that the US sanctions decisions show how these kinds of companies helped finance Russian mercenary groups and even North Korean nuclear programs.</p>
<p>“But there’s nothing that links them with Estonia, only that the service providers have created their address, provided some random nominal directors and AML contact [people] found in the street who understand nothing. They don’t even know which companies they are directors of,” Mäeker says.</p>
<p>“When they are laundering money, our hands are tied. In a criminal sense or in a sense of supervision, they are not even here. They are here only on paper.”</p>
<h2><b>Sanction evasion via P2P</b></h2>
<p>Crypto exchanges implement the so-called person to person (p2p) method to bypass Russian sanctions.</p>
<p>For example, international crypto exchange MEXC at the time of writing has a daily trade revenue of around 500 million euros and it owns a branch in Estonia (Mexc Estonia OÜ) with an active virtual assets license in the country.</p>
<p>MEXC also offers ruble payments via P2P method: you wire money to a private Russian bank account and receive cryptocurrency to your MEXC wallet. MEXC doesn’t allow withdrawing funds directly but there are no restrictions to transfer the cryptocurrency to exchanges which support withdrawing USD and EUR using the European and US banking system.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10858"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10.jpg" alt="" width="1324" height="461" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10.jpg 1324w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image10-600x209.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10858">MEXC enables Russians to deposit rubles into the exchange via a private person’s bank account.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The press secretary of the Estonian FIU, Õnne Mets, says that this activity from MEXC is known to the state agency and it is currently reviewing the company’s license. “This procedure has lasted for more than a year and will receive a solution when all the relevant facts have been clarified,” Mets says.</p>
<p>The manager of MEXC Estonia OÜ Ljudmila Budnikova confirms that the company is waiting for Estonian FIU to extend its’ license. She claims that the European branch in Estonia is a completely different company from MEXC Global.</p>
<p>“Simply put, MEXC Estonia OÜ is a unit operating as a franchise to serve European customers. This means that the company can use the global brand name “MEXC” but has no corporate connection with the brand owner,” she claims.</p>
<h2><b>Actors and fake profiles</b></h2>
<p>The fact that officials’ hands were tied is no surprise to Nico S. (full name known to the editorial board) from the Netherlands. In January 2022, he had made several statements to the Estonian police because “an Estonian” crypto company called Arbismart had not returned his funds. No criminal proceedings were opened. He was told that the owner of Arbismart was not Estonian and not based in the country. The company had no actual premises there.</p>
<p>But the public had been persuaded of the opposite. The company advertised that it was “<span>fully EU licensed and regulated</span>” and “regulated by the Financial Intelligence Unit (“FIU”) in Estonia”. To boost credibility, Arbismart had published “articles” in numerous crypto blogs. The articles featured Mike Meyers, CEO; Andrus Steiner, CTO; and Dennis Müller, Head of Business Development. According to their public LinkedIn pages, Meyers claims to be from a small village of Risti in Estonia, Steiner from the small town of Rakvere, and Müller is described on a blog as an IT graduate from Tallinn University, except… none of these people actually exist and Steiner even used images of other person found from the internet to give an illusion of presence in Estonia.</p>
<p>A series of videos uploaded to YouTube showed alleged Arbismart employees standing in an office and praising the service. In fact, these were actors. These videos were shot in 2019 in Moscow, at the design centre ARTPlay, according to one of the participants of the shoot interviewed by VSquare. In the studio, the whole operation was run by two Arbismart representatives in their 30s. One of them, known as Eli, spoke Russian with the actors but Hebrew with his business partner. They paid the actors in cash.</p>
<p>VSquare could not discover the true beneficiary of this operation. In the eyes of the Estonian state, Arbismart was owned by a 34-year-old Ukrainian, Dmytro Averianov. Averianov is in debt for utility bills and owes child support. At an alimony hearing, Averianov’s ex-wife described how the man is unemployed in the winter, but in the summer he gets occasional jobs to help put roofs and facades on apartment buildings.</p>
<p>To become an investor, one had to buy so-called RBIS tokens created by the company, which it promised to buy back in 2022 at a higher value. Nico invested one bitcoin in 2019, worth €6,000 at the time. “By December 2021, the theoretical value of my assets in RBIS tokens plus arbitrage gains was around €95,000,” he explains. Soon enough, however, investors began to understand that there was no promised buyback programme.</p>
<p>Finally, Arbismart paid Nico back €6,000 in January 2022. However, Arbismart kept his bitcoin – the coin was worth €40,000 by then. Others were not so lucky. Telegram victims’ chats indicate that numerous clients have still received nothing and the amounts lost range up to €50,000.</p>
<p>In February 2022, Arbismart wrote on Telegram that the Estonian FIU had introduced “draconian new regulations” in Estonia and Arbismart planned to move to Lithuania, where “the regulator body brings greater experience” and “offers a more welcoming environment for Fintech companies’.</p>
<p>In September 2021, Arbismart UAB was founded in Vilnius (initially under a different name, changed to Arbismart in November 2021).</p>
<h2><b>Migration to Lithuania: a full start over</b></h2>
<p>After moving its operations from Estonia to Lithuania, Arbismart continues to state it is a “secure, EU authorized, interest-generating wallet and exchange”.</p>
<p>After moving to Lithuania, Arbismart indicated another Ukrainian owner: Pavlo Havrylov, with an address in Nova Kakhovka, a frontline city in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Arbismart claims it has an “active operating authorization issued by the Lithuanian FCIS” – the Financial Crime Investigation Service. The FCIS doesn’t issue licenses or any other kind of “authorization” to crypto exchanges, the deputy chief of FCIS Audrius Valeika told VSquare.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only part of Arbismart’s official statements that isn’t exactly true. The company claims it is required to provide “adequate operational capital”. In fact Lithuania and Estonia have tried to tackle the crypto companies by demanding a minimum share capital from the operators. In Lithuania it has to be at least 125,000 euros in share capital. Arbismart’s share capital is 2,500 euros.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10855"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image9.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image9.jpg 1200w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image9-600x315.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10855">Arbismart’s official premises in Lithuania are limited to 12 square meters in this Soviet-era industrial complex. Source: Andrius Švitra / Siena</figcaption></figure>
<p>In an attempt to reach Arbismart for comment, VSquare called the two numbers indicated by the company in the Lithuanian registry. One was answered by a recording. The other number apparently belonged to a formation agent that helped Arbismart set up their Lithuanian business. He confirmed that Lithuanian law enforcement also called him in an attempt to reach Arbismart, and agreed to share the number for the person he considered to be Pavlo Havrylov. However, that number was offline.</p>
<p>VSquare managed to find Pavlo Havrylov. The 34-year-old Ukrainian confirmed it was his personal details indicated in the Lithuanian company’s documents, but claimed to have no knowledge of Arbismart or any connection to the company in general.</p>
<p>“What? Who am I? This is the first time I heard of it”, Havrylov said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>He said this was not the first time his identity got stolen. “I never took part in any of it. Once I got questioned [by authorities], they asked how do I have these companies where I’m allegedly the director. I have no knowledge of this”, he explained.</p>
<p>When asked if he would testify to Lithuanian authorities if they investigated Arbismart, Havrylov said this is not his main concern now, since he has enlisted in the Ukrainian army.</p>
<p>Arbismart did not respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>
<h2><b>Migration to Lithuania: a familiar story</b></h2>
<p><span>Arbismart is just one example of many showing how crypto companies have been able to continue their business activities even after being expelled from Estonia due to tougher regulations implemented in 2022. VSquare</span> has established that at least 68 crypto companies in Lithuania have clear connections to cryptocurrency firms operated in Estonia using the same brand, company name or internet domain.<span>&nbsp; </span>39 Lithuanian crypto companies have connections to Estonian service providers and company formation agencies.</p>
<p>For example, the Estonian law firm Gofaizen &amp; Sherle is connected to 11 crypto companies in Lithuania. Gofaizen &amp; Sherle also advertise jobs for AML/MLRO (anti-money laundering/money laundering reporting) officers, claiming “the job requires minimal involvement from 1 to 20 hours per month” and is “perfect as a side job or additional income source”. The job ad presents no qualification requirements and suggests it as an opportunity for university students to make some extra cash. The head of Lithuania’s Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering, Eglė Lukošienė, claims this does not look like a description of a real MLRO position.</p>
<p>“It is a full time job. If transactions are happening, they have to be monitored”, Lukošienė told VSquare.</p>
<p>Siena’s intern, a student at the Vilnius university, responded to Gofaizen &amp; Sherle’s job ad. Posing as a potential candidate, she called the company and asked if the job requires any experience in the field. The answer was: “No”.</p>
<p>VSquare emailed Gofaizen &amp; Sherle with a request to comment on the quality of the AML/MLRO officers they hire for their clients in Lithuania. <span>The company did not respond to the e-mail, all </span><span>attempts</span><span> to reach </span><span>Gofaizen &amp; Sherle by their Estonian and Lithuanian phone numbers were fruitless</span></p>
<p>A Lithuanian company called CAML claims to provide MLROs to 20% of the Lithuanian crypto industry. In July, CAML had more than 20 employees with an average salary of less than 800 euros before tax, which is below the Lithuanian minimum wage. The average salary in the company is significantly fluctuating, but rarely makes it above 1,000 euros before tax.</p>
<p>In Lukošienė’s view, these figures look nothing like the actual money made by real AML officers. “Less experienced specialists earn up to 2,600 euros before tax. Those with more experience earn above the 2,600 mark”, she claims.</p>
<p>Audrius Valeika, the deputy director of Lithuania’s FCIS, admits that MLROs and AML competency is being faked, similar to what had happened in Estonia.</p>
<p>Another journalism student from Lithuania also called CAML to be considered for the AML/MLRO position. The company’s representative confirmed there are virtually no requirements for the position and asked for a CV. He said that hourly wage is between 10 and 20 euros. Later, the candidate got rejected, on the grounds that the only currently open position does require some experience.</p>
<p>Povilas Norkūnas, the director of CAML, was also approached for comments by phone. He did not argue that his company’s AML/MLRO officers are paid below minimum wage, on average.</p>
<p>“So what?” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about the AML/MRLO officers’ qualification for the job and the fact that the company is offering the job to university students, Norkūnas refused to respond to any further questions and asked them to be sent via email.</p>
<p>The request for comments was sent late last week. In a written response, Norkūnas claimed his company values “honesty, quality and value” and all of their employees have at least two years of experience in the field. CAML’s director did not directly respond to the question about hiring university students for AML/MLRO position.</p>
<p>“We are not in control of our employees’ spare time or the decisions they take regarding their future, career or additional studies”, he said.</p>
<h2><b>Migration to Lithuania: sanction evasion</b></h2>
<p>In March 2022, a YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHeyS19Grog&amp;ab_channel=%D0%AD%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC2.0"><span>uploaded a tutorial in Russian</span></a> titled “Bypassing Sanctions Without VPN.” In the video, the uploader instructs Russians on how to evade payment sanctions via Payeer, a popular crypto exchange and payment processor in Russia. Numerous similar tutorials can be found in Russian forums and websites. At that time, Payeer was operated from Estonia (Payeer OÜ) and it boasts to have millions of customers, many of them based in Russia.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10850" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10850"><img loading="lazy" src="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3-600x576.png" alt="" width="600" height="576" srcset="https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3-600x576.png 600w, https://vsquare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image3.png 941w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10850">In Payeer, funds can be deposited via Russian banks and withdrawn in USD via Advcash and Perfectmoney.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Since its establishment in 2012, Payeer has operated through various jurisdictions. By 2023, it had lost its license in Estonia and reestablished itself in Lithuania as Payeer UAB <span>registering a company involved in crypto exchange activities</span> there. The actual beneficiary of the enterprise has never been clear as with each incarnation the ownership information of the operator has been different. In Russia, its first incarnation, Payeer RUS LLC, was founded by a woman named Evgenia Kosolapova, who doesn’t appear to have any public profile in connection to payment and crypto services.</p>
<p>During its operations in Georgia, Payeer was officially owned by a Ukrainian, Kostiantyn Buriachenko. The same Buriachenko established BlackShire United LP’s Czech spinoff company, which was owned by Dexberg Inc and Montbridge Inc from the Marshall Islands, notorious for concealing the true beneficiaries of suspicious companies. <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/how-a-russian-linked-shell-company-hired-an-ex-trump-aide-to-boost-albanias-right-wing-party-in-dc/"><span>Journalists from Mother Jones</span></a> have linked the Scottish company Blackshire to a network of Russian-backed shell companies associated with suspicious political donations to Albania.</p>
<p>During Payeer’s operations in Estonia, a Russian national named Liubov Svezhentseva was listed as the UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) of Payeer. However, she is officially the marketing director of Payeer, and VSquare was not able to confirm her position as a founder/owner. According to Payeer’s homepage, the service provider also claims to have a financial license from Vanuatu.</p>
<p>In Lithuania, Payeer now declares another Russian national as beneficiary – Ekaterina Olegovna Gorshkova, with an address in the Netherlands.</p>
<h2><b>A mirage of funds</b></h2>
<p>VSquare found several cases in which crypto companies use cryptocurrency to claim that they fulfill the minimum share capital requirement (125,000 EUR) in Lithuania. This method may be used as a way to bypass tougher regulations implemented in the hopes of cleaning up the market. For example, in January 2023 Payeer uploaded an official asset valuation report made by a hired expert in Lithuania, claiming the amount of cryptocurrency owned by Ekaterina Olegovna Gorshkova was worth exactly the amount in euros needed for Payeer to reach the minimum capital required in Lithuania.</p>
<p>The document indicated a particular crypto walled with its unique ID. Several publicly available wallet analysis tools indicate that 125,000 EUR worth of crypto currency (USDC) was sent out from the wallet on 17th of January 2023 so the wallet doesn’t actually have the necessary assets to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>Lukošiene from Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering concludes that crypto is not a reliable asset in terms of share capital.</p>
<p>“The practice you mentioned does not ensure the [reason] share capital is needed, in the first place: to provide security to clients, users and the company itself. So it seems like it doesn’t serve its purpose”, Lukošienė told VSquare.</p>
<p>Similarly to Arbismart, the phone number submitted to the Lithuanian registry by Payeer was offline. The Lithuanian formation agent who provided Payeer with company registration and his own address claimed to have no contact with the client. He also said the company is obliged to move from the premises within 12 months.</p>

<p>Payeer did not respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>
<h2><b>Connection to Sberbank leadership</b></h2>
<p>Similar to Payeer, another international crypto-firm, MoneySwap OÜ, operating the virtual assets platform Mercuryo, set up a new business entity in Lithuania, MoneyAmber UAB.</p>
<p>The Estonian FIU (Financial Intelligence Unit) refused to extend MoneyAmber’s license due to a lack of transparency in the ownership structure and incriminating information on the internet about the service provider. FIU noted that the investor warning website FinTelegram had noted that Mercuryo had brokered numerous crypto scams and was popular among Russian clients.</p>
<p>The shares of both the Estonian and Lithuanian business entities of Mercuryo are managed through the Cypriot company MRCR Holdings. One of the shareholders of this Cypriot company is Akshin Dzhangirov. In cooperation with Siena, the Lithuanian Center for Investigative Journalism, we found out that Dzhangirov is the brother of Dzhangir Dzhangirov, the group CRO of Sberbank, one of the most important Russian state banks. At the same time, Akshin, the co-owner of the Estonian and Lithuanian crypto company, has received about 285,600 euros in income from Sberbank in 2021, directly connecting him to the state bank.</p>
<p><span>Akshin Dzhangirov is a direct shareholder of MRCR Holdings since October 2020. He is the third largest shareholder of the company, after Moneybag, an offshore entity based in the Cayman Islands, and Target Global, registered in Delaware, US. </span></p>
<p>However, data on Dzhangirov being one of the Lithuanian company’s beneficiaries was never provided to the state registry. MoneyAmber, the Lithuanian company controlled by MRCR Holdings, lists only one beneficiary – and it’s Petr Kozyakov, a Russian national reportedly residing in the UK.</p>
<p>In written comments to our Lithuanian partner organization Siena, Mercuryo’s Senior Legal Counsel Adam Berker first stated it would be inaccurate to say they moved their activities to Lithuania, since “the entity in Lithuania was established 1.5 years ago with the aim of expanding [the] company’s presence in Europe”.</p>
<p>Regarding Akshin Dzhangirov, Berker stated he was “an early investor in Mercuryo and the third largest investor behind the founders of Mercuryo and Target Global”. “He is considered a minority shareholder (&lt;25%) who does not exercise control over Mercuryo and is not operationally involved in Mercuryo’s business activities,” Berker added.</p>
<p>Mercuryo’s representative claimed the company was “not in the position to comment on the family relationship(s)” of their investors.</p>
<p>He further claimed Mercuryo has no business relations with Sberbank and has an unequivocal “stance against the ongoing war in Ukraine”.</p>

The series was produced with funding from IJ4EU.</p>
<h2>“Estonian” crypto companies related to more than a billion in damages</h2>
<p>In addition to the companies mentioned previously, between 2018-2023 Estonia has hosted international crypto firms and illicit actors who are responsible for more than a billion of euros in damages according to US sanctions decisions, public claims, indictments, media and victims. Here are some of the examples.</p>
<p>● <b>Hashflare (HashCoins OÜ)</b></p>
<p>According to US prosecutors, Estonian citizens Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turõgin promised investors lucrative profits from cryptocurrency mines. According to the US indictment, their Bitcoin mining capabilities were only about 1% of what they had claimed to their victims. The US indictment indicates that the duo’s scam amounts to $575 million USD which would be one of the biggest frauds originating from Estonia ever.</p>
<p>● <b>FuturoCoin (FuturoCoin OÜ)</b></p>
<p>When Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen finished third overall in the 2019 season representing Red Bull, “FuturoCoin” was emblazoned on the sleeve of his race jersey as part of a sponsorship deal. FuturoCoin was a cryptocurrency sold on international exchanges and, while one FuturoCoin was worth<span>&nbsp; </span>almost $17 in June 2018, it is currently valued at $0.000026. Of the $451,000,000 worth of market cap at its high, only $860 has remained. FuturoCoin is actually part of a larger “multimedia network” called Futurenet, which is a series of pyramid schemes originating from Poland. Its Polish founder Roman Z. was arrested in Italy and accused of organizing Ponzi scams by South Korean prosecutors. Later he escaped the country and now he’s wanted by a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Polish court. As well as his German business partner Stephan M., arrested in Albania in August 2023. Z. and M. have still not been questioned by the Polish prosecutor’s office although investigators have worked on this case since 2016. Futurocoin OÜ never presented any financial statements to the Estonian business registry. Both Z. and M. accumulated considerable wealth. Roman Z. is a collector of luxury, very expensive cars, as well as the owner of eight properties in Dubai. Stephan M. is also a wealthy man. He used to live in Dubai, where he runs a garage for luxury cars called “The Space”. Just before his arrest, he was supposed to buy a villa near Tirana. Formally, the CEO of the company was Paulina Woźniak, who today claims that this work was only a form of “service” provided to the real owners of FuturoCoin. The “AML officer” in the company was Mateusz Głowicki, who in an interview with us denied having ever had anything to do with the field of AML.</p>
<p>● <b>Coinloan (CoinLoan OÜ)</b></p>
<p>According to bankruptcy proceedings in Estonia, 200 million euros of investors’ money is currently frozen because of the bankruptcy of Coinloan’s operator Coinloan OÜ. That is more than 12,000 investors. There are only 133 million euros worth of assets in the company and from that about half is Coinloan’s own token which is pretty much worthless because of the bankruptcy. The company’s founder is Alexandr Faliushin from Russia. The development director of Coinloan is Mikhail Rozhko, a former local United Russia politician in Petersburg and former coordinator in Immortal Regiment – a Russian propaganda organization.</p>
<p>● <b>CREX24 (Crex24 OÜ)</b></p>
<p>Russian-owned Crex24 OÜ announced in 2020 that their customers will not be getting their investments back since the firm had been hacked. Since then, the internet has been filled with numerous warnings of fraud. By the next year, the Estonian business entity was liquidated. The owner of the Estonian Crex24 business entity was Elizaveta Kazorina, whose husband Dmitry Kazorin, the founder of 1xBet online casinos, is wanted in Russia due to financial fraud. According to the Russian prosecutor’s office, 63 billion rubles (620 million euros) were stolen from customers through the 1xBet casinos. Kazorina resides in Cyprus, while Kazorin’s whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>● <b>Finiko (CyfronCapital OÜ)</b></p>
<p>In July 2021, the Russian prosecutor’s office arrested Kirill Doronin, the front man of Finiko’s alleged crypto Ponzi scheme. According to media reports, the scam amounted to about 90 million euros. At the same time, Doronin owned the company CyfronCapital OÜ in Estonia, which had a valid crypto license for almost three years until July 2022. Cyfron is the developer of the Finiko mobile app and is directly related to Finiko’s activities.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to Chainalysis, Finiko’s scheme’s funds were also laundered via Garantex mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>● <b>CryptoVenience/Cryptanet (OÜ)</b></p>
<p>The shareholder of both companies is Oskar Anselm Schmucki, a Swiss citizen. He manages Russian assets via DuLac Capital, whose offices are located in St. Petersburg and Moscow, among others. “Schmucki controls a global network of shell companies and has had close financial relationships with an individual charged with financial crimes and a company with suspected links to Russian organized crime and money laundering,” the US Treasury Department explained when sanctioning both crypto firms. Cryptanet owned a virtual currency license in Estonia until February 2021.</p>
<p>● <b>RR Crypto (RoiRising Crypto OÜ)</b></p>
<p>According to French media and a law firm representing victims, RR Crypto customers lost up to 58 million euros when their investments in the crypto platform disappeared. In spring 2022, the French police arrested four RR Crypto representatives on suspicion of fraud. The arrested founder of RR Crypto, Vincent R., also owns the biggest share in an Estonian company RoiRising CryptoOÜ whose virtual assets license was canceled in July 2021.</p>
<p>● <b>CoinsBank (OÜ)</b></p>
<p><span><a href="https://ekspress.delfi.ee/artikkel/93859615/tahame-oma-raha-tagasi-meestel-jai-kruptopanka-kinni-ule-miljoni-euro">Eesti Ekspress wrote last year </a></span>how Coinsbank OÜ refused to return 1.2 million euros of investments to two customers. The prosecution and the court did not initiate criminal proceedings. There are dozens of similar experiences shared about the investment platform online. Coinsbank was known for its luxurious conferences held on cruise ships and was related to Belarusian and Ukrainian individuals, who in turn, according to VSquare, had close ties to the infamous former US outlaw John McAfee, who hanged himself in prison before his charges of fraud and crypto scams came to fruition. Coinsbank’s contact e-mail address didn’t work at the time of writing.</p>
<p>● <b>Dagcoin</b></p>
<p>In 2022, Dagcoin’s Estonian creators were arrested. They, according to the Estonian Central Criminal Police, stole at least 8 million euros from customers. In 2019, the interior services of Estonia noted that Dagcoin could also be used to finance terrorism, as it was openly praised by Islamic radicals from Jordan.</p>
<p>● <b>VeMarkets (Grau International OÜ)</b></p>
<p>VeMarkets, which constantly changed business entities behind the scenes, was run until 2020 through Grau International OÜ, licensed in Estonia. According to investor warnings website FinTelegram, before moving to Estonia VeMarkets was operated by two now-arrested fraudsters, Uwe Lenhoff (died in prison in 2020) and Gal Barak, through a Montenegrin business entity. Dutchman Floris Waals was the official manager of Grau International. “My identity has been abused and I’m still suffering from it,” he explained to Vsquare. In three months’ time in 2018, Waals and his compatriot Gaele De Graaf had opened six crypto firms in Estonia, which all have warnings from government agencies related to them or have numerous warnings about them public on the internet. Although Waals claims his identity was abused, he was also named the official AML expert in all three of the companies.</p>

<p>Maybe Intel chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger has spent too much time at EMC and VMware. Because now Intel wants to spin out the FPGA business that is a small but bright spot in its datacenter and edge computing businesses.</p>
<p>It never made a lot of sense that EMC, the maker of traditional storage arrays and the poster child for datacenter-class storage during the Dot Com boom, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2003/12/15/emc_eyes_the_server/">snapped up VMware in December 2003 for $635 million</a> in cash just after that boom had gone bust. EMC was looking for some place where it could park its cash and get a great return on its investment. But no one would argue that maybe EMC should have just gone public. As it was, EMC had to maintain Switzerland status for VMware so its partners would not abandon it for other server virtualization platforms from Microsoft and Red Hat, and this is always a hassle. And so, EMC never did build a hybrid server-storage platform that changed the architecture in the datacenter.</p>
<p>To be fair, these deals always make <em>some sense</em> in the financial engineering way, just like it made sense for Michael Dell and Silverlake Partners to try to get rich <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/10/14/with-emc-and-vmware-dell-must-start-building-a-platform/">buying EMC (and therefore VMware) for an incredible $67 billion in October 2015</a> and in just the same way that it eventually made sense to spinoff VMware so it could finally be free – just so <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/05/26/with-vmware-broadcom-has-a-real-enterprise-software-stack/">Broadcom could swoop down from the skies to buy VMware from Wall Street for $61 billion</a> for its own financial engineering reasons. There were more twists and turns in there – including <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/09/10/for-whom-the-dell-toils/">Michael Dell taking the company that bears his name private</a> a year before announcing the EMC-VMware deal to avoid the sharp tongues of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Importantly, Dell also did not use VMware and EMC to build a new kind of server-storage-networking hybrid in the datacenter – something that Nutanix has tried to do – and we do not think Broadcom is trying to do this. These deals are about installed bases and subscription and maintenance streams and extracting maximum value from customers who are more or less trapped on the ESXi/vSphere stack.</p>
<p>When the rumors were going around back in March 2015 – the same month we started publishing <em>The Next Platform</em> – that Intel might buy FPGA maker Altera, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/03/30/why-intel-might-buy-fpga-maker-altera/">we did a deep dive analysis of the state of the FPGA market</a> and how it could be transformed by SmartNICs and other kinds of high speed computing where the FPGA is an excellent choice over a CPU or a GPU. It really comes down to software. Dedicated hardware with functions etched into ASICs are more efficient and CPUs running higher level software algorithms are more flexible, but the FPGA can sort of meet algorithm and function writers in the middle with FPGAs and hard blocked components like DSP engines. The problem is, you have to know how to code VHDL. You can convert C and C++ to VHDL, but ultimately you need to get in there and tune it for maximum performance.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/06/01/how-intel-is-hedging-on-the-future-of-compute-with-altera-buy/">Intel did buy Altera in June 2015 for what seemed like an excessive $16.7 billion</a>, we were also thinking that FPGAs could transform the datacenter. It was clear to us that in a lot of cases, an FPGA would be just right for workloads that do not change too much and yet needed low latency and high performance, albeit at a price/performance that could not match custom ASICs, which were getting more expensive with every node jump. (It is insanely costly at the 3 nanometer node.) There was talk about an FPGA being embedded in a third of the hyperscaler and cloud servers by 2020 – something that was driven in large part by the popularity of FPGAs on Microsoft’s Azure cloud to accelerate workloads and offload network and storage functions from the CPUs in servers. There was talk of hybrid CPU-FPGA packages, which never seem to get commercialized because no system architect likes static ratios of compute – unless they are determining the ratios. Like the hyperscalers and cloud builders, who can tell companies like Intel and AMD what their product roadmaps need to look like.</p>
<p>Intel hedged so many bets between 2015 and 2020 that it is hard to keep track of them all, but it started a GPU compute business for the third time, it bought Barefoot Networks and the Cray and QLogic InfiniBand interconnect businesses (which have all been sold off or shut down), and it bought up Nervana Systems and Habana Labs for a combined $2.35 billion in case custom ASIC neural network processors were going to replace CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Intel looked like it could sell anyone anything. And what it ended up doing was selling very little of anything but “supply win” CPUs as others did a better job getting cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs into the field. FPGA sales just continued along their normal course because people who use FPGAs, and who have used them for decades, <em>know what they are doing</em>. The jury is still out on NNPs as far as we are concerned. (Sorry Cerebras Systems, SambaNova Systems, Graphcore, Groq, and Tenstorrent. We probably forgot to mention a few dozen others.) Intel has hedged so many bets that it forgot what the real bet was and it has therefore hemmed itself in.</p>
<p>And it is no surprise that Intel dropped Nervana’s NNPs like a hot rock for Habana’s devices – and has basically said that after Gaudi 3, which has taped out, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/06/08/intel-downplays-hybrid-cpu-gpu-compute-engines-merges-nnp-into-gpu/">the Habana line is over, too</a>, and that some Habana technology – it’s matrix math engines and Ethernet interconnect – will live on in the future “Falcon Shores” GPU.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t place heavy bets on Falcon Shores making it to completion unless a big HPC center adopts it, and given how Argonne National Laboratory was treated, we don’t think there will be a lot of uptake unless Intel makes some pretty big pricing concessions. Which it can ill afford. Hybrid CPU-GPU devices – the original plan for Falcon Shores, have also been shelved.</p>
<p>So, the FPGA business formerly known as Altera is being spun out into a separate unit and will be run hands-off in the anticipation that Intel can do an initial public offering for that business sometime in the next two to three years. Thereby setting Altera free again and “unlocking shareholder value” as corporate behemoths say when they do this spinoff a few years after an acquisition.</p>
<p>We find this annoying, and said three years ago, when Intel’s chief financial officer, Bob Swan, was running the company and Gelsinger had not been asked to take the job (as far as we know), that <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/10/23/intel-needs-to-engineer-its-financial-future/">Intel needed to <em>start engineering its future</em> and stop trying to <em>financially engineer its future</em></a>. Spinning out the MobileEye edge AI Inference business (as happened last year) or spinning out the FPGA business doesn’t really solve anything as far as we are concerned. Intel paid a fortune for these things, and it should give them a chance to be the businesses that they are and then benefit from them. Spinning them out weakens Intel even if it might – and we emphasize the might here – help an aggregate share price across Intel, MobileEye, and FPGA Co stocks when they are separate. Doing this tells Wall Street Intel doesn’t believe in its own stock, and at the very least, if Intel spins them out, then its stock should depreciate precisely by the amount of value it unlocks in the spinoffs.</p>
<p>The Altera team was a great team, and Sandra Rivera, who runs the Data Center &amp; AI organization today, and Shannon Poulin, who we have known for years in the Xeon organization, will do a good job as chief executive officer and chief operating officer of an independent FPGA company and can build a great team again that can compete with the Xilinx part of AMD. The FPGA market is not going away, even if it is not exploding, and there is an opportunity to capture some of that value.</p>

<p>The FPGA business is a good business, but as you can see – well maybe, because those shares of blue are tough to parse – the datacenter portion of the FPGA business is not particularly large. (Our thanks to Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo for allowing us to reprint this chart.) And it sure as heck is not as large as many of us thought it would become. But that doesn’t mean that Intel should not be in the FPGA business and that it should not have a great SerDes team and a great SoC team and a great algorithm team and infuse that across Intel. That is why <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/02/15/what-will-amd-do-with-programmable-logic-and-other-xilinx-ip/">AMD paid close to $49 billion to acquire FPGA maker Xilinx</a> in February 2022.</p>
<p>By spinning out FPGA Co – here’s a crazy idea: You could call the spinout Altera – Intel can solicit private equity funding as well as public funding to help do the investing that Intel cannot right now afford to do to compete with AMD/Xilinx. The financial separation between Intel and Altera – why don’t we just call it Altera, people – starts with the Q1 2024 financials. By the way, Altera will keep its foundry relationship with Intel Foundry Services, but we presume Altera will have the option to go to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or Samsung as alternative foundries. Right now, if Intel did that with Altera still being part of DC&amp;AI, it would be seen as a failure of its foundry roadmap.</p>

It must surely follow that we’re the most relaxed generation of all time. Agree?</p><p><span>You might find that claim dubious, but if adverts are to be believed, AI, digital payments, self-driving cars and automation in general is only there to make our lives </span><em>easier. </em><span>We carry in our pockets a powerful computer that can take on the role of your personal navigator, translator, matchmaker, meditation teacher, and banker. With so many of our tasks automated, our leisure time must have expanded greatly. Right?</span></p><p><span>It matters how we frame this question. If you ask ‘are we working less than before’, research is ambiguous. In rich countries people work less than labourers who toiled during the 19th century industrial revolution, but more than our ancient ancestors. If you ask ‘are our lives more leisurely than ever’, the answer is less ambiguous. Many people feel their lives are frenetic. We’re not only expected to work a lot. We’re expected to</span><em> consume</em><span> a lot. Ask ‘are we more chilled out than ever?’ and the answer is no. People are strung out, stressed out, and burned out.</span></p><p><span>There’s more to work than the amount of time spent doing it. Carving a wooden door frame for ten hours in the 1600s is a very different emotional experience to jumping between a hundred emails, meetings and micro-tasks for four hours in 2023. Levels of workplace burnout have skyrocketed. We might think we’ve escaped Charles Dickens’ 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century sweatshop dystopia, but our global economy now apportions drudge-work to labourers in the Global South while middle-class workers plug into an attention-burning digital matrix that yokes us far beyond ordinary work hours. There’s all sorts of ‘half-work’ going on, such as checking emails while eating breakfast, and promoting yourself via Instagram while on holiday. Even our consumption has become unpaid work: every act of buying something with a card, watching a streaming show, or using Google Maps to get to a concert produces data that will train AIs for big tech.</span></p><p>It’s easy to brush these off as unintended by-products of digital life, a necessary downside to the great benefits brought to us by tech. To truly understand our predicament, however, requires us to look at this systemically. We don’t just live in any economy. We live in a mega-scale corporate capitalist economy, and in such a setting technology is never used to save time. It’s used to speed up production and consumption in order to expand the system. The basic rule is this: technology doesn't make our lives easier. It makes them faster and more crammed with stuff.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg" width="562" height="737.344" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1312,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:562,&quot;bytes&quot;:271163,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9c525fe-0171-48bc-99c1-53bb8e1887e9_1000x1312.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Ye olde rough path to the meadow</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let’s look at an example. Imagine it’s the mid-1700s and you live three miles from the meadow where you work the soil. It takes you an hour to walk there along a rough path. Now fast-forward two hundred years. The rough path has been replaced with a smooth highway, and now it takes only ten minutes to drive to the same point by car. Surely you’ve saved 50 minutes? Maybe you can relax in that time, read poetry and smell flowers.</p><p><span>But that’s not what happens. In our actual system the technology will be enlisted to expand and accelerate everything. Your meadow will be paved over and replaced with a mall, and you’ll now live in the suburbs of a metropolis. You’re still going to travel for an hour to work, but you’ll now drive at 30mph for 30 miles, instead of walking at 3mph for three. You don’t get to liberate time for yourself by holding your geographic scale constant while your speed increases. No, your geographic scale will expand as your speed does, and this is how mega-cities like Los Angeles develop. They’re </span><em>catalyzed</em><span>, or unleashed, by cars.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg" width="1200" height="776.4" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:647,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:252743,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7e826cf-3cb4-4e3f-b53c-956c3a44a75c_1000x647.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Meadow no more</figcaption></figure></div><p>This principle applies far beyond cars. Our modern lives are built from globe-spanning supply chains that require vast logistics systems and incredible communication speed to make sense. Each technology not only unlocks a new state of expanded acceleration (that will be hardcoded into our lives as the new basis for our survival), but will also be used as the basis for new technologies to continue that process. The vast majority of people do not experience this technology as ‘liberating’ them. Rather, they experience it as something that propagates itself around them, and something they must race to keep up with in order to not be ‘left behind’.</p><p>Consider the current AI hype. Believing that AI will save time is like being a person in the late 1800s seeing their first car and thinking “oh how easy it’ll be to get to the meadow now!” People back then didn’t imagine that by the 1960s we’d be stuck in traffic jams for hours in mega-cities. Now apply this to AI. If we fast-forward a decade, it will have recalibrated the entire economy to a state of higher acceleration where you’ll be expected to do far more, at much greater scale, in the same amount of time. At that point, if you’re not using it you’ll feel like a 19th century villager who finds themselves trying to walk to work in the middle of modern Los Angeles.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://brettscott.substack.com/p/tech-doesnt-make-our-lives-easier?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://brettscott.substack.com/p/tech-doesnt-make-our-lives-easier?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>This is why the stories we hear about tech are so rife with cognitive dissonance. Marketers and futurists first place themselves in the position of our proverbial villager - hyping the convenience of AI - but if you say you don’t need it they fast-forward their minds into the future and issue dire warnings that if don’t adopt it you’ll be </span><em>left behind</em><span>. What they’re trying to say, in their convoluted and euphemistic way, is this: </span><strong>the global capitalist system doesn’t care whether or not you want to use the technology, or whether you believe it should be used to save your time</strong><span>. </span><strong>You will have to use it, and you’re not in charge of how it will be used systemically</strong><span>. In fact, </span><em>nobody</em><span> is really in charge. Our personal desires will always play second fiddle to the systemic logic of a large-scale economy that is blind to anything except the profit motive. In the absence of us being able to get together and demand something different, our system will always just </span><em>default</em><span> towards increasingly speed and growth. It only has one gear.</span></p><p>This is why innovation futurists get stuck in doublethink. They tell you technological change is ‘inevitable’, and that you better sync up, but soften the blow by telling you it’s all happening because you desire it and will benefit. We have to emotionally cope with the state of inertia we’re in, so we accept this circular reasoning. </p><p><span>Let’s illustrate this by returning to the Los Angeles example. L.A. only exists in its current form </span><em>because</em><span> of cars, which means life will be difficult there if you don’t have one. In this scenario you’re essentially held hostage by the auto industry, whose products are the very thing that have catalysed our dependence on giant megacities. Rather than acknowledge that, we lapse into a type of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome" rel="">Stockholm Syndrome</a><span> where we choose to imagine the car as a saviour that grants us our independence in that context.

If I hop across to Germany, people of exactly the same social class don’t experience this inconvenience even now. In fact, there are hundreds of millions of people across the world who view the cash system as easy to use. So, why do perceptions of inconvenience change depending on where you go and when?</p><p><span>Convenience and inconvenience are not absolute properties that can be universally measured or experienced. In my birth country of South Africa, where the pace of life and expectations are different, cash feels totally normal, but in London it doesn’t. That’s because the city is moving into a state of higher automation-acceleration. In the early phases of their London takeover, digital payments companies invested hugely into nudging people towards the belief that cash was inconvenient (through marketing campaigns, and so on), but it’s only when the vortex of automation reorganized the environment that it started to </span><em>feel</em><span> like that. If you’re trying to use cash in Sweden, where many service jobs have been replaced by cash-refusing machines plugged directly into the banking sector (via Visa and Mastercard), it’s going to feel like you’re swimming against the tide. It literally will start to feel arduous to use cash, because the ATMs have been shut down, the branches won’t take it, and you keep getting refused when you try use it. What’s actually happening is that digital payments are being used to accelerate everything, but if you’re a person trying to live a slower life amidst all the others who are trying to keep up, you’ll find yourself out of sync. You’ll not only be culturally shamed for not adopting the new thing, but at some point you’ll simply be blocked, because the foundations of your existence - like the London train system - will force you down the automated path.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg" width="397" height="485.8615136876006" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:760,&quot;width&quot;:621,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:397,&quot;bytes&quot;:142961,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87f163c4-78e3-45dc-ac73-3ee53687a97c_621x760.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“You can use any shade of payment, as long as its digital”</figcaption></figure></div><p>Because we’re social animals we tend to go along with the trend, and because we live under capitalist acceleration the trend is always one way, because our system only has one gear. We also have the ability to edit our memories, so can find ways to convince ourselves that this was all our own choice. That very same adaptability, though, prevents us from using the new tech to save time, because – under a system with a growth fetish – we’ll be expected to adapt to a new normal in which we have to do more stuff and get more stuff in the same amount of time.</p><p>The dark irony then, is that it is the introduction of the new tech that inspires the subsequent irritation at its absence. Twenty years ago nobody fidgeted in agitation if they had to wait ten minutes for a taxi. Now you’ll check your phone incessantly if the Uber is running three minutes later than you expected. And god forbid the driver cancels, because you’ve probably algorithmically planned everything down to the last minute. We increasingly live a ‘just in time’ life because, at a systemic level, there’s pressure to pack in as much stuff as possible at both a consumption and production level.

It’s like opening the tap in a bath that’s already full, and then watching the new water push other water into the overflow.

										<p>Although proponents of secret science like to focus on examples in which it has benefited society, insiders from the very beginning of the Cold War worried that the best minds would not be drawn to work that they could not even talk about. Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols, validate the results, or replicate them in follow-up research.</p>
<p>One research manager at a Department of Energy weapons lab would later admit, “Far more progress is actually evidenced in the unclassified fields of research than the classified ones.” The physicist Robert McCrory, whose own lab received millions in funding in partnership with Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos National Laboratories, was even more blunt: “Some of the work is so poor that if it were declassified, it would be laughed off the face of the Earth.”</p>
<p>We can only guess what, specifically, McCrory had in mind when he said this. There are all too many possibilities. Collectively, they lend credence to the oft-stated concern that secret programs became a refuge for second- and third-rate minds. The wizards of Langley, for instance, considered it a “remarkable scientific achievement” when they managed to prove that cats could be “trained to move short distances.” According to a CIA veteran, Victor Marchetti, this achievement was part of a program to determine whether cats could be turned into surveillance devices:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of money was spent. They slit the cat open, put batteries in him, wired him up. The tail was used as an antenna. They made a monstrosity. They tested him and tested him. They found he would walk off the job when he got hungry, so they put another wire in to override that. Finally they’re ready. They took it out to a park and pointed it at a park bench and said, “Listen to those two guys. Don’t listen to anything else—not the birds, no dog or cat—just those two guys!” They put him out of the van, and a taxi comes and runs him over. There they were, sitting in the van with all those dials, and the cat was dead!</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA nevertheless commended the “energy and imagination” of the team, and considered them potential “models for scientific pioneers.”</p>
<p><span>Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols.</span></p><p>It could be argued that a sprawling research program purposely designed to push the envelope will, over several decades, inevitably produce some strange and low-quality research. But in some cases it is possible to make a side-by-side comparison of US government research with research commissioned by another country that had fewer resources but the same goal.</p>
<p>For instance, during World War II, American and British forces both used dogs to detect mines. It was delicate, dangerous work, and the dogs sometimes proved unreliable. Both governments therefore mounted research projects in the early 1950s to evaluate and improve dogs’ ability to locate mines.</p>
<p>____________________________________</p>

<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>The British just wanted “the facts” and sought out a “trained scientist.” They selected Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist expert in animal behavior. He designed the experiment to eliminate the possibility that human handlers were unconsciously influencing the dogs’ performance.</p>
<p>This required systematically isolating the specific biochemical and physiological factors that might explain success or failure, since either could prove important when mines were odorless. Zuckerman had a strong personal motivation—he had seen the devastating impact of blast injuries when he conducted wartime physiological research with the survivors. His larger agenda was to develop more rigorous experimental methods in animal research. Zuckerman found no solid evidence that dogs could be relied on to detect buried mines.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army, on the other hand, hired a “parapsychologist” named J. B. Rhine. It is not clear why—all the army records were later destroyed. Though his training was in botany, Rhine had become famous for his experiments—never replicated— in extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis. For Rhine, the study was an opportunity to prove that ESP really existed; he had already gathered a collection of amazing stories of animal ESP. Rhine once again convinced himself that dogs possessed special powers.</p>
<p>Army officials found in follow-up work that the results were random, and another study proved to be a complete failure, marked by a “rather conspicuous refusal of the dogs to alert.” But Rhine used the army money to seed new research, and found new customers. The Office of Naval Research funded a decade of work on ESP in homing pigeons. In other studies, one of Rhine’s colleagues tried to influence a cat telepathically to select one dish of food over another. But here, too, even Rhine admitted that the results were “not spectacular.” Alas, the cats proved “elusive.”</p>
<p>The US government would spend several decades on the larger program of mind-control research. And Rhine was a paragon of scientific rigor compared with some of the other researchers on the government payroll, who espoused theories of extraterrestrial and ghostly visitations to explain ESP, and were hired by the US Army to consult on psychedelic mushrooms.</p>
<p>The CIA’s Project MKUltra involved a whole series of experiments on unwitting subjects, using a range of different drugs in order to manipulate them into saying and doing things against their will. It was given carte blanche to operate without the normal Agency accounting controls or need for written contracts. Once again, researchers rapidly escalated their trials with little understanding of the effects. In the first round of an experiment conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, one of the patients, Harold Blauer, was given 0.4 mg of methylenedioxyphenyl-isopropylamine, a drug similar to ecstasy. The next dose was sixteen times stronger, and Blauer was dead in thirty minutes.</p>
<p>When the family took legal action, government lawyers threatened witnesses with prosecution under the Espionage Act. Decades later, CIA Director Stansfield Turner admitted that “some unwitting testing took place,” but testified to Congress that the subjects were “criminal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital.” In fact, Blauer was a tennis pro who voluntarily sought treatment for depression after a divorce.</p>
<p>The CIA also experimented on its own personnel. In one case, the head of MKUltra, a chemist named Sidney Gottlieb, dosed the attendees of a joint Agency-army retreat with LSD. One of the unwitting subjects, an army biochemist named Frank Olson, was traumatized by the experience. Until then, Olson had been an outgoing and devoted family man. Afterward, he sank into depression, overcome with feelings of shame, and would not return home. He told his army supervisor that he wanted to quit or be fired.</p>
<p>Gottlieb was likely alarmed upon being warned about this situation. MKUltra had been approved by the CIA director himself, Allen Dulles, who called the program “ultra-sensitive.” But Gottlieb reportedly had not obtained prior authorization before drugging Olson and the others. As an internal Agency report later noted, participants in this work well understood that their methods were “professionally unethical” and legally dubious, and would provoke “serious adverse reaction” from the public if ever revealed. Gottlieb therefore had a powerful motivation to make certain Olson told no one about what the CIA had done to him.</p>
<p><span>The government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes.</span></p><p>Gottlieb and his deputy decided to take Olson to see a New York doctor. The man had no psychiatric training but did have a top-secret CIA security clearance and experience with LSD. The doctor plied Olson with bourbon and sedatives, and took him to see a performance by a magician, whom Gottlieb was interested in hiring to help dose more unwitting targets. Olson’s public behavior became increasingly erratic, and he said that the Agency was “out to get him.” The doctor said he would take Olson to a sanitarium to be treated by CIA psychiatrists. But that night, Olson “fell” from the tenth floor of the Statler Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Gottlieb’s deputy was sharing the room with him, and claimed to have been asleep when it happened. His story was that Olson had just crashed right through the window, without opening it first, or even raising the shade. We may never know what happened in that hotel room. But at the time, the CIA was training its assassins to first ply their victims with drugs or alcohol, and advised, “The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.”</p>
<p>The CIA was clearly prepared to kill innocent American citizens. Six weeks after the Agency covered up what happened to Olson, a CIA mind-control team went on its first foreign assignment. The mission was to slip “artichoke”—likely LSD—into the drink of another unwitting subject and induce him to attempt an assassination of a prominent politician or American official. The artichoke team was primed for action, proudly noting that they “were ready when called upon for support, even though the operation did not materialize.”</p>
<p>Most of the MKUltra records were later destroyed, so we cannot know what other missions might have aimed to achieve. But CIA mind-control research went on for more than a decade, involved some eighty different institutions, and would eventually cost approximately ten million dollars—about a hundred million in today’s dollars.</p>
<p>A whole new mind-control program started up in 1972, this time led by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The goal of this new program was “to determine whether anomalous mental phenomena (i.e. extrasensory perception and psychokinesis) existed and the degree to which such phenomena might be applicable to problems of national interest.” Like MKUltra, it went on for many years, and cost many millions of dollars. How many exactly is still difficult to determine. But a single California contractor, SRI International, would eventually receive $11.3 million (or about thirty-six million in today’s dollars).</p>
<p>Even escape artists and magicians saw that the government was being rooked, and patiently explained to officials how timeworn tools of their trade could easily trick someone into believing in ESP. So, too, did the scientists at DARPA, who concluded that the Israeli illusionist Uri Geller, the DIA’s star pupil, was a “charlatan.” They thought it was “ridiculous” that Geller had fooled the US government into using taxpayer dollars to see whether he could bend spoons with his brain. They pointed to a host of problems with the ESP and psychokinesis experiments, above all the fact that the people paid to conduct them had a financial incentive to produce positive results.</p>
<p><span>Under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild.</span></p><p>In 1985, the army commissioned a blue-ribbon panel from the National Research Council to evaluate the program. The panel concluded there was “no scientific warrant for the existence of parapsychological phenomena” such as “remote-viewing”—sensing the location or appearance of things through sheer mental effort—or psychokinesis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, over the following decade the army conducted between fifty and a hundred more such experiments. In 1995, another review of the remote-viewing program was commissioned, this time by the American Institutes for Research (AIR). Once again, the reviewers found that, because of flaws in the research designs, there was no clear evidence demonstrating the existence of the paranormal.</p>
<p>But the AIR report found something even more damning. After some twenty-five years of experiments, the reviewers concluded, “In no case had the information provided ever been used to guide intelligence operations.” Even if some people really do have ESP that cannot be explained by science, the point of the program was not to use government resources to explore the Twilight Zone. It was to support actual missions that would safeguard national security. Yet, despite all the time and money spent—not to mention the human costs—the government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes.</p>
<p>Why, then, did the intelligence community and the Pentagon go to extremes in pursuing such embarrassing “research”? For the same reason why they felt they had license to control the weather and alter the upper atmosphere: because, under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild. Moreover, controlling people’s minds was a prize that was just too tempting to resist. And although the government may have given up on telekinetic spoons, it did not give up on that larger goal.</p>
<p>During the first decade of the “Global War on Terror,” the CIA pursued mind control through more direct methods—i.e., “enhanced interrogation.” The program employed psychological abuse, stress positions, and waterboarding not just to make people talk, but also to discover scientifically rigorous and reproducible methods for compelling subjects to submit to the will of interrogators and lose all sense of personal agency. Just like MKUltra, the enhanced-interrogation program was conducted as a series of “experiments.” Here is how the CIA’s Office of Medical Services, in a top- secret 2004 document, described the protocol for recording the application of “treatments” to “subjects”:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA hired a retired air-force psychologist named James Mitchell to enact these methods. Mitchell, too, saw himself as a scientist. As an informed source recounted to the journalist Jane Mayer, after Mitchell took over a case, he told the FBI agents that an interrogation “was like an experiment, when you apply electric shocks to a caged dog, after a while, he’s so diminished, he can’t resist.” When the agents argued that the subject of this experiment was a human being and not a dog, Mitchell retorted, “Science is science.”</p>
<p>Waterboarding, “diapering,” and stress positions ultimately proved no more effective than ESP or psychokinesis, as the CIA’s own internal reviews concluded. Many of the victims had already provided valuable intelligence to their interrogators before they were tortured, and once the waterboarding began, many offered false information in order to make it stop. But the waterboarding did not stop until Mitchell’s company was paid eighty-one million dollars.</p>

Fairphone, a competing Android manufacturer that prioritizes lengthy support periods for its devices, has <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2020/06/18/fairphone-2-gets-android-9/">publicly spoken about</a> how difficult it is to continue to support a phone after a chipset manufacturer like Qualcomm ends support for the processor used. In Google’s case with Tensor, the power is in its own hands.</p><p>Apple, another manufacturer that also produces its own processors for its phones, offers similarly lengthy support periods. Although the company doesn’t promote explicit promises about the number of years it supports its devices for, it released five major iOS version updates for the 2017 iPhone X before ending support with iOS 17 this year. Even then, however, Apple will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213913">occasionally release security patches for older devices</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, Google’s pledge should mean the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro get updated to at least 2029’s Android 20 and maybe even 2030’s Android 21, depending on when in the year the update gets released. But that assumes Google is still using the same annual release cadence for Android seven years from now, even before we get into its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851107/google-graveyard-pixel-pass-subscription-phone-upgrades">somewhat flaky history</a> of ongoing support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning">other services and initiatives</a>.</p><p>Although seven years of security support puts Google out ahead of its mainstream competitors, it’s still technically beaten by Fairphone, which recently announced the Fairphone 5 with a promised eight years of security updates (with 10 years as a stretch goal). However, Fairphone has no plans to sell its fifth-generation device in the US and is also only committed to releasing five major Android OS updates.</p><div><p>Check out our complete coverage of the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, as well as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23660312">Pixel Watch 2</a> that Google also announced today, in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup">guide to the Google Pixel 8 launch event</a>. </p></div><p><h3>Related:</h3></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether such systems just learn an enormous collection of superficial statistics or a coherent model of the data generating process -- a world model. We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. We discover that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual ``space neurons'' and ``time neurons'' that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates. Our analysis demonstrates that modern LLMs acquire structured knowledge about fundamental dimensions such as space and time, supporting the view that they learn not merely superficial statistics, but literal world models.

OpenSSH 9.5 is out.  Significant changes include a transport-level ping
mechanism and keystroke timing obfuscation:
</p><blockquote>
	This attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending
   	interactive traffic at fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when
   	there is only a small amount of data being sent. It also sends fake
   	"chaff" keystrokes for a random interval after the last real
   	keystroke. These are controlled by a new ssh_config
   	ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.4
=========================

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * ssh-keygen(1): generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
   are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
   specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
   (January 2014).
    
 * sshd(8): the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
   subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
   configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
   (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.

New features
------------

 * ssh(1): add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
   to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
   fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
   amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes for
   a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
   controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.
    
 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
   a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
   implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the "local
   extensions" number space and are advertised using a "ping@openssh.com"
   ext-info message with a string version number of "0".
    
 * sshd(8): allow override of Sybsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.

Bugfixes
--------

 * scp(1): fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
   directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
   the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not. bz3611
    
 * ssh-keygen(1): handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
   sshsig signature files.
    
 * ssh(1): interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
   originally requested a tty.
    
 * sshd(8): make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins
    
 * sshd(8): limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
   and don't delay at all for the "none" authentication mechanism.cw
    bz3602
    
 * sshd(8): Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
   verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
   get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().
    
 * sshd(8): correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
    to be sent less frequently than configured.
    
 * ssh(1): fix regression in OpenSSH 9.4 (mux.c r1.99) that caused
   multiplexed sessions to ignore SIGINT under some circumstances.

Portability
-----------

 * Avoid clang zero-call-used-regs=all bug on Apple compilers, which
   for some reason have version numbers that do not match the upstream
   clang version numbers. bz#3584

 * Fix configure test for zlib 1.3 and later/development versions. bz3604

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content="" data-astro-cid-rnrqlda2="">
<p>Have you heard about CRDTs and wondered what they are? Maybe you’ve looked into them a bit, but ran into a wall of academic papers and math jargon?

But I’ve spent the past month or so doing research and writing code, and it turns out that you can build a lot with just a few simple things!</p>
<p>In this two-part series, we’ll learn what a CRDT is. Then we’ll write a primitive CRDT, compose it into more complex data structures, and finally use what we’ve learned to build a collaborative pixel art editor. All of this assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs, and only a rudimentary knowledge of TypeScript.</p>
<p>To pique your curiosity, this is what we’ll end up with:</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="100"></pixelart-demo>

<p>Draw by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Change the paint color by using the color input on the bottom left. You can draw on either canvas and your changes will show up on the other, as if they were collaborating on the same picture.</p>
<p>Clicking the network button prevents changes from reaching the other canvas (although they’ll sync up again when they come back “online”). The latency slider adds a delay before changes on one canvas show up on the other.</p>
<p>We’ll build that in the next post. First, we need to learn about CRDTs!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-crdt">What is a CRDT?</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s start from the top. CRDT stands for “Conflict-free Replicated Data Type”. That’s a long acronym, but the concept isn’t too complicated. It’s a kind of data structure that can be stored on different computers (peers). Each peer can update its own state instantly, without a network request to check with other peers. Peers may have different states at different points in time, but are guaranteed to eventually converge on a single agreed-upon state. That makes CRDTs great for building rich collaborative apps, like Google Docs and Figma — without requiring a central server to sync changes.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two kinds of CRDTs: state-based and operation-based.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-cvrdt" id="user-content-fnref-cvrdt" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> State-based CRDTs transmit their full state between peers, and a new state is obtained by merging all the states together. Operation-based CRDTs transmit only the actions that users take, which can be used to calculate a new state.</p>
<p>That might make operation-based CRDTs sound way better. For example, if a user updates one item in a list, an operation-based CRDT can send a description of only that update, while a state-based CRDT has to send the whole list! The drawback is that operation-based CRDTs impose constraints on the communication channel: messages must be delivered exactly once, in causal order, to each peer.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-delta" id="user-content-fnref-delta" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This post will exclusively focus on on state-based CRDTs. For brevity, I’ll just say “CRDTs” from here on out, but know that I’m referring specifically to state-based CRDTs.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about what CRDTs do, but what <strong>is</strong> a CRDT? Let’s make it concrete: a CRDT is any data structure that implements this interface:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-ackshually" id="user-content-fnref-ackshually" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup></p>
<pre><code><span>interface</span> <span><span>CRDT</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
  state<span>:</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>void</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>That is to say, a CRDT contains at least three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A value, <code>T</code>. This is the part the rest of our program cares about. The entire point of the CRDT is to reliably sync the value between peers.</li>
<li>A state, <code>S</code>. This is the metadata needed for peers to agree on the same value. To update other peers, the whole state is serialized and sent to them.</li>
<li>A merge function. This is a function that takes some state (probably received from another peer) and merges it with the local state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The merge function must satisfy three properties to ensure that all peers arrive at the same result (I’ll use the notation <code>A ∨ B</code> to indicate merging state <code>A</code> into state <code>B</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Commutativity: states can be merged in any order; <code>A ∨ B = B ∨ A</code>. If Alice and Bob exchange states, they can each merge the other’s state into their own and arrive at the same result.</li>
<li>Associativity: when merging three (or more) states, it doesn’t matter which are merged first; <code>(A ∨ B) ∨ C = A ∨ (B ∨ C)</code>. If Alice receives states from both Bob and Carol, she can merge them into her own state in any order and the result will be the same.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-thesamepicture" id="user-content-fnref-thesamepicture" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Idempotence: merging a state with itself doesn’t change the state; <code>A ∨ A = A</code>. If Alice merges her own state with itself, the result will be the same state she started with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically proving that a merge function has all these properties might sound hard. But luckily, we don’t have to do that! Instead, we can just combine CRDTs that already exist, leaning on the fact that someone has proven these things for us.</p>
<p>Speaking of CRDTs that already exist: let’s learn about one!</p>
<h3 id="last-write-wins-register">Last Write Wins Register</h3>
<p>A register is a CRDT that holds a single value. There are a couple kinds of registers, but the simplest is the Last Write Wins Register (or LWW Register).</p>
<p>LWW Registers, as the name suggests, simply overwrite their current value with the last value written. They determine which write occurred last using timestamps, represented here by integers that increment whenever the value is updated.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-logical" id="user-content-fnref-logical" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup> Here’s the algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the received timestamp is less than the local timestamp, the register doesn’t change its state.</li>
<li>If the received timestamp is greater than the local timestamp, the register overwrites its local value with the received value. It also stores the received timestamp and some sort of identifier unique to the peer that last wrote the value (the peer ID).</li>
<li>Ties are broken by comparing the local peer ID to the peer ID in the received state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it out with the playground below.</p>
<lwwregister-demo></lwwregister-demo>

<p>Did you get a sense for how LWW Registers work? Here are a couple specific scenarios to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the network off, make a bunch of updates to <code>bob</code>, and then turn it back on. When you send updates from <code>alice</code>, they’ll be rejected until the timestamp exceeds <code>bob</code>’s timestamp.</li>
<li>Perform the same setup, but once you turn the network back on, send an update from <code>bob</code> to <code>alice</code>. Notice how the timestamps are now synced up and <code>alice</code> can write to <code>bob</code> again!</li>
<li>Increase the latency and send an update from both peers simultaneously. <code>alice</code> will accept <code>bob</code>’s update, but <code>bob</code> will reject <code>alice</code>‘s. Since <code>bob</code>’s peer ID is greater, it breaks the timestamp tie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the code for the LWW Register:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> <span>[</span>peer<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> timestamp<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>remotePeer<span>,</span> remoteTimestamp<span>]</span> <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>localPeer<span>,</span> localTimestamp<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>state<span>;</span>

    <span>// if the local timestamp is greater than the remote timestamp, discard the incoming value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>localTimestamp <span>&gt;</span> remoteTimestamp<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if the timestamps are the same but the local peer ID is greater than the remote peer ID, discard the incoming value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>localTimestamp <span>===</span> remoteTimestamp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> localPeer <span>&gt;</span> remotePeer<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// otherwise, overwrite the local state with the remote state</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>state <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s see how this stacks up to the CRDT interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>state</code> is a tuple of the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp of the last write and the value stored in the register.</li>
<li><code>value</code> is simply the last element of the <code>state</code> tuple.</li>
<li><code>merge</code> is a method that implements the algorithm described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>LWW Registers have one more method named <code>set</code>, which is called locally to set the register’s value. It also updates the local metadata, recording the local peer ID as the last writer and incrementing the local timestamp by one.</p>
<p>That’s it! Although it appears simple, the humble LWW Register is a powerful building block with which we can create actual applications.</p>

<p>Most programs involve more than one value,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-citation" id="user-content-fnref-citation" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup> which means we’ll need a more complex CRDT than the LWW Register. The one we’ll learn about today is called the Last Write Wins Map (or LWW Map).</p>
<p>Let’s start by defining a couple types. First, our value type:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Value<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>If each individual map value holds type <code>T</code>, then the value of the entire LWW Map is a mapping of string keys to <code>T</code> values.</p>
<p>Here’s our state type:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>&gt;</span><span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Do you see the trick? From our application’s perspective, the LWW Map just holds normal values — but <strong>it actually holds LWW Registers</strong>. When we look at the full state, each key’s state is the state of the LWW Register at that key.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-null" id="user-content-fnref-null" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup></p>
<p>I want to pause on that for a moment, because it’s important. Composition lets us combine primitive CRDTs into more complex ones. When it’s time to merge, all the parent does is pass slices of incoming state to the appropriate child’s merge function. We can nest this process as many times as we want; each complex CRDT passing ever-smaller slices of state down to the next level, until we finally hit a primitive CRDT that performs the actual merge.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the LWW Map merge function is simple: iterate through each key and hand off the incoming state at that key to the corresponding LWW Register to merge. Try it out in the playground below:</p>
<lwwmap-demo add="off" delete="off" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;], &quot;bar&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;, 1, &quot;dolor sit amet&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>It’s kind of difficult to trace what’s happening here, so let’s split up the state for each key. Note, though, that this is just a visualization aid; the full state is still being transmitted as a single unit.</p>
<p>Try increasing the latency and then updating different keys on each peer. You’ll see that each peer accepts the updated value with a higher timestamp, while rejecting the value with a lower timestamp.</p>
<lwwmap-demo split="true" add="off" delete="off" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;], &quot;bar&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;, 1, &quot;dolor sit amet&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>The full LWW Map class is kinda beefy, so let’s go through each property one by one. Here’s the start of it:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWMap<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id <span>=</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  #data <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>id <span>=</span> id<span>;</span>

    <span>// create a new register for each key in the initial state</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> Object<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> register<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><code>#data</code> is a private property holding a map of the keys to LWW Register instances. To instantiate a LWW Map with preexisting state, we need to iterate through the state and instantiate each LWW Register.</p>
<p>Remember, CRDTs need three properties: <code>value</code>, <code>state</code> and <code>merge</code>. We’ll look at <code>value</code> first:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> value<span>:</span> Value<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// build up an object where each value is set to the value of the register at the corresponding key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>.</span>value <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> value<span>[</span>key<span>]</span> <span>=</span> register<span>.</span>value<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> value<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a getter that iterates through the keys and gets each register’s <code>value</code>. As far as the rest of the app is concerned, it’s just normal map!</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <code>state</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// build up an object where each value is set to the full state of the register at the corresponding key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>)</span> state<span>[</span>key<span>]</span> <span>=</span> register<span>.</span>state<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Similar to <code>value</code>, it’s a getter that builds up a map from each register’s <code>state</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a clear trend here: iterating through the keys in <code>#data</code> and handing things off to the register stored at that key. You’d think <code>merge</code> would work the same way, but it’s a little more involved:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// recursively merge each key's register with the incoming state for that key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> remote<span>]</span> <span>of</span> Object<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> local <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

      <span>// if the register already exists, merge it with the incoming state</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>local<span>)</span> local<span>.</span><span>merge</span><span>(</span>remote<span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>// otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the incoming state</span>
      <span>else</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> remote<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>First, we iterate through the incoming <code>state</code> parameter rather than the local <code>#data</code>. That’s because if the incoming state is missing a key that <code>#data</code> has, we know that we don’t need to touch that key.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-delete" id="user-content-fnref-delete" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">8</a></sup></p>
<p>For each key in the incoming state, we get the local register at that key. If we find one, the peer is <strong>updating</strong> an existing key that we already know about, so we call that register’s <code>merge</code> method with the incoming state at that key. Otherwise, the peer has <strong>added</strong> a new key to the map, so we instantiate a new LWW Register using the incoming state at that key.</p>
<p>In addition to the CRDT methods, we need to implement methods more commonly found on maps: <code>set</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code> and <code>has</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <code>set</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// get the register at the given key</span>
    <span>const</span> register <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if the register already exists, set the value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>)</span> register<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>value<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the value</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> value<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Just like in the merge method, we’re either calling the register’s <code>set</code> to update an existing key, or instantiating a new LWW Register to add a new key. The initial state uses the local peer ID, a timestamp of 1 and the value passed to <code>set</code>.</p>
<p><code>get</code> is even simpler:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span>value <span>??</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Get the register from the local map, and return its value if it has one.</p>
<p>Why coalesce to <code>undefined</code>? Because each register holds <code>T | null</code>. And with the <code>delete</code> method, we’re ready to explain why:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>delete</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// set the register to null, if it exists</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Rather than fully removing the key from the map, we set the register value to <code>null</code>. The metadata is kept around so we can disambiguate deletions from states that simply don’t have a key yet. These are called <strong>tombstones</strong> — the ghosts of CRDTs past.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if we really did delete the keys from the map, rather than leaving a tombstone. Here’s a playground where peers can add keys, but not delete them. Can you figure out how to get a peer to delete a key?</p>
<lwwmap-demo delete="off" merge="naive" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>Turn off the network, add a key to <code>alice</code>’s map, then turn the network back on. Finally, make a change to <code>bob</code>’s map. Since <code>alice</code> sees that the incoming state from <code>bob</code> is missing that key, she removes it from her own state — even though <code>bob</code> never knew about that key in the first place. Whoops!</p>
<p>Here’s a playground with the correct behavior. You can also see what happens when a key is deleted.</p>
<lwwmap-demo state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>Notice how we never remove deleted keys from the map. This is one drawback to CRDTs — we can only ever add information, not remove it. Although from the application’s perspective the key has been fully deleted, the underlying state still records that the key was once there. In technical terms, we say that CRDTs are <strong>monotonically increasing</strong> data structures.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-efficiency" id="user-content-fnref-efficiency" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The final LWW Map method is <code>has</code>, which returns a boolean indicating whether the map contains a given key.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>has</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// if a register doesn't exist or its value is null, the map doesn't contain the key</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span>value <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There’s a special case here: if the map contains a register at the given key, but the register contains <code>null</code>, the map is considered to not contain the key.</p>
<p>For posterity, here’s the full LWW Map code:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWMap<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>

<p>They’re also known as CvRDTs (“Cv” standing for “convergent”) and CmRDTs (“Cm” standing for “commutative”), respectively, although I think “state-based” and “operation-based” are the preferred terms. <a href="#user-content-fnref-cvrdt" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>There are also delta CRDTs, or hybrid CRDTs, which allow peers to negotiate the subset of the state they need to send each other. That’s one example of blending operation-based and state-based CRDTs. But the fundamental tradeoff remains: sending less data between peers means more constraints on communication. <a href="#user-content-fnref-delta" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>Commutativity and associativity might sound the same, and indeed most commutative operations are also associative. But there are a few math operations that are only one or the other.

If you're diving into applications like large language models, RAG, or any platform leveraging semantic search, you're in the right place. </p><p id="d8d8f0d8-54f6-4f62-963b-e99a2bfc6fc7">Picking a vector database can be hard. Scalability, latency, costs, and even compliance hinge on this choice. For those navigating this terrain, I've embarked on a journey to sieve through the noise and compare the leading vector databases of 2023. I’ve included the following vector databases in the comparision: Pinecone, Weviate, Milvus, Qdrant, Chroma, Elasticsearch and PGvector. The data behind the comparision comes from <a href="https://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>, the docs and internal benchmarks of each vector database and from digging in open source github repos.  </p><h3 id="20c9874e-9426-41e4-8b4f-6552e1e67108">A comparison of leading vector databases </h3><table id="3c84713c-6aaa-419a-994a-8394da97e0ec"><thead><tr id="169c9354-a8c2-40fe-9069-fc4b90f71590"><th id="nNGs"></th><th id="vFHg"><strong>Pinecone</strong></th><th id="BzQt"><strong>Weaviate</strong></th><th id="o:dW"><strong>Milvus</strong></th><th id="ou>Z"><strong>Qdrant</strong></th><th id="@XWd"><strong>Chroma</strong></th><th id="YN}c"><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></th><th id="Dj[_"><strong>PGvector</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="b35c6d6a-c901-41b5-bf42-f36eaf005953"><th id="nNGs"><strong>Is open source</strong></th><td id="vFHg">❌</td><td id="BzQt">✅</td><td id="o:dW">✅</td><td id="ou>Z">✅</td><td id="@XWd">✅</td><td id="YN}c">❌</td><td id="Dj[_">✅</td></tr><tr id="60f4f8d2-e897-4a67-8fae-d438028efb6e"><th id="nNGs"><strong>Self-host</strong></th><td id="vFHg">❌</td><td id="BzQt">✅</td><td id="o:dW">✅</td><td id="ou>Z">✅</td><td id="@XWd">✅</td><td id="YN}c">✅</td><td id="Dj[_">✅</td></tr><tr id="cac3f7b1-0afb-4374-af6a-5a18196074b2"><th id="nNGs"><strong>Cloud management</strong></th><td id="vFHg">✅</td><td id="BzQt">✅</td><td id="o:dW">✅</td><td id="ou>Z">✅</td><td id="@XWd">❌</td><td id="YN}c">✅</td><td id="Dj[_">(✔️)</td></tr><tr id="0b0da29d-10bd-4391-ab7e-90090b7df310"><th id="nNGs"><strong>Purpose-built for Vectors</strong></th><td id="vFHg">✅</td><td id="BzQt">✅</td><td id="o:dW">✅</td><td id="ou>Z">✅</td><td id="@XWd">✅</td><td id="YN}c">❌</td><td id="Dj[_">❌</td></tr><tr id="f1474e0c-a949-4527-9b0a-aa3e3cb3feb6"><th id="nNGs"><strong>Developer experience</strong></th><td id="vFHg">👍👍👍</td><td id="BzQt">👍👍</td><td id="o:dW">👍👍</td><td id="ou>Z">👍👍</td><td id="@XWd">👍👍</td><td id="YN}c">👍</td><td id="Dj[_">👍</td></tr><tr id="9a7e338b-94fb-49d4-845c-e8d47ce750aa"><th id="nNGs"><strong>Community</strong></th><td id="vFHg">Community page &amp; events</td><td id="BzQt">8k☆ github,

The comparison table paints a clear picture, but here's a succinct summary to aid your decision:</p><ol type="1" id="1728bf5b-729e-4f2c-98b0-c759d529c833" start="1"><li><strong>Open-Source and hosted cloud</strong>: If you lean towards open-source solutions, Weviate, Milvus, and Chroma emerge as top contenders. Pinecone, although not open-source, shines with its developer experience and a robust fully hosted solution.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="6a58dcea-f5c8-4f69-bcc7-a746d609ffee" start="2"><li><strong>Performance</strong>: When it comes to raw performance in queries per second, Milvus takes the lead, closely followed by Weviate and Qdrant. However, in terms of latency, Pinecone and Milvus both offer impressive sub-2ms results. If nmultiple pods are added for pinecone, then much higher QPS can be reached.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="95dd7e5d-e4e1-4eb4-a789-474f02f2d67f" start="3"><li><strong>Community Strength</strong>: Milvus boasts the largest community presence, followed by Weviate and Elasticsearch. A strong community often translates to better support, enhancements, and bug fixes.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="6bb96afe-e354-45ba-ba2a-b31e335e6548" start="4"><li><strong>Scalability, advanced features and security</strong>: Role-based access control, a feature crucial for many enterprise applications, is found in Pinecone, Milvus, and Elasticsearch. On the scaling front, dynamic segment placement is offered by Milvus and Chroma, making them suitable for ever-evolving datasets. If you're in need of a database with a wide array of index types, Milvus' support for 11 different types is unmatched. While hybrid search is well-supported across the board, Elasticsearch does fall short in terms of disk index support.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="f2b159c7-6745-4bd3-9e7b-31ba3874f0b6" start="5"><li><strong>Pricing</strong>: For startups or projects on a budget, Qdrant's estimated $9 pricing for 50k vectors is hard to beat. On the other end of the spectrum, for larger projects requiring high performance, Pinecone and Milvus offer competitive pricing tiers.</li></ol><p id="1d3a42fe-e069-402e-87e7-01c2ba17ad45">In conclusion, there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to vector databases. The ideal choice varies based on specific project needs, budget constraints, and personal preferences. This guide offers a comprehensive lens to view the top vector databases of 2023, hoping to simplify the decision-making process for developers. My choice?
