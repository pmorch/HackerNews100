<p>Healthchecks.io launched in July 2015, which means this year we turn 9. Time flies!</p>
<p>Previous status updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2018, <a href="https://blog.healthchecks.io/2018/08/my-one-person-saas-side-project-celebrates-its-third-birthday/">My One-person SaaS Side Project Celebrates its Third Birthday</a></li>
<li>In 2021, <a href="https://blog.healthchecks.io/2021/07/healthchecks-turns-6-status-update/">Healthchecks Turns 6, Status Update</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>Healthchecks.io currently has 652 paying customers, and the monthly recurring revenue is 14043 USD. MRR graph:</p>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="393" src="https://blog.healthchecks.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mrr-1024x393.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Side note: to minimize the number of data sub-processors, I am not using revenue analytics services. I used a script and a spreadsheet to make the MRR graph!</p>
<p>I’m happy to see MRR gradually go up, but I’m not optimizing for it. Healthchecks.io is sustainable as-is, and so I’m optimizing for enjoyment and life/work balance.</p>
<p>More stats (user count, check count, pings/day) are available on the <a href="https://healthchecks.io/about/">Healthchecks.io About page</a>.</p>
<h3>Still a one-man business?</h3>
<p>Yes, Healthchecks.io is still a one-man business. Until 2022, I was part-time contracting. Since January 2022 Healthchecks.io has been my only source of income, but I work on it part-time.</p>
<p>At least for the time being I’m not looking to expand the team. A large part of why I’m a “solopreneur” is because I do not want to manage or be managed. A cofounder or employee would mean regular meetings to discuss what’s done, and what’s to be done. It would be awesome to find someone who just magically does great work without needing any attention. Just brief monthly summaries of high-quality contributions, better than I could have done. But I don’t think I can find someone like that, and I also don’t think I could afford them.</p>
<h3>Growth Goals</h3>
<p>I’m not planning to tighten the limits of the free plans. I started Healthchecks in 2015 because I thought the existing services (Dead Man’s Snitch and Cronitor) were overpriced. I started with “I think this can be done better and cheaper”, and I’m sticking with it.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I’m also not planning to raise pricing for paid plans.</p>
<p>I’m choosing not to pursue enterprise customers who ask about PO billing, payments by wire transfer, custom agreements, and signing up to vendor portals. “But you are leaving money on the table!” – yes, it is a conscious decision. In my situation, the extra money will not make a meaningful difference, but the additional burden will make me more busy and grumpy.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, I am happy with the current scope and feature set of Healthchecks. I am <em>not</em> planning to expand the scope and add e.g. active uptime monitoring, hosted status pages, or APM features.</p>
<p>Healthchecks the product is <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@danderson/112766460393943288">hobbit software</a> and Healthchecks.io the business is a lifestyle business.</p>
<h3>Hosting Setup</h3>
<p>The hosting setup is mostly the same as in <a href="https://blog.healthchecks.io/2022/02/healthchecks-io-hosting-setup-2022-edition/">2022</a>. Just a few updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web servers upgraded to Hetzner’s AX42 (AMD 8700GE, 8 cores). On the old machines, saw a few nonsensical Python exceptions. A kernel update and a reboot didn’t fix it. Rather than messing with hardware troubleshooting, I upgraded to newer, faster, and more efficient machines.</li>
<li>Database servers upgraded to Hetzner’s EX101 (Intel 13900, 8+16 cores). I was setting up new database replicas after <a href="https://status.healthchecks.io/en/incidents/m7Qv7s8KCsVdMVjGvMbpJb/">an outage and failover event</a> and took the opportunity to upgrade hardware.</li>
<li>Healthchecks.io <a href="https://blog.healthchecks.io/2023/08/notes-on-self-hosted-transactional-email/">now sends its own email using maddy</a>.</li>
<li>Healthchecks.io <a href="https://blog.healthchecks.io/2022/04/we-moved-some-data-to-s3/">now stores ping body data in S3-compatible object storage</a>. This keeps the PostgreSQL database size down but adds reliance on an external service.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it for now, thank you for reading! Here’s to another 9 years, and in the closing here’s a complimentary picture of me trying to fit through pull-up bars, and my kids, Nora and Alberts, cheering:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.healthchecks.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pull_up_bars-1024x768.jpg" alt=""></figure>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just after midnight Eastern Time on July 19, 2024, the enterprise cybersecurity
company CrowdStrike YOLOed a software update to millions of Windows machines. Or
as they put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On July 19, 2024 at 04:09 UTC, as part of ongoing operations, CrowdStrike
released a sensor configuration update to Windows systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sensor configuration update caused the largest IT outage in history.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1814361862890307692"><picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 640px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/pinboard-largest-it-outage-so-far-s.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/pinboard-largest-it-outage-so-far.webp 2x">

  </picture></a></p>

<p>Overnight, about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpe3zgznwjno">8.5 million
computers</a> blue screened,
affecting hospitals, banks, 911 systems–as the New York Times put it, “It is
more apt to ask what was not affected.” The answer is Linux, Macs, and phones.</p>

<p>The outage highlighted a different kind of digital divide. On one side, gmail,
Facebook, and Twitter kept running, letting us post photos of blue screens
located on the other side: the Windows machines responsible for actually doing
things in the world like making appointments, opening accounts, and dispatching
police.</p>

<p>They also run airlines.</p>

<p>Here’s a visualization of the chaos that CrowdStrike caused for airlines from
the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-what-happened.html">New York
Times</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://heavymeta.org/images/nytimes-crowdstrike-airport-delays.webp"><picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 640px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/nytimes-crowdstrike-airport-delays-s.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/nytimes-crowdstrike-airport-delays.webp 2x">
    <source media="(min-width: 641px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/nytimes-crowdstrike-airport-delays.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/nytimes-crowdstrike-airport-delays.webp 2x">
    <img src="https://heavymeta.org/images/nytimes-crowdstrike-airport-delays-s.webp" alt="Chart from the New York Times: How the airlines cancellations rippled around the world (and across time zones). Share of canceled flights at 25 airports on Friday">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>Airline cancellations is a good metric, but I want to look directly at air
traffic: How many planes were in the air? How many planes should have been in
the air?</p>

<p>At about noon UTC, 8 hours after the CrowdStrike update hit, someone posted a
video to Twitter that they made with FlightRadar24 showing air traffic over the
United States. It was described as a 12-hour timelapse of American Airlines,
Delta, and United plane traffic that showed the nationwide ground stop of the
three airlines due to CrowdStrike.</p>

<p>Here’s the video:</p>

<video controls="">
  <source src="https://heavymeta.org/images/fr24-20240718.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>It’s not a good visualization of the impact because there’s no basis for
comparison. It clearly shows fewer planes flying at night, but that happens
every day. Was that night different from any other night? There’s no way to
tell. In Bellingcat’s <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/04/25/oshit-seven-deadly-sins-of-bad-open-source-research/">“OSHIT: Seven Deadly Sins of Bad Open Source
Research”</a>,
sin #4 is “Lacking Context for Occurrences, Common or Otherwise”. In this post
I’ll show the effects CrowdStrike had on air traffic, with enough context to
make the significance clear.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-us-aviation">Impact on U.S. Aviation</h2>

<p>CrowdStrike hit on July 19. This chart shows the number of aircraft that took
off in the United States, hour by hour, on that day. It also shows the same
numbers for July 12, the previous Friday. The same day one week previously seems
to be a good basis for comparison–both days are Fridays, and there aren’t any
major holidays on either day. I also plotted the stats for July 18, the day
before CrowdStrike, but it was very similar so I’ll continue to compare to the
previous week.</p>

<p>Note that the chart is for all of aviation in the United States, including fire
fighting aircraft, police, military, and general aviation as well as commercial
aviation.</p>

<p><a href="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all.webp"><picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 640px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-s.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all.webp 2x">
    <source media="(min-width: 641px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all.webp 2x">
    <img src="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-s.webp" alt="CrowdStrike US all flights chart">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>From about 0600 to 1300 there seems to have been a small decrease in the number
of flights, and then a small increase in the rest of the day. Looking at the
cumulative statistics starting from 0400, when the CrowdStrike update was
pushed, flights were up 2.6% compared to the same period on the previous Friday.</p>

<p>This chart shows the percentage change in flights, comparing each hour on July
19 to the matching hour of the previous Friday as the baseline:</p>

<p><a href="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-pct.webp"><picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 640px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-pct-s.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-pct.webp 2x">
    <source media="(min-width: 641px)" srcset="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-pct.webp 1x,                     https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-pct.webp 2x">
    <img src="https://heavymeta.org/images/crowdstrike-us-all-pct-s.webp" alt="CrowdStrike US all flights percent change chart">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>This chart brings CrowdStrike’s effects into greater relief. The hour with the
largest percent decrease was from 0800 to 0900, which had only 261 flights
compared to the previous Friday’s 378 flights, a 31% reduction.</p>

American, and Southwest.</p>

<p>Apparently <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/southwest-airlines-avoided-crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-because-its-still-running-windows-31-fourth-largest-us-airline-remained-free-of-bsod-errors-because-its-os-hasnt-been-updated-in-decades">Southwest Airlines’ ingenious strategy of never upgrading from
Windows
3.1</a>
allowed it to remain unscathed. <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/140301/no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3-1/">This seems to be
false</a>,
BTW. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory/airlines-except-recovering-crowdstrike-tech-outage-feds-noticed-112167272">This ABC News
article</a>
says that Southwest wasn’t affected because they don’t use CrowdStrike.]</p>

<p>Delta Air Lines took an extended time to recover, canceling thousands of flights
in the days following the CrowdStrike update. Why were other airlines able to
get back to normal so much faster than Delta? A <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/delta-days-restore-normal-service-after-crowdstrike-outage/story?id=112299966">terrible article from ABC
News</a>
said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason for the prolonged recovery from the outage was because the
CrowdStrike update disruption required a manual fix at each individual
computer system, experts told ABC News. While each fix can be completed in no
more than 10 minutes, the vast number of Delta’s digital terminals required
significant manpower to address, expert said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m reminded of sin #4 again–How is this different from any other airline? ABC
News has no idea. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1edtfbh/comment/lf9konn/">random redditor gave an unsourced
explanation</a>
that might be wrong but at least attempts to answer the question “Why Delta so
bad?” (DR = disaster recovery):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These “experts” are completely wrong. The core issue was Delta did NOT have a
proper DR plan ready and did NOT have a proper IT business continuity plan
ready. UA, AA, and F9 recovered so fast because they had plans on stand-by and
engaged them immediately. After the SWA IT problem, UA and AA put in robust DR
plans staged everywhere from the server farms, to cloud solutions, to end-user
stations at airports. They had plans on how to recover systems. DL outsources
a lot of their IT. UA and AA engaged those plans quickly. They did not hold
back paying OT for staff. UA and AA have just as much reliance on Windows as
Delta. AA was recovered by end of data Friday and resumed normal operations
Saturday. UA was about 12 hours behind them having it resolved by Saturday
morning resuming normal schedules Saturday afternoon. The ONUS is 100% on DL
C+ level in their IT decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="data-and-analysis">Data and Analysis</h2>

<p>I took raw ADS-B data from <a href="https://adsbexchange.com/">ADS-B Exchange</a> and
processed it through my custom code to detect aircraft takeoffs. I’m assuming
that a takeoff is roughly equivalent to a flight, which isn’t actually true but
is close enough for these purposes. It tends to undercount the number of
aircraft flying, e.g. in the case where an aircraft took off from a field
outside of ADS-B Exchange’s coverage, but it does so in a systematic way that
still allows for valid comparisons between time periods. That is, the absolute
numbers of flights may be too low, but the percent changes in numbers are
accurate.</p>

<p>I counted takeoffs instead of counting flying aircraft because I already had
code to detect takeoffs and didn’t want to write new code–this was just a quick
weekend project.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Welcome to another edition of 5-Minute Whiteboards. And folks, we’ve got a doozy of a topic. Yes, I’m being intentionally provocative. But it’s because things really have changed in the last decade, yet too many of us are still asked to invest in marketing as though it’s 2014.</p>
<p>In just seven minutes, I’m going to try to change your mind about how marketing works in 2024 (and doesn’t), and the hard conversation we need to have with the C-suite, clients, team members, and those who believe every sale can be perfectly attributed to all the marketing channels and tactics that contributed. I’m also trying out a “digital” whiteboard format that’s likely to be my go to for the next few episodes (it’s easier to read, and the graphics can be embedded/shared with less friction). Let me know what you think of this format in the comments 😉</p>

<h2>The Way We’ve Done Digital Marketing for 20 Years is Ending</h2>
<p>Well, marketing friends, we gotta have a serious talk. Because the way we’ve done marketing for the last twenty years is ending. I’m serious. I believe that Rand in 2010 would have told you that digital marketing was all about being able to track every view and every click, so that when conversions happened, we could perfectly attribute them, is wrong today. Back then, we could say: <em>“Oh, this piece of content, this advertisement, this PR investment, this word-of-mouth effort is worthwhile because it turned into this trackable, perfectly attributable series of events in our analytics.”</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t work this way anymore.</p>
<p>That’s because clicks are dying and attribution is dying. There’s only one way forward.</p>
<h2>What’s Killing Clicks?</h2>
<p>“Tell me, Rand, what killed all these clicks?”</p>
<p>I’m going to tell you every one of the major search, social, and content platforms has an incentive to keep you there. LinkedIn wants to keep you on LinkedIn. Twitter wants to keep you on Twitter.</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/zero-click-content-chart-pink-1024x731.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:null,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:700px&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/zero-click-content-chart-pink-1024x731.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>So does Facebook, so does Reddit, so does YouTube, so does Instagram, so does TikTok, every one of these. So, they all bias to algorithms that penalize links and reward native content—zero-click content.</p>
<h2>What’s Killing Attribution?</h2>
<p>Attribution was killed by a variety of things: Apple’s cookie changes absolutely had a big effect when they pulled back on third party cookies inside safari that took a huge hit. Anti tracking and privacy laws in California, Canada, New York, and the EU, and many of those cookie permissions and do-not-track protocols have rolled out globally.</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/what-killed-attribution.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-9185&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:600px&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:800,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:801,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="800" height="801" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-killed-attribution.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-killed-attribution.png 800w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-killed-attribution-300x300.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-killed-attribution-150x150.png 150w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-killed-attribution-768x769.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure></div>
<p>Then there’s the massive adoption of ad blockers. We’re talking about <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/privacy-report-advertisers-and-adblockers">a third to half of all Internet users using an ad blocker</a> on one or more of their devices. And and ad blockers don’t just block ads, they block all of the tracking that we do as well.</p>
<p>Multi device journeys mean that tracking someone, even with fancy browser fingerprinting (illegal in many parts of the world, but still technically allowed in the US), is rendered impossible unless they log in with the same credentials on all those devices.</p>
<p>The adoption of mobile and tablet devices, and the domination of apps that happen inside of them further hides attribution data. All of that in-app activity, those hours that people spend inside their apps on their phone/tablet cannot be perfectly attributed back to the same visits that they make on the web except when it is through the same ad/login tracking system. That means only a few big companies (mostly Google, Apple, and Meta) have access to that data.</p>
<p>And then there’s the zero click problem.</p>
<p>As an Internet user, I don’t click on things the way I used to. You don’t click on things. We, as a collective Internet, stopped clicking. Part of that was the platforms training us not to click. And part of that is our own predilection for consuming content in native formats on apps and websites.</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/dark-traffic-major-social-networks-1024x635.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:null,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:750px&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dark-traffic-major-social-networks-1024x635.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>Last, but not least, there’s dark traffic. We studied this in-depth at SparkToro last year, noting that <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/new-research-dark-social-falsely-attributes-significant-percentages-of-web-traffic-as-direct/">more than half of the major social networks hide some or all</a> of their referral data.</p>
<h2>Show Me the Receipts</h2>
<p>We have the data to back up these assertions about the decline of both clicks and attribution. This isn’t just conjecture. I can prove it to you. We did a study in January of this year with Datos looking at <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/who-sends-traffic-on-the-web-and-how-much-new-research-from-datos-sparktoro/">who sends traffic on the web</a>, and it is overwhelmingly search.</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Datos-SparkToro-Referral-Study-Share-2024-1024x818.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:null,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:800px&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Datos-SparkToro-Referral-Study-Share-2024-1024x818.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>Google, Microsoft/Bing, and DuckDuckGo account for ~70% of all traffic referrals, every click that’s sent out. But, where people are spending time is NOT 70% search. That is not where 70% of visits go.</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Share-of-Visits-to-Categories-Datos-Jan-2023-24.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:null,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:800px&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Share-of-Visits-to-Categories-Datos-Jan-2023-24.png" alt=""></figure></div>
<p>In fact, search is only ~10% of all visits (and yes that includes AI search players like Perplexity). Ten percent. We spend time in social and productivity tools like our email, on news websites, buying things in e-commerce, on video and audio platforms.</p>
<p>If you try to prove acquisition via traffic referral data you will become Google’s fool. Here’s why: Everything we consume in social, news, productivity (like our emails), video and audio (YouTube and podcasts), and specific sectors like financial sites, travel sits, health sites, etc. leads us to potential searches. It exposes us to ideas, brands, problems… things we need to research.</p>
<p>If see something about a brand of risotto on a recipe website that looks interesting, it’s rare that I directly have a link to click. And often if I do, I still don’t bother! Because I’m used to zero-click consumption. Instead, later on, I might search in Google for that type of risotto.</p>
<p>When I go to Google and search… who gets the credit?</p>
<p>Google does. </p>

<h2>What’s the Solution to the Zero-Click, Impossible-to-Attribute World of Marketing in 2024?</h2>
<p>The way forward is to go where your audience is being influenced.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say I want to find the best rice for making risotto. I might search Google to solve that problem. But I might also watch videos on TikTok or Instagram. I could turn to my favorite recipe blog. I might ask the chefs at my favorite Italian restaurant.</p>
<p>Millions of people make risotto around the world every week. But, only 0.1% of them are searching Google for “best rice to make risotto.” If we wanna know how to influence those millions of people, we need to uncover ALL the sources that influence them. We need to know all the ways they’re nudged to buy one particular brand or kind of rice or another. We want the websites risotto searchers visit. We wanna know the social networks and social accounts that they use and follow. We want to know the podcasts and the Youtube channels and the subreddits that they visit.</p>
<p>Even if we’re exclusively thinking about a Google search for the “best rice for risotto,” I worry. I worry that an old school SEO looks at the potential click through rate and says this isn’t a keyword worth targeting.</p>
<p>Right? It’s not worth ranking for because Google’s showing an instant answer. There’s no clicks. But, there is a behavior-biasing result.</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/go-where-audience-is.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-9189&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:1400,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:692,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="506" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/go-where-audience-is-1024x506.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/go-where-audience-is-1024x506.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/go-where-audience-is-300x148.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/go-where-audience-is-768x380.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/go-where-audience-is.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>
<p>If you’rein the grocery store and search for “best kind of rice for risotto,” you’re probably going to buy arborio. Because Google’s big, bold answer at the top of the search result is Arborio. (Guess what: as an avid maker of risotto, and someone who’s been perfecting the dish for years, I can promise you that arborio is not the best kind of rice for risotto. You should be buying Carnaroli if you can).</p>
<p>The problem with doing marketing work to change this result and nudge Google to show Carnaroli (or even better, your particular brand of Carnaroli) is that even if you succeed, it lacks attribution. You can’t prove to your boss that by taking over that ranking you’ve provided any value to the company. Because not only are most of the searches going to end without a click, even those that DO send traffic won’t tell you what keyword referred them. Google killed that ability to see keyword data almost ten years ago.</p>
<h2>Success Comes By Reaching People Through the Right Sources of Influence</h2>
<p>There’s a brand of aged carnaroli rice, which which is excellent for risotto, and highly regarded by professional chefs and home cooks, too. It’s what I almost always use, and over the last few years, I’m obsessed with this stuff. It’s called <a href="https://acquerello.it/eng/">Acquerello</a>.</p>
<p>Acquerello was virtually unknown in the United States ten years ago. But in the last decade, they’ve massively grown their US sales by investing in tactics that cannot be perfectly attributed, no matter how sophisticated the AI-powered, econometrics/MMM software you’re using might be.</p>
<p>Acquerello recognized that to get into the major US publications, they needed an affiliate program, so they started selling through Amazon (even though it wasn’t a great brand positioning match). Then their PR team pitched folks like the editors at Bon Appetit (below).</p>
<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/images.sparktoro.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/acquerello-for-risotto.png&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;aligncenter size-full is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-9190&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:700px&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:917,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:917,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="917" height="917" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acquerello-for-risotto.png" alt="" srcset="https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acquerello-for-risotto.png 917w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acquerello-for-risotto-300x300.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acquerello-for-risotto-150x150.png 150w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acquerello-for-risotto-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px"></figure></div>
<p>Acquerello started nudging chefs all over Italy, where tourists often experienced great risotto for the first time, to include their brand name on their menus, and put their rice packaging on visible shelves in the restaurants. They started a huge word-of-mouth campaign with Italian restaurants and chefs in major US cities. They sponsored events in other European and North American countries. They worked with specialty retailers in the US to carry their product. They expanded their online sales distribution.</p>
<p>Every one of these things positively contributed to Acquerello’s success. But, almost none of them can be attributed to a particular sale. Tragically, most of the very smart, savvy, sophisticated American tech CEOs and CFOs I know, who grew up on attribution models to direct their spend, would veto every single thing Acquerello did because they couldn’t PROVE that it led to increased sales.</p>
<p><em>“Correlation, not causation means we might be throwing our money away,”</em> they’d say.</p>
<p>What I’m suggesting to you is that digital marketing in 2024 is a lot like marketing in 1964. It is getting the right message that appeals to the right people in the right places and at the right time to the right audience.</p>
<p>And I’m urging you to invest in it and to optimize for it using <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/how-to-measure-hard-to-measure-marketing-channels/">lift-based measurement and not attribution</a>.</p>
<p>Because attribution fundamentally don’t work anymore. When you make marketing investments based, instead, on knowing who your audience is and where/how you can influence them, you can massively improve your results.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://jpetazzo.github.io/2024/07/26/cloudflare-images-overcharge-billing/">http://jpetazzo.github.io/2024/07/26/cloudflare-images-overcharge-billing/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41100958">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently went down a very deep rabbit hole to understand why, some months, Cloudflare was charging us 3x what we were expecting for their Cloudflare Images service. I’m posting this write-up because back then, a quick search didn’t turn anything up; and Cloudflare support has totally ghosted us for more than 8 months now.</p>

<h2 id="context-and-scale">Context and scale</h2>

<p>Let’s get something out of the way first: this is not going to be a story about millions, or even thousands, of dollars. Merely hundreds. My partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajbowen/">AJ</a> runs a website called <a href="https://www.ephemerasearch.com/">EphemeraSearch</a> which is an archive of old mail, a treasure trove for folks doing history or genealogy research. It’s not making much money (yet!) but storing millions of postcards <em>does</em> incur significant hosting costs, so we’re trying to be thrifty, since these costs come directly out of our own pockets (we don’t have external investors, at least not yet).</p>

<p>The website itself was initially on Heroku, then moved to a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster (after a brief transition through AWS EKS, which turned to be awfully expensive, despite leveraging spot instances, very tight autoscaling, and the famously treacherous startup credits). Many third-party services are used whenever it makes sense; for instance, the search currently relies on Algolia.</p>

<p>Image hosting was initially using Cloudinary, but we knew from day one that it was only a temporary solution, as their pricing was prohibitive for us in the long run. We moved to Cloudflare Images because it seemed affordable enough at our scale (even though we’ll almost certainly replace it later, too) and there is no question that Cloudflare is an excellent CDN.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The service was working well, but after a few months, we noticed something off with our Cloudflare Images bills. At that point, we had a couple of million images, and less than a million image views per month. According to their <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/pricing/">pricing</a> page, we should have been paying each month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$100 for image storage ($5 per 100,000 images stored, x 20)</li>
  <li>$10 for image delivery ($1 per 100,000 images served, x 10)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, when summing our Cloudflare charges (as reflected on our credit card statements), we reached more than $400 some months.</p>

<p>What was going on?!?</p>

<h2 id="it-should-be-easy-right">It should be easy, right</h2>

<p>You might wonder, dear reader, “Why did you have to sum credit card charges to know your monthly bills? Don’t you get invoices that would basically give you that information?”</p>

<p>Of course, the first thing we did was look at the invoices that we were getting. Despite the relatively simple billing models for storage and delivery, the invoices are more confusing than they should be, because the two dimensions of billing work differently.</p>

<p><strong>Image delivery</strong> is a classic pay-for-what-you-use thing. It’s $1 per 100,000 images served, <em>post-paid</em>. In other words, at the end of the month, Cloudflare counts how many images they’ve served, divides by 100,000, rounds up, and that’s how much you pay in dollars.</p>

<p><strong>Image storage</strong>, however, is prepaid, and you decide how many increments of 100,000 images you’d like to purchase. When you’re close to running out, your account dashboard will show a warning message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your account has 2% of its storage capacity remaining. Please add storage capacity to your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you add storage capacity to your account, here is what happens.</p>

<p>First, you pre-pay immediately (and your credit card is charged) for the whole capacity that you’re using, prorated to the remaining number of days in your billing cycle. In other words, if your new storage capacity is 1 million images, and you have 10 days left in your billing cycle, you immediately pay $16.67:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 million images = 10 increments of 100,000 images at $5 each = $50</li>
  <li>10 days remaining in a cycle of 30, so 50x10/30 = $16.67</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, you get credited on your next bill with your <em>previous</em> storage capacity, prorated by the same amount - that’s the time during which you will <em>not</em> use that capacity. In other words, if you upgraded from, say, 800,000 images when you have 10 days left to your current billing cycle, you get a credit of $13.33:</p>

<ul>
  <li>800,000 images = 8 increments of 100,000 images at $5 each = $40</li>
  <li>10 days remaining in a cycle of 30, so 40x10/30 = $13.33</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, you receive a new invoice; meaning that in some months, instead of one invoice, you get multiple invoices with prorated charges. Fair enough.</p>

<p>At the end of the day (or rather, of the billing cycle), if we went from a capacity of say 800,000 to 900,000 and then again to 1,000,000, it looks like we should pay a prorated cost depending on how many days we provisioned each capacity. In any case, it should never cost more than 1,000,000 images, right?</p>

<p><em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this post, in some months, instead of $110, our credit card charges were over $400, and we couldn’t understand why.</p>

<p><em>And neither could the Cloudflare support team.</em></p>

<h2 id="involving-support">Involving support</h2>

<p>We contacted Cloudflare support in November 2023:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m currently subscribed to Cloudflare Images with a capacity of 2,200,000 images. I’ve been adding many images in the last few months and am regularly adding capacity as needed. It’s my understanding that each upgrade should be prorated.
2.2m images should cost $110/mo. However, when I look at the charges for the month of October, they add up to almost $400!
September also exceeds $116 even though I had way less capacity then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cloudflare replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] we’ve raised this issue with our Images team […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then when we pinged them again some time later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] We are experiencing an unprecedented demand for our service, which is causing delays for our customers.
I’ve submitted a request to our Engineering Team, so that we can thoroughly explain what happened, and if there was any mistake reagarding your Images service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And after pinging them one month later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note that we are still working with the Engineering Team on this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then after 3 more months without an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for waiting. Please accept our apologies for the delay in responding to you. We are experiencing an unprecedented demand for our service, which is causing delays for our customers.
Our Engineering team continues to analyze your case and develop a solution for your issue. We have been conducting weekly reviews of it for the past eight weeks. Rest assured, we are diligently working to resolve this matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After pinging them the Nth time, they pointed us to this <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/wsjmr28lwxw3">incident</a> which was indeed billing-related, but had absolutely nothing to do with our issue, alas.</p>

<p>We assume that our request was blindly lumped into the ongoing billing issue (even though our request dated from November 2023, and the billing issue ran through March-May 2024).</p>

<p>Last time we pinged support again, they had migrated support to Salesforce, so the original ticket seemed to be forgotten.</p>

<p><em>Great.</em></p>

<h2 id="re-analyzing-the-situation">Re-analyzing the situation</h2>

<p>Making sense of the invoices was not trivial, because each invoice will potentially mention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>itemized charges,</li>
  <li>an “available balance”,</li>
  <li>a “previous balance”,</li>
  <li>a “starting balance”,</li>
  <li>a list of payments and credits.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a lot of different balances, with quite confusing names. To make sense of it, we ended up painstakingly entering all the transactions (meaning charges, payments, credits) into a spreadsheet, to try and see which balance actually corresponded to what, and to try to understand if and how we had been overcharged. That took a few hours of data entry, but eventually, it gave us the following graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://jpetazzo.github.io/assets/cloudflare-images-charges.png" alt="Graph of our charges, payments, credits, and running balance"></p>

<p>And that’s finally what helped us to understand what was going on.</p>

<h2 id="the-explanation">The explanation</h2>

<p>When you change your provisioned image storage on Cloudflare Images, you pay for the new capacity upfront: your credit card gets charged immediately. Sure, it’s prorated by the time remaining on your billing cycle, but the money goes out <em>immediately</em>. You get a credit for the old capacity that you won’t use, but that credit will only show up on your next monthly bill.</p>

<p>Consider the extreme case where you would, at the beginning of your billing cycle, increase your capacity 5 times: each time, you pay for that capacity upfront; and you get a credit for the previous capacity but that credit only materializes the following month. On the next bill, you will see a very high negative balance (indicating that Cloudflare owes you a bunch of money) and your credit card will be charged less (or even not at all) that month, so things will eventually balance out. But in the meantime, you’re accruing these credit card charges.</p>

<p>In the end, this means that Cloudflare was indeed overcharging us, but only temporarily: if enough time passes during which we <em>do not</em> change our image storage capacity, the balance should eventually go down until Cloudflare doesn’t owe us money anymore.</p>

<p>The problem is that “changing capacity” is precisely the whole point of the hecking cloud. “Pay for what you use”. The first time I racked a machine in a datacenter in the 90s, I think we had at least a yearly commitment. In the 2000s it was fairly common to rent servers by the month, and by 2010 multiple cloud providers would let you rent machines by the hour, and then by the minute.</p>

<p>I don’t know why Cloudflare decided to have this extremely weird mix of post-paid, cloud-like billing (for image delivery) and prepaid, not-cloudlike-at-all billing (for image storage), but here we are.</p>

<h2 id="is-cloudflare-images-any-good">Is Cloudflare Images any good?</h2>

<p>We’re happy with the quality of the Cloudflare Images service, but our needs are very modest, and it’s definitely overpriced for our use-case.</p>

<p>If you need to store and serve <em>big</em> images (thousands of pixels in each dimension) and to resize them efficiently, Cloudflare Images might be interesting for you, because the pricing is exclusively based on the number of images, not their size. In our case, our images are typically in the 100KB-1MB range, and we only need a small number of variants for each of them.</p>

<p>It’s likely that we will replace Cloudflare Images in the long run. Looking at storage costs alone, S3 would be 4 times less expensive <em>for our use-case</em>. And when we scale our image collection 10x, other solutions (like a couple of replicated, dedicated servers with 20 TB SATA disks) become 20x cheaper.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-and-thoughts">Conclusions and thoughts</h2>

<p>Many “indie” projects can easily fit on very cheap infrastructure and services, sometimes well within the free tier of some generous hosting providers.</p>

<p>In our case, however, the current scale of our collection (a few terabytes at the moment, and constantly growing) compared to the very low revenue (a trickle of sales commissions whenever someone ends up buying on eBay a postcard that they found through <a href="https://www.ephemerasearch.com/">EphemeraSearch</a>) means that we have to be very efficient with our (personal) funds.</p>

<p>In the IT industry, we often talk about “buy vs. build”. Over time, as we gain more experience and understand the complexity of the things we build, we often prefer to buy a quality service rather than cobble together a crappy version of our own, arguing that the time spent building it would better be invested somewhere else. In our situation, however, the bargain turns out a bit differently: now that this is <em>my</em> money, do I want to pay $1000/month for a service, or build it myself and run it on a $100/month server? How much time do I need to build and run that service; and can I reliably make $900/month by e.g. selling consulting services to cover that cost instead?</p>

<p>Preserving historical artifacts is not, unfortunately, something that investors or the capitalist system in general tend to favor. Let’s hope that this changes in the future, but in the meantime, follow us for more thrifty and scrappy hosting tips ! 😁💸</p>

<p><em>This post was reviewed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajbowen/">AJ Bowen</a>. Any remaining typo or mistake is mine. We want to clarify that we think that Cloudflare Images is a great service, but that its pricing model (specifically, the prepaid aspect that has to be manually adjusted) is utterly borked. We hope our findings will be helpful to others!</em></p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! We're Tim and Zi from Roame (<a href="https://roame.travel/">https://roame.travel</a>). Roame is a flight search engine that lets you find and redeem business class flights using points and miles, rather than exorbitant amounts of cash. Here's a demo video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixXuyhofgo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fixXuyhofgo</a>
We have been flying around the world in first and business class using points for years—Tim for more than a decade and Zi more recently. A little over a year ago, we were trying to find cheap round-trip tickets in first or business class to Asia and back using points. We had tons of points across Chase, American Express, and Citi, but finding a good redemption is always a pain.</p><p>We had flexibility with points currency, destinations, and dates. Our only requirement was securing two round-trip flight redemptions in first or business class on the same flight. This flexibility came at a cost: we spent over 30 hours across two weeks manually searching dates and routes on the websites of 10-20 airline transfer partners.</p><p>Ultimately, we did find two Japan Airlines first class tickets from Los Angeles to Tokyo for 70,000 points each, returning to New York for 80,000 points each. These flights typically cost between $20,000 to $30,000 roundtrip in cash, but using points, we effectively paid only ~$2,000.</p><p>The first class experience was unforgettable, but we didn't want to repeat the tedious search process. So, we decided to build a tool to save time in the future.</p><p>I know all this about points might sound a bit like magic, but booking cheap business class flights using points is achievable for the average person. Here's how it works:
Credit card sign-up offers range from 50,000 to 150,000 points. These points are either tied to credit card currencies (Chase Ultimate Rewards, American Express Membership Rewards) or specific airlines (Delta Skymiles, United MileagePlus). The most valuable and versatile points are tied to credit card currencies because they can be transferred to various travel partners. This flexibility allows you to choose the best value before transferring points. If you only have points with one airline program, you're limited to their redemptions.</p><p>While most people redeem their credit card points through the Chase or American Express travel portals at about 1-1.5 cents per point, transferring to an airline partner can yield 3-8 cents per point for business class or 12-20 cents per point for first class.</p><p>The best value for points often comes from non-US airlines like Air Canada, Air France/KLM, Avianca, and British Airways. For example, you can redeem 50,000 points for an Air France business class flight from San Francisco to Paris, which would otherwise cost around $4,000. That's an 8 cents per point value, significantly higher than using the credit card travel portal.</p><p>However, the challenges are: 1) most people don't know their credit card points can transfer to airline partners, 2) they don't consider non-US airlines, and 3) manually searching each airline website is time-consuming.</p><p>Our tool simplifies this process: Enter your origin airport, destination airport, date, fare class, and number of travelers. After you click search, our tool searches up to 16 different airline loyalty programs in real time and displays the results, including flight information, points cost, and redemption instructions.</p><p>The real-time search is free and offers access to 60 days of SkyView, a cached database of the top 6,500 most popular routes categorized by regions (state, country, continent) across two months. The paid version extends access to the full 365 calendar and allows searches up to two months at a time, with email alerts. SkyView is perfect for showing you what is currently available or was previously possible for all your award redemption needs.</p><p>We're continuously adding more features and would love to hear your ideas, experiences, and feedback!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><main>
<!-- -->

<p><img loading="lazy" width="1792" height="1024" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmovable-tree-cover.f2c64ff7.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmovable-tree-cover.f2c64ff7.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmovable-tree-cover.f2c64ff7.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>This article introduces the implementation difficulties and challenges of Movable Tree CRDTs when collaboration, and how Loro implements it and sorts child nodes. The algorithm has high performance and can be used in production.</p>
<h2>Background<a href="#background" id="background" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>In distributed systems and collaborative software, managing hierarchical relationships is difficult and complex. Challenges arise in resolving conflicts and meeting user expectations when working with the data structure that models movement by combining deletion and insertion. For instance, if a node is concurrently moved to different parents in replicas, it may lead to the unintended creation of duplicate nodes with the same content. Because the node is deleted twice and created under two parents.</p>
<p>Currently, many software solutions offer different levels of support and functionality for managing hierarchical data structures in distributed environments. The key variation among these solutions lies in their approaches to handling potential conflicts.</p>
<h3>Conflicts in Movable Trees<a href="#conflicts-in-movable-trees" id="conflicts-in-movable-trees" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>A movable tree has 3 primary operations: creation, deletion, and movement. Consider a scenario where two peers independently execute various operations on their respective replicas of the same movable tree. Synchronizing these operations can lead to potential conflicts, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same node was deleted and moved</li>
<li>The same node was moved under different nodes</li>
<li>Different nodes were moved, resulting in a cycle</li>
<li>The ancestor node is deleted while the descendant node is moved</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deletion and Movement of the Same Node<a href="#deletion-and-movement-of-the-same-node" id="deletion-and-movement-of-the-same-node" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p><img alt="Deletion and Movement of the Same Node" loading="lazy" width="3054" height="1394" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmove-delete-dark.17378273.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmove-delete-dark.17378273.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>This situation is relatively easy to resolve. It can be addressed by applying one of the operations while ignoring the other based on the timestamp in the distributed system or the application's specific requirements. Either approach yields an acceptable outcome.</p>
<h4>Moving the Same Node Under Different Parents<a href="#moving-the-same-node-under-different-parents" id="moving-the-same-node-under-different-parents" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p><img alt="Moving the Same Node Under Different Parents" loading="lazy" width="3070" height="1398" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmove-same-node-dark.fc82da02.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmove-same-node-dark.fc82da02.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Merging concurrent movement operations of the same node is slightly more complex. Different approaches can be adopted depending on the application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the node and create copies of nodes under different parent nodes. Subsequent operations then treat these nodes independently. This approach is acceptable when node uniqueness is not critical.</li>
<li>Allow the node have two edges pointing to different parents. However, this approach breaks the fundamental tree structure and is generally not considered acceptable.</li>
<li>Sort all operations, then apply them one by one. The order can be determined by timestamps in a distributed system. Providing the system maintains a consistent operation sequence, it ensures uniform results across all peers.</li>

<h3>How Popular Applications Handle Conflicts<a href="#how-popular-applications-handle-conflicts" id="how-popular-applications-handle-conflicts" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Dropbox is a file data synchronization software. Initially, Dropbox treated file movement as a two-step process: deletion from the original location followed by creation at a new location. However, this method risked data loss, especially if a power outage or system crash occurred between the delete and create operations.</p>
<p>Today, when multiple people move the same file concurrently and attempt to save their changes, Dropbox detects a conflict. In this scenario, it typically saves one version of the original file and creates a new <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/organize/conflicted-copy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"conflicted copy"<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> for the changes made by one of the users.</p>

<p>Figma is a real-time collaborative prototyping tool. They consider tree structures as the most complex part of the collaborative system, as detailed in their <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/#syncing-trees-of-objects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog post about multiplayer technology<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. To maintain consistency, each element in Figma has a "parent" attribute. The centralized server plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of these structures. It monitors updates from various users and checks if any operation would result in a cycle. If a potential cycle is detected, the server rejects the operation.</p>
<p>However, due to network delays and similar issues, there can be instances where updates from users temporarily create a cycle before the server has the chance to reject them. Figma acknowledges that this situation is uncommon. Their <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/#syncing-trees-of-objects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">solution<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> is straightforward yet effective: they temporarily preserve this state and hide the elements involved in the cycle. This approach lasts until the server formally rejects the operation, ensuring both the stability of the system and a seamless user experience.</p>

<h2>Movable Tree CRDTs<a href="#movable-tree-crdts" id="movable-tree-crdts" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>The applications mentioned above use movable trees and resolve conflicts based on centralized solutions. Another alternative approach to collaborative tree structures is using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). While initial CRDT-based algorithms were challenging to implement and incurred significant storage overhead as noted in prior research, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.1784.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Abstract unordered and
ordered trees CRDT<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5990.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">File system on CRDT<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, but continual optimization and improvement have made several CRDT-based tree synchronization algorithms suitable for certain production environments. This article highlights two innovative CRDT-based approaches for movable trees. The first is presented by Martin Kleppmann et al. in their work <strong><em><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/10/07/crdt-tree-move-operation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">A highly-available move operation for replicated trees<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></em></strong> and the second by Evan Wallace in his <strong><em><a href="https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CRDT: Mutable Tree Hierarchy<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></em></strong>.</p>
<h3>A highly-available move operation for replicated trees<a href="#a-highly-available-move-operation-for-replicated-trees" id="a-highly-available-move-operation-for-replicated-trees" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>This paper unifies the three operations used in trees (creating, deleting, and moving nodes) into a move operation. The move operation is defined as a four-tuple <code dir="ltr">Move t p m c</code>, where <code dir="ltr">t</code> is the operation's unique and ordered timestamp such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code dir="ltr">Lamport timestamp</code><span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, <code dir="ltr">p</code> is the parent node ID, <code dir="ltr">m</code> is the metadata associated with the node, and <code dir="ltr">c</code> is the child node ID.</p>
<p>If all nodes of the tree do not contain <code dir="ltr">c</code>, this is a <strong>creation</strong> operation that creates a child node <code dir="ltr">c</code> under parent node <code dir="ltr">p</code>. Otherwise, it is a <strong>move</strong> operation that moves <code dir="ltr">c</code> from its original parent to the new parent <code dir="ltr">p</code>. Additionally, node deletion is elegantly handled by introducing a designated <code dir="ltr">TRASH</code> node; moving a node to <code dir="ltr">TRASH</code> implies its deletion, with all descendants of <code dir="ltr">TRASH</code> considered deleted. But they remain in memory to prevent concurrent editing from moving them to other nodes. In order to handle the previously mentioned situation of deleting ancestor nodes and moving descendant nodes concurrently.</p>
<p>In the three potential conflicts mentioned earlier, since deletion is also defined as a move operation, <strong>deleting and moving the same node</strong> is transformed into two move operations, leaving only two remaining problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moving the same node under different parents</strong></li>
<li><strong>Moving different nodes, creating a cycle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Logical timestamps are added so that all operations can be linearly ordered, thus the first conflict can be avoided as they can be expressed as two operations in sequence rather than concurrently for the same node. Therefore, in modeling a Tree using only move operations, the only exceptional case in concurrent editing would be creating a cycle, and operations causing a cycle are termed <strong>unsafe operations</strong>.</p>
<p>This algorithm sorts all move operations according to their timestamps. It can then sequentially apply each operation. Before applying, the algorithm detects cycles to determine whether an operation is safe. If the operation creates a cycle, we ignore the unsafe operation to ensure the correct structure of the tree.</p>
<p>Based on the above approach, the consistency problem of movable trees becomes the following two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to introduce global order to operations</li>
<li>How to apply a remote operation that should be inserted in the middle of an existing sorted sequence of operations</li>
</ol>
<h4>Globally Ordered Logical Timestamps<a href="#globally-ordered-logical-timestamps" id="globally-ordered-logical-timestamps" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lamport Timestamp<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> can determine the causal order of events in a distributed system. Here's how they work: each peer starts with a counter initialized to <code dir="ltr">0</code>. When a local event occurs, the counter is increased by <code dir="ltr">1</code>, and this value becomes the event's Lamport Timestamp. When peer <code dir="ltr">A</code> sends a message to peer <code dir="ltr">B</code>, <code dir="ltr">A</code> attaches its Lamport Timestamp to the message. Upon receiving the message, peer <code dir="ltr">B</code> compares its current logical clock value with the timestamp in the message and updates its logical clock to the larger value.</p>
<p>To globally sort events, we first look at the Lamport Timestamps: smaller numbers mean earlier events. If two events have the same timestamp, we use the unique ID of the peer serves as a tiebreaker.</p>
<h4>Apply a Remote Operation<a href="#apply-a-remote-operation" id="apply-a-remote-operation" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>An op's safety depends on the tree's state when applied, avoiding cycles. Insertion requires evaluating the state formed by all preceding ops. For remote updates, we may need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Undo recent ops</li>
<li>Insert the new op</li>
<li>Reapply undone ops</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures proper integration of new ops into the existing sequence.</p>
<h5>Undo Recent Ops<a href="#undo-recent-ops" id="undo-recent-ops" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>Since we've modeled all operations on the tree as move operations, undoing a move operation involves either moving the node back to its old parent or undoing the operation that created this node. To enable quick undoing, we cache and record the <strong>old parent</strong> of the node before applying each move operation.</p>
<h5>Apply the Remote Op<a href="#apply-the-remote-op" id="apply-the-remote-op" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>Upon encountering an unsafe operation, disregarding its effects prevents the creation of a cycle. Nevertheless, it's essential to record the operation, as the safety of an operation is determined <strong>dynamically</strong>. For instance, if we receive and sort an update that deletes another node causing the cycle prior to this operation, the operation that was initially unsafe becomes safe. Additionally, we need to mark this unsafe operation as ineffective, since during undo operations, it's necessary to query the <strong>old parent</strong> node, which is the target parent of the last effective operation in the sequence targeting this node.</p>
<h5>Reapply Undone Ops<a href="#reapply-undone-ops" id="reapply-undone-ops" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>Cycles only occur when receiving updates from other peers, so the undo-do-redo process is also needed at this time. When receiving a new op:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the new operation depends on an op that has not been encountered locally, indicating that some inter-version updates are still missing, it is necessary to temporarily cache the new op and wait to apply it until the missing updates are received.</li>
<li>Compare the new operation with all existing operations. If the <code dir="ltr">opId</code> of the new operation is greater than that of all existing operations, it can be directly applied. If the new operation is safe, record the parent node of the target node as the old parent node, then apply the move operation to change the current state. If it is not safe, mark this operation as ineffective and ignore the operation's impact.</li>
<li>If the new opId is sorted in the middle of the existing sequence, it is necessary to pop the operations that are sorted later from the sequence one by one, and undo the impact of this operation, which means moving back to the child of the old parent node, until the new operation can be applied. After applying the new operation, reapply the undone nodes in sequence order, ensuring that all operations are applied in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following animated GIF demonstrates the process executed by <code dir="ltr">Peer1</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Received <code dir="ltr">Peer0</code> creating node <code dir="ltr">A</code> with the <code dir="ltr">root</code> node as its parent.</li>
<li>Received <code dir="ltr">Peer0</code> creating node <code dir="ltr">B</code> with <code dir="ltr">A</code> as its parent.</li>
<li>Created node <code dir="ltr">C</code> with <code dir="ltr">A</code> as its parent and synchronized it with <code dir="ltr">Peer0</code>.</li>
<li>Moved <code dir="ltr">C</code> to have <code dir="ltr">B</code> as its parent.</li>
<li>Received <code dir="ltr">Peer0</code>'s moving <code dir="ltr">B</code> to have <code dir="ltr">C</code> as its parent.</li>
</ol>

<p>The queue at the top right of the animation represents the order of local operations and newly received updates. The interpretation of each element in each <code dir="ltr">Block</code> is as follows:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="891" height="465" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fexplain.ba7477d6.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fexplain.ba7477d6.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fexplain.ba7477d6.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>A particular part of this process to note is the two operations with <code dir="ltr">lamport timestamps</code> of <code dir="ltr">0:3</code> and <code dir="ltr">1:3</code>. Initially, the <code dir="ltr">1:3</code> operation moving <code dir="ltr">C</code> to <code dir="ltr">B</code> was created and applied locally, followed by receiving <code dir="ltr">Peer0</code>'s <code dir="ltr">0:3</code> operation moving <code dir="ltr">B</code> to <code dir="ltr">C</code>. In <code dir="ltr">lamport timestamp</code> order, <code dir="ltr">0:3</code> is less than <code dir="ltr">1:3</code> but greater than <code dir="ltr">1:2</code> (with peer as the tiebreaker when counters are equal). To apply the new op, the <code dir="ltr">1:3</code> operation is undone first, moving <code dir="ltr">C</code> back to its old parent <code dir="ltr">A</code>, then <code dir="ltr">0:3</code> moving <code dir="ltr">B</code> to <code dir="ltr">C</code> is applied. After that, <code dir="ltr">1:3</code> is redone, attempting to move <code dir="ltr">C</code> to <code dir="ltr">B</code> again (the old parent remains <code dir="ltr">A</code>, omitted in the animation). However, a cycle is detected during this attempt, preventing the operation from taking effect, and the state of the tree remains unchanged. This completes an <code dir="ltr">undo-do-redo</code> process.</p>
<h3>CRDT: Mutable Tree Hierarchy<a href="#crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy" id="crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Evan Wallace has developed an innovative algorithm that enables each node to track all its historical parent nodes, attaching a counter to each recorded parent. The count value of a new parent node is 1 higher than that of all the node's historical parents, indicating the update sequence of the node's parents. The parent with the highest count is considered the current parent node.</p>
<p>During synchronization, this parent node information is also synced. If a cycle occurs, a heuristic algorithm reattaches the nodes causing the cycle back to the nearest historical parent node that won't cause a cycle and is connected to the root node, thus updating the parent node record. This process is repeated until all nodes causing cycles are reattached to the tree, achieving all replica synchronization of the tree structure. The demo in <a href="https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-mutable-tree-hierarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Evan's blog<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> clearly illustrates this process.</p>
<p>As Evan summarized at the end of the article, this algorithm does not require the expensive <code dir="ltr">undo-do-redo</code> process. However, each time a remote move is received, the algorithm needs to determine if all nodes are connected to the root node and reattach the nodes causing cycles back to the tree, which can perform poorly when there are too many nodes.</p>
<p>I established a <a href="https://github.com/Leeeon233/movable-tree-crdt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">benchmark<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> to compare the performance of the movable tree algorithms.</p>
<h2>Movable Tree CRDTs implementation in Loro<a href="#movable-tree-crdts-implementation-in-loro" id="movable-tree-crdts-implementation-in-loro" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Loro implements the algorithm proposed by Martin Kleppmann et al., <strong><em><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/10/07/crdt-tree-move-operation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">A highly-available move operation for replicated trees<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></em></strong>. On one hand, this algorithm has high performance in most real world scenarios. On the other hand, the core <code dir="ltr">undo-do-redo</code> process of the algorithm is highly similar to how REG (Replayable Event Graph) applies remote updates in Loro. Introduction about <strong>REG</strong> can be found in our previous <a href="https://www.loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext#brief-introduction-to-replayable-event-graph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Movable tree has been introduced in detail, but there is still another problem of tree structure that has not been solved. For movable tree, in some real use cases, we still need the capability to sort child nodes. This is necessary for outline notes or layer management in graphic design softwares. Users need to adjust node order and sync it to other collaborators or devices.</p>
<p>We integrated the <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> algorithm into Loro and combined it with the movable tree, making the child nodes of the movable tree sortable.</p>
<p>There are many introductions to <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> on the web, You can read more about <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Figma blog<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> or <a href="https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-fractional-indexing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Evan blog<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. In simple terms, <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> assigns a sortable value to each object, and if a new insertion occurs between two objects, the <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> of the new object will be between the left and right values. What we want to speak about more here is how to deal with potential conflicts brought by <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> in CRDTs systems.</p>
<h3>Potential Conflicts in Child Node Sorting<a href="#potential-conflicts-in-child-node-sorting" id="potential-conflicts-in-child-node-sorting" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>As our applications are in a distributive condition, when multiple peers insert new nodes in the same position, the same <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> would be assigned to these differing content but same position nodes. When updates from the remote are applied to local, conflicts arise as the same <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> is encountered.</p>
<p>In Loro, we retain these identical <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> and use <code dir="ltr">PeerID</code> (unique ID of every Peer) as the tie-breaker for the relative order judgment of the same <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1096" height="465" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FFI-and-PeerID-dark.82febfcc.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FFI-and-PeerID-dark.82febfcc.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FFI-and-PeerID-dark.82febfcc.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Although this solved the sorting problem among the same <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> nodes from different peers, it impacted the generation of new <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> as we cannot generate a new <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> between two same ones. We use two methods to solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first method, as stated in Evan's blog, we could add a certain amount of jitter to each generated <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code>, (for the ease of explanation, all examples below take decimal fraction as the <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code>) for example, when generating a new <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> between 0 and 1, it should have been 0.5, but through random jitters, it could be <code dir="ltr">0.52712</code>, <code dir="ltr">0.58312</code>, <code dir="ltr">0.52834</code>, etc., thus significantly reducing the chance of same <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> appearing.</li>
<li>If the situation arises where the same <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> is present on both sides, we can handle this problem by resetting these <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code>. For example, if we need to insert a new node between <code dir="ltr">0.7@A</code> and <code dir="ltr">0.7@B</code> (which indicates <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> @ <code dir="ltr">PeerID</code>), instead of generating a new <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> between 0.7 and 0.7, we could assign two new <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> respectively for the new node and the <code dir="ltr">0.7@B</code> node between 0.7 and 1, which could be understood as an extra move operations.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementation and Encoding Size<a href="#implementation-and-encoding-size" id="implementation-and-encoding-size" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Introducing <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> brings the advantage of node sequence. What about encoding size?</p>
<p>Loro uses <a href="https://github.com/drifting-in-space/fractional_index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">drifting-in-space<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> implementation based on <code dir="ltr">Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>, which is base 256. In other words, you need to continuously insert 128 values forward or backward from the default value to increase the byte size of the <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> by 1. The worst storage overhead case, such as inserting new values alternately each time. For example, the initial sequence is <code dir="ltr">ab</code>, insert <code dir="ltr">c</code> between <code dir="ltr">a</code> and <code dir="ltr">b</code>, then insert <code dir="ltr">d</code> between <code dir="ltr">c</code> and <code dir="ltr">b</code>, then <code dir="ltr">e</code> between <code dir="ltr">c</code> and <code dir="ltr">d</code>, like:</p>

<p>a new operation would cause an additional byte to be needed. But such a situation is very rare.</p>
<p>Considering that potential conflicts wouldn't appear frequently in most applications, Loro simply extended the implementation, the original implementation produced new <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> in <code dir="ltr">Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> by only increasing or decreasing 1 in certain index to achieve relative sorting. The simple jitter solution was added, by appending random bytes in length of jitter value to <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code>. To enable jitter in js, you can use <code dir="ltr">doc.setFractionalIndexJitter(number)</code> with a positive value. But this will increase the encoding size slightly, but each <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> only adds <code dir="ltr">jitter</code> bytes. If you want to generate <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> at the same position with 99% probability without conflict, the relationship between <code dir="ltr">jitter</code> settings and the maximum number of concurrent edits <code dir="ltr">n</code> will be:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><p>jitter</p></th><th><p>max num of concurrent edits</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>37</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>582</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>When there are numerous <code dir="ltr">Fractional Indexes</code>, there will be many common prefixes after being sorted, when Loro encodes these <code dir="ltr">Fractional Indexes</code>, prefix optimization would be implemented. Each <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> only saves the amount of same prefix bits and remaining bytes with the previous one, which further downsizes the overall encoding size.</p>
<h3>Related work<a href="#related-work" id="related-work" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Other than using Fractional Index, there are other movable list CRDT that can make sibling nodes of the tree in order. One of these algorithms is Martin Kleppmann's <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/04/27/papoc-list-move.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Moving Elements in List CRDTs<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, which has been used in Loro's <a href="https://www.loro.dev/docs/tutorial/list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Movable List<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<p>In comparison, the implementation of <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> solution is simpler, and no stable position representation is provided for child nodes when modeling nodes in a tree, otherwise, the overall tree structure would be too complex. However, the <code dir="ltr">Fractional Index</code> has the problem of <a href="https://vlcn.io/blog/fractional-indexing#interleaving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">interleaving<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, but this is acceptable when some only need relative order and do not require strict sequential semantics, such as figma layer items, multi-level bookmarks, etc.</p>
<h2>Benchmark<a href="#benchmark" id="benchmark" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>We conducted performance benchmarks on the Movable Tree implementation by Loro, including scenarios of random node movement, switching to historical versions, and performance under extreme conditions with significantly deep tree structures. The results indicate that it is capable of supporting real-time collaboration and enabling seamless historical version checkouts.</p>

<h2>Usage<a href="#usage" id="usage" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>

<h3>Demo<a href="#demo" id="demo" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>We developed a simulated Todo app with data synchronization among multiple peers using Loro, including the use of <code dir="ltr">Movable Tree</code> to represent subtask relationships, <code dir="ltr">Map</code> to represent various attributes of tasks, and <code dir="ltr">Text</code> to represent task titles, etc. In addition to basic creation, moving, modification, and deletion, we also implemented version switching based on Loro. You can drag the scrollbar to switch between all the historical versions that have been operated on.</p>

Or use Bootstrap to analyze any other statistic of your choice. And there is a predefined method for the analysis of quantiles using Bootstrap. <strong>tea-tasting</strong>&nbsp;also detects mismatches in the sample ratios of different variants of an A/B test.</p><p><strong>tea-tasting</strong> applies <a href="https://alexdeng.github.io/public/files/kdd2018-dm.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delta method</a> for the analysis of ratios of averages. For example, average number of orders per average number of sessions, assuming that session is not a randomization unit.</p><p>Use pre-experiment data, metric forecasts, or other covariates to reduce variance and increase the sensitivity of an experiment. This approach is also known as <a href="https://exp-platform.com/Documents/2013-02-CUPED-ImprovingSensitivityOfControlledExperiments.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CUPED</a> or <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/06/08/improving-experimental-power-through-control-using-predictions-as-covariate-cupac/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CUPAC</a>.</p><p>The calculation of confidence intervals for <em>percentage</em> change in Student's t-test and Z-test can be tricky. Just taking confidence interval for <em>absolute</em> change and dividing it by control average will produce a biased result. <strong>tea-tasting</strong> applies <a href="https://alexdeng.github.io/public/files/kdd2018-dm.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delta method</a> to calculate the correct interval.</p><p>Analyze statistical power for Student's t-test and Z-test.

And in most cases it's not efficient to pull the detailed experimental data into a Python environment. Many statistical tests, such as the Student's t-test or the Z-test, require only aggregated data for analysis.</p><p>For example, if the raw experimental data are stored in ClickHouse, it's faster and more efficient to calculate counts, averages, variances, and covariances directly in ClickHouse rather than fetching granular data and performing aggregations in a Python environment.</p><p>Querying all the required statistics manually can be a daunting and error-prone task. For example, analysis of ratio metrics and variance reduction with CUPED require not only number of rows and variance, but also covariances. But don't worry—<strong>tea-tasting</strong>&nbsp;does all this work for you.</p><p><strong>tea-tasting</strong> accepts data either as a Pandas DataFrame or an Ibis Table.&nbsp;<a href="https://ibis-project.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ibis</a>&nbsp;is a Python package which serves as a DataFrame API to various data backends. It supports 20+ backends including BigQuery, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL/GreenPlum, Snowflake, and Spark.

In fact, <strong>tea-tasting</strong> uses these packages under the hood. What <strong>tea-tasting</strong> offers on top is a convenient higher-level API.</p><p>It's easier to show than to describe. Here is the basic example:</p><pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>import </span><span>tea_tasting </span><span>as </span><span>tt

<li><strong>PUBLIC_HOST_URL</strong>: base URL for the download links shown in the UI for completed files. By default MeTube serves them under its own URL. If your download directory is accessible on another URL and you want the download links to be based there, use this variable to set it.</li>
<li><strong>PUBLIC_HOST_AUDIO_URL</strong>: same as PUBLIC_HOST_URL but for audio downloads.</li>
<li><strong>OUTPUT_TEMPLATE</strong>: the template for the filenames of the downloaded videos, formatted according to <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/README.md#output-template">this spec</a>. Defaults to <code>%(title)s.%(ext)s</code>.</li>
<li><strong>OUTPUT_TEMPLATE_CHAPTER</strong>: the template for the filenames of the downloaded videos, when split into chapters via postprocessors. Defaults to <code>%(title)s - %(section_number)s %(section_title)s.%(ext)s</code>.</li>
<li><strong>YTDL_OPTIONS</strong>: Additional options to pass to youtube-dl, in JSON format. <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L183">See available options here</a>. They roughly correspond to command-line options, though some do not have exact equivalents here, for example <code>--recode-video</code> has to be specified via <code>postprocessors</code>. Also note that dashes are replaced with underscores.</li>
<li><strong>YTDL_OPTIONS_FILE</strong>: A path to a JSON file that will be loaded and used for populating <code>YTDL_OPTIONS</code> above. Please note that if both <code>YTDL_OPTIONS_FILE</code> and <code>YTDL_OPTIONS</code> are specified, the options in <code>YTDL_OPTIONS</code> take precedence.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The engine which powers the actual video downloads in MeTube is <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>. Since video sites regularly change their layouts, frequent updates of yt-dlp are required to keep up.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's an automatic nightly build of MeTube which looks for a new version of yt-dlp, and if one exists, the build pulls it and publishes an updated docker image. Therefore, in order to keep up with the changes, it's recommended that you update your MeTube container regularly with the latest image.</p>
<p dir="auto">I recommend installing and setting up <a href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower">watchtower</a> for this purpose.</p>

<p dir="auto">Before asking a question or submitting an issue for MeTube, please remember that MeTube is only a UI for <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>. Any issues you might be experiencing with authentication to video websites, postprocessing, permissions, other <code>YTDL_OPTIONS</code> configurations which seem not to work, or anything else that concerns the workings of the underlying yt-dlp library, need not be opened on the MeTube project. In order to debug and troubleshoot them, it's advised to try using the yt-dlp binary directly first, bypassing the UI, and once that is working, importing the options that worked for you into <code>YTDL_OPTIONS</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to test with the yt-dlp command directly, you can either download it and run it locally, or for a better simulation of its actual conditions, you can run it within the MeTube container itself. Assuming your MeTube container is called <code>metube</code>, run the following on your Docker host to get a shell inside the container:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker exec -ti metube sh
cd /downloads"><pre>docker <span>exec</span> -ti metube sh

<p>Designing the Super Nintendo Video System</p><hr>




<p>Last time, I explored the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_carts">inside of the Super Nintendo cartridges</a>. Today I am going through  its video system.</p>

<p>I put myself in the shoes of a Nintendo engineer working in Masayuki Uemura (上村雅之)'s team<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> by studying what was available in 1989, namely a TV set, to understand what decisions had to be made while designing the SNES video system.</p>

<p>Here is the summary of what I learned. Perhaps you will enjoy tagging along.</p>



<p>What is inside an early 90s TV?</p><hr><p>The screen upon which the SNES outputs video is a standard TV set. Usually it is used to watch Captain Tsubasa, Cobra, Astro Boy, Captain Herlock, Saint Seiya, or Dragon Ball.</p>

<p>There is an antenna on the roof of the house which catches the analog TV broadcast (NTSC), a cable bringing the signal to a tuner, and finally the part where the image is displayed, called a cathode ray tube (CRT).</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/tv.svg" width="178.47072mm" height="68.211235mm">

<p>More importantly for the topic at hand, there are auxiliary (AUX) inputs. A basic TV set would have a composite connector (in yellow) which carries a video signal. The auxiliary stereo audio signals are carried over dedicated jacks (in white and red on my ugly drawing).</p>

<p>How a CRT works</p><hr><p>The CRT is a super line drawing machine. At the time, they were rated at 15kHz which means they could draw in the vicinity of 15,000 lines per second.</p>

<p>Inside the CRT is a gun with three electron cannons. The cannons always shoot straight in front of them, and two sets of magnets (one vertical and one horizontal) route them up/down and left/right.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/shadow_mask.svg" width="10.246995in" height="5.2401996in">
<p>In the drawing above, I colored the rays from the cannons but only so the reader can follow. Electrons have no color. There is a mask in front of the phosphor strips to make sure the electrons from each cannon land in the appropriate color strip.</p>
 
<p>There are no pixels in the world of CRTs. A slot is <b>not a pixel</b>. The drawing below zoom into a scanline where various parts of slots are hit. The one guarantee is that electrons from a cannon always land in the correct color strip.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/triad_slots.svg" width="210.54335mm" height="27.952505mm">

<p>A HD TV has smaller slots, better able to render the color signal. In the drawing below, the same line is rendered horizontally with more fidelity thanks to the higher density of slots.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/triad_slots_hd.svg" width="210.54335mm" height="27.952505mm">


<p>How a CRT is controlled</p><hr><p>A CRT consumes five signals, carried over four wires. There is one wire for each of the Red, Green, and Blue signals. They are directly connected to the cannons of the gun. The higher the signal, the more electrons are shot and the more bright the phosphor strips are. No signal on all three wires means no electrons being shot, resulting in black being displayed on that line.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/rgb_wires.svg" width="210.30133mm" height="30.451578mm">
<p>The white wire in the drawing above carries the synchronization signals. There are two, named Horizontal Sync (HSYNC) and Vertical Sync (VSYNC). The two signals use the same wire so it is called Composite Sync (CSYNC).</p>

<p>With my PC programming background, I was used to "Wait for VSYNC" which carried the false idea the CRT emitted it. That is wrong. A CRT emits nothing, it only consumes signals and tries to synchronize the cannon with them.</p>

<p>How a CRT draws an image</p><hr><p>The CRT draws a line (a.k.a raster) from left to right. When it receives a HSYNC event, it "returns" to the left of the screen (X=0). When it receives a VSYNC event, it goes back to the top of the screen (Y=0). 
</p>

<p>Observant readers will see a problem with these events. There is no way to go down. The system driving the CRT can issue as many HSYNC and VSYNC as it wants, the same line at the top of the screen will end up being drawn over and over.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/one_line.svg" width="208.88399mm" height="82.920204mm">

<p>The key to understand CRTs</p><hr><p>The key to understanding CRTs is to assimilate that the cannon moves towards the right of the screen with a <b>downward slope</b><a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Upon HSYNC, the CRT returns to X = 0 but because the cannon will have aimed downward, the next line will be drawn below the previous one.</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/p_scan.svg" width="208.88399mm" height="82.920204mm">
<p>This opens the door to cool tricks. The drawing above shows a signal where VSYNC is issued at the same time as the last HSYNC. The lines are always drawn at the same location on the screen. But look below what happens if a VSYNC is issued between two HSYNC.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/i_scan.svg" width="208.88399mm" height="82.920204mm">
<p>Because it only drew half a line at the bottom, the CRT starts drawing the next line at the top of the screen at the same X position. The next set of lines will be interlaced with the previous set.</p>

<p>Lines sets are called "fields". The mode where fields are drawn at the same location is called "progressive" scan ("p"). The mode where fields are interlaced is abbreviated "i". In i mode, the tradeoff is that the vertical resolution is doubled but the refresh rate of each line is halved.</p> 

<p>NTSC issues two fields at 30-ish Hz. Therefore all CRTs provisioned enough space between lines for interlacing. When drawing in progressive, scanline spacing is visible. It results in black space between lines<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> which are characteristic of CRT rasterization.</p>

<p>What is inside a line?</p><hr><p>The CRT is numeric when it comes to drawing lines but analog when it comes to what is inside a line<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. As seen in the drawing, the three cannons are directly connected to the three RGB wires. A system is free to change the color signal as much as it wants (hence use any horizontal resolution). The only limit is signal propagation and the slot mask density.
</p>

 

<p>Dealing with what exists</p><hr><p>While the SNES designers could issue what they wanted on the wires, they still had to make sure the CRT would be able to deal with it. Since the hardware is designed to display a NTSC signal, whatever they decided on had to be close to these specifications<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>4:3 aspect ratio</li>
  <li>Number of lines: 262.5 per field</li>
  <li>Number of dots on a line: 341.25</li>
  <li>Field frequency: 59.94Hz</li>
</ul>

<p>59.94Hz is such a weird number. Isn't the power grid running at 60Hz and TVs used that AC frequency directly? Black and White NTSC used to be 60Hz. When broadcast engineers had to find a way to add color to the NTSC signal without breaking backward compatibility they decided to reduce frequency by 0.1% to avoid artifacts<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>



<p>Being a Nintendo engineer</p><hr> 
<p>Now that we know how a CRT works, it is time to play at being a Nintendo engineer and craft a video system.</p>

<p>The first choice to make it how many lines we want. NTSC uses 262.5 lines per field but the half-line is to interlace fields. We can use 262 to make it progressive. With a target framerate of 59.94, that should require 15,734.26 lines per second which is within 4% of the 15KHz rating.
</p>

<p>The CRT screen has an aspect ratio of 4:3. If we use 350 dots horizontally, we will match exactly that aspect ratio and there will be no distortion when the console image is converted into scanlines.</p>
 
<p>262 lines at 59.94Hz, each with 350 dots means we need a dot clock pulsing at 262 * 350 * 59.94 = 5,496,498Hz. We can craft an ASIC which counts dot ticks. Every 350 ticks it issues a HSYNC. Every 350*262 = 91,700 ticks, it issues a VSYNC<a name="back_10" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. I guess we are done?</p>







<p>We are not done. We are just getting started</p><hr>
<p>There are two issues with this naive design.</p>

<ol>
<li>It requires a dot clock of 5,496,498Hz we don't have. The SNES cost constraints prevent the video system from getting its own oscillator. There is a Master oscillator which sub-systems must use via dividers<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.
</li>

<li>You can't draw color all the time. This is called overscan. And it deserves its own section.</li>
</ol>



<p>Introducing overscan</p><hr>

<p>When the gun position is reset horizontally or vertically, it continues to shoot electrons. If it was to keep on shooting, it would create visible artifacts.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that TVs tend to over-scan their screen area<a name="back_12" href="#footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>, which means the picture on the screen is a little larger than the display. How much the TV over-scans varies from TV to TV. This happens to hide wobbling.</p>

<p>When the gun vertical position is reset to Y=0 (after VSYNC), it is going to undulate up and down for a while. You only get straight lines after a few µs. The same problem happens horizontally after HSYNC.</p>




<p>The solution to all these problems is to "stop" the CRT cannon a little bit after VSYNC and after HSYNC. These time spans during which no electrons are shot are called respectively VBLANK and HBLANK.</p>

<div><p>All gaming systems of that era used blanking. Here is a summary of the SNES competitors.</p><table>

<p>Picking the SNES vertical resolution</p><hr><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/super-mario.png" width="256" height="262">
<p>If we look closely at the recap table above, we see that all the competing systems, namely the Megadrive, the Neo-Geo, and Capcom's CPS-1 used 224 visible lines.</p>

<p>
They probably did not pick that number at random. 224 is a number evenly divisible by 16 (224/16 = 14) which means it plays nicely with the graphic rendering pipeline tilemaps.</p>

<p>My best guess is that Nintendo did not want to reinvent the wheel. They did not need higher resolution but better graphics. What made the system stand apart was its PPUs.</p>

<div><p>In the end, they went the safe way and split their 262 lines per frame into 224 visible + 38 blanks (as the drawing on the right shows).</p></div> 

<div>




<div><p>Arcade games could afford to be as peculiar as they wanted on a per-title basis. 
The designers of R-Type at Irem were unsatisfied with the default ”standard” 224 active lines of a CRT.</p><p>

They calibrated their M72-System registers to draw 284 lines, 512 dots, and used an 8 Mhz dot-clock. Leaving 128 dots to HBLANK and 28 lines to VBLANK resulted in an active resolution of 384x256 which was higher than other arcade titles at the time.</p><p>
The trade-off was a vertical refresh rate of 55.017605 Hz which was visually less pleasing and dangerously 10% off from the CRT recommended values. This refresh rate is difficult to replicate for ”modern” emulators but what an impressive feat for a 1987 system!</p><p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/rtype.png" width="384" height="256"><span><i><small>
R-Type (1984) has a whopping 256 visible lines (photo credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type">wikipedia</a>)!</small></i></span></p></div>

<p>Picking the SNES horizontal resolution</p><hr><p>So far we have picked a number of lines per frame (262). We also know we won't be able to pick a dotclock. We have to use the Master clock (21.47727MHz) and use a divider to end up close to NTSC dotclock. That leaves us with using a 21.47727 Mhz / 4 = 5.3693175 MHz dot clock.</p>

<p>Lines, dots, dot clock and refresh rate are inter-connected via the framerate equation.</p>

<center>
<p>refresh rate = <span>
    <span>lines * dots</span>
    <span>/</span>
    <span>dot clock</span>
</span></p>
</center>

<p>Given that our target refresh rate is 59.94Hz, we don't have much of a choice for the number of dots per line.</p>

<center>
<p>dots = <span>
  <span>5369317.5 (dot clock)</span>
    <span>/</span>
    <span>262 (lines) * 59.94 (rate)</span>
</span> ≃ 342 </p>
</center>

<p>Except that for gory reasons involving carrier artifact when using composite outputs, Nintendo engineers had to use 341 dot per lines instead of 342. This leaves the SNES with a framerate of:</p>

<p>60.098Hz is not NTSC's 59.94 Hz but since, as seen previously with R-Type, CRTs have tolerance it works. If you enjoyed this part, Nerdy pleasure has plenty more<a name="back_17" href="#footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>



<p>Picking the SNES horizontal Overscan</p><hr>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/super-mario-overscan-res.png" width="342" height="262"></p><p>Of these 341 dots, all of them are not usable for the same wobbling, artifact hiding, and TV overscan  reasons. The SNES needs an horizontal overscan during which it issues a blank signal.</p>

<p>The constraints are:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Result in an aspect ratio close to 4:3. This would mean 224*(4/3) = 298 visible dots.</li>
    <li>Play nice with the graphic pipeline tilemaps which uses 16x16 tiles. That leaves values 304 (16x19), 288 (16x18), 272 (16x17), 256 (16x16), 240 (16*15), and so on. The best value, the one resulting in next to no distortion on the screen would be 304 dots.</li>
  </ul>

<p>A third constraint was to allow enough time for the PPU to populate its sprite line buffer during HBLANK. My guess is that up to 128 sprites was a lot of data to retrieve and the PPU needed more than the 7µs granted by 37 dots of HBLANK if 304 visible dots was to be picked as horizontal resolution.</p>

<p>In the end, Nintendo decided on <b>256 visible dots</b> per line with <b>85 dots of HBLANK</b>. This means the PPU has 16µs to retrieve sprite data during HBLANK. This also means the aspect ratio was not 4:3 but 8:7 which results in slight distortion when the CRT displayed what the PPU generated.</p>


<p>High vertical Resolution mode: Interlacing</p><hr>
<p>So far we have designed the SNES video system with only progressive mode in mind.

</p><pre>Overscan resolution: 341x262
Visible resolution:  256x224
Framerate:           60.098Hz
</pre>

<p>Even though this is what 99% of games ended up using, the SNES also had high-resolution modes. I can double its resolution vertically and/or horizontally.</p>


<p>Doubling the resolution vertically to 448 lines is easy. We can just change the counter to issue a VSYNC half a line after the latest HSYNC to interlace frames. That means drawing 262.5 lines per frame but each line is now refreshed at only 60.098/2=30.049Hz. It will cause flickering and it won't be very pleasant but the vertical resolution will be higher<a name="back_18" href="#footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>


<p>High horizontal Resolution mode: The hack</p><hr>
<p>Doubling the horizontal resolution however is much more difficult since the console doesn't have the dotclock for it.</p>

<p>The hack is that the SNES shifts every second field horizontally a bit, so the dots of the field end up between the dots of the previous field. You end up with something running at half the framerate and massive color bleeding. Quite a few titles used it, mainly for menu screens as detailed in <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.txt">fullsnes.txt</a>.</p>

<p>PAL vs NTSC</p><hr><p>We are still not done. In Europe, TVs don't use NTSC but PAL and the French even use SECAM. The framerate expected is exactly 50Hz and there are 312.5 lines per field.</p>

<p>That is actually a simple problem to solve. These versions of the SNES ship with a Master clock running at 17.7344750MHz. The same divider gives a dot clock of 5.32034250MHz. The overscan resolution is 312 lines by 341 dots. The visible resolution is 224 lines by 256 dots. And the framerate is 50.00697891Hz.
</p>

<p>The problem is that only 224 lines of graphics is going to result in big black bands above and below the active zone. This is solved via an "Overscan mode" which increased the number of visible lines to 240 (that is 16 lines which is one tile tall).</p>

<p>What a blessing for game developers willing to port a game to the European market you may say. In practice, "overscan mode" was never used. Most titles were tailor made for 224 lines so the developers did not know what to put in these 16 extra lines. In total, only twelve titles ever used it<a name="back_19" href="#footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>. Nintendo still managed to do something awesome with their flagship title Super Mario World by increasing the vertical view range.</p>




<p>Note that both NTSC and PAL screen use the same 4:3 aspect ratio so the PAL image is a little bit more compressed vertically than the NTSC one.</p>



<p>Besides the annoying black band, the game code was also rarely revised to account for the VSYNC which occurred at 50.00697891Hz instead of 60.098Hz. This resulted in game running 17% slower than intended. European gaming was a real dumpster fire. But luckily without the internet we did not know about it.</p>

<p>Outputs</p><hr><p>So far we have only considered the "pure" signals needed to drive a CRT. However, few TVs set allowed to directly feed the CRT. Most sets only had a yellow composite jack input in the back while some high-end models had S-Video inputs. </p>

<p>The SNES does something pretty cool to handle this diversity. It converts the CRT signals to both composite and S-Video<a name="back_20" href="#footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>


<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/multi-out.svg" width="244.45126mm" height="65.154602mm"></p><p>The AV connector</p><hr><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/av.svg" width="88mm" height="55mm"></p><p>None of the signals are discarded. Thanks to the design of its AV output, gamers get a la carte access to the pure "RGB/CSync" signal, the "Composite" signal, and the S-Video.</p>

<pre>
1. Red                7. Luminance (S-Video)
2. Green              8. Chrominance (S-Video)
3. C-Sync             9. Composite Video
4. Blue              10. +5V DC
5. Ground            11. Left Audio 
6. Ground            12. Right Audio
</pre>

<p>European TVs, especially those in France, came with SCART connectors (a.k.a Prise peritel). This allowed them to craft cables feeding the CRT directly<a name="back_21" href="#footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>


<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_video/scart.webp" width="974" height="553"></p><p>That way we could enjoy our 17% slower, black-banded games at the highest level of visual fidelity.</p>

<p dir="auto">An interview question for a position that requires knowledge of bash/linux/stuff could be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">What if you're ssh'd into a machine, you're in your trusty bash shell, but unfortunately you cannot spawn any new processes because literally all other pids are taken.  What do you do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">And if that's what you're facing, this might be the tool for you!  Now you can kinda sorta pretend that you have access to a working <code>ps aux</code>.</p>
