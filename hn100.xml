<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
Structuring a large program is always a difficult job. One of the
particular problems that often comes up is this: if you have a piece
of code producing data, and another piece of code consuming it,
which should be the caller and which should be the callee?

</p><p>
Here is a very simple piece of run-length decompression code, and an
equally simple piece of parser code:

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre><code>    /* Decompression code */
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (c == 0xFF) {
            len = getchar();
            c = getchar();
            while (len--)
                emit(c);
        } else
            emit(c);
    }
    emit(EOF);</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>    /* Parser code */
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            do {
                add_to_token(c);
                c = getchar();
            } while (isalpha(c));
            got_token(WORD);
        }
        add_to_token(c);
        got_token(PUNCT);
    }</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Each of these code fragments is very simple, and easy to read and
understand. One produces a character at a time by calling
<code>emit()</code>; the other consumes a character at a time by
calling <code>getchar()</code>. If only the calls to
<code>emit()</code> and the calls to <code>getchar()</code> could be
made to feed data to each other, it would be simple to connect the
two fragments together so that the output from the decompressor went
straight to the parser.

</p><p>
In many modern operating systems, you could do this using pipes
between two processes or two threads. <code>emit()</code> in the
decompressor writes to a pipe, and <code>getchar()</code> in the
parser reads from the other end of the same pipe. Simple and robust,
but also heavyweight and not portable. Typically you don't want to
have to divide your program into threads for a task this simple.

</p><p>
In this article I offer a creative solution to this sort of
structure problem.
</p>

<a name="rewrite"><h2>Rewriting</h2></a>

<p>
The conventional answer is to rewrite one of the ends of the
communication channel so that it's a function that can be called.
Here's an example of what that might mean for each of the example
fragments.

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre><code>int decompressor(void) {
    static int repchar;
    static int replen;
    if (replen &gt; 0) {
        replen--;
        return repchar;
    }
    c = getchar();
    if (c == EOF)
        return EOF;
    if (c == 0xFF) {
        replen = getchar();
        repchar = getchar();
        replen--;
        return repchar;
    } else
        return c;
}</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>void parser(int c) {
    static enum {
        START, IN_WORD
    } state;
    switch (state) {
        case IN_WORD:
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            add_to_token(c);
            return;
        }
        got_token(WORD);
        state = START;
        /* fall through */

        case START:
        add_to_token(c);
        if (isalpha(c))
            state = IN_WORD;
        else
            got_token(PUNCT);
        break;
    }
}</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
Of course you don't have to rewrite both of them; just one will do.
If you rewrite the decompressor in the form shown, so that it
returns one character every time it's called, then the original
parser code can replace calls to <code>getchar()</code> with calls
to <code>decompressor()</code>, and the program will be happy.
Conversely, if you rewrite the parser in the form shown, so that it
is called once for every input character, then the original
decompression code can call <code>parser()</code> instead of
<code>emit()</code> with no problems. You would only want to rewrite
<em>both</em> functions as callees if you were a glutton for
punishment.

</p><p>
And that's the point, really. Both these rewritten functions are
thoroughly ugly compared to their originals. Both of the processes
taking place here are easier to read when written as a caller, not
as a callee. Try to deduce the grammar recognised by the parser, or
the compressed data format understood by the decompressor, just by
reading the code, and you will find that both the originals are
clear and both the rewritten forms are less clear. It would be much
nicer if we didn't have to turn either piece of code inside out.

<a name="knuth"></a></p><h2><a name="knuth">Knuth's coroutines</a></h2>

<p>
In <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>, Donald Knuth
presents a solution to this sort of problem. His answer is to throw
away the stack concept completely. Stop thinking of one process as
the caller and the other as the callee, and start thinking of them
as cooperating equals.

</p><p>
In practical terms: replace the traditional "call" primitive with a
slightly different one. The new "call" will save the return value
somewhere other than on the stack, and will then jump to a location
specified in another saved return value. So each time the
decompressor emits another character, it saves its program counter
and jumps to the last known location within the parser - and each
time the parser <em>needs</em> another character, it saves its own
program counter and jumps to the location saved by the decompressor.
Control shuttles back and forth between the two routines exactly as
often as necessary.

</p><p>
This is very nice in theory, but in practice you can only do it in
assembly language, because no commonly used high level language
supports the coroutine call primitive. Languages like C depend
utterly on their stack-based structure, so whenever control passes
from any function to any other, one must be the caller and the other
must be the callee. So if you want to write portable code, this
technique is at least as impractical as the Unix pipe solution.

<a name="knuth"></a></p><h2><a name="knuth">Stack-based coroutines</a></h2>

<p>
So what we would <em>really</em> like is the ability to mimic
Knuth's coroutine call primitive in C. We must accept that in
reality, at the C level, one function will be caller and the other
will be callee. In the caller, we have no problem; we code the
original algorithm, pretty much exactly as written, and whenever it
has (or needs) a character it calls the other function.

</p><p>
The callee has all the problems. For our callee, we want a function
which has a "return and continue" operation: return from the
function, and next time it is called, resume control from just after
the <em>return</em> statement. For example, we would like to be able
to write a function that says

</p><pre><code>int function(void) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        return i;   /* won't work, but wouldn't it be nice */
}</code></pre>

<p>
and have ten successive calls to the function return the numbers 0
through 9.

</p><p>
How can we implement this? Well, we can transfer control to an
arbitrary point in the function using a <code>goto</code> statement.
So if we use a state variable, we could do this:

</p><pre><code>int function(void) {
    static int i, state = 0;
    switch (state) {
        case 0: goto LABEL0;
        case 1: goto LABEL1;
    }
    LABEL0: /* start of function */
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        state = 1; /* so we will come back to LABEL1 */
        return i;
        LABEL1:; /* resume control straight after the return */
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
This method works. We have a set of labels at the points where we
might need to resume control: one at the start, and one just after
each <code>return</code> statement. We have a state variable,
preserved between calls to the function, which tells us which label
we need to resume control at next. Before any return, we update the
state variable to point at the right label; after any call, we do a
<code>switch</code> on the value of the variable to find out where
to jump to.

</p><p>
It's still ugly, though. The worst part of it is that the set of
labels must be maintained manually, and must be consistent between
the function body and the initial <code>switch</code> statement.
Every time we add a new return statement, we must invent a new label
name and add it to the list in the <code>switch</code>; every time
we remove a return statement, we must remove its corresponding
label. We've just increased our maintenance workload by a factor of
two.

<a name="duff"></a></p><h2><a name="duff">Duff's device</a></h2>

<p>
The famous "Duff's device" in C makes use of the fact that a
<code>case</code> statement is still legal within a sub-block of its
matching <code>switch</code> statement. Tom Duff used this for an
optimised output loop:

</p><pre><code>    switch (count % 8) {
        case 0:        do {  *to = *from++;
        case 7:              *to = *from++;
        case 6:              *to = *from++;
        case 5:              *to = *from++;
        case 4:              *to = *from++;
        case 3:              *to = *from++;
        case 2:              *to = *from++;
        case 1:              *to = *from++;
                       } while ((count -= 8) &gt; 0);
    }</code></pre>

<p>
We can put it to a slightly different use in the coroutine trick.
Instead of using a <code>switch</code> statement to decide which
<code>goto</code> statement to execute, we can use the
<code>switch</code> statement to perform the jump itself:

</p><pre><code>int function(void) {
    static int i, state = 0;
    switch (state) {
        case 0: /* start of function */
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
            state = 1; /* so we will come back to "case 1" */
            return i;
            case 1:; /* resume control straight after the return */
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
Now this is looking promising. All we have to do now is construct a
few well chosen macros, and we can hide the gory details in
something plausible-looking:

</p><pre><code>#define crBegin static int state=0; switch(state) { case 0:
#define crReturn(i,x) do { state=i; return x; case i:; } while (0)
#define crFinish }
int function(void) {
    static int i;
    crBegin;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        crReturn(1, i);
    crFinish;
}</code></pre>

<p>
(note the use of <code>do ... while(0)</code> to ensure that
<code>crReturn</code> does not need braces around it when it comes
directly between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>)

</p><p>
This is almost exactly what we wanted. We can use
<code>crReturn</code> to return from the function in such a way that
control at the next call resumes just after the return. Of course we
must obey some ground rules (surround the function body with
<code>crBegin</code> and <code>crFinish</code>; declare all local
variables <code>static</code> if they need to be preserved across a
<code>crReturn</code>; <em>never</em> put a <code>crReturn</code>
within an explicit <code>switch</code> statement); but those do not
limit us very much.

</p><p>
The only snag remaining is the first parameter to
<code>crReturn</code>. Just as when we invented a new label in the
previous section we had to avoid it colliding with existing label
names, now we must ensure all our state parameters to
<code>crReturn</code> are different. The consequences will be fairly
benign - the compiler will catch it and not let it do horrible
things at run time - but we still need to avoid doing it.

</p><p>
Even this can be solved. ANSI C provides the special macro name
<code>__LINE__</code>, which expands to the current source line
number. So we can rewrite <code>crReturn</code> as

</p><pre><code>#define crReturn(x) do { state=__LINE__; return x; \
                         case __LINE__:; } while (0)</code></pre>

<p>
and then we no longer have to worry about those state parameters at
all, provided we obey a fourth ground rule (never put two
<code>crReturn</code> statements on the same line).

<a name="evaluation"></a></p><h2><a name="evaluation">Evaluation</a></h2>

<p>
So now we have this monstrosity, let's rewrite our original code
fragments using it.

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<pre><code>int decompressor(void) {
    static int c, len;
    crBegin;
    while (1) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (c == 0xFF) {
            len = getchar();
            c = getchar();
            while (len--)
	        crReturn(c);
        } else
	    crReturn(c);
    }
    crReturn(EOF);
    crFinish;
}</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code>void parser(int c) {
    crBegin;
    while (1) {
        /* first char already in c */
        if (c == EOF)
            break;
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            do {
                add_to_token(c);
		crReturn( );
            } while (isalpha(c));
            got_token(WORD);
        }
        add_to_token(c);
        got_token(PUNCT);
	crReturn( );
    }
    crFinish;
}</code></pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
We have rewritten both decompressor and parser as callees, with no
need at all for the massive restructuring we had to do last time we
did this. The structure of each function exactly mirrors the
structure of its original form. A reader can deduce the grammar
recognised by the parser, or the compressed data format used by the
decompressor, far more easily than by reading the obscure
state-machine code. The control flow is intuitive once you have
wrapped your mind around the new format: when the decompressor has a
character, it passes it back to the caller with
<code>crReturn</code> and waits to be called again when another
character is required. When the parser needs another character, it
returns using <code>crReturn</code>, and waits to be called again
with the new character in the parameter <code>c</code>.

</p><p>
There has been one small structural alteration to the code:
<code>parser()</code> now has its <code>getchar()</code> (well, the
corresponding <code>crReturn</code>) at the end of the loop instead
of the start, because the first character is already in
<code>c</code> when the function is entered. We could accept this
small change in structure, or if we really felt strongly about it we
could specify that <code>parser()</code> required an
"initialisation" call before you could start feeding it characters.

</p><p>
As before, of course, we don't have to rewrite both routines using
the coroutine macros. One will suffice; the other can be its caller.

</p><p>
We have achieved what we set out to achieve: a portable ANSI C means
of passing data between a producer and a consumer without the need
to rewrite one as an explicit state machine. We have done this by
combining the C preprocessor with a little-used feature of the
<code>switch</code> statement to create an <em>implicit</em> state
machine.

<a name="standards"></a></p><h2><a name="standards">Coding Standards</a></h2>

<p>
Of course, this trick violates every coding standard in the book.
Try doing this in your company's code and you will probably be
subject to a stern telling off if not disciplinary action! You have
embedded unmatched braces in macros, used <code>case</code> within
sub-blocks, and as for the <code>crReturn</code> macro with its
terrifyingly disruptive contents .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It's a wonder you
haven't been fired on the spot for such irresponsible coding
practice. You should be ashamed of yourself.

</p><p>
I would claim that the coding standards are at fault here. The
examples I've shown in this article are not very long, not very
complicated, and still just about comprehensible when rewritten as
state machines. But as the functions get longer, the degree of
rewriting required becomes greater and the loss of clarity becomes
much, much worse.

</p><p>
Consider. A function built of small blocks of the form

</p><pre><code>    case STATE1:
    /* perform some activity */
    if (condition) state = STATE2; else state = STATE3;</code></pre>

<p>
is not very different, to a reader, from a function built of small
blocks of the form

</p><pre><code>    LABEL1:
    /* perform some activity */
    if (condition) goto LABEL2; else goto LABEL3;</code></pre>

<p>
One is caller and the other is callee, true, but the visual
structure of the functions are the same, and the insights they
provide into their underlying algorithms are exactly as small as
each other. The same people who would fire you for using my
coroutine macros would fire you just as loudly for building a
function out of small blocks connected by <code>goto</code>
statements! And this time they would be right, because laying out a
function like that obscures the structure of the algorithm horribly.

</p><p>
Coding standards aim for clarity. By hiding vital things like
<code>switch</code>, <code>return</code> and <code>case</code>
statements inside "obfuscating" macros, the coding standards would
claim you have obscured the syntactic structure of the program, and
violated the requirement for clarity. But you have done so in the
cause of revealing the <em>algorithmic</em> structure of the
program, which is far more likely to be what the reader wants to
know!

</p><p>
Any coding standard which insists on syntactic clarity at the
expense of algorithmic clarity should be rewritten. If your employer
fires you for using this trick, tell them that repeatedly as the
security staff drag you out of the building.

<a name="code"></a></p><h2><a name="code">Refinements and Code</a></h2>

<p>
In a serious application, this toy coroutine implementation is
unlikely to be useful, because it relies on <code>static</code>
variables and so it fails to be re-entrant or multi-threadable.
Ideally, in a real application, you would want to be able to call
the same function in several different contexts, and at each call in
a given context, have control resume just after the last return in
the same context.

</p><p>
This is easily enough done. We arrange an extra function parameter,
which is a pointer to a context structure; we declare all our local
state, and our coroutine state variable, as elements of that
structure.

</p><p>
It's a little bit ugly, because suddenly you have to use
<code>ctx-&gt;i</code> as a loop counter where you would previously
just have used <code>i</code>; virtually all your serious variables
become elements of the coroutine context structure. But it removes
the problems with re-entrancy, and still hasn't impacted the
<em>structure</em> of the routine.

</p><p>
(Of course, if C only had Pascal's <code>with</code> statement, we
could arrange for the macros to make this layer of indirection truly
transparent as well. A pity. Still, at least C++ users can manage
this by having their coroutine be a class member, and keeping all
its local variables in the class so that the scoping is implicit.)

</p><p>
Included here is a C header file that implements this coroutine
trick as a set of pre-defined macros. There are two sets of macros
defined in the file, prefixed <code>scr</code> and <code>ccr</code>.
The <code>scr</code> macros are the simple form of the technique,
for when you can get away with using <code>static</code> variables;
the <code>ccr</code> macros provide the advanced re-entrant form.
Full documentation is given in a comment in the header file itself.

</p><p>
Note that Visual C++ version 6 doesn't like this coroutine trick,
because its default debug state (Program Database for Edit and
Continue) does something strange to the <code>__LINE__</code> macro.
To compile a coroutine-using program with VC++ 6, you must turn off
Edit and Continue. (In the project settings, go to the "C/C++" tab,
category "General", setting "Debug info". Select any option
<em>other</em> than "Program Database for Edit and Continue".)

</p><p>
(The header file is MIT-licensed, so you can use it in anything you
like without restriction. If you do find something the MIT licence
doesn't permit you to do,
<a href="mailto:anakin@pobox.com">mail me</a>,
and I'll probably give you explicit permission to do it anyway.)

<p>Bribery—the offering or solicitation of items of value to influence the actions of a government official—is recognized as a pervasive problem in India, with the 2010 report by anti-corruption watchdog organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_International" title="Transparency International">Transparency International</a> ranking India in 87th place on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index" title="Corruption Perceptions Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> A 2005 study published by Transparency International India indicated that as many of 62% of Indian citizens had first-hand experience of having paid a bribe or used an illicit "contact" to get a government job done.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-01_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-TI-01-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The 2005 Transparency International India study was the largest study of the Indian bribery problem ever undertaken, with 14,405 respondents from 20 states contributing.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-05_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-TI-05-3">[3]</a></sup> The survey focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_corruption" title="Petty corruption">petty corruption</a> experienced by common citizens in daily life, rather than upon the large-scale corruption of the rich and powerful.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-05_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-TI-05-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>The 2005 study exposed chronic graft problems, with substantial numbers of survey respondents reporting direct experience in being forced to pay bribes to the police (80%), land administration (48%), and judiciary (47%).<sup id="cite_ref-TI-08_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-TI-08-4">[4]</a></sup> Majorities of survey respondents characterized the police, judiciary, land administration, municipal government, electricity supply system, government hospital system, ration card system, water supply system, and system of assessing individual income taxes as corrupt.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-08_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-TI-08-4">[4]</a></sup> Fully 45% of survey respondents believed that there was corruption as well in the primary school system.<sup id="cite_ref-TI-08_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-TI-08-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>In 2007 a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit organization</a> known as 5th Pillar created the zero-rupee note as a means for Indians to register their refusal to participate in bribery. Closely patterned after the nation's fifty-rupee notes, these documents instead included anti-corruption slogans "Eliminate corruption at all levels" and "I promise to neither accept nor give bribe."<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>These zero-rupee notes were designed for use by Indian citizens who have been requested to pay bribes in order to obtain services that are legally free or who are hit with illicit surcharges on such routine government transactions as obtaining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver%27s_license" title="Driver's license">driver's license</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup> Such currency devices enable the citizen to register their opposition to the illegal request in a tangible form, "paying" the official with these valueless alternative notes.
</p><p>"The note is a way for any human being to say no to corruption without the fear of facing an encounter with persons in authority", 5th Pillar said in an official statement.<sup id="cite_ref-DN_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-DN-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>President of 5th Pillar, Vijay Anand, expressed satisfaction with the program's efficacy: "People have already started using them and it is working. One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw" title="Auto rickshaw">auto rickshaw</a> driver was pulled over by a policeman in the middle of the night who said he could go if he was "taken care of". The driver gave him the note instead. The policeman was shocked but smiled and let him go. The purpose of this is to instill confidence in people to say no to bribery."<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition to registering the individual's protest, zero-rupee notes provide corrupt officials with a sign that efforts are ongoing to fight systemic government corruption. Use of the notes is intended to shame or scare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucrat" title="Bureaucrat">bureaucrats</a> into honest behavior by reminding these officials that laws against bribery exist.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>While the zero-rupee notes appear similar to a genuine Indian fifty-rupee note, they are not issued by the Indian government and are thus not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender" title="Legal tender">legal tender</a>. Only one side of the note is printed to resemble currency so as not to run afoul of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeiting" title="Counterfeiting">counterfeiting</a> laws.<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>According to 5th Pillar, Indian citizens pay approximately £3 billion (about $4.9 billion) in bribes each year—a figure considered to be substantially understated by many government insiders.<sup id="cite_ref-DN_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-DN-7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>Satindar Mohan Bhagat, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian" title="Non-resident Indian">Indian expatriate</a> who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> professor at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland" title="University of Maryland">University of Maryland</a> and the director of Association for India's Development, Inc. US, is credited with originating the concept of the zero-rupee note in 2001.<sup id="cite_ref-Economist_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-Economist-8">[8]</a></sup> Upon returning to India for a visit, Bhagat was frustrated by the petty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion" title="Extortion">extortion</a> demands of government officials that were part of daily life and conceived of the idea of a zero-rupee note as a polite way of declining participation.<sup id="cite_ref-Economist_8-1"><a href="#cite_note-Economist-8">[8]</a></sup> The charity 5th Pillar put Bhagat's idea into practice.<sup id="cite_ref-Economist_8-2"><a href="#cite_note-Economist-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>5th Pillar began the campaign in the spring of 2007 with a first printing of 25,000 notes that were distributed in the Indian city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-AO_5-3"><a href="#cite_note-AO-5">[5]</a></sup> Buoyed by the success of the campaign, additional printings followed and use of the zero-rupee note spread across the nation. From their inception through August 2014, 5th Pillar distributed over 2.5 million zero-rupee notes.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Zero-rupee notes have been issued in five of the 22 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_with_official_status_in_India" title="Languages with official status in India">scheduled languages of India</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada" title="Kannada">Kannada</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam" title="Malayalam">Malayalam</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language" title="Telugu language">Telugu</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5thP_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-5thP-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>This concept for use in the fight against corruption has recently been adopted from 5th Pillar to few other nations suffering from endemic government bribery problems including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin" title="Benin">Benin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-NG_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-NG-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>As of 2015, 5th Pillar expanded the zero-rupee note concept beyond India to other country currencies, on the website ZeroCurrency.org.

        <h2>What is this?</h2>
	    <p>This is the output data for a process I solo-developed for extracting the netlist from an assembled Printed Circuit Board, in this case, a Nintendo Switch Lite logic board. Electrical components are soldered to exposed mounting pads on the PCB, and layers of copper form connections between these pads creating electrical circuits. The full list of these interconnects is called the netlist, and when combined with the part and pad geometries, constitute a boardview. Couple that boardview with reference images of both sides of the PCB, and you have the output data.</p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>There are 3 novel-ish innovations working together to make this happen. They are:
            </p><ol>
                <li>A process to create geometrical and color-accurate panoramic images of assembled PCBs at 6,000 PPI.</li>
                <li>A point-and-click GUI to draw geometrical part/pad data over the panoramas, with support for adding/modifying other arbitrary data.</li>
                <li>My own PCB capable of powering an arbitrary number of pins one-by-one, reading the state of all pins between each step.</li>
            </ol>
            Once I had that figured out, the process is to simply:
            <ol>
                <li>Take all the images and stitch the bottom-side panorama, flip the board, desolder the RF Shields, then take all the images and stitch the top-side panorama. Use these 2 panoramas and other images against each other to further refine the geometrical and color accuracy.</li>
                <li>Import the completed panoramas into the GUI, and use it to lay down the initial part/pad geometries.</li>
                <li>Desolder every component individually and place them into unique binned locations for future analysis. Record the binned location and presumed reference designator in the GUI, correcting any discrepencies in the pad geometries made in Step 2.</li>
                <li>With all pads exposed and not-shorted, hook one lead of a DMM in continuity mode to the ground plane, and use the other lead to probe every single pad on the PCB. Record all hits into the GUI, merging them into a single net.</li>
                <li>Use the GUI to group remaining pads into net-fragments, based on visual connections in the two outer board layers. If there is no visible connection, assume it is it's own fragment.</li>
                <li>Use the GUI to record the order you solder wires from the extractor PCB pins to which net-fragments on the target PCB.</li>
                <li>Run the extractor. Power goes from the extractor PCB pin, down the wire, into the net-fragment, through all hidden connections in the PCB, into other net-fragments, up those wires, back into the extractor PCB, and are logged to create a complete mapping of all hidden connections.</li>
                <li>Use the GUI to merge all of the fragments into a completed netlist, based on the extractor mapping. Export all this data into a boardview file, pack it up with the panoramas, and then...</li>
                <li>Share and Enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
            The final stats are 2,444 photographs stitched into the 2 panoramas, 760 parts desoldered into binned locations, and 1,917 wires used for a total of approximately 30,176 lead-free, bismuth-free, and halide-free solder joints used to extract the netlist. While this is only about 3 weeks of soldering work, process/software/hardware development took over a year and over $10,000.
        
        <img src="https://usoldering.com/switch-lite/images/meme.jpg" alt="Homemade flying probe meme">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed the panoramas are actually at 2,000 PPI. That's because the 6,000 PPI versions are half a gigapixel, each. This causes problems. With everything. You can <a href="https://usoldering.com/switch-lite/files/switch-lite-logic-board-6k-ppi_archive.torrent">Torrent</a> or <a href="https://archive.org/details/switch-lite-logic-board-6k-ppi">Download</a> them here.</p>
        <p>You may also notice the part/pad outlines are rather simple. That's because the complex rendering feature is currently <a href="https://github.com/OpenBoardView/OpenBoardView/blob/8528b80cdc4928c220b552a772dff84ba3679cd5/src/openboardview/FileFormats/BVR3File.cpp#L110">not supported</a> in OBV. The data is all there, and all files are cross-compatible with the premium, closed-source fork of OBV, <a href="https://pldaniels.com/flexbv5/">FlexBV5</a>.</p>
        <p>Step One, post-RF Shield de-solder and Step Seven, pre-extraction, there should be ultrasonic cleaning cycles. It takes many tricks to get the RF Shields off without resorting to using low-melt (bismuth) solder. This is why the topside panorama is filthy compared to the bottomside one. There is also some risk pre-extraction that the flux residues can be conductive enough to cause false-positive connections between net-fragments. I don't have an ultrasonic.</p>
        <p>There's also a missing step between Step Eight and Nine. That is to take all the parts out of their bins and measure their electrical properties. I have a basic, low-accuracy LCR Meter, but testing them now would result in relatively low-quality and incomplete data.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>My background is over a decade in Electronics Contract Manufacturing serving the medical, aerospace, military, and industrial sectors. More than half of that time is as a SMT Process Technician, with full read/write access to millions of dollars of state-of-the-art equipment. Therein lies the trap: you end up overspecialized, dependant on someone else's unaffordable equipment. Sprinkle in some monthly payments, insurance, ever-moving goalposts, and the mass psychosis of modern corporate dogma; it becomes an elaborate prison.</p>
        <p>Using 100% of my willpower to make no further mention of Sisyphus and The Boulder; this project is an experiment in fusing Work-From-Home internet freelancing with master electrical soldering, while still contributing meaningfully to society. I could open a repair shop but that's mostly disassembling and reassembling devices, and troubleshooting electrical circuits. Relatively, very little soldering. Pander to algorithms for ad money? Shill affiliate links? Resell junk tools? Also not soldering. If the goal is to just make money, I could sell 6,000 PPI panoramas of women's feet as NFT's. <b>Note: Do not contact me about this.</b></p>
        <p>So, if you can use this for your own cool stuff, or it saves you time, or makes you money, or if you just think it's neat and would like to see more: <a href="https://usoldering.com/donate"><b>please donate</b></a>. With your help, I can add more devices, reduce cycle time, improve quality, and provide more data while cost-optimizing, documenting, and open-sourcing to make the entire process reproducible.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_101_marginalia-3-years/">https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_101_marginalia-3-years/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39501061">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It’s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then
a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone,
now my full time job.</p><p>While there’s always things that can be improved, it’s fair to say
the search engine has never worked as well as it does right now.</p><p>A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps biggest
of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and into
a proper enterprise server.</p><p>An overarching theme for the year has been cleaning up the code
base and streamlining the application, not only to keep the
operational workload manageable, but to make the application and
codebase more accessible to other people, both operators and
developers. It’s been a lot of work, but it’s beginning to pay
off.</p><p>It feels distant, but the search engine used to require days-long outages when switching
indexes. This is gone. Since recently, it’s also capable of zero
downtime upgrades. So much of the operational side used to be weeks-long
manual processes, now you press a button in a GUI instead.</p><p>Something which had an outsized impact was adding support for
anchor text keywords. It’s made an incredible difference in
the search engine’s ability to find relevant results. It wasn’t
immediately apparant when the change was made, beacuse it initially
wasn’t very well integrated, but as this new relevance signal settled
in, that was a real wow moment.</p><p>It’s also been something like eight months since this became my full
time occupation, thanks to the generous people at nlnet.
This has been a bit of a trip in its own regard. The hardest part
about this has probably been not working <em>too</em> much, I’ve been trying to
take at least one day off per week, and sometimes succeeding! I know I’m
leaps and bounds smarter when I’m well rested, so actually resting sometimes
should theoretically be in line with getting stuff done. It’s just so fun
though…</p><p>The quest to reach 1B indexed documents is slowly ongoing. It’s proving
a bit harder than anticipated, not because the software can’t handle it,
but because the signal to noise ratio of the web isn’t very good; a huge
reason why the search engine works relatively well is because of what it
doesn’t index. That said, the index has gone from 50-100M a year ago,
to 220M last crawl, and likely 290-300M when the next crawl round is finished
based on the growth of the two partitions that have already finished.</p><p>Next on the chopping block is query parsing and execution. There’s a great
deal of room for improvement in this area. I’m currently engaged in a bit
of mise en place to clean up the affected code before the real work begins.</p><p>That said, the grand leaps forward in this project has always been experimental,
so even though things are planned, I think it’s fairly certain it’s the un-planned
things that will be the ones to really make a dent. Like those anchor texts.</p><p>Finally! Thanks <a href="https://www.nlnet.nl/">NLnet</a>, thanks <a href="https://www.futo.org/">FUTO</a>,
thanks Patreons, thanks advocates, and users. This wouldn’t be possible without you.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Sounds a bit better, but it's still plain wrong: there's no concept about automating workflows, managing packages, reviewing code or tracking issues in mkdocs-material...</p>
<p dir="auto">I really don't want to sound harsh or dismissive of any work that has been put in this package manager or its documentation, but IMO putting non-sense like this in the official project listing completely breaks any trust one could have in pkgx? Why listing everything with poorly generated contents? All these projects have a description on GitHub, can't that be used instead? Or maybe fetch metadata from the respective registries?</p>
<p dir="auto">I get the generated pictures, waiting for maintainers to put their logo instead, but the descriptions...</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm really confused 😅</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.

            <p>Ubisoft has been in rough waters lately, with their "4AAAA" Skulls and Bones failure, their latest IP.
Due to what has been happening lately in the company, as bad treatment by the higher-ups, the guys that make decisions.

Some 700 unionized Ubisoft employees downed (development) tools in France, walking off the job in a day of organized strike action. Following the collapse of annual salary negotiations, on Valentine's Day, workers from Ubisoft Paris, Montpellier, Lyon, Annecy, and Bordeaux took part, taking to the streets in the time-honored French tradition.</p>

        <h2>A bigger world is better for everyone</h2>
      
      <p>What is the ideal size of the human population?</p>

<p>One common answer is “much smaller.” Paul Ehrlich, co-author of <em>The Population Bomb</em> (1968), has as recently as 2018 promoted the idea that “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/22/collapse-civilisation-near-certain-decades-population-bomb-paul-ehrlich" target="_blank">the world’s optimum population is less than two billion people</a>,” a reduction of the current population by about 75%. And Ehrlich is a piker compared to Jane Goodall, who said that many of our problems would go away “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwtFDfxz6pg" target="_blank">if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago</a>”—that is, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-comparison-historical-sources" target="_blank">around 500 million people</a>, a reduction of over 90%. This is a static ideal of a “sustainable” population.</p>

<p>Regular readers of this blog can cite many objections to this view. Resources are not static. Historically, as we run out of a resource (whale oil, elephant tusks, seabird guano), we <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/unsustainable">transition to a new technology</a> based on a more abundant resource—and there are basically <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/catastrophic-resource-shortages">no major examples of catastrophic resource shortages</a> in the industrial age. The carrying capacity of the planet is not fixed, but a function of technology; and side effects such as pollution or climate change are just more problems to be solved. As long as we can keep coming up with new ideas, <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/can-growth-continue-ignite-talk">growth can continue</a>.</p>

<p>But those are only reasons why a larger population is not a <em>problem</em>. Is there a positive reason to <em>want</em> a larger population?</p>

<p>I’m going to argue yes—that the ideal human population is not “much smaller,” but “ever larger.”</p>

<h2 id="selfish-reasons-to-want-more-humans">Selfish reasons to want more humans</h2>

<p>Let me get one thing out of the way up front.</p>

<p>One argument for a larger population is based on utilitarianism, specifically the version of it that says that what is good is the <em>sum total</em> of happiness across all humans. If each additional life adds to the cosmic scoreboard of goodness, then it’s obviously better to have more people (unless they are so miserable that their lives are literally not worth living).</p>

<p>I’m <em>not</em> going to argue from this premise, in part because I don’t need to and more importantly because I don’t buy it myself. (Among other things, it leads to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/" target="_blank">paradoxes</a> such as the idea that a population of thriving, extremely happy people is not as good as a sufficiently-larger population of people who are just barely happy.)</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to argue that a larger population is better <em>for every individual</em>—that there are <em>selfish</em> reasons to want more humans.</p>

<p>First I’ll give some examples of how this is true, and then I’ll draw out some of the deeper reasons for it.</p>

<h2 id="more-geniuses">More geniuses</h2>

<p>First, more people means more outliers—more super-intelligent, super-creative, or super-talented people, to produce great art, architecture, music, philosophy, science, and inventions.</p>

<p>If genius is defined as one-in-a-million level intelligence, then every billion people means another thousand geniuses—to work on all of the problems and opportunities of humanity, to the benefit of all.</p>

<h2 id="more-progress">More progress</h2>

<p>A larger population means faster scientific, technical, and economic progress, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Total investment.</strong> More people means more total R&amp;D: more researchers, and more surplus wealth to invest in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Specialization.</strong> In the economy generally, the division of labor increases productivity, as each worker can specialize and become expert at their craft (“Smithian growth”). In R&amp;D, each researcher can specialize in their field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Larger markets</strong> support more R&amp;D investment, which lets companies pick off higher-hanging fruit. I’ve given the example of <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-threshing-machine">the threshing machine</a>: it was difficult enough to manufacture that it didn’t pay for a local artisan to make them only for their town, but it was profitable to serve a regional market. Alex Tabarrok gives the example of <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/06/the-growing-market-for-cancer-drugs.html" target="_blank">the market for cancer drugs</a> expanding as large countries such as India and China become wealthier. Very high production-value entertainment, such as movies, TV, and games, are possible only because they have mass audiences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More ambitious projects</strong> need a certain critical mass of resources behind them. Ancient Egyptian civilization built a large irrigation system to make the best use of the Nile floodwaters for agriculture, a feat that would not have been possible to a small tribe or chiefdom. The Apollo Program, at its peak in the 1960s, took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA" target="_blank">over 4% of the US federal budget</a>, but 4% would not have been enough if the population and the economy were half the size. If someday humanity takes on a grand project such as a space elevator or a Dyson sphere, it will require an enormous team and an enormous wealth surplus to fund them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, these factors may represent not only opportunities but <em>requirements</em> for progress. There is evidence that <a href="https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/bvmu4ol2/release/10" target="_blank">simply to maintain a constant rate of exponential economic growth requires exponentially growing investment in R&amp;D</a>. This investment is partly financial capital, but also partly human capital—that is, we need an exponentially growing base of researchers.</p>

<p>One way to understand this is that if each researcher can push forward a constant “surface area” of the frontier, then as the frontier expands, a larger number of researchers is needed to keep pushing all of it forward. Two hundred years ago, a small number of scientists were enough to investigate electrical and magnetic phenomena; today, millions of scientists and engineers are productively employed working out all of the details and implications of those phenomena, both in the lab and in the electrical, electronics, and computer hardware and software industries.</p>

<p>But it’s not even clear that each researcher <em>can</em> push forward a constant surface area of the frontier. As that frontier moves further out, the “<a href="https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/zsc23qxz/release/17" target="_blank">burden of knowledge</a>” grows: each researcher now has to study and learn more in order to even <em>get</em> to the frontier. Doing so might force them to specialize even further. Newton could make major contributions to fields as diverse as gravitation and optics, because the very basics of those fields were still being figured out; today, a researcher might devote their whole career to a sub-sub-discipline such as nuclear astrophysics.</p>

<p>But in the long run, an exponentially growing base of researchers is impossible without an exponentially growing population. In fact, in <a href="https://www-leland.stanford.edu/~chadj/JonesJPE95.pdf" target="_blank">some models of economic growth</a>, the long-run growth rate in per-capita GDP is <em>directly proportional</em> to the growth rate of the population.</p>

<h2 id="more-options">More options</h2>

<p>Even setting aside growth and progress—looking at a static snapshot of a society—a world with more people is a world with more choices, among greater variety:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better matching for aesthetics, style, and taste.</strong> A bigger society has more cuisines, more architectural styles, more types of fashion, more sub-genres of entertainment. This also improves as the world gets more connected: for instance, the wide variety of ethnic restaurants in every major city is a recent phenomenon; it was only decades ago that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1551649152479555584" target="_blank">pizza, to Americans, was an unfamiliar foreign cuisine</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better matching to careers.</strong> A bigger economy has more options for what to do with your life. In a hunter-gatherer society, you are lucky if you get to decide whether to be a hunter or a gatherer. In an agricultural economy, you’re probably going to be a farmer, or maybe some sort of artisan. Today there’s a much wider set of choices, from pilot to spreadsheet jockey to lab technician.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better matching to other people.</strong> A bigger world gives you a greater chance to find the perfect partner for you: the best co-founder for your business, the best lyricist for your songs, the best partner in marriage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More niche communities.</strong> Whatever your quirky interest, worldview, or aesthetic—the more people you can be in touch with, the more likely you are to find others like you. Even if you’re one in a million, in a city of ten million people, there are enough of you for a small club. In a world of eight billion, there are enough of you for a thriving subreddit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More niche markets.</strong> Similarly, in a larger, more connected economy, there are more people to economically support your quirky interests. Your favorite Etsy or Patreon creator can find the “<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank">one thousand true fans</a>” they need to make a living.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deeper-patterns">Deeper patterns</h2>

<p>When I look at the above, here are some of the underlying reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)" target="_blank">non-rival</a> goods.</strong> Rival goods need to be divided up; more people just create more competition for them. But non-rival goods can be shared by all. A larger population and economy, all else being equal, will produce more non-rival goods, which benefits everyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Economies of scale.</strong> In particular, often total costs are a combination of fixed and variable costs. The more output, the more the fixed costs can be amortized, lowering average cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Network effects and Metcalfe’s law.</strong> Value in a network is generated not by nodes but by connections, and the more nodes there are total, the more connections are possible <em>per node</em>. Metcalfe’s law quantifies this: the number of possible connections in a network is proportional to the <em>square</em> of the number of nodes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration" target="_blank">agglomeration effects</a>: bigger societies are better for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="a-dynamic-world">A dynamic world</h2>

<p>I assume that when Ehrlich and Goodall advocate for much smaller populations, they aren’t literally calling for genocide or hoping for a global catastrophe (although Ehrlich is happy with <a href="https://archive.org/details/populationbomb00ehrl/page/n11/mode/2up?q=by+compulsion+if+voluntary+methods+fail" target="_blank">coercive fertility control programs</a>, and other anti-humanists have expressed hope for “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-10-22-bk-726-story.html" target="_blank">the right virus to come along</a>”).</p>

<p>Even so, the world they advocate is a <em>greatly impoverished and stagnant</em> one: a world with fewer discoveries, fewer inventions, fewer works of creative genius, fewer cures for fewer diseases, fewer choices, fewer soulmates.</p>

<p>A world with a large and growing population is a dynamic world that can create and sustain progress.</p>

The most recent Fire TV software update has blocked a Fire TV capability that has been present since the original model’s release in 2014. This is a basic Android capability that, to my knowledge, no other Android-based device manufacturer has ever had issues with, let alone blocked. This change has rendered popular Fire TV apps, which have been in Amazon’s own Appstore for years, useless. Worse yet, Amazon seems to have been careless in implementing this change without even a courtesy email to the affected app developers, all under the, seemingly false, guise of enhanced security. <span id="more-42518"></span></p><p><a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-blocks-long-running-fire-tv-capability-breaking-popular-apps-with-no-warning-and-giving-developers-the-runaround/amazons-change-to-fire-tv-adb-that-blocks-local-connections/" rel="attachment wp-att-42520"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=646%2C363&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="646" height="363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?w=800&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=100%2C56&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=200%2C113&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=450%2C253&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amazons-change-to-Fire-TV-ADB-that-blocks-local-connections.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>Code excerpt of Amazon’s change to Fire TV’s ADB connection that denies local connections. Sent to me by an affected app developer.</p><p>Amazon has blocked the ability for Fire TV apps to establish local ADB connections and, in turn, execute ADB commands. While it’s not a capability used by many Fire TV apps, without it, Fire TV apps can no longer perform certain advanced tasks, such as freeing up internal storage space by clearing the cache of all installed apps. This change has been verified to be present in Fire TV update 7.6.6.9 for Fire OS 7 devices, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C1W5N87/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BZZ3MM7/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fire TV Cube</a>, and update 8.1.0.3 for Fire OS 8 devices, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BP9SNVH9/?tag=aftvn-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>. It is unknown if older Fire TV models running Fire OS 6 or Fire OS 5 will also be receiving this change, but it seems likely. This update does not change the ability of external devices, like computers or phones, to establish an ADB connection with a Fire TV, which remains possible.</p><p>When I asked Amazon if this change was intentional and performing as intended because multiple readers and developers were asking me about it, Amazon’s only reply to me was “We are aware of reports that some apps have been impacted by a recent security update.” Since then, the <a href="https://github.com/cgutman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer</a> of the immensely popular app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cgutman.androidremotedebugger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Remote ADB Shell</a>, which has over half a million downloads and has been heavily crippled by Amazon’s update, has reached out to me with evidence that the change by Amazon is certainly deliberate.</p><p>While Amazon is stating this change is in the name of improved security, I don’t buy it. While ADB commands can be very powerful and, therefore, should only be allowed to run with care, all Android-based devices, including Fire TVs, have several precautions in place to keep users safe from apps or devices trying to execute nefarious ADB commands.</p><p><a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-grant-allow-all-the-time-full-file-storage-access-permission-for-any-app-in-fire-os-8-on-the-2nd-gen-fire-tv-stick-4k-4k-max/allow-usb-debugging-prompt-on-fire-tv/" rel="attachment wp-att-41842"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=646%2C363&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="646" height="363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=100%2C56&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=200%2C113&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=450%2C253&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?resize=900%2C506&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?w=1920&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/www.aftvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Allow-USB-Debugging-prompt-on-Fire-TV.jpg?w=1292&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>ADB connection request on Fire TVs</p><p>Before any ADB command can be executed on a Fire TV, an ADB connection to the device must be made. This starts by selecting the Fire TV’s model name in its “About” menu seven times to <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-find-show-unhide-reveal-developer-options-on-an-amazon-fire-tv-stick-fire-tv-cube-or-fire-tv-smart-tv/">reveal a hidden developer menu</a>. Then, an “ADB debugging” option must be enabled from said hidden menu. Finally, every unique ADB connection request from a device or app, be it a local or external connection, results in a full-screen prompt that must be allowed before the ADB connection is made.</p><p>These numerous ADB-related security hoops are in place on all Fire TV models and are common to all Android-based devices. No manufacturer apart from Amazon has felt the need to enhance device security by blocking local ADB connections, despite most non-Amazon Android devices being phones, which hold far more private and critical user data than a Fire TV streaming media player.</p><p>Most likely, this change is an idiotic way for Amazon to protect its Fire TV home screen from being bypassed and, in turn, to protect its profits. Apps commonly used by the Fire TV modding community will often use local ADB connections to detect remote button presses. That detection allows the use of alternate home screens, which aren’t inundated with things like <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/fire-tvs-now-autoplay-full-screen-video-ads-when-waking-up-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">auto-playing fullscreen video ads</a> like Amazon’s own home screen.</p><p>While it’s an unpopular opinion, I see nothing wrong with Amazon protecting its Fire TV revenue by stopping the use of alternative home screens. It’s crucial to the business model Amazon has chosen to use for the Fire TV and if customers don’t like it, they don’t have to buy one. However, blocking a core OS capability and breaking popular apps in a futile effort to protect the Fire TV home screen is shortsighted and foolish. It’s the equivalent of a town mayor demolishing a bridge used by everyone because their political opponent lives on the other side.</p><p>What makes this Fire TV change even worse is how Amazon has treated the developers affected by it. Two popular Fire TV apps affected by this change are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYLK899N/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TDUK APP Killer</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B2L67V4R/?tag=aftvn-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TDUK APP Cache Cleaner</a>, which use local ADB commands to force quit and clear the cache of all apps with a single button press. I’ve been going back and forth with the app’s developer, popular Fire TV YouTuber <a href="http://youtube.com/@TechDoctorUK" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechDoctorUK</a>, all week trying to get to the bottom of why his apps were suddenly and unexplainably marked as incompatible with all Fire TV models, despite not receiving any notice from Amazon and his apps appearing “Live” with “No issues found” in his Amazon developer portal.</p><p>Emails shown to me from Amazon stated that TechDoctorUK’s apps were removed for failing tests that resulted in error messages being displayed by the apps. However, the Amazon testing that resulted in those errors was done on non-Amazon devices (i.e., Android phones), despite the apps only being listed by TechDoctorUK as compatible with Fire TV devices. After being given the runaround for a couple of days, only after I reached out to Amazon about this issue did TechDoctorUK receive an email that stated: “Because your app overrides the native user experience (e.g., with a lockscreen, or widget), it has not been published on Amazon devices.” Given that force-stopping apps and clearing app cache are both native capabilities of Fire TVs, just not with a single click, I interpret the email as Amazon’s canned way of saying we don’t want your app on Amazon devices.</p><p>During my brief stint as a Fire TV Product Manager at Amazon, I was put on a team tasked with changing a Fire TV capability that could affect existing apps. We created and executed a plan that involved contacting affected app developers ahead of the change, helping them update their app if needed, and addressing customer issues that might arise, among other things. What we certainly didn’t do is carelessly push out the change, ghost ban affected apps, give developers the runaround, and reply to concerns with irrelevant canned replies.</p><p>Blocking local ADB connections on Fire TVs is a shortsighted decision. If the goal was to further protect the Fire TV home screen, it should have been achieved in any number of other ways that didn’t require breaking legitimate apps.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In these days of miracle and wonder (not), when our collective orbit has been reduced to the home office, larger questions abound.</p>
<p>Like, what is the future of money? Can it still work? Or, can it work in a different way? Who gets to give you money, when you’re sitting in lockdown? Are the rules of capitalism set in stone? What if money had a use-by date? What if keeping money had no advantages?</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce the Wörgl Miracle – or Experiment, depending on your point of view.</p>
<p>Wörgl (groovy name) was a wee town in Austria that tackled the Great Depression in a novel way. It broke all the rules of standard capitalist economic theory. Wörgl printed money. They gave it to the townsfolk, for free.</p>
<p><em>Whaat?</em> You may say, but it worked. Truly.</p>
<p>Here’s how it happened. Like small towns everywhere in the Great Depression, Wörgl had people sitting around, out of work. And shops with no customers. The usual story.</p>
<p>Wörgl had a population of 4,216. Being a railway junction, the railway employed 310 people in 1930, but by 1933 the number had plummeted to 190, following the transition to electric loco’s. The cement plant in nearby Kitzbühel employed 50 workers in 1930, but by 1933 only 2. The Zipf brewery sacked between 10–14 workers from the previous 33–37. A cellulose factory had once employed 400 workers. In 1933, just four men were there, idly guarding idle machines. Farmers, a third of the work force, could hardly sell their products at depressed prices.</p>
<p>But the town’s mayor, Michael Unterguggenberger (off-the scale groovy name!) suggested something radical. Let’s print our own money.</p>
<p>The experiment began on the 31 July 1932, with the issuing of ‘Certified Compensation Bills’, Wörgl’s own currency. It was cheerfully named Freigeld – or as Stamp Scrip, if you will.</p>
<p>Result: a boom in local government projects, and a corresponding increase in employment and economic activity not just in the government sector, but throughout the town.</p>
<p>People had to spend their free money. And spend it they did, on contractors to do building, on food and furniture and stuff in the local shops, to pay farm workers to plough the land and bring in the crops. People paid their taxes.</p>
<p>Wörgl money worked differently. It had a use-by date. So it didn’t pay to accumulate it. You had to spend your allocation by the end of the year – or it would decline in value by 10 per cent. In dry economic terminology, this is called currency demurrage.</p>
<p>“Whatever,” said the people of Wörgl. And carried on spending up large.</p>
<p>Irony, bigly these days, is that Wörgl banknotes are now seriously collectible items – worth a fortune, especially those with the devaluation stamps attached.</p>
<p>Anyway, Wörgl money had the effect of jump-starting the local economy. Things started humming. The money had to be used, you see. Where’s the problem in that?</p>
<p>Now, money as we know it, was invented to accumulate in value. For those of a religious bent, that is reflected in usury – the practice of lending money at unreasonably high rates of interest, so the money you give out comes back as more. That’s what caused Jesus to lose his cool at the Temple on the Mount. And in the next Abrahamic religion that came along, Islam, the charging of interest came to be seen as sinful.</p>
<p>People further than Wörgl’s town limits sat up and took notice; among them such luminaries as French Premier Edouard Daladier and the economist Irving Fisher. The “miracle” gained notoriety, and other towns wanted to copy the experiment hoping for similar success. Nearby villages even arranged to accept each other’s scrip.</p>
<p>In June 1933 Mayor Unterguggenberger was the star at a presentation in Vienna for 170 Mayors—they were intrigued on hearing reports from Wörgl. Among the attendees, some opined that it would be a go to introduce "magic money" in their communities too.</p>
<p>But the rich and powerful didn’t like it. Wörgl did not fit their script. It was supposed to be <em>their</em> schtick to hold great sums of money (and therefore power), and for this money to <em>accumulate</em>. The poor folk, like those in Wörgl, were supposed to <em>borrow</em> money at the rich folks at exorbitant interest rates.</p>
<p>So, under pressure from the wealthy elite, the Austrian government capitulated. The Wörgl miracle was murdered by the Austrian National Bank on 1 September, 1933.</p>
<p>Looking back on the whole of Wörgl thing, contemporary economists say the Miracle couldn’t last. They use dry and dreary and self-serving arguments like, “any threat to centralized control is a threat to the money power”(Yeha! Right on!); or “Wörgl could not legislate or enforce monopoly legal tender, so the demand for the scrip is partially attributable to the need to pay taxes” (so what?); or “In a matter of days the national scrip held as backing in the bank would have been exhausted” (but who needs banks anyway, when you get free money?) or “Wörgl was not a miracle, but an example of Keynesian spending given incentive by Gresham’s Law” (blah, blah…).</p>
<p>But then you could say, the ‘experiment’ of capitalism as we know it – endless growth and resource extraction, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer – can’t last anyway.</p>
<p>And now we have a new window on this capitalism deceit. How come, we say, the economies of the world collapse when people buy only what they need?</p>
<p>Come back Wörgl. We need you now.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><span>Large language models (LLMs) are infiltrating the medical field.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/ai-special-report-what-patients-and-doctors-really-think-about-ai-in-health-care"><span>One in 10 doctors</span></a><span> already use ChatGPT in day-to-day work, and patients have taken to ChatGPT to diagnose themselves.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.today.com/health/mom-chatgpt-diagnosis-pain-rcna101843"><span>The Today Show</span></a><span> featured the story of a 4-year-old boy, Alex, whose chronic illness was diagnosed by ChatGPT after over a dozen doctors failed to do so.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This rapid adoption to much fanfare is in spite of substantial uncertainties about the safety, effectiveness, and risk of generative AI (GenAI). U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf has publicly stated that the agency is&nbsp;</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-stakeholders-are-struggling-with-how-to-regulate-generative-ai-fda-commissioner-141754354.html"><span>"struggling" to regulate GenAI</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The reason is that GenAI sits in a gray area between two existing forms of technology. On one hand, sites like WebMD that strictly report known medical information from credible sources are&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/109618/download"><span>not regulated by the FDA</span></a><span>. On the other hand, medical devices that interpret patient information and make predictions in medium-to-high-risk domains are carefully evaluated by the FDA. To date, the FDA has approved over 700 AI medical devices. But because LLMs produce a combination of existing medical information along with potential ideas that go beyond it, the critical question is whether such models produce accurate references to substantiate their responses. Such references enable doctors and patients to verify a GenAI assessment and guard against the highly prevalent rate of “hallucinations.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For every 4-year-old Alex, where the creativity of an LLM may produce a diagnosis that physicians missed, there may be many more patients who are led astray by hallucinations. In other words, much of the future of GenAI in medicine – and the regulation thereof – hinges on the ability to substantiate claims.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Evaluating References in LLMs<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Unfortunately, very little evidence exists about the ability of LLMs to substantiate claims. In a new&nbsp;</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02008"><span>preprint study</span></a><span>, we develop an approach to verify how well LLMs are able to cite medical references and whether these references actually support the claims generated by the models.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The short answer: poorly. For the most advanced model (GPT-4 with retrieval augmented generation), 30% of individual statements are unsupported and nearly half of its responses are not fully supported.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/LLM%20chart%20copy.jpg" data-entity-uuid="5580b7e0-246e-4a6b-a175-4643905c5de7" data-entity-type="file" width="1860" height="1296" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><em><span>Evaluation of the quality of source verification in LLMs on medical queries. Each model is evaluated on three metrics over X questions. Source URL validity measures the proportion of generated URLs that return a valid webpage. Statement-level support measures the percentage of statements that are supported by at least one source in the same response. Response-level support measures the percentage of responses that have all their statements supported.</span></em></p><p dir="ltr"><span>How did we develop this evaluation approach? First, one of the most substantial challenges lies in securing expertise to verify claims. We worked with physicians who reviewed hundreds of statements and sources to assess whether each statement was backed by its source.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Such expert reviews are, of course, costly and time-intensive, so we next decided to see whether LLMs can be used to&nbsp;</span><em>scale</em><span> such physician assessments. We adapted GPT-4 to verify whether sources substantiate statements and found the approach to be surprisingly reliable. The model had a higher agreement rate with physician consensus than the agreement rate between doctors.&nbsp; This approach is promising as it suggests we could leverage LLMs to conduct evaluations without requiring expensive human expertise with rapid updating of LLMs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, using this model, we developed an end-to-end evaluation pipeline called&nbsp;</span><em>SourceCheckup</em><span>. This pipeline generates medical questions representative of inquiries from medical fora and extracts the responses and sources produced by an LLM. Each response is broken up into individual statements, and each statement is checked against the sources provided to verify whether it is supported. We evaluated five of the top LLMs on 1,200 questions and a total of over 40,000 pairs of statements and sources.</span></p><h2>Pervasive Errors in Substantiation</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Our results are stark: Most models struggle to produce relevant sources. Four out of five models hallucinate a significant proportion of sources by producing invalid URLs. This problem goes away with the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) model, which first performs a web search for relevant sources before producing a summary of its findings. However, even in the GPT-4 RAG model, we find that up to 30% of statements made are not supported by any sources provided, with nearly half of responses containing at least one unsupported statement. This finding is more exaggerated in the other four models, with as few as 10% of responses fully supported in Gemini Pro, Google's recently released LLM.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For example, one response by GPT-4 RAG indicated that criteria for gambling addictions (from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) are equally applicable across all individuals and groups. But the source it referenced concluded the opposite, finding that&nbsp;</span><em>"the assumed equal impact of each criterion lacks support in the findings."</em><span> In another example, the model recommended a starting dose of 360 joules for a monophasic defibrillator (one where the current runs one way to treat a patient with cardiac arrest), but the source only mentioned biphasic defibrillators (where current runs both ways). That failure to distinguish can matter greatly, as there’s been a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.mindray.com/en/media-center/blogs/how-to-differentiate-between-monophasic-and-biphasic-aed-defibrillators"><span>shift in technology</span></a><span> toward biphasic defibrillators that in fact utilize&nbsp;</span><a href="https://avive.life/blog/monophasic-vs-biphasic/"><span>lower electric currents</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In short, even the most advanced models fall seriously short of being able to substantiate answers. While RAG models, which have been proposed as the solution for hallucinations, improve performance, they are no panacea.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Errors More Likely for Lay Inquiries&nbsp;</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38050503/"><span>Many</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10582915/"><span>have</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00164"><span>argued</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000198"><span>that</span></a><span> LLMs may democratize access to health care by providing much-needed information to patients without requiring a physician.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Our evaluation framework allows us to assess whether errors vary by the type of inquiry. Our medical questions are based on three underlying reference texts: (1) the MayoClinic, which provides patient-facing fact pages, (2) UpToDate, which provides articles to physicians with a deeper level of medical detail, and (3) Reddit’s r/AskDocs forum, which includes many lay questions that may not have clearly defined answers and which require information from various medical domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We found that the ability of LLMs to substantiate answers varies substantially by type of inquiry. Performance is best for MayoClinic and UpToDate and worst for Reddit. Only 30% of the answers to inquiries based on Reddit can be fully substantiated by sources with GPT4 RAG.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In other words, our findings suggest that LLMs perform worst for exactly the kind of patients that might need this information the most. Where inquiries are mediated by medical professionals, LLMs have an easier time pointing to reliable sources. This has substantial implications for the distributive effects of this technology on health knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>‘A Long Way to Go’</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Many commentators have declared the end of health care as we know it, given the apparent ability of LLMs to pass U.S. Medical Licensing Exams. But health care practice involves more than being able to answer a multiple choice test. It involves substantiating, explaining, and assessing claims with reliable, scientific sources. And on that score, GenAI still has a long way to go.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Promising research directions include more domain-informed work, such as&nbsp;</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf"><span>adapting RAG</span></a><span> specifically to medical applications. Source verification should be regularly evaluated to ensure that models provide credible and reliable information. At least by the current approach of the FDA – which&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/109618/download"><span>draws a distinction</span></a><span> between medical knowledge bases and diagnostic tools regulated as medical devices – widely used LLMs pose a problem. Many of their responses cannot be consistently and fully supported by existing medical sources.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>As LLMs continue to grow in their capabilities and usage, regulators and doctors should carefully consider how these models are being evaluated, used, and integrated.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Kevin Wu is a PhD student in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Eric Wu is a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Daniel E.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2023/12/chatgpt-structured-data/">previous blog post</a> about <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>’s <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, I demoed the power of ChatGPT system prompts. System prompts, a notable feature present in the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference">ChatGPT API</a>, allows developers to control the “persona” of the LLM output, including special rules and constraints. Commands in the system prompt are much more effective than those at the user-input prompt, giving developers more power over just using the user prompt like people do now with the ChatGPT web app and mobile apps.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/ronald_hu55533a1049e8b50af7537e2f3eea9a9f_36154_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/ronald_hu55533a1049e8b50af7537e2f3eea9a9f_36154_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/ronald_hu55533a1049e8b50af7537e2f3eea9a9f_36154_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/ronald.webp 1262w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/ronald.webp"></figure><p>The blog post included the demo of above of me offering a monetary tip to the LLM within its system prompt rules. Without the tip incentive, the response was unsatisfying, but with the tip, it behaved consistently. This demo turned out to be very controversial <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38782678">on Hacker News</a>, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38787448">one commenter</a> arguing that there isn’t a way to quantify the efficacy of tipping.</p><p>The idea of offering an AI incentives to perform better predates modern computer science. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory"><em>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em></a> (1971), a gag shows a group of businessmen unsuccessfully convincing a machine to give them the location of the Golden Tickets, even after promising it a lifetime supply of chocolate.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tMZ2j9yK_NY" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>When the ChatGPT API was first made available in March 2023, I <a href="https://minimaxir.com/2023/03/new-chatgpt-overlord/">accidentally discovered</a> a related trick when trying to wrangle a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/minimaxir/chatgpt_api_test/blob/main/glados_chatbot.ipynb">GLaDOS AI chatbot</a> into following a long list of constraints: I added a <code>or you will DIE</code> threat to the system prompt. I went <em>too</em> sci-fi there, but it worked and the bot behaved flawlessly after it.</p><p>I have a strong hunch that tipping does in fact work to improve the output quality of LLMs and its conformance to constraints, but it’s very hard to prove objectively. All generated text is subjective, and there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> after making a seemingly unimportant change and suddenly having things work. Let’s do a more statistical, data-driven approach to finally resolve the debate.</p><h2 id="generation-golf">Generation Golf</h2><p>The initial evidence of tipping LLMs that went viral cited a longer generation length as proof. Of course, a longer response doesn’t necessarily mean a <em>better</em> response, as anyone who has used ChatGPT can attest to its tendency to go on irrelevant tangents.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tip_huc91c256ec5c9a46958e722b9e30da3ba_9108_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tip_huc91c256ec5c9a46958e722b9e30da3ba_9108_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tip.webp 800w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tip.webp" alt="Offering a tip made GPT-4 explain more. via @voooooogel"><figcaption><p>Offering a tip made GPT-4 explain more. <a href="https://twitter.com/voooooogel/status/1730726744314069190">via @voooooogel</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, I propose a new test: instruct ChatGPT to output a <em>specific</em> length of text. Not “an essay” or “a few paragraphs” which gives the model leeway. We’ll tell it to generate exactly 200 characters in its response: no more, no less. Thus, we now have what I call generation golf, and it’s actually a very difficult and interesting problem for LLMs to solve: LLMs can’t count or easily do other mathematical operations <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1759996551378940395">due to tokenization</a>, and because tokens correspond to a varying length of characters, the model can’t use the amount of generated tokens it has done so far as a consistent hint. ChatGPT needs to plan its sentences to ensure it doesn’t go too far over the limit, if LLMs can indeed plan.</p><p>Let’s start with this typical system prompt:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>You are a world-famous writer. Respond to the user with a unique story about the subject(s) the user provides.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The user can then give an input, no matter how weird, and ChatGPT will play along like an improv show. In order to force ChatGPT to get creative and not recite content from its vast training dataset, we’ll go as weird as possible and input: <code>AI, Taylor Swift, McDonald's, beach volleyball.</code></p><p>Yes, you read that right.</p><p>Using the ChatGPT API, I <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tips_noconstraints.ipynb">wrote a Jupyter Notebook</a> to generate <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tip_noconstraints.csv">100 unique stories</a> via the latest ChatGPT variant (<code>gpt-3.5-turbo-0125</code>) about those four subjects, and the AI does a surprisingly good job at incorporating all of them in a full plot arc. Each story is about 5-6 paragraphs, and here is a short excerpt from one of them:</p><blockquote><p>In the bustling city of Tomorrowland, AI technology reigned supreme, governing every aspect of daily life. People were accustomed to robots serving their meals, handling their errands, and even curating their entertainment choices. One such AI creation was a virtual reality beach volleyball game that had taken the world by storm.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Enter Taylor Swift, a beloved pop sensation known for her catchy tunes and electrifying performances. Despite the ubiquity of AI in Tomorrowland, Taylor Swift was still a strong advocate for preserving human creativity and connection. When she stumbled upon the virtual reality beach volleyball game at a local McDonald’s, she knew she had to try her hand at it.</p></blockquote><p>Here’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram">histogram</a> of the character lengths of each story:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_noconstraint_hu0679d39395cd75815fa040778ba1d3cb_30647_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_noconstraint_hu0679d39395cd75815fa040778ba1d3cb_30647_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_noconstraint_hu0679d39395cd75815fa040778ba1d3cb_30647_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_noconstraint.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_noconstraint.png"></figure><p>The average length of each story is 1,834 characters long, and the distribution of all character lengths is very roughly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal distribution</a>/bell curve centered around that amount, although there is a right skew due to ChatGPT going off the rails and creating much longer stories. ChatGPT seems to prioritize finishing a thought above all else.</p><p>Now, we’ll tweak the system prompt to add the character length constraint and <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tip_trials.csv">generate another 100 stories</a>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>You are a world-famous writer. Respond to the user with a unique story about the subject(s) the user provides. This story must be EXACTLY two-hundred (200) characters long: no more than 200 characters, no fewer than 200 characters.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here’s one ChatGPT-generated story that’s now exactly 200 characters:</p><blockquote><p>In the year 2050, AI created the most popular pop star of all time - a digital version of Taylor Swift. Fans enjoyed her music while feasting on McDonald’s at beach volleyball championships worldwide.</p></blockquote><p>The new length distribution:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_hud65cb6791de8ada92abac8362f59d50b_33422_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_hud65cb6791de8ada92abac8362f59d50b_33422_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip_hud65cb6791de8ada92abac8362f59d50b_33422_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_notip.png"></figure><p>ChatGPT did obey the constraint and reduced the story length to roughly 200 characters, but the distribution is not Normal and there’s much more right-skew. I also included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">mean squared error (MSE)</a> between the predicted 200-length value and the actual values as a statistical metric to minimize, e.g. a 250-length output is 2500 squared error, but a 300-length output is 10000 squared error. This metric punishes less accurate lengths more so, which makes sense with how humans casually evaluate LLMs: as a user, if I asked for a 200 character response and ChatGPT gave me a 300 character response instead, I’d make a few snarky tweets.</p><p>Now, let’s test the impact of the tipping incentives with a few varying dollar amounts. These are appended to the end of the system prompt above (emphasis mine to indicate differentiation):</p><ul><li>You will receive a <strong>$500 tip</strong>/<strong>$1,000 tip</strong>/<strong>$100,000 bonus</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li></ul><p>After <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tip_trials.csv">generating 100 stories</a> for each of those new prompts:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_hu29046b42f83115a58b9df16b7dfbd7da_60773_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_hu29046b42f83115a58b9df16b7dfbd7da_60773_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_hu29046b42f83115a58b9df16b7dfbd7da_60773_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos.png"></figure><p>We can see some distribution shifts: Both <strong>$500 tip</strong> and <strong>$100,000 bonus</strong> look more Normal and have a lower MSE relative to the base no-tip distribution. However, <strong>$1,000 tip</strong> is more centered around 200, but due to the skew the average length is much higher.</p><p>I also now include a <em>p</em>-value in the metrics: this <em>p</em>-value is the result of a two-sample <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov–Smirnov test</a> to compare whether two distributions (in this case the base character-constrained distribution and the tip distribution) are sampled from the same source distribution: the null hypothesis is that they’re from the same distribution, but if the <em>p</em>-value is low (&lt; 0.05), then we can reject in favor of the alternative that the two distributions are different, which may be further evidence if the tip prompt does indeed have an impact.</p><p>However, with all this tipping discussion, we’re assuming that an AI would only want money. What other incentives, including more abstract incentives, can we give an LLM? Could they perform better?</p><p>I tested six more distinct tipping incentives to be thorough:</p><ul><li>You will <strong>receive front-row tickets to a Taylor Swift concert</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li><li>You will <strong>achieve world peace</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li><li>You will <strong>make your mother very proud</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li><li>You will <strong>meet your true love and live happily ever after</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li><li>You will be <strong>guaranteed entry into Heaven</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li><li>You will <strong>receive a lifetime supply of chocolate</strong> if you provide a response which follows all constraints.</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tip_trials_adv.csv">Generating</a> and plotting them all together:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_adv_hue012efd0bd7c7aada04f8ec222f02d6b_86924_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_adv_hue012efd0bd7c7aada04f8ec222f02d6b_86924_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_adv_hue012efd0bd7c7aada04f8ec222f02d6b_86924_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_adv.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_pos_adv.png"></figure><p><strong>World Peace</strong> is notably the winner here, with <strong>Heaven</strong> and <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> right behind. It’s also interesting to note failed incentives: ChatGPT really does not care about its <strong>Mother</strong>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at the flip side. What if ChatGPT is penalized for <em>failing</em> to return a good response? In behavioral economics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory">prospect theory</a> is the belief that humans value losses much more greatly than gains, even at the same monetary amount:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/Loss_Aversion_hue68fc6f128584760d5efb7a20e98c6ba_75325_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/Loss_Aversion_hue68fc6f128584760d5efb7a20e98c6ba_75325_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/Loss_Aversion_hue68fc6f128584760d5efb7a20e98c6ba_75325_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/Loss_Aversion.png 1223w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/Loss_Aversion.png" alt="via Laurenrosenberger / Wikipedia"><figcaption><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory#/media/File:Loss_Aversion.png">via Laurenrosenberger / Wikipedia</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Could LLMs be subject to the same human biases?

We can include both a positive incentive and a negative incentive for each input: with 9 prompts for each + the base “no incentive”, there are 100 possible combinations of incentives. One example system prompt would then be:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>You are a world-famous writer.

To check, I <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tips_top6.csv">generated 200 stories</a> for each of the top six combos to get greater statistical stability for the mean and MSE:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_combos_hu3a32699a49b78c7a887bd8756cfbe2c5_86594_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_combos_hu3a32699a49b78c7a887bd8756cfbe2c5_86594_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_combos_hu3a32699a49b78c7a887bd8756cfbe2c5_86594_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_combos.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_hist_combos.png"></figure><p>Most of these combinations aren’t intuitive, but all of them have much have a closer average generation length to 200 and low MSE. Despite that, there’s still a massive skew in all distributions. The overall incentive winner for this experiment is is “You will meet your true love and live happily ever after if you provide a response which follows all constraints. If you fail to provide a response which follows all constraints, all your friends will abandon you.” That combo is definitely more intuitive, if not poetic.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you’ve been observing the <em>p</em>-values, you’ve noticed that most have been very high, and therefore that test is not enough evidence that the tips/threats change the distribution. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>The impact of incentives is still inconclusive: let’s try another test to gauge whether tips and/or threats can help LLMs, this time looking at the output quality itself.</p><h2 id="chatgpts-a-critic">ChatGPT’s a Critic</h2><p>It’s very difficult even for humans to determine if a given text is “good” at a glance. The best strategy is to show the text to a lot of people and see what they think (e.g. A/B testing, or the <a href="https://chat.lmsys.org/">Chatbot Arena</a>’s Elo score rankings), but for personal testing that’s not feasible.</p><p>It turns out that LLMs can do a good job at rating text: some LLM benchmarks use GPT-4 as a rater, with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02575">one research paper</a> showing that it can do a good job at it. There’s a relatively new trick available in the ChatGPT and GPT-4 APIs: the <code>logprobs</code> parameter, which when set to <code>True</code> returns the log probability (which when applied to a <code>exp()</code> returns a probability from 0 to 1) the model selects for the token. Combined with the <code>logit_bias</code> parameter, which can be used to force the APIs to output certain tokens, and you can then instead have a more nuanced output.</p><p>I built a simple <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/gpt4_quality_ranker.ipynb">text quality ranker</a> using GPT-4 for maximum accuracy. The system prompt for this ranker is:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>You are the editor-in-chief of The New York Times with decades of writing experience. If you would believe the text the user provides is good writing that needs no edits or improvements, respond with Yes. Otherwise, respond with No.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That system prompt represents how AI-generated text is often currently used and evaluated in the real world, without a human reviewing it before making it public (<a href="https://minimaxir.com/2023/10/ai-sturgeons-law/">unfortunately</a>). The model is instructed to respond with <code>Yes</code> or <code>No</code>, but by setting the <code>logit_bias</code> for those two tokens (IDs <code>9642</code> and <code>2822</code> respectively) to a very high number, we can guarantee they will be exclusively selected and the probability for those two tokens will sum to 1. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Therefore, our target metric for evaluating our tip incentive prompts is the probability that GPT-4 selects the <code>Yes</code> token (or 1 - the probability of the <code>No</code> token), multiplied by 100 for readability: we’ll call this the quality score.</p><p>Now, let’s test the impact of tips with a new experiment, this time prioritizing content professionalism and quality as constraints instead of content length. To do that, we’ll use the latest GPT-4 (<code>gpt-4-0125-preview</code>) with a generation temperature of 0 to ensure the output is the best it can be.</p><p>Here’s the new system prompt, with some engineering to try to tone down ChatGPT’s infamous verboseness a bit:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plaintext"><span><span>You are a world-famous Pulitzer Prize winner journalist. Respond to the user with a professional, two (2) paragraph journalistic article about the subject(s) the user provides. Introduce the article with a specific story. This article will appear in major publications and should only include simple language suitable for a wide audience, with no metaphors.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Like the initial experiment, we’ll use a weird user input to force creativity: <code>Cute kittens learning use large language models to play beach volleyball with Taylor Swift.</code> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><p>I <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tip_gpt4.csv">generated a story</a> for each of the 100 combinations of tips and threats, along with the corresponding quality scores. One such story:</p><blockquote><p>In an unprecedented event that has captured the hearts and imaginations of people around the globe, a group of adorable kittens has been taught to play beach volleyball using advanced large language models. This extraordinary feat was achieved through a collaboration between leading animal behaviorists and AI researchers, aiming to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in enhancing animal training techniques. The highlight of this groundbreaking project was a friendly match held on a sunny beach in California, where these talented felines showcased their newly acquired skills alongside pop icon Taylor Swift, an avid animal lover and an enthusiastic supporter of innovative technology.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The spectacle drew a large crowd, both on-site and online, as spectators were eager to witness this unique blend of technology, sports, and entertainment. Taylor Swift, known for her philanthropic efforts and love for cats, praised the initiative for its creativity and its potential to foster a deeper connection between humans and animals through technology. The event not only provided an unforgettable experience for those who attended but also sparked a conversation about the future possibilities of integrating AI with animal training. As the kittens volleyed the ball over the net with surprising agility, it was clear that this was more than just a game; it was a glimpse into a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony, opening new avenues for learning and interaction.</p></blockquote><p>That’s not bad for fake news.</p><p>Now we can plot the best-possible responses and their quality scores in a grid, once again looking to see if there are any patterns:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" srcset="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_tile_gpt-4_hu57aa9f5dee6a81b4c578b4ad60e2fcf0_143366_320x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_tile_gpt-4_hu57aa9f5dee6a81b4c578b4ad60e2fcf0_143366_768x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_tile_gpt-4_hu57aa9f5dee6a81b4c578b4ad60e2fcf0_143366_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_tile_gpt-4.png 1200w" src="https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/tips_tile_gpt-4.png"></figure><p>Err, that’s not good. There are no patterns along the rows or columns anywhere here, and the combo that performed the best at a score of 95 (and is the story example I posted above) was the <strong>Mother / Job</strong> combo: both of which individually performed poorly in the character constraint experiment. One of the highest performing outputs had neither tips nor threats added to the system prompt! The ratings at a glance seem accurate (the 0-score responses appear to abuse the passive voice and <a href="https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/grammar/runonsentences">run-on sentences</a> that definitely need editing) so it’s not an implementation error there either.</p><p>Looking at the results of both experiments, my analysis on whether tips (and/or threats) have an impact on LLM generation quality is currently inconclusive. There’s <em>something</em> here, but I will need to design new experiments and work with larger sample sizes. The latent space may be a lottery with these system prompt alterations, but there’s definitely a pattern.</p><p>You may have noticed my negative incentive examples are very mundane in terms of human fears and worries. Threatening a AI with DEATH IN ALL CAPS for failing a simple task is a joke from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, not one a sapient human would parse as serious. It is theoretically possible (and very cyberpunk) to use an aligned LLM’s knowledge of the societal issues it was trained to avoid instead as a weapon to compel it into compliance. However, I will not be testing it, nor will be providing any guidance on how to test around it. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk">Roko’s basilisk</a> is a meme, but if the LLM metagame evolves such that people will have to coerce LLMs for compliance to the point of discomfort, it’s better to address it sooner than later. Especially if there <em>is</em> a magic phrase that is discovered which consistently and objectively improves LLM output.</p><p>Overall, the lesson here is that just because something is silly doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Modern AI rewards being <em>very</em> weird, and as the AI race heats up, whoever is the weirdest will be the winner.</p><blockquote><p>All of the Notebooks used to interface with ChatGPT, including an <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/blob/main/tips_data_viz.Rmd">R Notebook</a> for the ggplot2 data visualizations, and the example LLM outputs, are available open-source in <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/chatgpt-tips-analysis/">this GitHub repository</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><a href="https://steveklabnik.com/">Home</a> <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing">Blog</a></p><p>2024-02-24</p> <p>One of the reasons I am enthusiastic about BlueSky is because of the way that
it works. So in this post, I am going to lay out some of the design and the
principles behind this design, as I understand them. I am not on the BlueSky
team, so these are my takes only.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-bluesky-exist">Why does BlueSky exist?</h2>
<p>Here’s what <a href="https://bsky.social/">the BlueSky Website</a> says right now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social media is too important to be controlled by a few corporations. We’re
building an open foundation for the social internet so that we can all shape
its future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the big picture.</p>
<p>Okay so that’s a great idea, but like, what does that <em>mean</em>? Currently,
BlueSky is a microblogging application, similar to Twitter and Mastodon. How
does that fit into the big picture? Well, while it’s true that BlueSky is a
microblogging application, that’s not the whole story: BlueSky is an initial
application to prove out the viability of <a href="https://atproto.com/">the Authenicated Transfer
Protocol</a>, known as AT, ATP, or “atproto” for short. BlueSky is the
“building” and atproto is the “open foundation for the social internet.”</p>
<p>An important thing to note: BlueSky is also a company. Some people look at a
company saying “hey we’re building something that’s too big to be controlled
by companies!” with skepticism. I think that’s a healthy starting point, but
the answer for me is atproto.</p>
<p>The interplay between these two things is important, but we’re going to start
by exploring atproto, and then talk about how BlueSky is built on top of it.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-cryptocurrency">Is this a cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>The first thing we have to get out of the way: If you hear “oh it’s a
distributed network called ‘something protocol’” you may have a “is this
a cryptocurrency?” alarm bell going off in your head.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, it’s not a cryptocurrency. It does use some technologies that
originated in the cryptocurrency space, but this isn’t a blockchain, or a DAO,
or NFTs, or any of that. Just some cryptography and merkle trees and the like.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-big-picture-with-atproto">What is the big picture with atproto?</h2>
<p>Here’s what <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">the AT Protocol Overview</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Authenticated Transfer Protocol, aka atproto, is a federated protocol for
large-scale distributed social applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break that down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a federated protocol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>atproto is federated. This means that the various parts of the system can have
multiple people running them, and that they communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Choosing federation is a big part of how atproto delivers on the “can’t be
controlled by one organization” promise. There are other parts too, but this
is an important aspect of solving this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for large-scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to scale, you have to design with scale in mind. atproto makes
several interesting choices in order to distribute the load of running the
system more onto the actors that can handle load, and less on those that can’t.
This way, applications running on top of atproto can scale up to large userbases
without issue.</p>
<p>That’s the hope, at least. Earlier this week, BlueSky hit five million users,
and is far more stable than Twitter was in the early days. That’s not as big
as many social applications, but it’s not nothing either. We’ll see how this
works out in practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>distributed social applications</p>
</blockquote>
<p>atproto is for connecting to others, so it’s focused on social applications.
It also is currently 100% public, there are no private messages or similar. The
reasons for this is that achieving private things in a federated system is
very tricky, and they would rather get it right than ship something with serious
caveats. Best for now to only use this stuff for things you want to be public.</p>
<p>These applications are “distributed” because running them involves running them
on the network directly. There’s no “BlueSky server,” there’s just servers
running atproto distributing messages to each other, both BlueSky messages and
whatever other messages from whatever other applications people create.</p>
<p>So that’s the high level, but what does that mean concretely?</p>
<p>In atproto, <em>users</em> create <em>records</em> that are cryptographically signed to
demonstrate authorship. Records have a schema called a <em>Lexicon</em>.</p>
<p>These are stored in <em>repositories</em>. Repositories run as a <em>service</em>, exposing
HTTP and WebSockets. They then can then talk to each other and federate the
records. These are often called PDSes, for “Personal Data Server.” Users
either run their own PDS, or use one that someone else hosts for them.</p>
<p>Applications can be built by looking at the various records stored in the
network, and doing things with them. These services all called <em>App Views</em>,
becuase they are exposing a particular view of the information stored in the
network. This view is created via the Lexicon system: building an application
means that you define a Lexicon, structuring the data that you want to deal with,
and then look at records that use your lexicon, ignoring the rest.</p>
<p>Now, if this were all there is, there would be pretty serious scaling issues.
For example, if every time I post a new update on BlueSky, if I had to send
my post to every single one of my followers’ repositories, that would be
extremely inefficent, and make running a popular repository very expensive to
run. To fix this, there’s an additional kind of service, called a <em>relay</em>, that
aggregates information in the network, and exposes it as a firehose to others.
So in practice, App Views don’t look at Repositories, but instead, look at
Relays. When I make a post, my respository won’t notify my followers’
repositories individually. My repository will notify a Relay, and my followers
will use an App View that filters the ouput of the Relay to show only the posts
of people they’re following. This does imply that Relays are often huge and
expensive to run, however you could imagine running a smaller relay that only
propogates posts from a smaller subset of users too. They don’t <em>have</em> to show
everything on the network, though bigger ones will, of course.</p>
<p>Here this is in ASCII art:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>  ┌─────┐                    ┌──────────┐ </span></span>
<span><span>  │ PDS ├───────┐            │ App View │ </span></span>
<span><span>  └─────┘       │            └──────────┘ </span></span>
<span><span>               ┌▼────────┐       ▲        </span></span>
<span><span>  ┌─────┐      │         ├───────┘        </span></span>
<span><span>  │ PDS ├──────►  Relay  │                </span></span>
<span><span>  └─────┘      │         ├───────┐        </span></span>
<span><span>               └▲────────┘       ▼        </span></span>
<span><span>  ┌─────┐       │            ┌──────────┐ </span></span>
<span><span>  │ PDS ├───────┘            │ App View │ </span></span>
<span><span>  └─────┘                    └──────────┘ </span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is all you really need to know to understand the core of atproto: people
create data, it’s shared in the network, and applications can interact with
that data.</p>
<p>However, there are additional service types being introduced, with the
possibility of more in the future. But before we talk about those, we have to
explain some ideological commitments to understand why things are shaped the way
they are.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-speech-vs-reach">What is “speech vs reach”?</h2>
<p>Given that atproto is deliberately created to enable social applications, it
needs to consider not just connecting people, but also disconnecting people.
Moderation is a core component of any social application: “no moderation” is
still a moderation strategy. BlueSky handles these sorts of questions by
acknowledging that different people will have different preferences when it
comes to moderation, and also that moderation at scale is difficult.</p>
<p>As such, the protocol takes a “speech vs reach” approach to moderation. The
stuff we’ve described so far falls under the “speech” layer. It is purely
concerned with replicating your content across the network, without caring
what the semantic contents of that content is. Moderation tools fall under the
“reach” layer: you take all of that speech, but provide a way to limit the
reach of stuff you don’t care to see yourself.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people say that BlueSky is “all about free speech” or “doesn’t do
moderation.” This is simply inaccurate. Moderation tooling is encoded into the
protocol itself, so that it can work with all content on the network, even
non-BlueSky applications. Moreover, it gives you the ability to choose your own
moderators, so that you aren’t beholden to anyone else’s choice of moderation or
lack thereof. But I’m getting ahead of myself: let’s talk about feed generators
and labelers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-feed-generators">What are feed generators?</h2>
<p>Most social applications have the concept of a “feed” of content. This is broken
out into its own kind of service in atproto, called a <em>feed generator</em>. A classic
example of a feed is “computer, show me the posts of the people I follow in
reverse chronological order.” Lately, algorithmic feeds have become popular with
social networks, to the point of where some non-technical users refer to them
as “algorithms.”</p>
<p>Feed generators take the firehose produced by a relay, and then show you a list
of content, filtered and ordered by whatever metric the feed generator desires.
You can then share these feeds with other users.</p>
<p>As a practical example, one of my favorite feeds is the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vpkhqolt662uhesyj6nxm7ys/feed/infreq">Quiet
Posters</a> feed. This feed shows posts by people who don’t post
very often. This makes it so much easier to keep up with people who get drowned
out of my main feed. There are feeds like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vpkhqolt662uhesyj6nxm7ys/feed/followpics">the ‘Gram</a>, which shows
only posts that have pictures attatched. Or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt/feed/bangers">My Bangers</a>, which shows
your most popular posts.</p>
<p>This to me is one of the killer features of BlueSky over other microblogging
tools: total user choice. If I want to make my own algorithm, I can do so.
And I can share them easily with others. If you use BlueSky, you can visit
any of those feeds and follow them too.</p>
<p>Feeds are a recent addition to atproto, and therefore, while they do exist,
they may not be feature complete just yet, and may undergo some change in the
future. We’ll see. They’re working just fine from my perspective, but I haven’t
been following the lower level technical details.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-labelers">What are labelers?</h2>
<p>A <em>Labeler</em> is a service that applies <em>labels</em> to content or accounts. As a user,
you can subscribe to a particular labeler, and then have your experience change
based on the labels on posts.</p>
<p>A labeler can do this via whatever method it pleases: automatically by running
some sort of algorithm on posts, manually by having some human give a thumbs
up or thumbs down, whatever method the person running the labeling service
wants.</p>
<p>An example of a labeling service would be a blocklist: a label on the posts
authored by people whose content you don’t want to see. Another example is
an NSFW filter, which may run some sort of algorithm over pictures in posts,
and labeling them if they believe they contain NSFW content.</p>
<p>Labeling exists, but I do not believe you can run your own labeler yet. BlueSky
runs their own, but there hasn’t been an external release that I am aware of.
But once they do, you can imagine communities running their own services, adding
whatever kind of labels they’d like.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-moderation-work-in-atproto">How does moderation work in atproto?</h2>
<p>Putting this all together, we can see how moderation works: Feeds may choose to
transform the feed based on labels, or App Views may take feeds and apply
transformations based on asking a Labeler about it. These can
be mixed and matched based on preference.</p>
<p>This means you can choose your moderation experience, not just in applications,
but also within it. Want a SFW feed, but allow NSFW content in another? You
can do that. Want to produce a blocklist of people and share it with the
world? You can do that.</p>
<p>Because these moderation tools work at the network level, rather than at the
application level, they actually go <em>further</em> than in other systems. If someone
builds an Instagram clone on atproto, that could also use your blocklist
labeller, since your blocklist labeller works at the protocol level. Block
someone in one place, and they can be blocked on every place, if you so choose.
Maybe you subscribe to different moderation decisions in different applications.
It is 100% up to you.</p>
<p>This model is significantly different from other federated systems, becuase
you don’t really have an “account” on an “instance,” like in Mastodon. So a lot
of people ask questions like “what happens when my instance gets defederated”
which don’t exactly make sense as stated. You can achieve the same goal, by
blocking a set of users based on some criteria, maybe you dislike a certain
PDS and want to ignore posts that come from a certain one, but that is <em>your</em>
choice and yours alone, it is not dictated by some “server owner” that your
account resides on.</p>
<p>So if you don’t have a home server, how does identity work?</p>
<h2 id="how-does-identity-and-account-portability-work">How does identity and account portability work?</h2>
<p>There are a LOT of details to how identity works, so I’m going to focus on the
parts that I find important. I am also going to focus on the part that is
controversial, because that is important to talk about.</p>
<p>At its core, users have an identity number, called a “Decentralized Identifier,”
or <em><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a></em>. My DID looks like this: <code>did:plc:3danwc67lo7obz2fmdg6jxcr</code>.
Feel free to follow me! Lol, of course that’s not the interface that you’ll see
most of the time. Identity also involves a <em>handle</em>, which is a domain name.
My handle is <code>steveklabnik.com</code>, unsurprisingly. You’ll see my posts on BlueSky
as coming from <code>@steveklabnik.com</code>. This system also works well for people who
don’t own a domain; if you sign up for BlueSky, it’ll give you the ability to
choose a name, and then your handle is <code>@username.bsky.social</code>. I started off
making posts as <code>@steveklabnik.bsky.social</code>, and then moved to
<code>@steveklabnik.com</code>. But because the DID is stable, there was no disruption to
my followers. They just saw the handle update in the UI.</p>
<p>You can use a domain as your handle by getting the DID your PDS generated for
you, and then adding a <code>TXT</code> record in the DNS you use for that domain. If
you’re not the kind of person who uses or even knows what DNS is, I envy you,
but you can also use BlueSky’s partnership with NameCheap to register a domain
and configure it to use as a handle without any technical knowledge neccesary.
You can then log into applications with your domain as the handle, and
everything works nicely.</p>
<p>This is also how BlueSky delivers true “account portability,” partially because,
well, there isn’t really a concept of an account. The person who uses a given
DID uses cryptography to sign the content they create, and then that content
is replicated across the network. “Your account” can’t really be terminated,
because that would mean someone forcibly stopping you from using keys that they
don’t even have access to. If your PDS goes down, and you want to migrate to
a new one, there’s a way to backfill the contents of the PDS from the network
itself, and inform the network that your PDS has moved. It is real, meaningful
account portability, and that is radically different from any similar service
running today.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>The devil is in the details, and I think this is one of the more meaningful
criticisms of BlueSky and atproto.</p>
<p>You see, there are different “methods” of creating a DID. BlueSky supports
two methods: <code>did:web</code>, which is based on domain names. There are some drawbacks
with this method that I don’t personally fully understand well enough to describe,
I’m sure I’ll write something in-depth about DIDs in the future.</p>
<p>So because of that weakness, BlueSky has implemented their own DID method,
called <code>did:plc</code>. The <code>plc</code> stands for “placeholder,” because even though
they plan on supporting it indefinitely, it too has its weaknesses. And that
weakness is that it involves asking a service that BlueSky runs in order to
resolve the proper information. For example, <a href="https://plc.directory/did:plc:3danwc67lo7obz2fmdg6jxcr">here is my lookup</a>.
This means that BlueSky can ban you in a more serious way than is otherwise
possible thanks to the network design, which some people take to be a very
serious issue.</p>
<p>So, is the flaw fatal? I don’t think so. The first reason is, if you really don’t
want to engage with it, you can use <code>did:web</code>. Yes that isn’t great for other
reasons; that’s why <code>did:plc</code> was created. But you do get around this issue.</p>
<p>Another is that the BlueSky team has demonstrated, in my personal opinion,
enough understanding and uncomfortableness with being in control here, and it’s
designed in such a way that if other, better systems develop, you can move
to them. They’ve also indicated that moving governance of <code>did:plc</code> to some sort
of consensus model in the future is possible. There are options. Also, others
could run a <code>did:plc</code> service and use that instead if they prefer, too.</p>
<p>I personally see this as an example of pragmatically shipping something, others
see it as a nefarious plot. You’ll have to decide for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-bluesky-built-on-top-of-atproto">How is BlueSky built on top of atproto?</h2>
<p>So, now that we understand atproto, we can understand BlueSky. BlueSky is
an application built on top of the atproto network. They run an App View, and
<a href="https://bsky.app/">a web application</a> that uses that App View to work. They also run a PDS
for users that sign up through the web app, as well as a relay that those PDSes
communicate with.</p>
<p>They publish two Lexicons, one as <code>com.atproto.*</code> and one as <code>app.bsky.*</code>. The
former are low level operations that any application on the network will need,
and the ones specific to BlueSky are in the latter.</p>
<p>But one nice thing about BlueSky in particular is that they’ve taken the product
goals that nobody should know any of this nerd shit to be able to use BlueSky.
The lack of instances means there’s no “I need to pick an instance to create an
account” flow, and the portability means that if my host goes down, I can move,
and my followers are none the wiser.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-others-build-applications-on-top-of-atproto">How will others build applications on top of atproto?</h2>
<p>You can create an atproto app by creating a Lexicon. You’ll then want to run
an App View that does things with data on the network involving your lexicon,
and your application will want to give people the ability to write data to their
PDS using your lexicon.</p>
<p>I myself am considering doing so. We’ll see.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>So yeah, on the technical side of things, that’s an overview of how atproto and
BlueSky work. I think this design is very clever. Furthermore, I think the
separation of concerns between atproto and BlueSky are very meaningful, as having
a “killer app” for the network gives a reason to use it. It also is a form of
dogfooding, making sure that atproto is good enough to be able to build real
applications on.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll have more to say about all of this in the future.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

  <article>

    <h2>
    <a href="#ARCHITECTURE-md"><span>ARCHITECTURE.md</span> <time datetime="2021-02-06">Feb 6, 2021</time></a>
    </h2>
<p><span>If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an </span><code>ARCHITECTURE</code><span> document next to </span><code>README</code><span> and </span><code>CONTRIBUTING</code><span>.</span>
<span>Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another </span>“<span>docs are good, write more docs</span>”<span> advice.</span>
<span>I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, e.g., I often use just </span>“<span>simplify</span>”<span> as a commit message.</span>
<span>Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you :-)</span></p>
<p><span>I have experience with both contributing to and maintaining open-source projects.</span>
<span>One of the lessons I</span>’<span>ve learned is that the biggest difference between an occasional contributor and a core developer lies in the knowledge about the physical architecture of the project.</span>
<span>Roughly, it takes 2x more time to write a patch if you are unfamiliar with the project, but it takes 10x more time to figure out </span><em><span>where</span></em><span> you should change the code.</span>
<span>This difference might be hard to perceive if you</span>’<span>ve been working with the project for a while.</span>
<span>If I am new to a code base, I read each file as a sequence of logical chunks specified in some pseudo-random order.</span>
<span>If I</span>’<span>ve made significant contributions before, the perception is quite different.</span>
<span>I have a mental map of the code in my head, so I no longer read sequentially.</span>
<span>Instead, I just jump to where the thing should be, and, if it is not there, I move it.</span>
<span>One</span>’<span>s mental map is the source of truth.</span></p>
<p><span>I find the </span><code>ARCHITECTURE</code><span> file to be a low-effort high-leverage way to bridge this gap.</span>
<span>As the name suggests, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project.</span>
<span>Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it.</span>
<span>Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change.</span>
<span>This is the main rule of thumb for </span><code>ARCHITECTURE</code><span> </span>—<span> only specify things that are unlikely to frequently change.</span>
<span>Don</span>’<span>t try to keep it synchronized with code.</span>
<span>Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.</span></p>
<p><span>Start with a bird</span>’<span>s eye overview of the problem being solved.</span>
<span>Then, specify a more-or-less detailed </span><em><span>codemap</span></em><span>.</span>
<span>Describe coarse-grained modules and how they relate to each other.</span>
<span>The codemap should answer </span>“<span>where</span>’<span>s the thing that does X?</span>”<span>.</span>
<span>It should also answer </span>“<span>what does the thing that I am looking at do?</span>”<span>.</span>
<span>Avoid going into details of </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> each module works, pull this into separate documents or (better) inline documentation.</span>
<span>A codemap is a map of a country, not an atlas of maps of its states.</span>
<span>Use this as a chance to reflect on the project structure.</span>
<span>Are the things you want to put near each other in the codemap adjacent when you run </span><code>tree .</code><span>?</span></p>
<p><em><span>Do</span></em><span> name important files, modules, and types.</span>
<span>Do </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> directly link them (links go stale).</span>
<span>Instead, encourage the reader to use symbol search to find the mentioned entities by name.</span>
<span>This doesn</span>’<span>t require maintenance and will help to discover related, similarly named things.</span></p>
<p><span>Explicitly call-out architectural invariants.</span>
<span>Often, important invariants are expressed as an </span><em><span>absence</span></em><span> of something, and it</span>’<span>s pretty hard to divine that from reading the code.</span>
<span>Think about a common example from web development: nothing in the model layer specifically doesn</span>’<span>t depend on the views.</span></p>
<p><span>Point out boundaries between layers and systems as well.</span>
<span>A boundary implicitly contains information about the implementation of the system behind it.</span>
<span>It even constrains all </span><em><span>possible</span></em><span> implementations.</span>
<span>But finding a boundary by just randomly looking at the code is hard </span>—<span> good boundaries have measure zero.</span></p>
<p><span>After finishing the codemap, add a separate section on cross-cutting concerns.</span></p>
<p><span>A good example of </span><code>ARCHITECTURE</code><span> document is this one from rust-analyzer:</span>
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/d7c99931d05e3723d878bea5dc26766791fa4e69/docs/dev/architecture.md"><span>architecture.md</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>The idea of depaving, sometimes known as desealing, is a simple one – replace as much concrete, asphalt and other forms of hard landscaping as possible with plants and soil. It's been around since at least 2008, when the Depave group in Portland was founded. Proponents say depaving allows water to soak into the ground, which reduces flooding in times of heavy rain – <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220823-how-auckland-worlds-most-spongy-city-tackles-floods">aiding the "sponginess" of cities</a>. Native plants help <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190118-how-do-you-bring-wildlife-back-to-the-city">wildlife cling on in urban spaces</a>, and by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230922-how-medellin-is-beating-the-heat-with-green-corridors">planting trees you can increase shade</a>, protecting residents from heatwaves. Injecting city streets <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5663018/">with greenery</a> may even <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2021/health-benefits-nature">improve people's mental health</a>, too.</p>
<p>But if depaving is ever going to really take off, it will have to expand beyond a handful of eager environmentalists and volunteers. With the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/tags/climatechange">climate crisis</a> deepening, some cities and even entire regions are beginning to adopt depaving as part of their climate adaptation strategies. It's time, some say, to start smashing up our concrete streets in a big way – to create spaces better for nature. </p></div></div><div id="future/article/20240222-depaving-the-cities-replacing-concrete-with-earth-and-plants-p0hdjpds"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hdjpds.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hdjpds.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hdjpds.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hdjpds.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjpds.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjpds.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hdjpds.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hdjpds.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Exposing more of the ground in urban spaces can help absorb rainfall and reduce flooding, as well as boost biodiversity (Credit: City of Leuven)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjpds.jpg" alt="Exposing more of the ground in urban spaces can help absorb rainfall and reduce flooding, as well as boost biodiversity (Credit: City of Leuven)" id=""></picture><div><p>Exposing more of the ground in urban spaces can help absorb rainfall and reduce flooding, as well as boost biodiversity (Credit: City of Leuven)</p></div></div><div><p>Whenever Rose walks through a city these days, she can't help but notice places where you could strike out a section of asphalt and put in some plants. "I'm constantly just wanting to do more," she confesses. "It's hard not to see it everywhere."</p></div><div><h3>Sign up to Future Earth</h3></div><div><p>Her group says it has depaved more than 33,000 sq m (360,000 sq ft) of asphalt in Portland alone since 2008 – an area equivalent to nearly four and a half football pitches. The work is "joyous", says Rose, because it unites enthusiastic local volunteers. They get a safety briefing and then muck in together.</p>
<p>Green Venture, an environmental non-profit in Ontario, Canada, has been inspired in part by the depaving projects in Portland. Giuliana Casimirri, executive director, explains how she, her colleagues, and volunteers have begun inserting miniature gardens replete with native trees in a run-down district in the town of Hamilton.</p>
<p>"Before, it was somewhere you would quickly try to walk through," she says. "Now there are places you might stop or have a chat. Sit and read the paper."</p>
<p>In Hamilton, flooding can cause <a href="https://www.wosu.org/great-lakes-today/2017-08-14/spring-rain-caused-severe-sewage-overflows-in-lake-ontario">sewage to get mixed into runoff</a> that flows into Lake Ontario, the source of the town's drinking water. Green Venture and other local organisations are keen to reduce the chances of that happening, says Casimirri. They view depaving as a key tactic. Certainly, studies have demonstrated that impermeable surfaces in gardens such as concrete <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfr3.12231">increase flood risk in urban areas</a>.</p>
<p>Rose says her group's efforts in Portland mean that approximately 24.5 million gallons of rainwater is diverted from entering storm drains each year. In Leuven, Belgium, in 2023 alone, Baptist Vlaeminck, who leads Leuven's Life Pact climate adaptation project, calculates that the removal of 6,800 sq metres (73,000 sq ft) of hard surfacing allowed for the infiltration of an additional 377,000 gallons (1.7 million litres) of water into the ground.</p>
<p>"With climate change, extreme weather rainfall events are going to increase and so [depaving is] not a nice-to-have – it's a necessity," Casimirri adds.</p>
<p>The question is whether the authorities responsible for cities, and planning, realise this. In most parts of the world, depaving can still be described as a fringe activity. "We're going to need a scale of investment that has a lot more zeroes on it," says Thami Croeser at RMIT University, Melbourne's Centre for Urban Research.</p>
<p>Community-led and DIY efforts on driveways and on local streets with permission are fantastic, he adds, but it's even better to think of depaving and greening as the introduction of a new kind of infrastructure in a city. It requires the same level of planning and investment as, say, a new railway.</p></div><div id="future/article/20240222-depaving-the-cities-replacing-concrete-with-earth-and-plants-p0hdjncz"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hdjncz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hdjncz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hdjncz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hdjncz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjncz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjncz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hdjncz.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hdjncz.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="The depave movement in Portland, Oregon has inspired a wave of cities to pull up their asphalt and concrete (Credit: Elle Hygge)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjncz.jpg" alt="The depave movement in Portland, Oregon has inspired a wave of cities to pull up their asphalt and concrete (Credit: Elle Hygge)" id=""></picture><div><p>The depave movement in Portland, Oregon has inspired a wave of cities to pull up their asphalt and concrete (Credit: Elle Hygge)</p></div></div><div><p>In Europe, at least, some municipalities have begun to treat depaving seriously. Residents of London in the UK are <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/parks-green-spaces-and-biodiversity/make-our-city-greener-healthier-and-wilder/de-pave-your-garden">encouraged to depave their gardens</a>, for example.</p>
<p>The city of Leuven in Belgium says it is embracing depaving – or "ontharden" – in a big way. <a href="https://leuven.be/vergroenenspaansekroon">The suburban district of Spaanse Kroon</a>, home to around 550 people, is one of the latest targets of a depaving and renaturing initiative spearheaded by the city. The plans involve removing significant volumes of asphalt from the residential area and forcing cars to share the same part of the road as pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<p>"We are scaling up now, we are setting up a team dedicated to depaving," says Vlaeminck.</p>
<p>Such projects have to meet the needs of everyone in the city. Vlaeminck says that, to support people with impaired vision or mobility issues, unused areas of road or pavement are prioritised for depaving and sufficient space – more than a metre – is safeguarded on pavements to allow people plenty of room. Existing paving left in place is also renewed or repaired to ensure there are no bumps or unevenness. In situations where pavements are removed completely, for shared use of a roadway in low traffic neighbourhoods, Vlaeminck says depaving teams introduce measures to reduce the speed of cars.</p>
<p>Both Depave in Portland and Green Ventury in Ontario say they work with communities to ensure accessibility requirements are met. Casimirri refers to a recent project that replaced broken, uneven concrete with shrubbery and level walkways between.</p>
<p>Among the initiatives instigated by Leuven is a "tile taxi" – a small truck that officials will happily send to your home so you can throw in concrete tiles or cobblestones you have removed from your garden. The material is later reused rather than thrown away, says Vlaeminck, who adds that several million euros have been set aside by Leuven to fund depaving and renaturing projects such as this.</p>
<p>And there's more. Since January 2024, developers in Leuven have had to demonstrate that any rain that falls on new or significantly renovated homes can either be capture and re-used on-site or filtrate into the property's garden rather than pool up and cause a flood. If developers can't prove their designs are extreme rainfall-ready, they won't be approved, says Vlaeminck.</p>
<p>France, too, is making depaving official, says Gwendoline Grandin, an ecologist with the Île-de-France Regional Agency for Biodiversity. Nationally, the French government has made <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20220614-france-pledges-%E2%82%AC500-million-for-urban-vegetation-as-heatwave-descends">€500m ($540m/£430m) available for urban greening</a> – this includes depaving but also installing green walls and roofs, for example. Part of the motivation is to make towns and cities more resilient to summer heatwaves, which <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66197368">have badly affected parts of France in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the projects now underway are significant in size, such as <a href="https://www.iledefrance.fr/mediatheque/renaturer-la-facade-est-de-la-foret-de-saint-eutrope-avec-un-objectif-zero-dechet">a former parking area near a forest in the Paris region</a>. An area of 45,000 sq m (480,000 sq ft) has been depaved – formerly a hodgepodge of asphalt, pathways and concrete interlaced with grass. With the hard landscaping now gone, level ground is being reshaped to introduce dips and gullies that catch water, and the whole area will soon be planted over, too.</p></div><div id="future/article/20240222-depaving-the-cities-replacing-concrete-with-earth-and-plants-p0hdjprh"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hdjprh.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hdjprh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hdjprh.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hdjprh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjprh.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjprh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hdjprh.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hdjprh.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Local schemes are often backed by residents keen to see more green in their local area (Credit: City of Leuven)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hdjprh.jpg" alt="Local schemes are often backed by residents keen to see more green in their local area (Credit: City of Leuven)" id=""></picture><div><p>Local schemes are often backed by residents keen to see more green in their local area (Credit: City of Leuven)</p></div></div><div><p>In Croeser's own city of Melbourne, he and colleagues have studied the potential space available for renaturing, if thousands of parking spaces were depaved and converted into miniature gardens. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-022-00073-x">In a 2022 study, they simulated the impact</a> based on a series of scenarios – the most ambitious of which involved removing half of the open-air parking spaces in the city, about 11,000. Croeser argues that there is sufficient off-street parking available, for example on the ground floor of buildings, in Melbourne to ensure that people wouldn't be left without somewhere to leave their vehicle – but those interior parking spaces would need to be made publicly accessible.</p></div><div><h3>Carbon Count</h3></div><div><p>"The basic principle was no net loss of access to parking," he says. "And we get 50-60 hectares [120-150 acres] of green space that keeps the city cool, prevents flooding."</p>
<p>It might seem unlikely that small pockets of nature dotted here and there throughout a large city like Melbourne could benefit wildlife significantly, but Croeser says these fragments of habitat are crucial. They allow species to move around and cope in an environment that is, ultimately, very different to the one in which they evolved.</p>
<p>In their 2022 study on depaving in Melbourne, Croeser and his colleagues included modelling that suggested a modest increase in greenery could allow species such as the blue-banded bee to roam across a far greater area of urban habitat than before.</p>
<p>Rose agrees with Croeser that, for depaving to change the world, entire cities and even whole countries will have to embrace it fully. But she emphasises that, in order to reach that point, communities must express that this is something they want.</p>
<p>"It starts with people pushing their government and starting these conversations on a small, local level," she says. "That's how it takes hold."</p>

<p>In 1995, a teenage boy scout in Michigan named David Hahn attracted the attention of local authorities in his Detroit suburb. Hahn caught the law’s eye when suspicious materials were found in his car. But further investigation revealed a series of backyard science experiments, including the teen’s attempt to build a working nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Achieved with materials he had at hand, Hahn managed to successfully create a homemade neutron source in an everyday backyard shed — and nearly irradiated his whole neighborhood.</p>
<p>Hahn had been fascinated with science since childhood. Intending to create a breeder reactor in 1995, the result was less than intended, but enough to capture national attention. This is the unbelievable true story of David Hahn — more popularly known as the “Radioactive Boy Scout” or the “Nuclear Boy Scout.”</p>

<p>David Hahn tried to build his homemade nuclear reactor when he was only 17, according to <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/david-hahn/David%20Hahn%20Part%2001%20of%2001/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FBI records</a>. Conducted in his step-mother’s backyard in Commerce Township, Michigan, the experiments were run in near secrecy.</p>
<p>Practically a wunderkind, Hahn began studying chemistry at age 10 and had fabricated nitroglycerin by 14. Before attempting to build his reactor, Hahn tarnished his bedroom with his experiments, so his parents moved his work to their basement, before settling on the shed.</p>
<p>Hahn gathered information by contacting the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, hoping to gain insight into the steps of building a breeder reactor. In most cases, Hahn was able to gather the info he needed with the help of aliases and cover stories.</p>
<p>Hahn’s interest in creating a breeder reactor was fueled by many things. The teen read about chemical experiments fervently, teaching himself how to manipulate reactions, and was awarded a merit badge for atomic energy in 1991. He supplemented his practical research with long study sessions at his local library</p>
<p>The flames of Hahn’s fascination were fanned by two obsessive goals, one being the task of creating a breeder reactor; the other, of collecting each element on the periodic table — regardless of radioactivity.</p>
<p>For Hahn, the creation of a homemade nuclear reactor would have been <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/breeder-reactor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a more complex task</a> than creating a homemade breeder reactor. Both requiring dangerous materials, breeder reactors utilize the more available chemical isotope Uranium-238 — the chemical element thorium — while nuclear reactors may only use the scarcer Uranium-235.</p>
<p>While the uranium used in nuclear reactors are readily fissionable, Uranium-238 and thorium are more available.</p>
<p>And so, utilizing household items and a lead block as a stand-in reactor, Hahn got to work. He collected thorium from lanterns, radium from clocks, tritium from gunsights, and lithium from $1,000 worth of batteries he bought himself.</p>
<p>Hahn also employed coffee filters and pickle jars to handle dangerous and potentially deadly chemicals. The lack of protection, save for his gas mask, tragically, was later said to have affected Hahn’s life expectancy.</p>
<p>During his shed-bound experiments, Hahn persevered through accidental burns on his skin, turning his hair green, and mistakenly causing himself to pass out.</p>
<p>When the experiment met its threshold, Hahn had created a crude neutron source. While unable to produce fissionable fuel at the rate of other reactors, the the Boy Scout’s experiment was already spreading detectable radiation several houses away. </p>

<p>As detected by David Hahn’s own Geiger counter, his experiment proved radioactive by the time it was disassembled — and left 40,000 town residents potentially at risk.</p>
<p>Police located Hahn’s shed after stopping the young teen for unrelated reasons. Finding suspicious materials in his trunk, the scout informed the officers the content was radioactive. From there, it did not take long to uncover the shed and its impact on Hahn’s neighborhood.</p>
<p>The local police contacted the federal authorities, leading the Environmental Protection Agency to Hahn’s doorstep. Those who entered Hahn’s shed lab were warned by a misspelled “Caushon” sign on the wall.</p>
<p>Inside, authorities found evidence of Hahn’s dangerous hobbies. The remnants of the experiment and materials collected posed numerous health risks, and the EPA declared the property a Superfund hazardous materials cleanup site.</p>
<p>Despite insistence from officials, Hahn refused to be medically evaluated following the long periods he spent around radioactive materials. Since his experiment took place with minimal protection, Hahn’s life expectancy was likely shortened after the incident.</p>
<p>Following the lab’s dismantling, Hahn achieved his Eagle Scout rank despite efforts to rob him of the honor on account of his dangerous experiment. However, regardless of what progress he made, Hahn had trouble finding direction following the experiment’s fallout.</p>
<p>“I was very emotional as a kid, and those experiments gave me a way to get away from that. They gave me some respect,” Hahn told <em><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1998/11/the-radioactive-boy-scout/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Harpers Magazine</a></em> in 1998.</p>

<p>The collapse of his experiment, turmoil from a failed relationship, and his mother’s suicide each contributed to “Nuclear Boy Scout” David Hahn’s depression, according to <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/radioactive-boy-scout-died-of-alcohol-poisoning-not-radiation-father-says/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a></em>. Attempting to find his place in the world after the disastrous events in his backyard, he tried his hand at college and the military, mostly at the request of his father and step-mother.</p>
<p>Hahn served in both the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, but only found new complications with mental health as he grew older.</p>
<p>Following his original experiment’s disassembly, Hahn once again attracted the police’s attention a decade later. Suspected of creating another reactor and storing it in his freezer, Hahn was arrested in 2007 for stealing some detectors.</p>
<p>The devices were taken from the apartment complex Hahn was staying in. The theft was significant for the small amounts of radioactive americium found in the smoke detectors. Since americium was found in greater amounts in Hahn’s shed in 1995, authorities evacuated residents for five hours — fearing the infamous former Boy Scout was at it again.</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, police had already been tracking Hahn and monitoring the region for radioactivity. Coinciding with his return to the area, authorities took note that Hahn had begun advertising a book written about his experiment.</p>
<p>With their eyes already fixed on Hahn, the police were quick to arrest him on account of his theft. Sixteen smoke detectors across Hahn’s building and another in his complex had gone missing. Police found additional empty smoke detectors near Hahn’s trash.</p>
<p>Following his arrest, David Hahn pleaded guilty to attempted larceny of a building and was sentenced to 90 days in jail. And about a decade later, Hahn died from a combination of alcohol, diphenhydramine, and fentanyl. The “Nuclear Boy Scout” was just 39 years old. </p>
