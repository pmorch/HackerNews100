            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ladybird.org/newsletter/2025-07-31/">https://ladybird.org/newsletter/2025-07-31/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44765292">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div>  <p>Hello friends! July is done. We merged 319 pull requests from 47 contributors.</p>

<p>Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we’re excited to welcome the following new sponsors:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <a href="https://scrapingfish.com/">Scraping Fish</a> with $5,000 </li>
<li> <a href="https://t.co/McauGhPdxH">Blacksmith</a> with high-performance CI infrastructure </li>
 </ul>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful for their support. If you’re interested in sponsoring the project, please <a href="mailto:contact@ladybird.org">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3 id="web-platform-tests-wpt"> Web Platform Tests (WPT) </h3>
<p>As usual, we’ve made some progress on the Web Platform Tests. We’ve added 13,090 passing tests for a new total of 1,831,856.</p>
<h3 id="google-recaptcha-passing"> Google reCAPTCHA passing </h3>
<p>There was a long-standing issue with our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">postMessage</a> implementation: if the serialized type had not previously been used in the destination realm, we would fail to reconstruct it. The realm didn’t recognize the type and rejected the message.</p>
<p>This is now fixed, allowing Google reCAPTCHA to pass!</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-july-2025-google-recaptcha.mp4"></video>
<p>Unfortunately, this only works on <code>https://www.google.com/</code> for now, due to a separate unresolved same-origin policy issue.</p>
<h3 id="high-refresh-rate-support"> High refresh rate support </h3>
<p>We now detect the refresh rate of the active screen to determine how often web content should be rendered. Previously, rendering was fixed at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>Websites using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame</a> now render at up to 120Hz on supported hardware. This change also improves the smoothness of scrolling, animations, transitions, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-july-2025-high-refresh-rate.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="http3-support"> HTTP/3 support </h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a> support was recently added in curl 8.14.0 for users of OpenSSL and <a href="https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2">ngtcp2</a>. Since Ladybird uses the OpenSSL backend with libcurl, this enabled us to support HTTP/3 as well.</p>
<p>We now negotiate HTTP/3 for servers that advertise it via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Alt-Svc">Alt-Svc header</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ladybird.org/assets/img/newsletter-july-2025-http-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We also found and reported an issue in curl where <code>Alt-Svc: clear</code> was parsed incorrectly. This has since been <a href="https://curl.se/ch/8.15.0.html">fixed in curl 8.15.0.</a></p>
<h3 id="trusted-types"> Trusted Types </h3>
<p>Trusted Types is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) by locking down injection sinks like <code>Element.innerHTML</code>, <code>HTMLScriptElement.text</code>, and <code>HTMLScriptElement.src</code>. It allows web developers to define policies that control how sanitized content can be created and consumed.</p>
<p>This month, we added initial support for Trusted Types. This includes recognizing policies and enforcing type-safe DOM writes. Further work is ongoing to support more of the spec and improve compliance.</p>
<h3 id="svg-foreignobject-improvements"> SVG <code>foreignObject</code> improvements </h3>
<p>The relationship between HTML and SVG is complex. While SVG content can appear in HTML, SVG can also embed arbitrary HTML using the <code>foreignObject</code> element.</p>
<p>This month, we made major improvements to how Ladybird handles <code>foreignObject</code>. Layout, style resolution, and rendering inside embedded HTML are now much closer to spec behavior, with better integration between the two worlds.</p>
<h3 id="css-content-url"> CSS <code>content: url(...)</code> </h3>
<p>We added support for using <code>content: url(...)</code> in CSS pseudo-elements such as <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>. This allows authors to insert images via CSS content, matching behavior seen on modern websites.</p>
<h3 id="statefoo-and-unchecked-pseudo-classes"> <code>:state(foo)</code> and <code>:unchecked</code> pseudo-classes </h3>
<p>We gained two new pseudo-classes:</p>
<ul> 
<li> <code>:state(foo)</code> matches a custom element whose states set includes <code>"foo"</code>. This allows custom elements to be styled based on internal state, similar to how <code>:checked</code> and <code>:empty</code> work. </li>
<li> <code>:unchecked</code> matches elements that are checkable but currently not checked. </li>
 </ul>
<p>These additions improve our compatibility with web components and modern form styling.</p>
<h3 id="logical-property-groups"> Logical property groups </h3>
<p>Building on work from <a href="https://ladybird.org/newsletter/2025-06-30/#css-logical-aliases">last month</a>, we now generate the mappings from logical to physical properties at compile time.</p>
<p>Logical and physical properties form groups—for example, the various <code>margin</code> properties—and we now take these into account when serializing styles and when modifying them from JavaScript. This improves both CSS fidelity and performance.</p>
<h3 id="arbitrary-substitution-functions"> Arbitrary substitution functions </h3>
<p>This month we rewrote our implementations of <code>var()</code> and <code>attr()</code> to align with the formal definition of <em> arbitrary substitution functions </em> in recent CSS specs. These are functions that return a value to be substituted into the rule before parsing continues.</p>
<p>Our new implementation is more robust, more spec-compliant, and sets us up to support other substitution functions like <code>if()</code> and <code>env()</code> in the future.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-parsing"> <code>&lt;syntax&gt;</code> parsing </h3>
<p>CSS now allows authors to define the expected syntax for attribute values using the <code>&lt;syntax&gt;</code> type. This is used within <code>attr()</code> to guide how the value should be parsed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="css"><code><span><span>color: attr(</span><span>data-color</span><span> type(&lt;color</span><span>&gt;</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This instructs the parser to interpret the <code>data-color</code> attribute as a CSS color. Ladybird now supports <code>&lt;syntax&gt;</code> parsing and uses it to improve behavior in CSS Houdini and custom properties.</p>
<h3 id="property-progress"> <code>@property</code> progress </h3>
<p>We’ve had a stub implementation of <code>@property</code> for a while. This month, we started fleshing it out.</p>
<p>We now respect the initial value defined in a <code>@property</code> declaration and added initial support for <code>CSS.registerProperty()</code>. This brings us closer to full Houdini support.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-is-utf-16"> The Web is UTF-16 </h3>
<p>By definition, strings in JavaScript and the web are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#utf-16_characters_unicode_code_points_and_grapheme_clusters">UTF-16 encoded</a>. Until now, LibJS used UTF-8 internally and transcoded to UTF-16 on the fly.</p>
<p>This month, we introduced a native UTF-16 string type and began transitioning LibJS and LibWeb to use it internally. This simplifies the implementation and avoids subtle encoding-related bugs, especially with Unicode edge cases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <!-- First artwork/project -->
      <article>

  
  

        <div><p>
            Sometime during winter 2024, I found myself at a thrift store. I was staring at rows of appliances, 
            wrapped in plastic and clinging to life, trying to answer one question: which of these is the right 
            chassis for a retro gaming computer?
            </p><p>
            Driving home, I took corners carefully, checking that the General Electric (GE) drip coffee maker I’d 
            chosen was safe in the backseat. The coffee maker's given name was Coffeematic.  Circa 1980, 
            it is boxy yet athletic – unfazed by any considerations of future internet connectivity. Best, it is perfect for being hacked.
            </p><p>
            Coffeematic is now Coffeematic PC – part gaming computer, part coffee maker. 
            A newly synthesized machine percolating processes well beyond its original configuration. 
            <span>Coffeematic PC is part of a lineage of coffee maker computers made since 2002</span>. 
            I'll describe that fascinating lineage here, and how it inspired an art exhibition called <a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/Sparklines.html">Sparklines</a> 
            where hand-drafted data visualizations accompany Coffeematic PC.
            <br>

<a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/images/coffeematic-pc-final-build-doug-macdowell.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View full-size image of Coffeematic PC by Doug MacDowell">

</a></p></div><p>
            Profound and poetically articulated. Elegant and assertive. Highly scaleable with dynamic acceleration. 
            No. These do not describe Coffeematic PC or its peers (one of those phrases describes a bottle of wine.)
            A custom built computer can be basic and functional, or an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJMYik2ptvJ/">elaborate, absurd, 
            spinning piece of art.</a>  <span>Coffeematic PC falls somewhere in that spectrum 
            while also being nearly self-destructive.</span>
        </p>
        <br>

<img src="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/images/coffeematic-pc-in-progress-doug-macdowell.jpeg" alt="Coffeematic PC, a coffee maker computer in progress on artist Doug MacDowell’s workspace" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy">


      
      <p>
        This is how Coffeematic PC works. 
        <span>The computer is fully functional. The coffee maker is too</span>, 
        it percolates Java like a regular coffee maker. Very hot Java. 
        Computers usually use fans or liquid cooling systems to reduce heat. 
        Coffeematic PC uses the hot Java it brews to heat? cool? caffeinate? the computer. 
        A pump takes the hot, caffenated slurry (~90C/194F) 
        and circulates it thru two radiators sitting on top of Coffeematic PC's crown -&gt; 
        down to a central processing unit (CPU) tucked within an ASUS M2NPV-VM 
        motherboard snugly strapped to Coffeematic PC's back. 
        Java continues through an artery returning to Coffeematic PC's caraffe.
        The process repeats until Java is integrated with the user or the machine is powered off.
      </p>
      <br>

    <p>
    ↑ Coffeematic PC has a dedicated pump to aggressively dispense Java for user.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CPU's are meant to be cool and Java hot. <span>Despite circulating hot Java, 
      Coffeematic PC does not crash.</span>
    To understand more, I wrote command line code to gather data on Coffeematic PC every 5 seconds, 
    and monitored Coffeematic PC for 75 minutes.
    The graph below shows the results. 
    The machine is just barely non-destructive. <span>Coffeematic PC's CPU, body, 
    and circulatory system eventually find equilibrium. A warm 33C/91F - 
    amazingly close to the temperature of the slurry that flows through you and me.</span>

  <div><p>
    An important part of this project is the lineage of coffee maker computers. 
    Before discussing that, <span>
    this is how Coffeematic PC was made.</span>
    The build is a mix of discarded electronics and newly purchased 
    hardware, pumps, and radiators. The motherboard, CPU, RAM, and graphics card are from the mid 2000's and were 
    sourced from a recycling center. This is a parts list for Coffeematic PC.

I spent about a month designing and building Coffeematic PC with the help from my beautiful fiance. 
<span>The build traverses time</span>. The coffee maker is from the late 1970's, the motherboard, CPU, and graphics card from the 2000's, and 
the SSD, operating system, and hardware from the today's (2020's). The General Electric coffee maker needed only a minor repair of 
replacing a small vinyl tube that had cracked. It takes awhile to brew a pot of coffee, but once it is brewed... it tastes like 
coffee made from a plastic coffee maker from the 1970's. I'lllll drink it!

  <p><span>The lineage of coffee maker computer builds spans 
    22 years with a curious 15 year gap in the middle.</span> 
    I'm not the first person to synthesize a coffee maker and a computer. 
    But, I think I am the first to use hot Java as a cooling method. The graph below shows the lineage of 
    coffee maker computers. There are a total of 5.  In 2002 Nick Pelis built the first ever coffee maker computer named 
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131210043642/http://themodzoo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/931-the-caffeine-machine/" target="_blank">The Caffeine Machine</a>. 
    Then, the builds went cold for 15 years until 2018, when a person named Ali “THE CRE8OR” Abbas collaborated with a company named 
    Zotac to make the 
    <a href="https://thecre8or.de/mekspresso.htm" target="_blank">Zotac Mekspresso</a> 
    to feature in a trade show. One year after in 2019, a man whose username is Logarythm made the 
    <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/mngwrH" target="_blank">Mr. Coffee PC</a>. This unassuming build is perhaps 
    my favorite. 
    5 years later, after COVID-19, NerdForge, a youtube channel specializing on fun builds, built a 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/oSVPkuplVRY" target="_blank">"PC that 
      makes coffee"</a>. During this time I was making 
      <a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/Percolating%20Human%20Computer%20Interaction,%202024.html" target="_blank">Coffeematic PC</a>.

Were people tired of 
      drinking coffee?</span> I don't think so. We're people tired of building fun computers? Were they distracted? Could they not afford it?
      I'm not sure. But something is wrong. There should be a steady output of absurd coffee maker computers being made. 
      What happened in those 15 years? To look into it I created the graph above. It shows a timeline of 
      coffee maker computers along with important events compiled from the 
      <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/" target="_blank">The Timeline of Computer History</a> 
      from the Computer History Museum. Of course, there are many important things that happened worldwide between 2002 and 2018 like 
      war, natural disasters, financial crisis, shootings, refugee crisis, and the apocalypse in 2012 determined by the end of 
      the Mayan calendar. Its too much to capture in this dinky graph. But maybe focusing on tech, and the culture of tech, 
      can reveal something about this large gap in absurd creativity. Do you see any trends?

        Coffeematic PC inspired an art exhibition called <a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/sparklines.html">Sparklines</a>. In Sparklines I elaborate on 
        the curious 15 year gap in coffee maker computers being built and create data portraits of a group of people I call 
        artist-hackers. The work is all drawn by hand using drafting tools and a vintage lettering kit. Check it out at the link 
        above!
        
        Do you know of any other coffee maker computer builds that I missed?

  <h3><span><span><span><span>Using advanced computational modeling, a Rutgers professor, in collaboration with researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Stony Brook University, reveal both the immediate and delayed climate benefits of solar power</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Increasing solar power generation in the United States by 15% could lead to an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to researchers at Rutgers, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Stony Brook University. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq5660">study</a>, published in <em>Science Advances</em>, found that the climate benefits of solar power differ markedly throughout U.S. regions, pinpointing where clean energy investments return the greatest climate dividends. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In 2023, 60% of </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3"><span>U.S. electricity generation</span></a><span> relied on fossil fuels, while 3.9% came from solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Because fossil fuel-generated electricity is a </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746196/"><span>leading source of carbon dioxide</span></a><span>, or CO2, and harmful air pollutants such as fine particulate matter, expanding solar could not only mitigate CO2 but help </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36961127/"><span>reduce illness, hospitalizations and premature deaths</span></a><span> linked to air pollution exposure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From a computer science perspective, this study demonstrates the power of harnessing large-scale, high-resolution energy data to generate actionable insights.</p>

<p>Arpita Biswas</p>

<p>Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span><span>Researchers examined five years of hourly electricity generation, demand and emissions data from the Energy Information Administration starting July 1, 2018. They focused on the 13 geographic regions in the United States. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>With this </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OKEATQ"><span>dataset</span></a><span>, the researchers constructed a statistical model to explore how increases in hourly solar energy generation would affect CO2 emissions within a given region and in its neighboring regions. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The study quantified both immediate and delayed emissions reductions resulting from added solar generation. For example, the researchers found that in California, a 15% increase in solar power at noon was associated with a reduction of 147.18 metric tons of CO2 in the region in the first hour and 16.08 metric tons eight hours later. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>“It was rewarding to see how advanced computational modeling can uncover not just the immediate, but also the delayed and far-reaching spillover effects of solar energy adoption,” said the lead author </span><a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/people/professors/details/arpita-biswas"><span>Arpita Biswas</span></a><span>, an assistant professor with the Department of Computer Science at the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. “From a computer science perspective, this study demonstrates the power of harnessing large-scale, high-resolution energy data to generate actionable insights. For policymakers and investors, it offers a roadmap for targeting solar investments where emissions reductions are most impactful and where solar energy infrastructure can yield the highest returns.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The researchers said their methods provide a more nuanced understanding of system-level impacts from solar expansion than previous studies, pinpointing where the benefits of increased solar energy adoption could best be realized. In some areas, such as California, Florida, the mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, Texas and the Southwest, small increases in solar were estimated to deliver large CO2 reductions, while in others, such as New England, the central U.S., and Tennessee, impacts were found to be minimal – even at much larger increases in solar generation. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, the researchers said their study demonstrates the significant spillover effects solar adoption has on neighboring regions, highlighting the value of coordinated clean energy efforts. For example, a 15% increase in solar capacity in California was associated with a reduction of 913 and 1,942 metric tons of CO2 emissions per day in the northwest and southwest regions, respectively. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>“</span></span><span>I am very excited about this study because it harnesses the power of data science to offer insights for policymakers and stakeholders in achieving CO2 reduction targets through increased solar generation,” said Francesca Dominici, director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative and Clarence James Gamble Professor of Biostatistics, Population and Data Science and a corresponding author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <p>Recently, “the bitter lesson” is having a moment. Coined in <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">an essay by Rich Sutton</a>, the bitter lesson is that, “general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.” Why is the lesson bitter? Sutton writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sutton walks through how the fields of computer chess, computer go, speech recognition, and computer vision have all experienced the bitter lesson.</p>

<p>Lately, people have been citing the bitter lesson a lot.</p>

<h3 id="a-blow-to-the-human-ego">A Blow to the Human Ego</h3>

<p>The first time I read “The Bitter Lesson”, I thought of <a href="https://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=haraway">Donna Haraway</a>, one of my professors at UCSC. During a seminar on the history of science, she presented her list of the <strong>four major blows to the human ego</strong> (<a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2013/10/26/the-5-blows-to-the-human-ego.html">which I previously wrote about</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">The Copernican Revolution</a>, which allowed us to realize we weren’t the center of the universe.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species">Darwinian thought</a>, which allowed us to realize we weren’t separate from animals.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind#Freud.27s_view_of_the_unconscious">Freud’s ideas of the unconscious</a>, which allowed us to realize that we weren’t in full control of our selves.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">Cyborgs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot">robots</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton">automatons</a>, which allowed us to realize that non-humans could do the work of humans.</li>
</ul>

<p>These concepts undermined humans’ imagined central position in the universe.</p>

<p>The bitter lesson slots in naturally here; really a sub-point of <em>cyborgs</em>, a topic which Haraway has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cyborg_Manifesto">exploring for decades</a>. Within this framework, it’s easy to believe! My instinctual belief reminds me of an exchange from a <a href="https://radiolab.org/podcast/91522-its-not-about-you/transcript">2010 RadioLab segment with Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ROBERT KRULWICH:</strong> Is it your working bias that if I came to you with a new discovery in which we were less important, or a discovery which proposed that we were more important, that you would guess that my scientific discovery that said we are less important is more likely to be right?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:</strong> No doubt about it. That’s correct. Now you call that a bias, but I don’t. I call that track record.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprisingly, the bitter lesson landed on my LinkedIn feed this week. Among the emoji-laden bulleted lists and grindset slop was a new Ethan Mollick piece, “<a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage">The Bitter Lesson versus The Garbage Can</a>”. In it, Mollick contrasts the step-by-step way businesses are building agents with the reality of business processes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing you learn studying (or working in) organizations is that they are all actually a bit of a mess. In fact, one classic organizational theory is actually called the Garbage Can Model. This views organizations as chaotic “garbage cans” where problems, solutions, and decision-makers are dumped in together, and decisions often happen when these elements collide randomly, rather than through a fully rational process. Of course, it is easy to take this view too far - organizations do have structures, decision-makers, and processes that actually matter. It is just that these structures often evolved and were negotiated among people, rather than being carefully designed and well-recorded.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Garbage Can represents a world where unwritten rules, bespoke knowledge, and complex and undocumented processes are critical. It is this situation that makes AI adoption in organizations difficult, because even though 43% of American workers have used AI at work, they are mostly doing it in informal ways, solving their own work problems. Scaling AI across the enterprise is hard because traditional automation requires clear rules and defined processes; the very things Garbage Can organizations lack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bitter lesson is about to be rediscovered, Mollick suggests. “If AI agents can train on outputs alone, any organization that can define quality and provide enough examples might achieve similar results, whether they understand their own processes or not,” he writes. Org charts and workflows are UX for us humans, unneeded by our agents.</p>

<p>But while I found myself quickly accepting the original bitter lesson essay, Mollick’s essay triggered my inner skeptic. Two practical issues immediately arose:</p>

<p><strong>The bitter lesson is dependent on high-quality data.</strong></p>

<p>Data has an embedded perspective. It is not objective. Further, data is <em>reductive</em>, a shadow of the information it represents. And many things resist being reduced to data points<sup id="fnref:haraway" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:haraway" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Without sufficient data, the bitter lesson cannot be learned.</p>

<p>When Mollick writes, “any organization that can define quality and provide enough examples might achieve similar results,” I immediately focus on the word “can”. Most organizations I’ve encountered have an incredibly hard time defining their objectives <em>firmly</em> and <em>clearly</em>, if they’re able to at all.</p>

<p>Already, companies rely on goal-setting metrics or rubrics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKRs</a> to attempt to measure that which resists measurement. These can be helpful, but their reductive nature leads to gaming<sup id="fnref:goog" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:goog" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Any metrics organizations use to optimize agents with likely be argued over, squishy, and inadequate.</p>

<p>Unlike the workplace, the fields Sutton cites as having met the bitter lesson are ones where the objective is easy to quantify. Victory in go and chess is clear, speech can be directly matched to written text, and most subjects in images can be easily annotated. It’s okay if you find a way to game the system to win a chess game; the rules are air tight.</p>

<p>Further, these fields can be easily represented with data – which is necessary for any general program that needs to learn how to achieve the quantifiable goal. Even <em>if</em> a company can give a clear, firm definition of quality, it still has to figure out how to measure all the interactions involved in producing this output. Otherwise, the program has no ideas what levers if can pull.</p>

<p>If we wish to teach agent-builders the bitter lesson, we need to get better at defining outputs concretely that are resistant to reward hacking (even if they’re not perfect, as <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/07/31/how-kimi-rl-ed-qualitative-data-to-write-better.html">we explored yesterday</a>) and figure out how to represent “Garbage Can” organizations with data.</p>

<p><strong>Adding compute is often not practical nor optimal.</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of chess, to illustrate his point, Mollick used both Manus and ChatGPT Agent Mode to create charts documenting the performance of human and computer chess play over time. Here’s ChatGPT’s:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dbreunig.com/img/chatgpt_agent_chess.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you’re a chess nerd, you might catch how this plot undermines the bitter lesson: <strong><a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a>, the top performing program since 2020 is <em>not</em> an example of a, “general method that leverages computation.”</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://yellow-apartment-148.notion.site/AI-Search-The-Bitter-er-Lesson-44c11acd27294f4495c3de778cd09c8d">Aidan McLaughlin explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stockfish always had clever search algorithms, but in 2019, its ability to grind out billions of positions didn’t matter because its understanding of each position was kneecapped by human creators. To fix this, the Stockfish team heisted Leela’s deep learning techniques and trained a model hundreds of times smaller than the top Leela model.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>After they trained their tiny model, they threw it into their search pipeline, and Stockfish crushed Leela overnight. The Stockfish team utterly rejected scaling laws. They went backward and made a smaller model. But, because their search algorithm was more efficient, took better advantage of hardware, and saw further, they won.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leela_Chess_Zero">Leela</a> is a deep learning model that, “started with no intrinsic chess-specific knowledge other than the basic rules of the game.” It learned by playing chess, at an absurd scale, until it was the best in the world. A true example of the bitter lesson.</p>

<p>Then Stockfish adopted a small, purpose-built search model inside its conventional chess program. Today, Stockfish remains unbeaten – and can run on your iPhone. By not embracing compute as the primary lever, the Stockfish team not only delivered quality, but delivered something everyone can use, often.</p>

<p>We’re starting to see hints that this pattern might be coming for our best AI benchmarks. <a href="https://arcprize.org/">ARC-AGI-1</a>, a highly-respected reasoning benchmark, saw its first breakout high score from OpenAI’s o3, <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/12/20/the-new-game-in-town.html">last December</a>. This score supported the compute component of the bitter lesson: OpenAI reportedly spent ~$30,000 <em>per task</em> to achieve this milestone. Since this score, ARC has added a “cost per task” metric to their leaderboard, and made efficiency a requirement for their grand prize.</p>

<p>But 3 weeks ago, <a href="https://sapient.inc/">Sapient</a> published a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21734">Hierarchical Reasoning Model</a>” (HRM), that achieves a 40.3 score on ARC-AGI-1 with only <em>27 million parameters</em> – besting large models like o3-mini-high and Claude 3.7. (As a reminder, LLM model parameter counts are measured in the billions.) HRM achieves this feat<sup id="fnref:sapient" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sapient" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> with a handful of new techniques, but also each model is trained for only a specific task: the model that scored highly on ARC was trained on 1,000 ARC problems. It’s not built for general use.</p>

<p>A model like HRM could likely run on your phone, just like Stockfish. These aren’t general purpose programs, and they’re not excelling with copious compute. Further, Stockfish is incredibly practical! It can be run basically anywhere (which is actually a growing problem in the online chess scene…) While the bitter lesson did demonstrate new mechanisms for search humans wouldn’t have anticipated, wrapping those in human-knowledge-based rules proves both more performant and practical.</p>

<hr>

<p>The bitter lesson is an <em>incredibly</em> well written essay. And the argument it makes is compelling because of its simplicity.</p>

<p>But like any rule of thumb, it’s imperfect when it meets the real world. I embrace the idea that general methods that leverage computation will lead us to new ideas and techniques. For many domains, once we understand these mechanisms we can apply them in focused, efficient applications.</p>

<p>And of course – this is entirely dependent on our ability to represent our challenges as data. We can easily model chess and annotate images, but modeling workplace dynamics is much harder.</p>

<p>For those building agents and other AI-powered applications today, it’s good to keep in mind the bitter lesson. Consider where <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/05/27/will-the-model-eat-your-stack.html">the model might eat your stack</a>, but don’t be afraid to thoughtfully apply custom, human-crafted logic or embrace non-general models to get the job done. And remember: compute is a constraint.&nbsp;Don’t let the bitter lesson stand in the way of actually <em>running</em> your tool. Slightly less accuracy at a fraction of the cost is often the best way.</p>

Sparse attention offers a promising direction for improving efficiency while maintaining model capabilities. We present NSA, a Natively trained Sparse Attention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations to achieve efficient long-context modeling. NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context awareness and local precision. Our approach advances sparse attention design with two key innovations: (1) We achieve substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design, with implementation optimizations for modern hardware. (2) We enable end-to-end training, reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model performance. As shown in Figure 1, experiments show the model pretrained with NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models across general benchmarks, long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning. Meanwhile, NSA achieves substantial speedups over Full Attention on 64k-length sequences across decoding, forward propagation, and backward propagation, validating its efficiency throughout the model lifecycle.</span></p></div><dl><dt>Anthology ID:</dt><dd>2025.acl-long.1126</dd><dt>Volume:</dt><dd><a href="https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2025.acl-long/">Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)</a></dd><dt>Month:</dt><dd>July</dd><dt>Year:</dt><dd>2025</dd><dt>Address:</dt><dd>Vienna, Austria</dd><dt>Editors:</dt><dd><a href="https://aclanthology.org/people/w/wanxiang-che/">Wanxiang Che</a>,

            <p>Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is the simplest form of an agent. This architecture, however, can yield agents that are “shallow” and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks.

<p dir="ltr"><span>Atlassian has always set itself as a company that doesn’t mince words and is majorly transparent, displaying the core value “Open Company, No Bullshit” in its offices around the world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While not specifically outlined, the affected staff seem to be from the company’s European operations, with </span><em>The Australian</em><span><em> </em>saying that Cannon-Brooke’s overshared that it would be difficult to axe its European staff due to contract arrangements, but that the company had already begun moving in that direction.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The company has also embedded AI in its customer contact form.</span></p>
    





<p dir="ltr"><span>Former co-CEO and co-founder Scott Farquhar, at the same time, has said that embracing AI on a daily basis is something Australians should be doing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“AI is going to change Australia,” he told t</span><span>he ABC.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“Every person should be using AI daily for as many things as they can.”</span></p>
    






<p dir="ltr"><span>“Like any new technology, it will feel awkward to start with, but every business person, every business leader, every government leader, and every bureaucrat should be using it.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He also said that governments should be implementing AI more broadly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Staff believe that Farquhar, who announced his resignation as co-CEO of Atlassian in April 2024 before stepping down in September, would have been more gentle in delivering the termination message.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“[Cannon-Brookes] is the colder person out of the couple,” said one person who saw the pre-recorded video, according to </span><em>The Australian</em><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“[Farquhar] was the warmer one.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Commenting on the termination, Farquhar said the mass termination was due to the customer service team no longer being needed in the same capacity, as larger clients required less complex support following a move to the cloud.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Cyber Daily has reached out to Atlassian for confirmation that no Australian staff were impacted and for comment on the incident.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Atlassian closely follows </span><a href="https://www.cyberdaily.au/digital-transformation/12434-cba-cuts-at-least-45-jobs-to-make-room-for-ai-unions-furious" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Commonwealth Bank</span></a><span> (CBA), which culled at least 45 jobs as it makes room for AI.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The country’s largest bank said it would be making at least 45 roles redundant in the wake of its push to use AI, and only a month after it announced that it had launched a new customer assistance AI voice bot system.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“Our investment in technology, including AI, is making it easier and faster for customers to get help, especially in our call centres,” a CBA spokesman said regarding the voice bot.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“By automating simple queries, our teams can focus on more complex customer queries that need empathy and experience.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“To meet the changing needs of our customers ... we review the skills we need and how we’re organised to deliver the best customer experiences and outcomes. That means some roles and work can change.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Updated 31/07/25 - Atlassian says the jobs are not being replaced by AI, but that it has embedded AI in its customer service. Updated to remove claims of AI replacing jobs.</em></p></section>

Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.</p><p>The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.</p><p>While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.</p><p>Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.</p><p>"Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans," Brett Schreiber, counsel for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. "Tesla's lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm's way."</p><p>Following the verdict, the plaintiffs' families hugged each other and their lawyers, and Angulo was "visibly emotional" as he embraced his mother, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial-verdict-partly-liable-rcna222344" target="_blank">according to NBC</a>. </p><p>Tesla told NBC that it plans to appeal and said, "Today's verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology."</p><p>The verdict comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that his company can pivot into a leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S.</p><p>Tesla shares dipped 1.5% on Friday and are now down 25% for the year, the biggest drop among tech's megacap companies.</p><p>The verdict could set a precedent for Autopilot-related suits against Tesla. About a dozen active cases are underway focused on similar claims involving incidents where Autopilot or Tesla's FSD— Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — had been in use just before a fatal or injurious crash. </p><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/tesla-software-fix-rolls-out-after-regulators-recall-2-million-cars-over-autopilot-defect.html">initiated</a>&nbsp;a probe in 2021 into possible safety defects in Tesla's Autopilot systems. During the course of that investigation, Tesla made changes, including a number of over-the-air software updates.</p><p>The agency then opened a second probe, which is ongoing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/tesla-must-provide-nhtsa-with-autopilot-recall-data-or-face-fines.html">evaluating</a>&nbsp;whether Tesla's "recall remedy" to resolve issues with the behavior of its Autopilot, especially around stationary first responder vehicles, had been effective.</p><p>The NHTSA has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/08/tesla-social-media-posts-falsely-say-cars-are-robotaxis-nhtsa-warns.html">also warned&nbsp;Tesla</a>&nbsp;that its social media posts may mislead drivers into thinking its cars are capable of functioning as robotaxis, even though owners manuals say the cars require hands-on steering and a driver attentive to steering and braking at all times.</p><p>A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions, <a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/" target="_blank">TeslaDeaths.com</a>, has reported at least 58 deaths resulting from incidents where Tesla drivers had Autopilot engaged just before impact.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/07/24/ex-tesla-board-member-tough-quarter-for-the-ev-maker.html">Tesla's tough quarter</a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108176215" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000383327" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108176215"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108176216-17533473381753347335-40867300248-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1753347337&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Ex-Tesla Board Member: Tough quarter for the EV-maker"><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Get a load of this (totally normalized) BS.</p>
<div><p>
"We have just the offering for you! 
</p><p>Visit our website. Create an account. Verify your email. Create a project. Add your credit card. Go to settings. Create an API key. Add it to your password manager. Drop it in your .env file. Download our SDK. Import it. Pass your env var in. Never share your API key. Make sure you never commit it to source control.</p>
<p>On the client, we have a React SDK. Make sure you use your publishable key for that. For the server, download our admin SDK. Use your secret key. Never mix the two up.”</p>
</div>
<p>It’s truly wild to me what some of y’all will tolerate.</p>
<h3 id="making-your-own-api-key">Making your own API key</h3>
<p>Let me show you something… Did you know generating a JWK is stupidly easy?</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="ts"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { generateKeyPair, exportJWK } </span><span>from</span><span> 'jose'</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> keyPair</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> generateKeyPair</span><span>(</span><span>'ES256'</span><span>, {</span></span>
<span><span>  extractable: </span><span>true</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>})</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> publicKeyJWK</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> exportJWK</span><span>(keyPair.publicKey)</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> privateKeyJWK</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> exportJWK</span><span>(keyPair.privateKey)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Your JWK keypair is now effectively your own self-issued API key.</p>
<p>No need to visit a website, make an account, verify your email, create a project, go to settings, create an API key, or copy it and use it. You just generated your own.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-use-this">How do we use this?</h3>
<p>Let’s see how we can get rid of secret versus publishable keys and separate client and admin SDKs.</p>
<p>Who cares whether you’re on the client or server? If your app wants to authorize a privileged action, it should be able to do so without separate keys or SDKs.</p>
<p>Here’s how to implement this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store your app’s private JWK on the server</li>
<li>Using whatever auth scheme you have, implement a function that returns whether to allow a given action</li>
<li>Express privileged actions as claims in your JWT—if a privileged action is allowed, include the claim in the payload and sign the JWT with your private key</li>
<li>Give your client SDK a function that reverse-proxies to your API, adding a signed JWT to the request’s Authorization header with any privileged claims you want to include</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what the client-side JWT generation looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="ts"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { SignJWT } </span><span>from</span><span> 'jose'</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> jwt</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> new</span><span> SignJWT</span><span>({</span></span>
<span><span>  // Clients shouldn't be able to destroy the database</span></span>
<span><span>  // unless the action is allowed, so this is a claim</span></span>
<span><span>  destroyDatabase: </span><span>true</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>})</span></span>
<span><span>// Include the public key in the JWT header so the server </span></span>
<span><span>// can verify the signature and associate the request</span></span>
<span><span>// with your account</span></span>
<span><span>.</span><span>setProtectedHeader</span><span>({ alg: </span><span>'ES256'</span><span>, jwk: publicKeyJWK })</span></span>
<span><span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(privateKeyJWK);</span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="charging-for-your-api">Charging for your API</h3>
<p>But what if you want to charge for your API?</p>
<p>Simple: make your API return a payment URL when a request is made with a public key that isn’t associated with a paid account.</p>
<p>Your client SDK can present this to the developer (for example, by logging it to the console).</p>
<p>After the developer pays, associate their public key with the paid account in your database and stop returning payment URLs for future requests from that key.</p>
<h3 id="b2b2c">B2B2C</h3>
<p>What about situations where your customers are developers who want to give <em>their</em> end users API keys?</p>
<p>This is where you need to deviate from JOSE standards.</p>
<p>One approach is hierarchical JWK derivation. Here’s the idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your developer customers create a master JWK</li>
<li>They derive child JWKs for each of their end users from that master key</li>
<li>You modify the JWT scheme to include a zero-knowledge proof that the end user’s key is derived from the developer’s master public key</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, you can verify that an end user is authorized by a specific developer without the developer having to manage API keys for their users.</p>
<p>I don’t have a ready-made example of this, but the concept is solid. If you want to explore this further, hit me up on <a href="https://x.com/danscan">Twitter</a> and I’ll help you out.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-g44mhg6z="">  <article> <p> July 30, 2025 , Nicholas Khami </p>     <p>For over a year, I was bugged by a search quirk on <a href="https://mintlify.com/">Mintlify</a> that caused race conditions and wonky search results.</p>
<p>Here’s the fun irony: I was the founder of Trieve, the company that powered search for their 30,000+ documentation sites, yet their debounced search queries weren’t being aborted as you typed. Check out this delightful chaos:</p>

<p>I had brought this up in our shared Slack before when I was just a vendor to <del>them</del> <strong>us</strong> (weird), but it wasn’t a priority and never got fixed. It was extra frustrating because the race condition on the query was apparent enough that search would sometimes feel low quality since it would return results for a query many characters before the user was done typing.</p>
<p>Even worse, as the founder of the search company powering this experience, it felt like a poor reflection on Trieve every time someone encountered these wonky results.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-it">Fixed It</h2>
<p>Now that I’m on the team, I was able to finally fix it. I added an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">AbortController</a> to the debounced search function, so that it aborts any previous queries when a new one is made. This means that the search results are always relevant to what the user is currently typing.</p>
<p>There’s something deeply satisfying about finally being able to fix the things that bug you. It reminds me of George Hotz’s legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221122050324/https://twitter.com/realGeorgeHotz/status/1594908473875173377">single week at Twitter</a> in 2022, where he boldly joined with perhaps overambitious plans to fix Twitter search, got humbled by the complexity, but still managed to ship a useful login popup fix before his characteristically dramatic exit. Classic hacker hubris meeting reality, but still getting something done.</p>
<p>I’ve always admired engineers who are part hacker, part entrepreneur - people who see a problem and just… fix it. Getting to do something similar here (minus the dramatic exit) felt like a small win in steering my career toward that kind of direct approach.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>I prefer building and using open source software whenever possible, and this whole situation is a great example of why.</p>
<p>With open source - when you encounter a bug or pain point, you can actually fix it yourself. Had this been an open source project during the year I was frustrated with the search race condition, I could have submitted a pull request with the AbortController fix and saved myself (and thousands of other users) the daily annoyance.</p>
<p>Instead, it remained a persistent irritation until I happened to join the company and gain access to the codebase. There’s something to be said for the immediate empowerment that comes with open source - though I understand why many companies choose different models for various business reasons.</p>
<h2 id="self-congratulation">Self-Congratulation</h2>
<p>If search feels just a bit crisper and more responsive on Mintlify, it’s because of me! I fixed a bug that bothered me for over a year, and it feels great to have made that little improvement to the product.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to make more. Fixing small issues like this over and over again is how products become legendary. There’s something deeply satisfying about finally having the power to fix the things that annoy you - even if they’re tiny.</p>
<p><strong>Especially if they’re tiny.</strong></p> </article>  </div></div>]]></description>

	<span><span><span><span>For nearly 60 years, CPB has carried out its Congressional mission to build and sustain a trusted public media system that informs, educates, and serves communities across the country. Through partnerships with local stations and producers, CPB has supported educational content, locally relevant journalism, emergency communications, cultural programming, and essential services for Americans in every community.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison. “CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>CPB informed its employees today that the majority of staff positions will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025. A small transition team will remain through January 2026 to ensure a responsible and orderly closeout of operations. This team will focus on compliance, final distributions, and resolution of long-term financial obligations, including ensuring continuity for music rights and royalties that remain essential to the public media system.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>CPB’s Board of Directors and management are working closely to address the legal, financial, and operational requirements of the closure. CPB will provide regular updates and guidance to stations and producers navigating the profound challenges ahead.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <article>
  <section id="my-background">
  <h2>My background <a href="#my-background">§</a></h2>
  
    <p><span>E</span>ven before I started pressing buttons for a living I was always a
pretty heavy computer user.  When I was about 18 I started
experiencing symptoms of RSI.  At around the same time I learnt of the
Dvorak keyboard layout, and so I switched, hoping it would solve my
problems.  It did, at least at the time, and so for the last 17 years
I’ve been a Dvorak user.</p>


<!--more-->

    <p><span>A</span>t the same time I’m really interested in human/machine interaction
and ways to get the contents of the human brain into a machine as
fluently as possible.  As a combined result of these two factors, I
worked my way through a few different physical keyboards, including
the Microsoft Ergonomic series (which I struggled to make Windows 2000
recognize — go figure) and a Kinesis Advantage, but my keyboard of
choice for many years now has been the
<a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>.  The Ergodox (and its ZSA
comrade the Moonlander) is a solid keyboard, with a few features that
I’ve come to realize are very important:</p>

    <p><strong>Split halves</strong>. Any keyboard with the halves joined together (that is
narrower than shoulder-width, as is the case with every joined
keyboard I’ve seen so far) causes the elbows to bend in and the wrists
to bend out, which seems to be the primary trigger of wrist pain
for me.</p>

    <p><strong>Tenting</strong>. Ditto for the elbows: last year I found myself struggling
with pain and numbness in my arm that, on investigation, matched
symptoms of early cubital tunnel syndrome.  Tenting, rotating the
halves of the keyboard so that the wrists sit in a slight angle,
allows the elbows to rest in a more natural slightly-bent position,
and since adopting it I haven’t had any further problems with my elbow.</p>

</p>
<p>Figure 1. The Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard.</p>
</div>

    <p><strong>Thumb clusters</strong>. The first symptom I got was what’s affectionately
known as ‘emacs pinky’. 

<label for="sidenote:1"></label>
<span>In fact, on most keyboards (though sadly no longer on ThinkPads) the control key, positioned in the bottom-right corner, can and should be held with the palm — this makes some combinations more awkward, though no more awkward than with the little finger, and saves the weakest digit.  In fact, I think it would be better named for vi — the escape key is perhaps the least ergonomic key on a standard keyboard.  Some people like to put it in the place of caps-lock, which is of course entirely missing the point.</span> The
reason I picked up the Kinesis Advantage is that on these keyboards
the thumb, which is highly underutilized in standard layouts, gets a
dedicated cluster of keys, perfect for things like modifiers, since
the opposable thumbs don’t limit the motion of the rest of the hand at
all, no matter how it’s engaged.</p>
<div>

</p>
<p>Figure 2. The Kinesis Advantage.  This one is wireless, while mine, the original model, was connected by PS/2 cable.  But the layout hasn’t changed.</p>
</div>

    <p><strong>Programmability</strong>. My customization is light compared to some
people’s, but my keyboard usage is pretty idiosyncratic, so it’s
important to me to be able to customize my keyboard when I need to.
Particularly for keyboards with fewer keys that need heavier layer
usage, I want to be able to set up the layers as I want.  My most
elaborate customization is that I am (from time to time) a hobbyist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype">stenographer</a>, and rather
than having a separate device I find it convenient to be able to
configure my keyboard to speak one of the steno protocols understood
by <a href="https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/">Plover</a> such as TX
Bolt or GeminiPR.</p>
</section>
<section id="finger-oriented-keyboarding">
  <h2>Finger-oriented keyboarding <a href="#finger-oriented-keyboarding">§</a></h2>
  
    <p><span>W</span>ith this in mind, I was pretty excited when I stumbled across the
<a href="https://www.charachorder.com/">CharaChorder</a>.  The promise is
simple: increase typing speed through a combination of minimizing
finger movement and stenography-style chording (albeit with a theory
designed to have a shallower learning curve, basically just mashing
all the letters of the word at once).  I signed up to the
pre-order, and when I got it I immediately started playing around,
practising a few hours per day on the (very good!) training software.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.charachorder.com/"><img src="https://twey.io/hci/svalboard/charachorder-one.jpeg" alt="Picture of a CharaChorder One, a radical new keyboard with joysticks instead of keys."></a>
</p>
<p>Figure 3. The CharaChorder One.</p>
</div>

    <p><span>I</span>f you’ve ever done typing training, you’ll know that most of the
point of the drills and forms that they teach you is to keep your
fingers on the home row so that you can reach all the letters with a
minimum of movement.  The CharaChorder turns this on its head: on the
CharaChorder there is <em>only</em> the home row.  Where you would stretch up
or down or sideways to reach a key on a traditional keyboard, on the
CharaChorder you simply wiggle a joystick in that direction, never
taking your finger off the key. 

<label for="sidenote:5"></label>
<span>There is in fact a second row of joysticks used for arrow keys or mouse emulation, but we’ll ignore them for the purposes of this since they don’t impact most of the typing experience.</span></p>

    <p><span>I</span> loved the compact form factor combined with the power of chording,
and I was excited to develop a new steno theory based on the
CharaChorder’s unique structure.  Unfortunately, I was thwarted: the
CC1 runs the CharaChorder OS, a closed-source project with only a
restricted set of chording configurations, and the fact that it must
take place on-device severely limits what can be done compared to the
software-based solutions I was used to.  The CC1 is great for people
who need to travel and connect their device to many different
computers, but that’s not my use-case.  Furthermore ergonomics are
decidedly not a priority for the CharaChorder, with (for example) the
down presses being a chord of each of the cardinal directions, for a
hefty (42 × 4 = 168) grams of force to activate, and some default
chords requiring punishing scissoring and twisting motions that left
my hands very sore after a practice session.  The final straw for me
was that a month or so into using the CC1 one of my joysticks broke,
coming loose in its housing; CC were kind enough to send me a
replacement half, but shortly after that arrived the same thing
happened to a joystick on the remaining half from the first keyboard!


<label for="sidenote:9"></label>
<span>I hear that the build quality has improved significantly on the CC2; please don’t be put off from trying it by this experience of mine!  It remains a really nifty device, especially if you regularly need to transport your keyboard and use it with computers whose software you don’t control, or if you want to <a href="https://www.charachorder.com/en-gb/products/wear-a-chorder">attach the keyboard to your trousers</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span>T</span>hankfully, on the CharaChorder Discord I was introduced to the
<a href="https://svalboard.com/">Svalboard Lightly</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-svalboard-lightly">
  <h2>The Svalboard Lightly <a href="#the-svalboard-lightly">§</a></h2>
  
    <p><span>T</span>he Svalboard, a descendent of the beloved
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand">DataHand</a>, is based on the
same principles as the CharaChorder: each finger gets a key ‘cluster’
and rather than moving the finger off the key to reach other keys as
in traditional keyboards, the finger stays in its cluster and merely
moves in a direction to press a key — including down, like a standard
keyboard but mostly unlike the CharaChorder, in which the down press
is too awkward to use as part of standard typing.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://svalboard.com/products/lightly"><img src="https://twey.io/hci/svalboard/svalboard.jpeg" alt="svalboard"></a>
</p>
<p>Figure 4. The Svalboard Lightly.</p>
</div>

    <p><span>I</span>t throws away the usual mechanical keyboard spring-loaded switches in
favour of something at once simpler and more high-tech: an infrared
source fires a beam at the stem of the key, initially blocked by a
‘flag’ on the keystem, and triggers a keypress when the key is moved
out of the way to allow the beam to hit a detector.  Magnets — actual,
permanent bits of magnetic neodymium — are used to replace the
tactility of traditional switch springs, with pressing the key
requiring breaking the magnets' hold in a rather satisfying way that
feels similar to a traditional buckling spring but requires much less
total force to activate.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>his is in line with its philosophy: apart from the circuitry and the
magnets, everything is 3D-printed to open schematics and held together
with standard screws, ensuring that any piece that’s likely to break
can be replaced, even if the board stops being produced (as happened
to the DataHand).</p>
<section id="the-excellent">
  <h3>The excellent <a href="#the-excellent">§</a></h3>
  
    <p><span>T</span>he Svalboard runs <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>, a de-facto standard for
customizable keyboard firmware that I was already used to from the
Ergodox.  Something that was new to me, though, 

<label for="sidenote:13"></label>
<span>ZSA do now provide <a href="https://www.zsa.io/oryx">Oryx</a>, configuration software with a similar purpose; I’d just never tried it!</span> was that the variant
of QMK it uses (by default) is a custom spin of
<a href="https://get.vial.today/">Vial</a>, a fork of QMK enriched with
dynamic layout editing via a GUI editor, or (for the Svalboard) the
excellent <a href="https://captdeaf.github.io/keybard/">Keybard</a>, which
replaces the Vial frontend with a much lighter-weight Web-based
alternative.</p>

    <p><span>I</span>’d never bothered to get set up with a graphical configurator before,
reasoning that I’m perfectly capable of writing a bit of C so I might
as well avail myself of the full power of the firmware, but the
qualitative difference it made, especially as I was still getting used
to the board and ‘dialled in’ to make my everyday tasks comfortable,
was phenomenal.  The ability to open a Web page and tweak a key has
led to a huge number of quality-of-life improvements that I could have
made without it but never did because I didn’t want to interrupt my
workflow to flash my keyboard, and then I promptly forgot about them.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>hat ties neatly into another aspect of the Svalboard I really
appreciate: every part is minutely customizable.  At build time
several options are available for different key sizes and shapes, and
at the time of writing there are three different pointing devices
available which can be swapped out on either side of the Svalboard.
But even after assembly every part of the board that the user’s hand
touches can be shifted, rotated, raised, lowered, or detached entirely
by loosening some screws.  For the first few months I kept a
screwdriver on my desk so I could make small adjustments as I noticed
certain movements were more or less comfortable for me, and the
software allows me to easily tweak my layout to put more common
actions on more easily-reached keys.</p>
</section>
<section id="some-caveats">
  <h3>Some caveats <a href="#some-caveats">§</a></h3>
  
    <p><span>W</span>hile overall I think it’s a fantastic device, it would be remiss of
me to pretend that everything has been plain sailing with the
Svalboard.  I’m very happy with it and it’s now my sole everyday
keyboard.  That said, there are a couple of things that, while far
from deal-breakers for me, definitely bear thinking about, and if you
have the chance to test-drive a Svalboard you should pay attention to.</p>

    <p><span>F</span>irst, and most definitely least, I’ve had a couple of minor
build-quality incidents.  Notably, the magnets that hold the keys in
place have escaped from their plastic housing three or four times
during my ownership of my Sval.  Thankfully, in sharp contrast to the
CharaChorder, the hackable nature of the Svalboard makes this pretty
easy to fix: some superglue and a steady hand has them better than new
in a couple of minutes.  But it’s never nice to have to stop work to
re-glue my keyboard.  Of course the Svalboard is also available as a
kit for 3D printing around, so potentially I should have built it
myself and then I wouldn’t have anyone else to blame!</p>

    <p><span>T</span>hen, there’s the matter of the price.  A premium mechanical keyboard
like the ZSA Moonlander will typically set you back up to around
USD$400.  But the Svalboard comes in at easily twice that and even
higher depending on respective configurations.  For me, so far, the
device is well worth the investment, but your mileage may vary.  If
you have some spare time and access to a 3D printer, the kit option is
significantly cheaper, and seems like it could be fun.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>he Svalboard demands correct configuration, and can be very
uncomfortable to use until arranged right.  Being able to comfortably
and consistently press the keys is, in my experience, very much a
function of how well set up the keyboard is, and so if you have a
setup where it or you will be moving around a lot, you’ll find
yourself spending a lot of time repositioning and reconfiguring the
keyboard.  I strongly suggest looking into a chair-mounted solution,
which lets the keyboard remain statically positioned with respect to
your body and arms.  Relatedly, its many moving parts make it
infeasible to transport around easily; Morgan sells a blessed travel
case, but it’s a chunky thing, and doesn’t lend itself to throwing in
a backpack, nor (due to its positioning sensitivity) would I really
want to use a Svalboard on the go on a train or aeroplane.  Likewise,
the optical keypress sensors require active infrared beams, meaning
they’re too power-hungry for cable-free usage.</p>

    <p><span>I</span>t’s punishing to sloppy typing too.  For those of us used to
hammering away at slab keyboards all day, the lightness of the keys
can make it feel like the keyboard is on a hair trigger.  I often find
myself making typos that wouldn’t have happened on a traditional
board, because between having the impulse to press the key, moving my
finger over to where the key is, and exerting the requisite force to
register a keystroke, I have plenty of time to reconsider my actions.
With the Svalboard, it can feel like I type the letter before I decide
to, and then I’m left to clean up the resulting mess!  I think this is
significantly a matter of practice, and I’ve definitely seen it get
better as I become more accustomed to the board, but it’s something I
still fight with six months in.</p>

    <p><span>F</span>inally, in balance to its many advantages, there is one straight-up
disadvantage to the Svalboard (and other DataHand-like layouts)
compared to a slab keyboard when it comes to typing, and that’s repeat
keypresses.  Whereas with a traditional keyboard a repeat keypress
involves making a potentially awkward movement to the desired key and
then making several simple pressing motions, for the Svalboard
repeating a key involves repeating the stretching/curling motion for
every press, which can be much more difficult than just repeating the
press.  This is most evident in games that need you to hammer a
particular key several times in quick succession, but can also be seen
when typing words with certain double letters.  There are workarounds
available for this, though:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, not all keys suffer from this problem: at least the centre
keys of each cluster are at least as easy to hammer as on a
traditional keyboard, if not even easier due to their super-light
switches.  I also find the inward and downward presses easy enough
to repeat.  If you can keep keycodes that need repeating on those
keys that are comfortable to repeat, you’ll have no problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, as a more general solution, QMK supports binding a
‘repeat’ key that can be used to repeat the previous keypress.  If
you bind that key to an easily-repeatable key you can use it to
comfortably repeat any key on the keyboard.  I’ve tried this a
couple of times, but the combination of sacrificing a prime key with
the mental overhead make it not worth it for me, compared to
rearranging the keys that need to be repeated.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <h2>My Svalboard setup <a href="#my-svalboard-setup">§</a></h2>
  
    <p><span>T</span>he above is my take on the Svalboard as a device; you can find many
other reviews online, some of them in much greater depth, but these
are the things I’ve noticed about it in my first half-year.  The
remainder of this article is about how I have my Svalboard set up, and
how I use it day-to-day.</p>
<section id="mounting">
  <h3>Mounting <a href="#mounting">§</a></h3>
  
    <p><span>I</span> have my Svalboard on a chair mount, simply attached to my chair arms
with some <a href="https://www.smallrig.com/list/Magic-Arm.html">SmallRig
Magic Arms</a>.  I experimented with on-desk and under-desk mounting, but
I found I tend to move my chair too much with respect to the keyboard,
which puts me into poor typing position and messes up my typing for a
bit before I figure out what the problem is and adjust back.  By
contrast, having the Svalboard mounted to a chair means my arms, so
long as I keep them on the arm rests, are always positioned the same
way on the Svalboard, and the only thing I have to worry about is my
cats using the cables as chew-toys. 

<label for="sidenote:17"></label>
<span>Magnetic cable attachments mean that if a cat decides to dangle from your cables by the teeth the cable detaches, resulting in minor inconvenience and maybe a damaged cable rather than a thousand-dollar keyboard being forcibly ripped from its housing and dropped onto the floor.  I settled on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/leizhan-magnetic-connection-charging-transfer-Dark-Gray/dp/B0DRVD9Y3W">these units</a> because they swivel vertically, but they’re all pretty interchangeable.</span></p>

<section id="base-layout-and-learning-to-type-again">
  <h3>Base layout and learning to type again <a href="#base-layout-and-learning-to-type-again">§</a></h3>
  
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Twey/svalboard-layout">My Svalboard layout is
available on GitHub</a> in Keybard format, along with some documentation
that is sometimes in-date.</p>

    <p><span>W</span>hen I learnt Dvorak I learnt to touch-type properly for the first
time, and for whatever reason I’ve managed to almost fully maintain my
<abbr>QWERTY</abbr> hunt-and-peck skills, with only a brief adjustment peried when
faced with a <abbr>QWERTY</abbr> keyboard before I can begin typing at a reasonable
speed.  So, I reasoned, given that the Svalboard is physically quite
different from the flat keyboards on which I normally type Dvorak, if
I pick a base layout that’s sufficiently different to Dvorak anyway it
and my Dvorak muscle memory won’t interfere with each other and I’ll
keep both intact.  And, since I’m learning a drastically different
physical keyboard layout anyway, it won’t slow me down much.  So I
picked
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1g66ivi/hands_down_promethium_snth_meets_hd_silverengram/">Hands
Down Promethium</a>, which was recommended to me for split keyboards,
adapted to the Svalboard by <a href="https://github.com/ilc">Ira Cooper</a>.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>his was a mistake.</p>

    <p><span>I</span>n fact, HDPm and Dvorak interfere with each other constantly, and I
find myself making typos from one whenever I’m using the other.  Six
months later I’m up to about 80 WPM on the Svalboard now from my ~120
on Dvorak, but given the amount of interference from my Dvorak muscle
memory I can only assume I’d be at full speed by now if I’d used an
adapted Dvorak, and my flat-keyboard Dvorak would not have suffered as
it now does.  Particularly, since the home rows are roughly mirror
images of each other, I frequently press with the right finger on the
wrong hand.  Perhaps it would have been easier if I’d mirrored the
layout, but it’s too late now.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://twey.io/hci/svalboard/layout-default.png"><img src="https://twey.io/hci/svalboard/layout-default.png" alt="A screenshot of my base layout in Keybard."></a>
</p>
<p>Figure 6. My base layout, derived from Hands Down Promethium.</p>
</div>

    <p><span>N</span>evertheless, I’ve found picking up a new keyboard layout as an adult
to be a pretty educational endeavour.  There’s a symbiosis with the
Svalboard that rewards mindfulness: I will do a couple of rounds of
<a href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkeytype</a>, realize that I’m
consistently making a particular error because my keyboard is
misconfigured in some way, get out the screwdriver and fiddle with it,
then continue.  But doing that requires a certain level of conscious
introspection to determine what typos are due to keyboard
misconfigurations vs brain slips vs physical mishaps (which
occasionally happen randomly!).  It’s an almost meditative state.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>he main adaptation from HDPm is a vertical mirroring.  This is
because, at least for me, the Svalboard’s north keys are much harder
to hit than its south keys, even though on slab keyboards conventional
wisdom considers the top row to be lower-cost than the bottom row.
Something I didn’t realize at the time is that I also find the inward
lateral keys much easier to hit than the north keys, so I’d have liked
to try mapping the bottom row of HDPm to the inward laterals of the
Svalboard rather than the top row.  Nevertheless, I find this layout
to be pretty good overall, and I don’t think it would be worth the
switch now I’m starting to get used to it.</p>

    <p><span>O</span>n the fingers, after a long adjustment period, I’ve found that the
easiest keys to hit are, in order:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the centre keys,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>followed by the south keys,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then the inward keys,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then the north keys.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

    <p><span>T</span>he outward keys are relatively uncomfortable, especially on the
weaker fingers, and I reserve them for infrequently-used
keys. 

<label for="sidenote:21"></label>
<span>The astute reader might have noticed a lack of an escape key: I actually type escape by pressing <kbd>⌦ Delete</kbd> and <kbd>⌫ Backspace</kbd> in unison.  This took me a bit to get used to but now I really like it, and would consider a similar approach for other infrequently-used keys like <kbd>↵ Enter</kbd>.  <em>Combos</em> with the outward keys can use a slight roll of the wrist, and so are much more comfortable for these kinds of one-off actions than for typing letters.</span></p>

    <p><span>O</span>n the thumbs, the easiest keys for me to hit are the inward ‘pad’
keys and the bottom ‘knuckle’ key, followed by the downward key.  The
lateral motions required to hit the ‘nail’ and ‘up’ keys are not
difficult to do, but cause strain that makes my thumbs hurt at the end
of the day if I assign them to anything that’s used too heavily.  This
is probably unique to my pathophysiology: you should experiment
yourself.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>he Svalboard has only 60 keys, meaning that layering is inevitable to
get a full complement of keystrokes.  I have three ‘everyday’ layers,
not counting shift: my base layer, a numbers/symbols layer, and a
combined navigation/control layer.  These are all ‘momentary’ layers,
meaning that I switch between them by holding down a key, and I switch
between them all on the fly while editing text.  Layering is something
that seems to put people off of keyboards with fewer keys, but while
experimenting with the Ergodox (on which, for many keycodes, I had
both a less-accessible key in the base layout and also a
more-accessible key on a higher layer) I found it much more
comfortable to have an easily-reachable layer switch than to have a
dedicated key that requires a stretch and a mispositioning of the
hands.  I find three layers few enough to not cause me undue mental
load, while still providing plenty of key space (none of my layers,
even the base layer, is fully utilized at the time of writing).</p>

    <p><span>I</span>’ve settled on a hand-split setup in which software modifiers like
<kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>, <kbd>⎈ Ctrl</kbd>, and <kbd>⎇ Alt</kbd> (very important since I’m
an emacs user!) live on the left thumb, while layer modifiers live on
the right hand.  Having modifiers on the thumb allows me to have only
one copy of each modifier, since the thumb can move independently of
any other finger, while having the layer-switch keys (which are not
detectable by software) on the right thumb allows me to bind the
entirety of the left half of the keyboard when gaming. 

<label for="sidenote:25"></label>
<span>The <kbd>❖ Super</kbd> key is on the right hand for the same reason: it isn’t usually bindable in games.</span> The design of the individual clusters is
subtle: on the Svalboard thumb cluster the pairings on the same side
of the thumb cluster (e.g. <span><kbd>⎈ Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>⎇ Alt</kbd></span> on my layout) can be
easily hit together, while those on opposite sides (e.g. <span><kbd>⎈ Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></span> can’t be).  <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>, therefore, lives in the middle of the
cluster, where it can be easily hit with either side, while for the
specific combinations of the modifiers on the right with <kbd>R</kbd> or
<kbd>↵ Return</kbd> I have dedicated combinations with other layers: for
example, <kbd>R</kbd> on the control layer produces <span><kbd>⎈ Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd></span>.  On
the right cluster I have my layout modifiers, and here I make use of a
controversial feature of the Svalboard, inherited from the original
DataHand: the middle key of the thumb cluster has a ‘deep press’ that
is activated by pressing on it harder than usual.  Obviously this can
only occur while the usual key is held down.  This is ideal for me, as
I control my window manager using a combination of <kbd>❖ Super</kbd> with
various control and function keys, so while the middle press usually
enables my control/navigation layer, by pressing it more firmly I can
activate <kbd>❖ Super</kbd> as well and control my window manager.
Unfortunately, I sometimes need to use <kbd>❖ Super</kbd> with keys from
the base layout, so I also need a bare <kbd>❖ Super</kbd> key that doesn’t
involve switching to the control layer.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>he symbol layer has symmetric pairs of brackets as well as the
standard numbers and symbols.  Worthy of note is that I have a
‘<a href="https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">programmer Dvorak</a>’–like
layout in which symbols are prioritized over numbers: as a programmer
I type symbols a lot more often than numbers, and privileging small
numbers over large numbers encodes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford’s law</a>.
It’s notable that, due to the abundance of key space given by having
an entire layer dedicated to numbers and symbols rather than just the
top row and some peripheral keys, I’m able to represent the entire set
of standard keyboard symbols and numbers here without shifting.
Insofar as needing an extra layer is a negative for the accessibility
of these keys, I find that this advantage more than offsets it.  I
also keep some infrequently-used keys here, such as my <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd>
key, which I use only for symbols too rare to have their own dedicated
key.  I use composition for occasional letters with diacritics, emoji,
mathematical characters, or non-ASCII punctuation like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark">quotation marks</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash">dashes</a>. 

<label for="sidenote:29"></label>
<span>It is important for clarity for quotation marks to be properly aligned: the typewriter ‘straight quotes’ arose only out of lack of glyph space, and should be avoided where more capable encodings are available.  I do find the ‘straight apostrophe’ useful for semantically distinguishing the apostrophe, whose chirality is unimportant, from the single quote, against Unicode recommendations.</span></p>

</div>

    <p><span>T</span>he control layer has, most importantly, two
‘<a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/wordstar-diamond/">WordStar
diamonds</a>’ for textual navigation: one on the left produces standard
arrow keys, while one on the right produces ‘big-step’ versions of the
same (<kbd>⇞ Page Up</kbd>, <kbd>⇟ Page Down</kbd>, <kbd>⇤ Home</kbd>, and <kbd>⇥
End</kbd>).  These diamonds differ from the standard <abbr>QWERTY</abbr>
<kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> in that on the Svalboard (at least for
me) the ‘south’ direction is much more comfortable than the ‘north’
direction, but both are trumped by the ‘centre’ direction, so both
<kbd>← Left</kbd> and <kbd>→ Right</kbd> are on the centre keys along with
<kbd>↑ Up</kbd>, and instead of <kbd>↑ Up</kbd> being on a row above <kbd>↓
Down</kbd> is on a ‘row’ below, with a southward keypress. Also on this
layer I have function keys, matched in position to the number keys on
the symbol layer, which I use with <kbd>❖ Super</kbd> to switch workspaces,
and media control keys, as well as the key to switch to my steno
layer.</p>

<section id="stenography">
  <h3>Stenography <a href="#stenography">§</a></h3>
  
    <p><span>I</span> haven’t focused too much on stenography yet, since I’m still getting
up to speed with the base layout, but with help from
<a href="https://github.com/captdeaf">Ira Cooper</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/captdeaf">Greg Millam</a> I did add support to the
Svalboard and to Keybard for generating and configuring steno keycodes
using <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/features/stenography">QMK’s steno
support</a>, so the Svalboard works out of the box with Plover — connect
it to the Svalboard’s emulated <code>/dev/ttyACM</code> device, set up
stenography keys on your Svalboard, and you should be good to go.</p>

    <p><span>A</span> big reason I bought the Svalboard in the first place is because the
super-light tactile keys with low travel, combined with its full N-key
rollover, should be excellent for steno, and so far my experiments
have borne this out.  There are two main caveats I’ve found that I’ve
had to somewhat mitigate in my steno layout.  Neither seems
insurmountable, but I need to experiment with different options to
figure out how to make something that’s sufficiently expressive but
still comfortable.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Svalboard has only one ‘column’ per finger, while the stenotype
traditionally has an extra column on the outside for the <kbd>＊
Star</kbd> modifier on the left, which is easily emulated with the
outwards lateral, and the <kbd>–D</kbd> <kbd>–Z</kbd> terminals on the right,
which are not.  Fundamentally, the steno layout allows the little
finger to press up to four keys at once while the Svalboard only
allows combos of up to three. Thankfully, some combinations of the
four (like <span><kbd>–T</kbd>+<kbd>–D</kbd>+<kbd>–S</kbd></span> or <span><kbd>–T</kbd>+<kbd>–Z</kbd></span>) are inadmissible, so if we
make sure that we can type each of the adjacent two-key combinations
and then the four-key combination we should be okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The centre/south combination, which seemed like the most obvious
mapping of the stenotype layout onto the Svalboard, is pretty
difficult to do consistently due to the angles of the keys involved.
I have two workarounds for this, and I’m not yet sure which I
prefer: either using the centre key as a steno combo key,
e.g. <kbd>PW–</kbd>, or eschewing the centre keys entirely for the
inwards lateral key as the upper row of the stenotype.  Each has its
own advantages and disadvantages: using the laterals requires
tilting either the keyboard or the wrist to make the neutral
position (with fingers on both ‘rows’) natural, while using
combination keys exacerbates the <kbd>–D</kbd>/<kbd>–Z</kbd> problem: the
rightmost cluster would need 6 keys to represent it uniformly with
combinations, but it has only five.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

</p>
<p>Figure 9. The standard American Stenotype layout, used by default by Plover.  Contrast with the Svalboard layout above.</p>
</div>

    <p><span>E</span>ither way, it’s clear to me that I at least need combo keys for the
vowels: the only two thumb-cluster keys that can be combined
comfortably enough for steno are the inward keys, and constantly
performing that lateral motion makes my thumbs hurt pretty quickly.
I’ve chosen the thumb knuckle and pad keys for the steno inner and
outer vowels, as the easiest thumb keys for me to hit, with the centre
key for their combination.</p>
</section>
<section id="pointing">
  <h3>Pointing <a href="#pointing">§</a></h3>
  
    <p><span>T</span>he Svalboard comes (optionally) with real pointing devices on each
hand, and the default firmware supports a ‘mouse layer’ on the highest
layer (15) that is automatically switched to when a pointer event is
detected, and switched away from when a press of a key not on the
mouse layer is detected.  The default configuration has the mouse
layer time out after inactivity, as well; I found this very
unpredictable, and it led to me making a lot of mode errors.  It can
be configured or disabled with a special keycode that can be bound in
Vial or Keybard.  I use two trackballs, one for pointing and one for
scrolling, but I’m looking forward to switching at least one of them
to a trackpad as soon as the trackpad gets smooth-scrolling support,
since the ability to use trackpad gestures like tap-for-click frees up
a bunch of key space (and maybe removes the need for mouse mode at
all?).  When gaming, to avoid accidental mouse-mode switches, I
usually remove the left trackball altogether.</p>

<section id="retrospective">
  <h2>Retrospective <a href="#retrospective">§</a></h2>
  
    <p><span>O</span>verall, I find the Svalboard ticks all my boxes for a keyboard, and
if you can afford the money and the time investment I’d definitely
recommend giving it a go.  Typing is a lot more comfortable for me
now, and there are no downsides big enough to make me want to switch
back.</p>

    <p><span>I</span>t took me six months to achieve 80 WPM, but I think it would be a lot
faster if adapting an existing layout that you’re familiar with.  I
don’t recommend switching keyboard layouts at the same time, unless
you wanted to switch layout anyway.  Even though it can be fun, it
will likely only hinder your adoption of the keyboard, and doesn’t
come with any particular benefits. 

<label for="sidenote:33"></label>
<span>Benefits, that is, over switching layouts before or after switching keyboards — the ergonomic advantages of modern layouts, especially if you’re a <abbr>QWERTY</abbr> user, are well-documented, and I won’t repeat them here, though they are probably somewhat diminished for a keyboard that reduces <em>all</em> finger motion anyway.</span>  I’ve noticed a logarithmic pattern to my speed
improvements: I hit 20 WPM within the first week, and 40–50 WPM in the
first month, which is a bit painful but good enough to get things done
with.  By the second or third month I no longer felt like my keyboard
was imposing a large additional mental load on me and instead I felt
like it was just a bottleneck through which I have to squeeze my
thoughts — which has been my experience with all keyboards, even when
I was typing at 120 WPM.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>hough I’m still quite slow, and the Svalboard doesn’t try to sell
itself on improving typing speed, I see steady improvement in my
typing speeds as I use it more, and I don’t see any reason I shouldn’t
be able to match or exceed my typing speeds on slab keyboards while
enjoying significantly better typing comfort.  My hands feel much less
tired at the end of a day, though it’s important to note that this is
only the case after I’d spent quite some time adjusting the keyboard
to my typing habits and my typing habits to the keyboard.
Particularly, figuring out my typing posture and keyboard mounting
setup made a world of difference.</p>

    <p><span>I</span>n addition to the practical aspects, and despite the earlier warning,
it’s been pretty fun getting back into the world of crazy keyboard
layout optimizations, and I’ve discovered a lot about how I learn
physical skills and learnt to pay attention to aspects of how I use
computers that I would never have considered.</p>

    <p><span>F</span>inally, this post wouldn’t be complete without a shout-out to the
Svalboard Discord community, who have helped me a lot on my journey
both with hardware and software.</p>

    <p><span>H</span>appy typing!</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>It’s not that anyone ever said sophisticated math problems can’t be solved by teenagers who haven’t finished high school. But the odds of such a result would have seemed long.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06137">a paper posted on February 10</a> left the math world by turns stunned, delighted and ready to welcome a bold new talent into its midst. Its author was <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hannah-cairo/">Hannah Cairo</a>, just 17 at the time. She had solved a 40-year-old mystery about how functions behave, called the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture.</p>
<p>“We were all shocked, absolutely. I don’t remember ever seeing anything like that,” said <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/oliveira-itamar">Itamar Oliveira</a> of the University of Birmingham, who has spent the past two years trying to prove that the conjecture was true. In her paper, Cairo showed that it’s false. The result defies mathematicians’ usual intuitions about what functions can and cannot do.</p>
<p>So does Cairo herself, who found her way to a proof after years of homeschooling in isolation and an unorthodox path through the math world.</p>
<h2><strong>A World Without Bounds</strong></h2>
<p>Cairo grew up in Nassau, the Bahamas, where her parents had moved so that her dad could take a job as a software developer. She and her two brothers — one three years older, the other eight years younger — were all homeschooled. Cairo started learning math using Khan Academy’s online lessons, and she quickly advanced through its standard curriculum. By the time she was 11 years old, she’d finished calculus.</p>
<p>Soon she had consumed everything that was readily available online. Her parents found a couple of math professors to tutor her remotely — first Martin Magid of Wellesley College, then Amir Aazami from Clark University. But much of her education was self-directed, as she read and absorbed, on her own, the graduate-level math textbooks that her tutors recommended. “Eventually,” Cairo recalled, Aazami “said something like, he feels uncomfortable being paid, because he feels like he’s not really teaching me. Because mostly I would read the book and try to prove the theorems.”</p>

    <p>But Cairo found homeschooling confining.</p>
<p>“There was this inescapable sameness, in a way. No matter what I did, I was in the same place doing mostly the same things,” she said. “I was very isolated, and nothing I could do could really change that. I’d wake up on certain days and realize, I’m just older.”</p>
<p>Math became a kind of escape, a space that felt expansive when her daily life was not.</p>
<p>“Mathematics was another world I could explore. A world that was not confining, a world I could access at any point just by thinking about it,” she said. “That’s how I grew up, thinking about mathematics as this world of ideas that I can explore on my own. That sort of process helped me see math differently than a lot of people.”</p>
<p>In 2021, amid the Covid pandemic, Cairo’s world began to widen, even as it was narrowing for so many others. Travel restrictions stranded her family at her grandparents’ house in Chicago. While they were there, she joined the Math Circles of Chicago, where teachers and students gather to solve difficult problems together.</p>
<p>The experience led her to apply the following year to a two-week online summer program run by the Berkeley Math Circle, which has nurtured some of the most exceptional math talent in the world. In her application, she listed a set of self-taught subjects that together comprised the equivalent of an advanced undergraduate math degree. She was 14 years old.</p>

    <p>“Hannah is above and beyond the ordinary,” said <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~stankova/">Zvezdelina Stankova</a>, a mathematician at Berkeley and the founder of the Berkeley Math Circle. “Every time she applies for school or a program, she is several levels ahead.”</p>
<p>Yet these scattered experiences never convinced Cairo that she had exceptional mathematical ability. She is soft-spoken, open and humble, and seems genuinely unsure of how her ability stacks up against anyone else’s — in part because for years her only reference point was herself.</p>
<p>“Growing up, I didn’t really know if I was talented,” she said. “I like to play piano, and people around me would tell me that I was really talented at math and at piano. And in retrospect, now that I look at it, I can see, sure, my piano was above average. But it was by no means exceptional. While on the other hand, it looks like mathematically I’m, like, whatever.”</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Her Place</strong></h2>
<p>In 2023, after a second summer with the Berkeley Math Circle, Cairo wondered what her next step should be. She had already applied to several universities, and while most schools rejected her — she hadn’t finished high school yet — she was accepted by the University of California, Davis. Should she start her undergraduate studies three years early? Or should she pursue educational opportunities elsewhere?</p>
<p>Stankova encouraged her to instead participate in Berkeley’s concurrent enrollment program, where she could take graduate-level math courses from leading researchers in the field.</p>

                            <p>The math world was taken aback when Cairo announced her counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture — both because it settled a major open problem, and because Cairo was still in high school at the time.</p>

    <p>Cairo followed this advice. In the fall of 2023, her family moved to Davis, 60 miles northeast of Berkeley. There, her older brother enrolled as a freshman at UC Davis, and her parents allowed her to commute to Berkeley on Tuesdays and Thursdays. By the spring, she was going five days a week and taking several more classes. She recalls it as a time in her life when she began to feel full of possibility.</p>
<p>“I had started making friends, and I was feeling good,” she said. After the spring semester ended, her family moved from Davis to Berkeley — her brother had decided to transfer there — and Cairo finally felt able to settle in.</p>
<p>Even so, it was an adjustment. “I didn’t have many social experiences, so I still had to learn how to interact with other humans,” she said.</p>
<p>As the 2024–2025 academic year neared, Cairo considered what courses she would take. One class in particular caught her eye — a graduate course in Fourier restriction theory, a branch of harmonic analysis. “It was one of the most advanced analysis classes being offered that semester, so I thought, I’ll just go take it,” she said.</p>

<p>The professor for the course was <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ruixiang-zhang">Ruixiang Zhang</a>, an accomplished mathematician whose path into the field had followed a more traditional arc: a gold medal at the 2008 International Mathematical Olympiad, the prestigious high school competition; a doctorate from Princeton University; a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study; a tenure-track position at Berkeley, one of the top math departments in the world.</p>
<p>Cairo emailed Zhang, asking to enroll. “Hannah was very focused and seemed to be passionate about the topic,” he said. “This attitude alone is enough for me, so I just gave her permission.”</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, while working on a problem set, she came across a problem that she couldn’t stop thinking about.</p>
<h2><strong>Extra Credit</strong></h2>
<p>The problem was a simplified version of the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture. Zhang had included it in one of his homework assignments as a warm-up, hoping to encourage students to practice advanced techniques in a deep area of math. The assignment also included an optional extension, inviting them to consider whether the proof they’d found for the simplified case could be extended to more complicated formulations of the problem.</p>
<p>Cairo completed the problem set and took Zhang up on the invitation to keep thinking. To her, it seemed natural to follow the thread of an idea as far as it would go. “Why would I stop?” she said.</p>
<p>The Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture is a problem in harmonic analysis, a field that studies how functions are assembled from wavelike components.</p>
<p>Any given function can be written as the sum of simpler wavelike pieces, called sine waves. Each of those sine waves, in turn, has a frequency. Mathematicians often want to understand the nature of functions that can only be built out of sine waves with certain frequencies. In these cases, the only permitted frequencies are those that satisfy equations that carve out specific surfaces, like a sphere. That’s because the functions that define many physical waves — such as light, sound and quantum particles — are restricted to these kinds of frequencies.</p>

                            <p>To Cairo, “mathematics was another world I could explore. A world that was not confining, a world I could access at any point just by thinking about it,” she said.</p>

    <p>The Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture considers functions built out of waves whose frequencies lie on such a surface. It states that the energy of the function — a measure of how big the function gets — can only be spread out and concentrated in particular patterns.</p>
<p>It’s as if you’re playing music in a strangely shaped room. Sometimes, the music might echo and amplify, getting very loud. But when that happens, it can only happen in certain spots.</p>
<p>Over the decades, mathematicians made limited progress on a few special cases of the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture. But the general problem remained wide open. None of the standard methods seemed able to touch it. That imperviousness made some mathematicians suspect that the conjecture was false; others felt that its elegance made it more likely to be true.</p>
<p>“Some mornings, I’d wake up with the idea that because it’s so simply and elegantly stated, and it’s so broad, in the end it had to be true,” said Tony Carbery, a mathematician at the University of Edinburgh who worked on the problem for decades. “Other mornings, I’d wake up and say … it can’t possibly be true in any simpleminded way.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians found themselves at an impasse.</p>
<h2><strong>Exceeding Limits</strong></h2>
<p>In the path toward a proof of any hard problem, there’s a lot of doubt. Mathematicians doubt their approaches, doubt their intuitions, doubt that the idea they’re following — so promising in the moment — will actually hold up.</p>
<p>In Cairo’s case, those doubts were amplified. She was new to the field, and her early efforts to prove the full conjecture were tentative and incomplete. She questioned whether she was headed in the right direction. So did Zhang.</p>

    <p>“I went to office hours and asked him, ‘Do these ideas work?’ It turned out they didn’t because they were silly,” she said. “There’d be this back-and-forth. I’d come to office hours with new ideas and ask if they work. And he’d say no.”</p>
<p>Cairo kept reading and thinking. Eventually, she found a way to construct a strange, complicated function out of waves whose frequencies all lay on a curved surface — the type of surface the conjecture required. Usually, when you add these kinds of waves together, they interfere, canceling each other out in some places and reinforcing each other elsewhere.</p>
<p>But Cairo showed that in her function, they didn’t cancel out as expected. Instead, their interference created uneven patterns, causing the function’s energy to spread out over some areas and concentrate in others in a fractal-like way that the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture prohibited. She found herself staring at a mathematical construction that by many accounts shouldn’t exist.</p>
<p>At first it made her wary. “This is something that happens to me often,” she said. “I come to something that looks like a proof, and I think I have a proof, but [then] I’ve actually been wrong.”</p>
<p>Then two things happened. The first was that she realized she could replace her complicated construction with a much simpler one and achieve the same result.</p>
<p>The other was that she convinced herself, and Zhang, that the result was right.</p>
<p>“Cairo’s paper is a great example of how natural and elegant conjectures can fail in ways we didn’t think of,” Oliveira said. “But to see that, we need to look through the right lenses.”</p>
<h2><strong>A New Landscape</strong></h2>
<p>The proof, and its unlikely author, have energized the math community since Cairo posted it in February. “I was absolutely, ‘Wow.’ This has been my favorite problem for nigh on 40 years, and I was completely blown away,” Carbery said. “When I found out [Cairo] was much younger than I previously thought, I was much more impressed. The elegance with which the paper is written is quite extraordinary.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians are excited about how Cairo’s work will inspire new research. “I am certain that, from now on, whenever we come upon a problem of similar flavor, we will try to test it against Cairo-like constructions,” Oliveira said.</p>
        
        
<p>He and others in the harmonic analysis community will also have to reckon with a changed landscape. In harmonic analysis, there’s a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-tower-of-conjectures-that-rests-upon-a-needle-20230912/">constellation of questions</a> about how the energy of a wave concentrates. If a conjecture known as Stein’s conjecture were true, it would cement connections between some of the most important questions in that broader constellation. But Cairo’s work shows that Stein’s conjecture is false. It eliminates one of the most promising links mathematicians had hoped to establish between different parts of harmonic analysis.</p>
<p>The math world is also adjusting to the fact of Cairo herself. After completing the proof, she decided to apply straight to graduate school, skipping college (and a high school diploma) altogether. As she saw it, she was already living the life of a graduate student. Cairo applied to 10 graduate programs. Six rejected her because she didn’t have a college degree. Two admitted her, but then higher-ups in those universities’ administrations overrode those decisions.</p>
<p>Only the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University were willing to welcome her straight into a doctoral program. She’ll start at Maryland in the fall. When she finishes, it will be her first degree.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>Linda Martin found out the hard way that the most powerful law enforcement agency in the U.S.—the FBI—can seize your assets without articulating why. Worse: Law enforcement took her savings in a raid that was itself unconstitutional. Worse still: A lawsuit she filed met its demise last week, allowing the federal government to continue the dubious practice of taking people's valuables without having to explain the reason it is justified in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span>The agency never did furnish a specific reason in Martin's case—because she wasn't charged with a crime. Her saga began in 2021, when the FBI sought to take more than $100 million in assets from U.S. Private Vaults, a business that offered safe-deposit boxes. That company was suspected of, and ultimately charged with, criminal wrongdoing. But the warrant expressly </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g/#document/p10"><span>forbade</span></a><span> agents from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure" of customers' boxes, like Martin's.</span></p>
<p><span>They did so anyway, rummaging through approximately 800 of them and seizing assets that belonged to a <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/11/fbi-raid-safety-deposit-boxes-los-angeles-jennifer-paul-snitko-85-million-civil-forfeiture/">slew of innocent people.</a> That included Travis May, who stored gold and $63,000 in cash; Jeni Verdon-Pearsons and Michael Storc, who kept $2,000 in cash, as well as approximately $20,000 worth of silver; Paul and Jennifer Snitko, whose box contained personal items, like marriage, birth, and baptismal certificates; and Don Mellein, who had invested in gold coins, many of which the FBI said it lost (to the tune of over $100,000).</span></p>
<p><span>A federal court later ruled that the bureau's actions <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/23/appeals-court-fbis-safe-deposit-box-seizures-violated-fourth-amendment/">violated the Fourth Amendment</a>. </span><span>But it was too late for Martin, who received notice that the FBI had taken $40,200, her life savings, from her box. To justify that, the notice listed hundreds of federal crimes that would lead to a seizure. As Institute for Justice (I.J.) Director of Media Relations Andrew Wimer </span><a href="https://x.com/andrewwimer/status/1948831860622053716"><span>points out</span></a><span>, that included things like copyright infringement and doing business with North Korea. But the bureau notably did not specify how Martin was supposedly connected to any of those offenses, because it is not required to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>So she sued. "When the FBI attempts to forfeit someone's property, due process requires that it say why, citing </span><i><span>specific facts and laws</span></i><span>," reads her appellant </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CADC-15-Brief-of-Appellant.pdf"><span>brief</span></a><span>. "By sending notices that initiate and, often, consummate property's forfeiture—all without ever saying what exactly the FBI thinks justifies the forfeiture, the FBI deprives owners of crucial information they need to protect their rights." After she filed the lawsuit, and about two years post-seizure, the agency returned Martin's cash. But she continued in court in hopes that the judiciary would agree that the FBI was violating people's due process rights by seizing assets with effectively no explanation.</span></p>
<p><span>That died last week, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia </span><a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2025/07/24-5144-2126635.pdf"><span>dismissed</span></a><span> the suit for lack of jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span>"The FBI took Linda's savings without clearly saying what she did wrong. That shouldn't happen in America, but taking on the entrenched federal civil forfeiture system is challenging," said Bob Belden, an attorney at I.J. (which represented Martin), in a statement via email. "Unfortunately, there is not a clear path to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. We know that several Justices are alarmed at how civil forfeiture works in America and hope that the right case will work its way to the Court."</span></p>
<p><span>Robert Frommer, a senior attorney at I.J., </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/03/20/the-fbi-seized-this-womans-life-savings-without-telling-her-why/"><span>told</span></a><span> me in March that "without specific notice, property owners can't understand what this is all about, and therefore can't do any investigation or get meaningful advice from attorneys." That helps explain, he says, why the agency is so successful at avoiding scrutiny for its seizures. "Owners must decide whether to fight against the federal government, default, or plead for mercy, all without knowing why the FBI is doing this to them," he says. "It's therefore little surprise that 93% of federal forfeitures never get to a court, meaning the FBI gets to keep the money without ever telling anyone why they should be allowed to"—which, at least for now, will remain the status quo.</span></p>

<em>An observation on Software Engineering</em>

<p>Put succinctly, the observation is this:</p>
<blockquote>With a sufficient number of users of an API,<br>
it does not matter what you promise in the contract:<br>
all observable behaviors of your system<br>
will be depended on by somebody.</blockquote>

<p>Over the past couple years of doing low-level infrastructure migrations in one of the most complex software systems on the planet, I’ve made some observations about the differences between an interface and its implementations.  We typically think of the interface as an abstraction for interacting with a system (like the steering wheel and pedals in a car), and the implementation as the way the system does its work (wheels and an engine).  This is useful for a number of reasons, foremost among them that most useful systems rapidly become too complex for a single individual or group to completely understand, and abstractions are essential to managing that complexity.</p>

<p>Defining the correct level of abstraction is a completely separate discussion (see Mythical Man-Month), but we like to think that once an abstraction is defined, it is concrete.  In other words, an interface should theoretically provide a clear separation between consumers of a system and its implementers.  In practice, this theory breaks down as the use of a system grows and its users start to rely upon implementation details intentionally exposed through the interface, or which they divine through regular use.  Spolsky’s “Law of Leaky Abstractions” embodies consumers’ reliance upon internal implementation details.</p>

<p>Taken to its logical extreme, this leads to the following observation, colloquially referred to as “The Law of Implicit Interfaces”: Given enough use, there is no such thing as a private implementation.  That is, if an interface has enough consumers, they will collectively depend on every aspect of the implementation, intentionally or not.  This effect serves to constrain changes to the implementation, which must now conform to both the explicitly documented interface, as well as the implicit interface captured by usage.  We often refer to this phenomenon as "bug-for-bug compatibility."</p>

<p>The creation of the implicit interface usually happens gradually, and interface consumers generally aren’t aware as it’s happening.  For example, an interface may make no guarantees about performance, yet consumers often come to expect a certain level of performance from its implementation.  Those expectations become part of the implicit interface to a system, and changes to the system must maintain these performance characteristics to continue functioning for its consumers.</p>

<p>Not all consumers depend upon the same implicit interface, but given enough consumers, the implicit interface will eventually exactly match the implementation.  At this point, the interface has evaporated: the implementation has become the interface, and any changes to it will violate consumer expectations.  With a bit of luck, widespread, comprehensive, and automated testing can detect these new expectations but not ameliorate them.</p>

<p>Implicit interfaces result from the organic growth of large systems, and while we may wish the problem did not exist, designers and engineers would be wise to consider it when building and maintaining complex systems.  So be aware of how the implicit interface constrains your system design and evolution, and know that for any reasonably popular system, the interface reaches much deeper than you think.</p>

<h3>Who's Hyrum?</h3>
<p>I'm a Principal Scientist at Adobe, and before that, a software engineer at Google.  I work on large-scale code change tooling and infrastructure, and spent several years improving Google's core C++ libraries.  The above observation grew out of experiences when even the simplest library change caused failures in some far off system.</p>

<p>While I may have made the observation, credit goes to Titus Winters for actually naming it as "Hyrum's Law" and popularizing the concept more broadly.</p>
