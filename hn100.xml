								<p>The death of competition spells doom for regulation. Competition is an essential component of effective regulation, for two reasons: First, competition keeps the companies within a sector from all telling the same lie to its regulators. Second, competition erodes companies’ profits and thus starves them of the capital they need to overpower or outmaneuver their regulators.</p><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p>
<p>While not all regulation is wise or helpful, a world without regulation is a catastrophe. That’s because, in a highly technological world, your ability to do well (or even to live out the day) requires that you correctly navigate innumerable highly technical questions that you can’t possibly answer.</p>
<p>You need to know whether you can trust the software in your car’s antilock braking system, whether you should heed your doctor’s advice to get vaccinated, whether the joists over your head at home are sufficient to keep the ceiling from falling in and killing you, and whether your kids’ schooling is adequate or likely to turn them into ignoramuses.</p>
<p>Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law.</p>
<p>It’s not that you lack the intellect and discernment to answer each of these questions. You’re a smart cookie. Given enough time, you could get a PhD’s worth of education in software engineering, cell biology, material science, structural engineering, and pedagogy; investigate each of the offerings before you in each of these categories; and make an intelligent choice that reflects your priorities and the trade-offs you’re willing to make.</p>
<p>The problem is that it would take you several lifetimes to acquire all that knowledge, and long before you could do so, you’d be killed by food poisoning because you guessed wrong about whether you could trust the hygiene policies at your local diner.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_1 -->
</div>
<p>It would be nice if you could let markets take care of these questions for you, but many of the consequences of wrong answers don’t manifest fast enough to steer your decision-making. Sure, if a private school turns one of your kids into an ignoramus, you can demand your money back and refuse to send your other kids to that school—but your kid is <em>still</em> an ignoramus. Likewise, you can punish a restaurant that gives you food poisoning by withholding your future custom, but if that’s a <em>lethal</em> poisoning, the fact that you don’t eat at that restaurant anymore isn’t quite the moral victory you might be hoping for.</p>
<p>To navigate all of these technical minefields, you need the help of a third party. In a modern society, that third party is an expert regulator who investigates or anticipates problems in their area of expertise and then makes rules designed to solve these problems.</p>
<p>To make these rules, the regulator convenes a truth-seeking exercise, in which all affected parties submit evidence about what the best rule should be and then get a chance to read what everyone else wrote and rebut their claims. Sometimes, there are in-person hearings, or successive rounds of comment and counter-comment, but that’s the basic shape of things.</p>
<p>Once all the evidence is in, the regulator—who is a neutral expert, required to recuse themselves if they have conflicts—makes a rule, citing the evidence on which the rule is based. This whole system is backstopped by courts, which can order the process to begin anew if the new rule isn’t supported by the evidence created while the regulator was developing the record.</p>
<p>This kind of adversarial process—something between a court case and scientific peer review—has a good track record of producing high-quality regulations. You can thank a process like this for the fact that you weren’t killed today by critters in your tap water or a high-voltage shock from one of your home’s electrical outlets.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_2 -->
</div>
<p>One key advantage of the process is that it relies on competitors to counter one another’s claims. The reinforced steel joist manufacturer that claims that only its products are suitable for use in high-rise apartment buildings will have to defend those claims against competitors who submit their own structural engineering and material science evidence. Regulators don’t need to look for holes in the arguments advanced by interested parties; they only need to assess the quality of the criticisms raised by other commenters who submit to the docket.</p>
<p>This process isn’t just a way to prevent corporate executives from cheating the public by knowingly overpromising about their own products or denigrating their rivals’; it’s also a way to stop firms that have tricked <em>themselves</em> from fooling the rest of us, too. As with the scientific method, the safeguards of peer review help us catch grubby attempts at both deception and <em>self</em>-deception, because it’s <em>very</em> easy to talk yourself into a sincere belief that you are right and everyone else is wrong.</p>
<p>This process works well on “disorganized” sectors composed of many firms that compete hard with one another. When hundreds of companies are all at one another’s throats, they suffer from a collective action problem—the same force that keeps users from leaving services like Facebook.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies find it impossible to agree on almost <em>anything</em>, including where to have a meeting in which they could discuss what line they are going to feed their regulator. They probably can’t even agree on how to cater that meeting.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies are a disorganized rabble. They can’t come to accord, and even if they could, a truly competitive sector produces smaller profits for each company (since one of the best ways to compete is by lowering prices to attract new customers and raising wages to attract the best workers). That leaves very little surplus capital with which to pursue regulatory adventures.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_3 -->
</div>
<p>But when a sector dwindles to five companies—or four, or three, or two, or just one—the collective action problem is annihilated by the inevitable coziness among the executives of the incestuous industries.</p>
<p>After all, the executives in an industry dominated by a handful of firms are apt to have worked at most or all of the companies in the sector. They know one another, came up together, and are part of one another’s social milieu.</p>
<p>Not only do concentrated industries find it easier to converge on a set of policy priorities and maintain message discipline while bargaining with their regulators, they also have a lot to bargain <em>with</em>. Concentrated sectors tend to have Mafia-style demarcations of turf. (Think of Pope Alexander VI dividing up the “New World” in 1494, of cable companies carving up the map of the United States into exclusive fiefdoms, or of Apple taking an annual $20 billion-plus payment from Google in exchange for not making its own search engine.)</p>
<p>This prevents “wasteful competition” and allows these companies to amass gigantic war chests that they can mobilize to win their policy priorities.</p>
<p>A hundred companies are a mob, a rabble. Five companies are a cartel.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_4 -->

<p>“Regulatory capture”—when a company suborns its regulator and teams up with it to screw over customers, rivals, and suppliers—starts with a regulator that is weaker than the company it is supposed to be watchdogging. The pro-monopoly policies of the past forty years have produced <em>gigantic</em> companies that find it easy to unite against their regulators, even as the deregulatory policies over the same period have starved regulators of the resources they need to fight back. The inevitable result is regulatory capture.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Regulatory capture has two faces: On the one hand, a captured industry is able to flout regulations that are meant to prevent it from harming the public, its employees and other stakeholders, and the environment. On the other hand, regulatory capture creates a <em>coalition</em> between the regulated industry and its regulators. They form a team and work together to enforce rules against other industries, startups, foreign adversaries, and so on. Regulatory capture isn’t the same as <em>underregulation</em>; rather, it is the combination of <em>underregulation</em> (for the industry that has effected the capture) and <em>overregulation</em> (against that industry’s enemies).</p>
<p>Tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.”</p>
<p>The most common tactic used to flout regulation is to break the law with an app and then insist that the law hasn’t been broken at all, because the crime was committed with an app.</p>
<p>Sometimes literally (as Uber does when it argues that it’s not an employer because it directs its workers with an app) and sometimes figuratively. Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law. (“It’s not an illegal unregulated hotel, it’s an Airbnb!”)</p>
<p>Riley Quinn, showrunner for the excellent <em>Trashfuture</em> podcast, says that whenever you hear the word <em>fintech</em> (financial technology), you should mentally substitute <em>unregulated bank</em>.</p>
<p>App-based lending platforms ignore usury law and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app. Cryptocurrency hustlers illegally trade in unregistered securities and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app.</p>
<p>When Uber entered the taxi market without securing taxi licenses or extending the workforce protections required under law, it said the move didn’t count because it did it with an app.</p>
<p>The McDonald’s-backed company Plexure sells surveillance data on you to vendors, who use it to raise the price of items when they think you’ll pay more. In its promotional materials, Plexure uses the example of charging extra for your breakfast sandwich on payday. It says that such practices are not a rip-off because they’re done with an app.</p>
<p>RealPage gives “recommendations” to landlords about the minimum rents they should charge for all the apartments in your neighborhood, raising rents and worsening the housing crisis. The company says it’s not price-fixing because it’s done with an app.</p>
<p>On the subject of the housing crisis, Airbnb is racing to convert all the rental stock in your city into an unlicensed hotel room, but it says the conversion doesn’t count because it’s done with an app.</p>
<p>The legal regime for apps really <em>is</em> different from the rules governing web pages. Thanks to intellectual property laws that ban “circumvention,” companies that embed undesirable anti-features in apps can use the law to destroy rivals that disenshittify their offerings.</p>
<p>In other words, tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.”</p>

						<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
					</div><div lang="en" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text"><p>The <b>Ortega hypothesis</b> holds that average or mediocre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientists" title="Scientists">scientists</a> contribute substantially to the advancement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hess_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hess-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>The Ortega hypothesis is widely held,<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> but a number of systematic studies of scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citations" title="Citations">citations</a> have favored the opposing "Newton hypothesis", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s statement that he "stood on the shoulders of giants").<sup id="cite_ref-Hess_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Hess-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>  Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology" title="Criminology">criminology</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Oromaner_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Oromaner-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data.<sup id="cite_ref-MacRoberts_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-MacRoberts-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics.<sup id="cite_ref-Kretschmer_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kretschmer-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoerman_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hoerman-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results.<sup id="cite_ref-Goudsmit_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Goudsmit-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-eponym_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-eponym-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results.<sup id="cite_ref-Goudsmit_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-Goudsmit-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>The name of the hypothesis refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset" title="José Ortega y Gasset">José Ortega y Gasset</a>, who wrote in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolt_of_the_Masses" title="The Revolt of the Masses">The Revolt of the Masses</a></i> that "astoundingly mediocre" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science.<sup id="cite_ref-Ortega_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ortega-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geniuses" title="Geniuses">geniuses</a> create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> drew upon the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" title="Ernst Mach">Ernst Mach</a> to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone.<sup id="cite_ref-Szava_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Szava-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The "Ortega hypothesis" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as "mechanical work of the mind" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it.<sup id="cite_ref-Szava_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-Szava-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/blog/feed-reader-deep-dive">https://lighthouseapp.io/blog/feed-reader-deep-dive</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45517134">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RSS feeds and, in one form or another, feed readers, have existed for more than 20 years. Their main purpose is enabling their users to consume content from various sources in one place. And especially in recent years, also helping users deal with content overload.</p>
<p>Back then there were only a handful of relevant products. Today it's different, there are products for many different situations and use-cases. When first getting into RSS and feed readers, it can be difficult to find out which of this wide range of products are the right ones to use.</p>
<p>This article describes the landscape so you can find out which product fits best for your use-case.</p>
<p>Side-note: I'm using RSS as a synonym for all web feed standards (Atom, JSON Feed)</p>
<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>I attempted a classification of feed readers based on 2 axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment model</strong>: local (phone or PC), browser extension, self-hosted, hosted</li>
<li><strong>Business model</strong>: free, one-time payment, SAAS</li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment model is based on where data is stored and feed fetching happens. Some products have a web app and mobile apps, but feed fetching happens on the server. In this case it's classified as <code>hosted</code>.</p>
<p>The business model categorization is based on the cheapest option that gives access to the full feature set of the product. A self-hostable product with a hosted option is categorized into <code>free</code>. A freemium SAAS product is categorized as <code>paid (SAAS)</code>.</p>

<h2>Hosting models</h2>
<h3>Browser extension</h3>
<p>Feed readers deployed as browser extensions can be installed through the respective stores of the browsers, usually either the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/">Chrome Web Store</a> or the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox Add-ons</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Setup typically only requires installing the extension, not even an account is needed. There is no maintenance required beyond the occasional update, which usually happens automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Data is stored locally, with browser storage functionality (local storage or IndexedDB). How much data can be stored depends on the storage of the device. Browser extensions can only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#unlimited_storage">store</a> as much data as the browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/local">allows itself to use</a>. But for most users this is easily enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the device itself. Because the extension only runs if the browser runs, feeds are only fetched if the browser is open. This can lead to missed posts, depending on the publishing frequency of the feed and how often the browser is active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Since all data is stored on the device, by default it's available only on the device where the extension is installed. If users enable it, the extension supports it, and the user is signed in, browsers can sync data to other devices that have the extension. Storing all data on the device also means that it is accessible offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Extensions can integrate deeply with the browser, and offer features like automatic feed finding of visited websites. Extensions can also provide a comprehensive feature set. Their only limitations are more compute-intensive features (e.g. requiring machine learning), or features that require special infrastructure to run (e.g. emails).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products (free)</h4>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Free</th>
<th>Paid (one-time)</th>
<th>Paid (SAAS)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li><a href="https://nodetics.com/feedbro/">Feedbro</a></li></ul></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>In this category I only found one product. <a href="https://github.com/SmartRSS/Smart-RSS">Smart-RSS</a> was another one, but was discontinued in February.</p>
<h3>On-device</h3>
<p>On-device products are separate applications and installed on the device you want to use them. Either on your iOS or Android phone or tablet, or on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. They fetch feeds and store data on that device.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: In general setup is done by installing the application. Some products may require an account, but that is not the norm. Maintenance is similar to browser extensions, the occasional updates. Some applications require manual update installations, others do that automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Data is stored locally on the device, which gives total control over the data. The maximum amount of feeds and articles stored only depend on the available storage of the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the device. For that to happen the application must be running. Some products may implement a background fetching service, in that case only the device must be turned on. Similar to browser extensions, this limitation may lead to missed posts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Typically the data of on-device feed readers are only available on the device where it's installed. Data sync would need to be done manually or via operating system specific mechanisms (e.g. iCloud), which not all products support. Since data is stored on the device, it's also available offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: On-device products can use the full computing power of the device. Combined with the comparatively small storage requirements of one user, it means that some features can be significantly faster than other categories. The exact features depend on the application, and mobile apps are typically less powerful than desktop apps. Limitations are only features that require multiple users (e.g. recommendations) or specific infrastructure (e.g. newsletter subscriptions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<h3>Self-hosted</h3>
<p>Self-hosted products all fall into the open-source and free category. They are designed to be installed on a server to run continuously, though it is possible to install them on a PC as well. They fetch feeds and store data on the server, and make it available through a web interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Setup requires a server, installing the application, and depending on how it should be accessible, possibly also domain and reverse proxy setup. This needs significantly more technical knowledge than the other options, but with ChatGPT (or others) it should be possible also for fairly non-technical people. This setup is generally more complex with more failure points than the other options, but with a correct setup failures happen rarely, if at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: The application stores data on the server it runs on. Since users control their server, they also have total control over the data stored on it. Applications typically use well-established databases, which allows users to inspect and change data with common tools. The amount of data that can be stored is only limited by the available storage on the server. Most servers start at 20 GB, which is enough for most feed reading use-cases. Often, storage can be dynamically extended if more space is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the server. Since it runs continuously, there is no break in feed fetching, and even high frequency feeds are no problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: The application and all its data is accessible from any device with a web browser by navigating to the server's URL. Data is stored on the server, therefore automatically synced between all devices that use it, but also require internet access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: On average self-hosted products have a wider feature set than browser extension or on-device feed readers. There is no theoretical limit on the feature set, but typically they keep the infrastructure as simple as possible, to keep setup and maintenance straightforward. This makes them slightly less powerful than hosted alternatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<p>Self-hosted products are all open-source and free. The only costs are for the server, and the cheapest VPS plans start at ~2$/month.</p>
<h3>Hosted</h3>
<p>Hosted feed readers are managed services. It's required to create an account to get access to them. All of them are paid SAAS products, and most offer a free plan.</p>
<p>On average they have the most polished user experience and most comprehensive feature sets, since they're backed by companies that invest in continuous development.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Beyond creating an account, no setup is required. The same for maintenance. Service providers make sure the products work as intended, and deal with everything required to keep the service running, including infrastructure setup, monitoring, backups, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Since data is stored on the servers and databases of the company running the product, users don't have direct control. But through laws like GDPR users have the right to export all their data, or request deletion. Storage is essentially unlimited, though most products have limits to avoid abuse. These limits are mentioned on their pricing page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Similar to self-hosted products, feeds are fetched on the server, which runs continuously and ensures that even high-frequency feeds don't pose a problem. The fetching interval is usually dynamic, based on the popularity of a feed and the publishing frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Hosted products are primarily available as web application, and some offer native apps as well. Since data is stored on the server, it's natively synced between devices. Some hosted feed readers also offer offline support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Hosted feed readers serve many customers at the same time, which makes it necessary to have more complex infrastructure setups. This also enables features that other types of products cannot do, like email receiving, recommendations, or historic feed contents. Consequently hosted options are generally more powerful than other categories, though the specific feature set depends on the product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<p>All hosted products are SAAS products and charge monthly. <code>Folo</code> is an outlier, they currently don't have any paid features, but the terms of service indicate that this will come in the future. At that point it will join the others in the <code>Paid (SAAS)</code> category.</p>
<h2>App support and offline access for products that don't offer it natively</h2>
<p>Many of the self-hosted or hosted products don't provide apps or offline access by themselves. However, with the right setup, it's still possible to access the articles offline.</p>
<p>Most of these products provide APIs. This can be a proprietary API, or an API based on the old Google Reader API.</p>
<p>Mobile apps, for example ReadKit or Fiery Feeds, can not only subscribe to feeds, but also connect to other products through their APIs. They download contents, store them locally, and sync changes back to the connected products.</p>
<p>These apps make it possible to use a native mobile app for products that don't provide an app themselves, and get offline access at the same time.</p>
<p>FreshRSS, for example, has a <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/blob/edge/README.md#apis--native-apps">list of native apps</a> that support it.</p>
<h2>A note on newsletters</h2>
<p>Newsletters are a growing mechanism for delivering (blog) content. Some, but not all, hosted feed readers support newsletters out of the box. But on-device products can't do that at all because of their infrastructure limitations.</p>
<p>Even if a feed reader doesn't support newsletters by itself, it's still possible to get newsletters into the feed reader, through services that convert newsletters into RSS feeds.</p>
<p>These services generate an email address and give you a corresponding feed URL. Emails to the generated address are added to the feed as new entry. So after signing up to the newsletter and adding the feed URL, the newsletter is added to the feed reader even without native email support.</p>
<p>Services that do this are <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a> and the <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/newsletter-to-rss">Lighthouse Newsletter to RSS tool</a>. Both are free.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<p>The descriptions highlight the defining and unique aspects of the products, for the full feature list please go to their respective websites. Where available I used the screenshots for their websites, to represent the products as best as possible (test account screenshots wouldn't be as good).</p>
<h3>NetNewsWire (on-device, free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> is a free, on-device feed reader for Mac and iOS. By default it stores data on the device itself, but can sync via iCloud and using other products as storage. And it provides a Safari extension for easy feed-adding. Notably, it supports AppleScript, which makes it possible to automate certain workflows.</p>

<h3>Fiery Feeds (on device, paid SAAS)</h3>
<p>Fiery feeds is a Mac and iOS app. The download is free, and to get the premium features it costs ~15$/year (varies by region). By default it stores data on the device itself, but can sync via iCloud and using the API of other products (e.g. FreshRSS). The main distinguishing features are the customization options of the app, like custom themes.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="6" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="783" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from voidstern.net/fiery-feeds</p>
<h3>Reeder (on-device, SAAS)</h3>
<p>The current version of <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> is a Mac and iOS app. The download is free, and to get the premium features it costs ~10$/year. The previous version of Reeder, now called <a href="https://reederapp.com/classic/">Reeder Classic</a>, is still available as one-time purchase. It also stores data on-device, and can sync via iCloud.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature is the unified timeline, which includes RSS, podcasts, social media, and more.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1604" height="968" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from App Store Reeder page</p>
<h3>FreshRSS (self-hosted, free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a> is a self-hosted feed reader and once set up, it's available as a web app. It is quite powerful, and in addition to normal feed subscriptions offers WebSub as well. It's possible to customize it with themes and extensions, and it's translated into more than 15 languages.</p>
<p>Together with Miniflux they're the most-recommended self-hosted options.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="2454" height="1251" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffreshrss.f7bbd93e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffreshrss.f7bbd93e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from freshrss.org</p>
<h3>Miniflux</h3>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> is a self-hosted feed reader as well, and available as web app after setup. It's focus is on staying simple and fast instead of adding fancy features. It also offers a hosted version, which is 15$/year and has a 15 day trial period.</p>
<p>Together with FreshRSS they're the most-recommended self-hosted options.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="756" height="483" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from miniflux.app</p>
<h3>Folo (hosted, free)</h3>
<p>Folo is a relatively new product developed by the creators of RSS Hub. It's a free hosted feed reader, with apps available for every major platform. Their <a href="https://folo.is/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> suggest that at some point they will charge a monthly fee for some premium features, but at the time of writing there were no paid features.</p>
<p>Folo is also open-source and therefore theoretically self-hostable, but I haven't found documentation for it.</p>
<p>It has a huge feature set, including newsletter support, transforming websites into feeds, AI summaries, and much more.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1287" height="686" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><h3>Feedly (hosted, SAAS)</h3>
<p><a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader">Feedly</a> is the most widely-known product and has the most users of all feed readers. It has a comprehensive features set, and offers a free plan as well. For the past couple of years, it seems that Feedly has focused more on AI features and enterprise customers, but their core product remains solid.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1427" height="775" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from feedly.com/news-reader</p>
<h3>Inoreader</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> is the second most widely-known product, after Feedly. It too offers a free plan. Their feature list is impressive, with social media support for subscriptions, automation and AI features, public API and integrations. And of course much more.</p>
<p>What stands out on Reddit are complaints about price hikes. Though Inoreader probably has tens or hundreds of thousands of users who don't have issues and think the product is great.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1519" height="855" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finoreader.28b7d07f.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finoreader.28b7d07f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Finoreader.28b7d07f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from inoreader.com</p>
<h3>Readwise Reader</h3>
<p><a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> is a relatively new product, from the creators of the original <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>. It's a great feed reader, though were it really shines is the reading experience. They also have reading views for PDFs, eBooks, and more.</p>
<p>The website mentions that it's in beta, but it has been in beta for years now and at this point is a stable product, and has been for awhile.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1205" height="807" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from readwise.io/read</p>
<h3>Tiny Tiny RSS</h3>
<p>Tiny Tiny RSS deserves an honorable mention in this list. It was, and still is, used by many, and has been for a long time, and was often recommended on the RSS subreddit.</p>
<p>On October 3rd the maintainer <a href="https://community.tt-rss.org/t/the-end-of-tt-rss-org/7164">announced</a> that he's going to stop working on it, and will remove all infrastructure on November 1st. Forks of the project with other maintainers may pop up, but at the moment it's too soon to tell what the future of Tiny Tiny RSS will be.</p>
<h3>Lighthouse</h3>
<p><a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/">Lighthouse</a> is also a relatively new product. It's in beta, which refers to the fact that it doesn't yet have all features necessary to fulfill its vision, which goes beyond simple feed reading.</p>
<p>The main differentiator is that it focuses on articles over feeds, and has a separate view for curating articles (the inbox). It's focused on finding high-value content.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="686" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><h2>Similar product categories</h2>
<p>Feed readers are powerful products, which require manual setup to make them work well. Subscribing to feeds is mandatory, adding tags, filtered views, and rules can make them work even better. But for some use-cases, other product categories are simpler and might work better.</p>
<h3>News aggregators</h3>
<p>News aggregators automatically collect and curate news from a large variety of sources. They usually provide some customization options, but focus on news and don't allow arbitrary feed subscriptions like feed readers do.</p>
<p>They focus on providing an overview of the most relevant news stories.</p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://kite.kagi.com/">Kagi News,</a> <a href="https://ground.news/">Ground News</a>, and <a href="https://www.smartnews.com/">SmartNews</a>.</p>
<h3>Reading lists</h3>
<p>Reading lists, also called read-it-later apps, are for saving and organizing links you found somewhere on the web. Many feed readers can do the same, but reading lists are optimized for that purpose.</p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a>. <a href="https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep">Karakeep</a> is a self-hosted option.</p>
<h2>How to choose</h2>
<p>For most people, going with one of the hosted products is the best option. They're generally the most polished and most powerful products, owing to the fact that they have companies behind them with full-time engineers. They generally also offer a free plan, so if you stay within the limits of those, they will even be free to use.</p>
<p>For more specific requirements, products of the other categories can work better. They have different characteristics, and can work better in some situations. For example, if you want total control over your data, self-hosted options are the way to go.</p>
<p>It's probably easiest to first decide on the category, and then check out multiple products, or maybe even try them out. Virtually all products support OPML import and export, so moving feed subscriptions from one product to the next is almost zero effort.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>Let me test out a theory here: If you're into emulation, you're into older video games, ergo you're into <em>old stuff</em> of all kinds. That means you, savvy, good-taste-having reader, will love this spread of photos I took in Tokyo last week at the National Film Archive of Japan, which has a small but lovely set of exhibits from the history of Japanese film.

And it's coming late in the day Sunday — apologies! But patience pays off!!</p><p>This issue's main story has been cookin' for a minute: last month the news landed that MAME had finally properly cracked Hyper Neo Geo 64 support, but the celebration was a little bit premature. The arcade system was playable in MAME, yes, but sound was in really shoddy shape — it wasn't yet a particularly good experience. </p><p>Over the last month or so that's been changing, and changing fast, with frequent improvements checked in by a pair of regular MAME contributors. So <em>now</em> is the time to talk about it, and <em><strong>soon</strong> </em>(with the very next MAME release!) it will be time to actually play it. Considering there are only seven Hyper Neo Geo 64 games, well, that's a week's worth of evenings sorted.</p><p>As with every trip to Tokyo I took a few hours to stop by Akihabara this time, but its pull has certainly lessened over the years as retro prices have skyrocketed from where they were a decade ago and the selection has gotten thinner and thinner. Still, browsing the stores is a fun time and there are great finds to be found as long as you're not looking for anything too in-demand. I picked up one game: Kamiwaza, a PS2 "stealth" game where you play as a thief in feudal Japan stealing hella stuff.</p><p>As you might guess, it's more silly than stealthy.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFLNxNU-54E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Kamiwaza PS2 Gameplay HD (PCSX2 v1.7.0)"></iframe></figure><p>Shout out to my shopping partner in crime, Paradise Killer's Oli Clarke Smith, for the recommendation. I've got a feature on the way in the coming weeks over at PC Gamer based on some of the games we picked up and how they speak to the "identity" of particular retro consoles. I'm hoping it'll be a fun read! </p><p>For now, let's hop into MAME; then stick around for an update on Pioneer LaserActive emulation!</p><div><p>💸</p><p><i><em>If you enjoy </em></i><i><b><strong>ROM</strong></b></i><i><em>, I'd love it if you'd consider </em></i><a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/#/portal/support"><i><b><strong>a small tip</strong></b></i></a><i><em> to help me cover my monthly costs.

"When I started looking at the system back in 2004 MAME didn't really do much 3D stuff at all, even things like the MIPS (main CPU) core were in a much rougher shape, there were no dumps of the I/O MCU at all (happened only a few years ago) and the PC I had at the time barely had enough memory to load and decode even the 2D graphics," he says. </p><p>"It was also pre-YouTube, and even in the early days of YouTube you didn't really get much in the way of good reference material. Kinda crazy to think that a lot of people who are probably interested in the emulation of the platform now as younger adults weren't even born when emulation work first started on it!"</p><p>A few weeks ago, two decades after he started looking into the system, Haywood finally promoted it to "working" status in MAME. But that move was a bit of a formality, or a bit sneaky, depending on how you look at it. Though the promotion got some buzz, it wasn't truly finished: proper sound emulation was still missing. Haywood actually hadn't worked on the core since 2023, and decided, well, people had been playing the games for long enough without sound, he might as well slap the "working" label on. It turned out to be the final push other MAME contributors needed to take a crack at tuning up the sound.</p><p>What's the Hyper Neo Geo's whole deal, anyway? Well, it makes some sense that the system would be more a curiosity for younger folks to discover than an object of intense nostalgia like some of MAME's more high-profile cores or the original Neo Geo; it was only active in arcades for two years from 1997 to 1999 during the awkward transitional period to 3D, with just seven games released for it:</p><ul><li>Road's Edge</li><li>Samurai Shodown 64</li><li>Xtreme Rally</li><li>Beat Busters: Second Nightmare</li><li>Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage</li><li>Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition</li><li>Buriki One</li></ul><p>Here's a nice write-up of the system from Nicole Express that delves into the hardware: </p><figure><a href="https://nicole.express/2021/ultra-mega-hyper-neo-geo-64.html?ref=readonlymemo.com"><div><p>The failed heir: The Hyper Neo Geo 64!</p><p>In 1982, Commodore International introduced the technology world to the concept of 64.

Haywood's initial investigation into it predated even MAME's high profile support of Capcom's CPS3 boards, for instance, but once that platform was decrypted support was added quite quickly because hell yeah people wanted to play Street Fighter III. By comparison, "Hyper64 has been a 21 year on-and-off slog," he says.</p><p>It's a perfect representation one of the eternal frustrations of emulation development: People often ask why no one's working on something when they actually are. Just invisibly.</p><blockquote>"The sheer number of times I picked up the Hyper64 driver and pumped weeks of work in it only to not be able to make any progress at all was frustrating at the best of times. Just trying to gain an understanding of it all, but ending up not making any headway at all.  That's something I don't think people really appreciate when it comes to emulation, the amount of time that you have to put in which often yields no positive results at all, where all you can really conclude is it doesn't work the way you were hoping it would work." </blockquote><p>A few years ago, Haywood finally made substantial progress: Someone dumped the I/O microcontroller, and he was able to write a CPU core to emulate it. "The inputs finally started working in a bunch of the games, which allowed me to explore them further and make video improvements," he said. </p><p>"Other components improving in MAME over the years has really helped too.  When I started MAME didn't have a CPU core for the V53 either (which is a V33 CPU with variolus peripherals) and is the CPU driving the sound DSP.  At some point in MAME's history the V53 support got fleshed out (for other systems) which has really come in handy now, as proper sound emulation requires that to be running properly."</p><p>When Haywood marked the platform as working, it caught the attention of another longtime MAME contributor: R. Belmont. For the last month or so, Belmont, as well as two other devs, Happy and O. Galibert, have been chipping away at making the games sound like they're supposed to. </p><p>"Haze marking them working did provide a push, and Happy had done a detailed disassembly of the sound CPU program which was quite useful," Belmont recently posted on Reddit. Belmont and Galibert have both been working on synthesizer support in MAME, and the Hyper Neo Geo 64's sound chip happens to be used it one, providing them with some convenient overlap in interest/speciality. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVrXnV33cjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Hyper NeoGeo 64 Sound Improvements for MAME 0.282 (from O.Galibert &amp; R.Belmont)"></iframe></figure><p>The current MAME release, 0.281, includes a series of rapid-fire improvements as documented by Belmont in a few videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKrXtzndXmw&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">on YouTube</a>:</p><ul><li>"Very early work in progress on better audio for the Hyper Neo Geo 64 system.  There is a loooong way to go, this is just some very basic fixes so far."</li><li>"Since the first video we've got the basic sample starts and stops working the actual correct way they're supposed to and added a preliminary support for volume envelopes, which also helps the audio balance.  Still a lot of work to go though."</li><li>"More progress today!  I figured out how the volume envelopes really work, and that made Buriki One's intro mostly awesome."</li><li>"Barring any last minute adjustments, this is what HNG64 audio will sound like in MAME 0.281. Since the last video, the per-voice low pass filter was added, which cleans up some of the high frequency 'hash' audible previously and makes the sound a bit cleaner."</li></ul><p>It was a ton of progress for a month, taking Hyper Neo Geo 64 sound support from messy and inaccurate to, at least, broadly playable without assaulting your ears. But the real refinements have been coming in just the last few days since 0.281's release in late September.</p><p>But the next build is gonna be the big one. October's upcoming MAME 0.282 release will notably fix up the audio issues in one of the the trickiest games, Xtreme Rally, while really polishing up the rest. Here's what Belmont's noted in update notes for 0.282 so far: </p><ul><li>"Olivier Galibert figured out how they squeezed 12 bits of dynamic range into 8 bits (presumably this is the format from Roger Linn's original MPC60 design) and replaced the biquad low-pass filter with a more likely Chamberlin one that fits the parameters better. Also there were some improvements to the filter envelope. All this results in much clearer and higher-fidelity sound."</li><li>"This time we've figured out how looping samples actually work, fixed the final mixdown to not introduce any distortion, and fixed the filter envelope. The result? A dramatic improvement to Beast Busters Second Nightmare's intro."</li><li>"So the previous fixes seem to have solved Samurai Shodown 64 and SS64 2, but Xtreme Rally (aka Off Beat Racer) was still extremely broken. The engine sound barely worked, sounds were missing, and some sounds would stick looping forever. This time the problem wasn't actually in the sound emulation itself; Xtreme Rally has unique code among the 7 HNG64 games that tries to push sound commands to the sound CPU as quickly as possible. This resulted in as many as 2/3rds of the commands getting dropped on the floor. I have fixed that issue so that all of the commands make it, and Xtreme Rally now sounds great."</li></ul><p>Since Belmont made that post he dialed in a few more improvements where the wrong sounds were playing in certain instances in the game. Here's a video from Haywood showing off the vastly improved audio (though he notes "some graphical issues, such as the fog in the tunnel still need addressing eventually.")</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9P8_u6lRIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Hyper NeoGeo 64 &quot;Xtreme Rally&quot; Sound Improvements for MAME 0.282 (from R.Belmont)"></iframe></figure><p>Once MAME 0.282 releases, the Hyper Neo Geo 64 will well and truly be worthy of the "working" label. Turns out it just needed that last little push.</p><p>In a perfect encapsulation of how these sorts of collaborative projects come together, Galibert noted on Reddit that despite their contributions to the core stemming from an interest in emulating synthesizers, "amusingly, the synth itself (MPC3000) is not working at all yet." Some parts of the synthesizer remain undumped and undocumented, just as parts of the Hyper Neo Geo once were; sometimes while you're waiting for all the pieces to fall into place, it turns out one of the pieces you do have happens to fit into another puzzle entirely.</p><p>"It's just been a long slow process," Haywood said. "Things have inched forward a little bit over the years, and the surrounding code in MAME has become better / more capable, allowing for more progress to be made, step by step."</p><hr><h3 id="2-cant-stop-pioneering-nec-support-and-big-laseractive-performance-improvements-arrive-in-the-latest-ares-nightlies">2.

It took less than three weeks. While you can grab the <a href="https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/releases/download/nightly/ares-windows-x64.zip?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">nightly build</a> anytime, when the next stable build of Ares releases, it'll be all official-like.</p><p>Considering the bulky size of the LaserActive game rips — they can take up dozens of gigabytes — some performance optimizations Nemesis has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/pull/2241?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">in the last few days</a> are almost as exciting as the second console support. Because now you should be able to run the images off a decent HDD without performance issues. Here's the breakdown on Github:</p><blockquote>"This change brings speed enhancements to LaserActive games. The linear resampling coefficient precalculation reduces overall CPU overhead by approximately 30%, making slower CPUs much more likely to achieve full framerate. Additionally, frame prefetch using a background thread makes games much more tolerant of IO latency, making it possible to play games back from platter drives over SATA3.<p>This should be sufficient to make emulation performance acceptable on 95%+ of systems, and I don't have any further optimizations planned at this stage."</p></blockquote><p>So then — LaserActive support is more or less feature complete. What can you play? What <em>should</em> you play?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-10-08</p><section><p>10 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1zaMttyutjMsqHUuEpCss3/8b7eb27d92e5fc53f6541d04fe0b778f/Bug_Bounty.png" alt=""><div><p>Every second, 84 million HTTP requests are hitting Cloudflare across our fleet of data centers in 330 cities. It means that even the rarest of bugs can show up frequently. In fact, it was our scale that recently led us to discover a bug in Go's arm64 compiler which causes a race condition in the generated code.</p><p>This post breaks down how we first encountered the bug, investigated it, and ultimately drove to the root cause.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="investigating-a-strange-panic">Investigating a strange panic</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We run a service in our network which configures the kernel to handle traffic for some products like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/"><u>Magic Transit</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-wan/"><u>Magic WAN</u></a>. Our monitoring watches this closely, and it started to observe very sporadic panics on arm64 machines.</p><p>We first saw one with a fatal error stating that <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c0ee2fd4e309ef0b8f4ab6f4860e2626c8e00802/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566"><u>traceback did not unwind completely</u></a>. That error suggests that invariants were violated when traversing the stack, likely because of stack corruption. After a brief investigation we decided that it was probably rare stack memory corruption. This was a largely idle control plane service where unplanned restarts have negligible impact, and so we felt that following up was not a priority unless it kept happening.</p><p>And then it kept happening.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h4 id="coredumps-per-hour">Coredumps per hour</h4>
      
    </p>
    
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7ohMD2ph3I9l7lbZQWZ4xl/243e679d8293565fc6a55a670c9f3583/BLOG-2906_2.png" alt="BLOG-2906 2" width="1999" height="526" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>When we first saw this bug we saw that the fatal errors correlated with recovered panics. These were caused by some old code which used panic/recover as error handling.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, our theory was:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>All of the fatal panics happen within stack unwinding.</p></li><li><p>We correlated an increased volume of recovered panics with these fatal panics.</p></li><li><p>Recovering a panic unwinds goroutine stacks to call deferred functions.</p></li><li><p>A related <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259"><u>Go issue (#73259)</u></a> reported an arm64 stack unwinding crash.</p></li><li><p>Let’s stop using panic/recover for error handling and wait out the upstream fix?</p></li></ol><p>So we did that and watched as fatal panics stopped occurring as the release rolled out. Fatal panics gone, our theoretical mitigation seemed to work, and this was no longer our problem. We subscribed to the upstream issue so we could update when it was resolved and put it out of our minds.</p><p>But, this turned out to be a much stranger bug than expected. Putting it out of our minds was premature as the same class of fatal panics came back at a much higher rate. A month later, we were seeing up to 30 daily fatal panics with no real discernible cause; while that might account for only one machine a day in less than 10% of our data centers, we found it concerning that we didn’t understand the cause. The first thing we checked was the number of recovered panics, to match our previous pattern, but there were none.

            <p>Now we could observe some clear patterns. Both errors occur when unwinding the stack in <code>(*unwinder).next</code>. In one case we saw an intentional<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566"> <u>fatal error</u></a> as the runtime identified that unwinding could not complete and the stack was in a bad state. In the other case there was a direct memory access error that happened while trying to unwind the stack. The segfault was discussed in the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259#issuecomment-2786818812"><u>GitHub issue</u></a> and a Go engineer identified it as dereference of a go scheduler struct, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536"><u>m</u></a>, when<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L458"> <u>unwinding</u></a>.&nbsp;  </p>

    </p>
    <p>Go uses a lightweight userspace scheduler to manage concurrency. Many goroutines are scheduled on a smaller number of kernel threads – this is often referred to as M:N scheduling. Any individual goroutine can be scheduled on any kernel thread. The scheduler has three core types – <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L394"><code><u>g</u></code></a>&nbsp; (the goroutine), <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536"><code><u>m</u></code></a> (the kernel thread, or “machine”), and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L644"><code><u>p</u></code></a> (the physical execution context, or&nbsp; “processor”). For a goroutine to be scheduled a free <code>m</code> must acquire a free <code>p</code>, which will execute a g. Each <code>g</code> contains a field for its m if it is currently running, otherwise it will be <b>nil</b>. This is all the context needed for this post but the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/HACKING.md#gs-ms-ps"><u>go runtime docs</u></a> explore this more comprehensively.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point we can start to make inferences on what’s happening: the program crashes because we try to unwind a goroutine stack which is invalid. In the first backtrace, if a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L446"><u>return address is null, we call </u><code><u>finishInternal</u></code><u> and abort because the stack was not fully unwound</u></a>. The segmentation fault case in the second backtrace is a bit more interesting: if instead the return address is non-zero but not a function then the unwinder code assumes that the goroutine is currently running. It'll then dereference m and fault by accessing <code>m.incgo</code> (the offset of <code>incgo</code> into <code>struct m</code> is 0x118, the faulting memory access). </p><p>What, then, is causing this corruption? The traces were difficult to get anything useful from – our service has hundreds if not thousands of active goroutines. It was fairly clear from the beginning that the panic was remote from the actual bug. The crashes were all observed while unwinding the stack and if this were an issue any time the stack was unwound on arm64 we would be seeing it in many more services. We felt pretty confident that the stack unwinding was happening correctly but on an invalid stack.&nbsp;</p><p>Our investigation stalled for a while at this point – making guesses, testing guesses, trying to infer if the panic rate went up or down, or if nothing changed. There was <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259"><u>a known issue</u></a> on Go’s GitHub issue tracker which matched our symptoms almost exactly, but what they discussed was mostly what we already knew. At some point when looking through the linked stack traces we realized that their crash referenced an old version of a library that we were also using – Go Netlink.</p>

    </p>
    <p>In the prehistoric era of Go (&lt;=1.13) the runtime was cooperatively scheduled. A goroutine would run until it decided it was ready to yield to the scheduler – usually due to explicit calls to <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> or injected yield points at function calls/IO operations. Since<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime"> <u>Go 1.14</u></a> the runtime instead does async preemption. The Go runtime has a thread <code>sysmon</code> which tracks the runtime of goroutines and will preempt any that run for longer than 10ms (at time of writing). It does this by sending <code>SIGURG</code> to the OS thread and in the signal handler will modify the program counter and stack to mimic a call to <code>asyncPreempt</code>.</p><p>At this point we had two broad theories:</p><ul><li><p>This is a Go Netlink bug – likely due to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> usage which invoked undefined behavior but is only actually broken on arm64</p></li><li><p>This is a Go runtime bug and we're only triggering it in <code>NetlinkSocket.Receive</code> for some reason</p></li></ul><p>After finding the same bug publicly reported upstream, we were feeling confident this was caused by a Go runtime bug. However, upon seeing that both issues implicated the same function, we felt more skeptical – notably the Go Netlink library uses unsafe.Pointer so memory corruption was a plausible explanation even if we didn't understand why.</p><p>After an unsuccessful code audit we had hit a wall. The crashes were rare and remote from the root cause. Maybe these crashes were caused by a runtime bug, maybe they were caused by a Go Netlink bug. It seemed clear that there was something wrong with this area of the code, but code auditing wasn’t going anywhere. </p>

      <h2 id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>At this point we had a fairly good understanding of what was crashing but very little understanding of <b>why</b> it was happening. It was clear that the root cause of the stack unwinder crashing was remote from the actual crash, and that it had to do with <code>(*NetlinkSocket).Receive</code>, but why? We were able to capture a <b>coredump</b> of a production crash and view it in a debugger. The backtrace confirmed what we already knew – that there was a segmentation fault when unwinding a stack. The crux of the issue revealed itself when we looked at the goroutine which had been preempted while calling <code>(*NetlinkSocket).Receive</code>.&nbsp;    </p>

            <p>The goroutine was paused between two opcodes in the function epilogue. Since the process of unwinding a stack relies on the stack frame being in a consistent state, it felt immediately suspicious that we preempted in the middle of adjusting the stack pointer. The goroutine had been paused at 0x555577cb2880, between<code> ADD $80, RSP, RSP and ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), RSP, RSP</code>.&nbsp;</p><p>We queried the service logs to confirm our theory. This wasn’t isolated – the majority of stack traces showed that this same opcode was preempted. This was no longer a weird production crash we couldn’t reproduce. A crash happened when the Go runtime preempted between these two stack pointer adjustments. We had our smoking gun.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>At this point we felt pretty confident that this was actually just a runtime bug and it should be reproducible in an isolated environment without any dependencies.

            <p>This function ends up with a stack frame slightly larger than can be represented in 16 bits, and so on arm64 the Go compiler will split the stack pointer adjustment into two opcodes.

            <p>A reproducible crash with standard library only? This felt like conclusive evidence that our problem was a runtime bug.</p><p>This was an extremely particular reproducer! Even now with a good understanding of the bug and its fix, some of the behavior is still puzzling. It's a one-instruction race condition, so it’s unsurprising that small changes could have large impact. For example, this reproducer was originally written and tested on Go 1.23.4, but did not crash when compiled with 1.23.9 (the version in production), even though we could objdump the binary and see the split ADD still present! We don’t have a definite explanation for this behavior – even with the bug present there remain a few unknown variables which affect the likelihood of hitting the race condition.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>arm64 is a fixed-length 4-byte instruction set architecture. This has a lot of implications on codegen but most relevant to this bug is the fact that immediate length is limited.<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2020-12/Base-Instructions/ADD--immediate---Add--immediate--"> <code><u>add</u></code></a> gets a 12-bit immediate,<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0802/a/A64-General-Instructions/MOV--wide-immediate-"> <code><u>mov</u></code></a> gets a 16-bit immediate, etc. How does the architecture handle this when the operands don't fit? It depends – <code>ADD</code> in particular reserves a bit for "shift left by 12" so any 24 bit addition can be decomposed into two opcodes. Other instructions are decomposed similarly, or just require loading an immediate into a register first.&nbsp;</p><p>The very last step of the Go compiler before emitting machine code involves transforming the program into <code>obj.Prog</code> structs. It's a very low level intermediate representation (IR) that mostly serves to be translated into machine code.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/fa2bb342d7b0024440d996c2d6d6778b7a5e0247/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/obj7.go#L856

</code></pre>
            <p>In the larger stack case, there is a point between <code>ADD x, RSP, RSP</code> opcodes where the stack pointer is not pointing to the tip of a stack frame. We thought at first that this was a matter of memory corruption – that in handling async preemption the runtime would push a function call on the stack and corrupt the middle of the stack. However, this goroutine is already in the function epilogue – any data we corrupt is actively in the process of being thrown away. What's the issue then?  </p><p>The Go runtime often needs to <b>unwind</b> the stack, which means walking backwards through the chain of function calls. For example: garbage collection uses it to find live references on the stack, panicking relies on it to evaluate <code>defer</code> functions, and generating stack traces needs to print the call stack. For this to work the stack pointer <b>must be accurate during unwinding</b> because of how golang dereferences sp to determine the calling function. If the stack pointer is partially modified, the unwinder will look for the calling function in the middle of the stack. The underlying data is meaningless when interpreted as directions to a parent stack frame and then the runtime will likely crash.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/66536242fce34787230c42078a7bbd373ef8dcb0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L373

if innermost &amp;&amp; frame.sp &lt; frame.fp || frame.lr == 0 {
    lrPtr = frame.sp
    frame.lr = *(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(lrPtr))
}
</code></pre>
            <p>When async preemption happens it will push a function call onto the stack but the parent stack frame is no longer correct because sp was only partially adjusted when the preemption happened. The crash flow looks something like this:  </p><ol><li><p>Async preemption happens between the two opcodes that <code>add x, rsp</code> expands to</p></li><li><p>Garbage collection triggers stack unwinding (to check for heap object liveness)</p></li><li><p>The unwinder starts traversing the stack of the problematic goroutine and correctly unwinds up to the problematic function</p></li><li><p>The unwinder dereferences <code>sp</code> to determine the parent function</p></li><li><p>Almost certainly the data behind <code>sp</code> is not a function</p></li><li><p>Crash</p></li></ol>

</code></pre>
            <p>Once we discovered the root cause we reported it with a reproducer and the bug was quickly fixed. This bug is fixed in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e8794e650e05fad07a33fb6e3266a9e677d13fa8"><u>go1.23.12</u></a>, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6e1c4529e4e00ab58572deceab74cc4057e6f0b6"><u>go1.24.6</u></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f7cc61e7d7f77521e073137c6045ba73f66ef902"><u>go1.25.0</u></a>. Previously, the go compiler emitted a single <code>add x, rsp</code> instruction and relied on the assembler to split immediates into multiple opcodes as necessary. After this change, stacks larger than 1&lt;&lt;12 will build the offset in a temporary register and then add that to <code>rsp</code> in a single, indivisible opcode. A goroutine can be preempted before or after the stack pointer modification, but never during. This means that the stack pointer is always valid and there is no race condition.</p>
            <pre><code>LDP -8(RSP), (R29, R30)
MOVD $32, R27
MOVK $(1&lt;&lt;16), R27
ADD R27, RSP, RSP
RET</code></pre>
            <p>This was a very fun problem to debug. We don’t often see bugs where you can accurately blame the compiler. Debugging it took weeks and we had to learn about areas of the Go runtime that people don’t usually need to think about. It’s a nice example of a rare race condition, the sort of bug that can only really be quantified at a large scale.</p><p>We’re always looking for people who enjoy this kind of detective work. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?department=Engineering"><u>Our engineering teams are hiring</u></a>.   </p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<p>Coming just hours before the partial shutdown of Federal government operations, this hearing was sparsely attended, even by members of the committee, and got little press attention. The hearing opened with the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the committee talking over each other at length.</p>
<p>Much of the argument between Senators and the questioning of witnesses focused not on the general problems of the <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">Quiet Skies</a> traveler surveillance program program or government travel <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/19/put-them-on-the-no-fly-list/">blacklists</a> (referred to euphemistically as “watchlists” throughout the hearing) but on whether these programs have been weaponized to a greater extent under Democratic or Republican administrations.</p>
<p>But if we — and, we hope, members of Congress — can look past the partisan polemics, the <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/examining-the-weaponization-of-the-quiet-skies-program/">testimony</a> and <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.09.30_Final-Hearing-Documents.pdf">documents introduced into the record</a> of this hearing provide important guidance on what can and should be done to protect <strong>all</strong> travelers —&nbsp; regardless of our party affiliation (if any), ethnicity, religious beliefs, or political opinions — against the weaponization of travel blacklists by <em>whatever</em> government is in power.<span id="more-20425"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">Quiet Skies</a> [sic] program assigned officers from the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/videos/inside-look-federal-air-marshal-service">Federal Air Marshals Service</a> (one of the police agencies within the Transportation Security Administration) to accompany and surveil pre-selected airline passengers on flights and in airports.</p>
<p>Quiet Skies is just one of many travel surveillance and blacklisting programs. According to another report by the same Senate committee last yea (under a chair from the opposite side of the aisle), “There are at least 22 different mechanisms that might lead Americans to receive additional screening at airports and other ports of entry or be denied the ability to travel.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">precious whistleblower reports</a> and <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.09.30_Final-Hearing-Documents.pdf">documents obtained by the Senate HSGAC Committee</a> and entered into the record of the hearing last week, Quite Skies targets were selected by a ruleset that incorporated other US government <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/19/put-them-on-the-no-fly-list/">blacklists</a> and <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/08/31/a-broader-legal-challenge-to-federal-blacklists/">watchlists </a>as well as profile-based rules that factored in ethnicity and countries previously visited.</p>

<p>The Quiet Skies program was <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/06/05/secretary-noem-ends-politicized-tsa-watchlist-program-has-failed-prevent-single">ended in June 2025</a> by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noehm.&nbsp; The same day as the Senate hearing on Quiet Skies last week, the TSA&nbsp; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/09/30/dhs-and-tsa-expose-targeting-political-opponents-former-biden">announced</a> that Secretary Noehm was firing five senior TSA officials associated with the Quite Skies program, including the TSA’s executive assistant administrator for operations support and the deputy assistant administrator for intelligence and analysis.</p>
<p>News reports, presumably based on DHS statements, described Quiet Skies as a “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-removes-senior-leaders-over-airline-passenger-watch-list-screening-program-2025-09-30/">Biden-era</a>” program even though <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">its largest expansion came in 2018</a>&nbsp; during the first Trump administration. And according to the TSA’s <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/09/30/dhs-and-tsa-expose-targeting-political-opponents-former-biden">press release</a> last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>The TSA administrator has legal authority to prevent an individual from boarding an aircraft, task Federal Air Marshals with surveilling an individual, or place them on a watchlist, but it is only intended to be used to track and prevent dangerous criminals and terrorists from carrying out attacks on Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>We question whether the TSA Administrator has the authority to prevent someone from traveling by common carrier without getting an order from a judge.&nbsp; And the TSA and DHS have consistently asserted authority and exercised power — legally or not — to blacklist and surveil travelers without needing any suspicion of criminality.</p>
<p>The bipartisanship of violations of the right to travel through blacklisting and watchlisting was brought out in the response of <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Testimony-Ayoub-2025-09-30.pdf">Mr. Abed Ayoub</a>, Executive Director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) to one of the Senators’ questions about the weaponization of watchlists and blacklists against disfavored groups and individuals:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s not a partisan problem. That’s a due process problem. When the government can quietly tag one group, it can quietly tag any group, left, right, neither, just depending on who holds power. The answer is the same for all of us: end the watchlists….</p>
<p>Quiet Skies captures only part of the story. It’s a window into a faulty surveillance architecture. The watchlist isn’t about who you vote for. It’s about whether the government has to prove its case when it takes away your rights….</p>
<p>Our community, for the past quarter of a century, we’re… targeted by all the administrations, so we can tell you the experience under Republican and Democratic administrations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further guidance about what Congress can and should do was provided by another of the witnesses, <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Testimony-Harper-2025-09-30-Final.pdf">Mr. Jim Harper</a>, a Senior Nonresident Fellow of&nbsp; the American Enterprise Institute:</p>
<blockquote><p>We intuitively feel we have the right to travel, and there are cases from the Supreme Court that say you have a right to travel: You can move from one state to another and they can’t deny you Welfare benefits when you get there.</p>
<p>There are other cases: <a href="https://papersplease.org/gilmore/">A man in San Francisco wanted to fly to Washington, DC, to meet with his Representative</a>,&nbsp; and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2023/06/12/tsa-misstates-the-case-law-on-id-to-fly/">said</a> that you don’t have a right to travel on your preferred mode of transportation. They said, no, you can take the train, you can drive, if you want to go to Washington, DC.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/11/22/freedom-to-travel-act-of-2021-introduced-in-congress/">clear right to travel</a> — Americans believe they have it, but the courts haven’t accorded it to them — would give them a position when they went to court.</p></blockquote>
<p>Court cases challenging the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4365955/fikre-v-federal-bureau-of-investigation">no-fly list</a> (ongoing since 2013, and now on remand following a <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2024/03/19/unanimous-supreme-court-rules-that-no-fly-case-can-go-forward/">unanimous favorable Supreme Court decision</a> in 2024) and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7653937/parties/jardaneh-v-barr/">other travel blacklists and watchlists</a> (ongoing <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/08/31/a-broader-legal-challenge-to-federal-blacklists/">since 2018</a>) have been dragged out for years by the government. The government continues to claim that “merely” being delayed for a few hours or days isn’t sufficiently harmful to a traveler’s rights to provide a basis for a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/11/22/freedom-to-travel-act-of-2021-introduced-in-congress/">Freedom to Travel Act</a> that was introduced in 2021 in the House of Representatives would provide both an explicit statutory right to travel by common carrier and a cause of action for violations of that right by government agencies, carriers, or other entities.</p>
<p>We hope Senators and Representatives moved to act on the issues raised in last week’s hearing on the TSA will re-introduce and co-sponsor the <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/11/22/freedom-to-travel-act-of-2021-introduced-in-congress/">Freedom to Travel Act</a> in this session of Congress, hold committee hearings on it, and incorporate it into appropriate omnibus legislation that has a better chance of passage than a standalone bill.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Before we begin, an important clarification. What follows is a horror story based on real events from my career. However, to protect the privacy of the people and companies involved, I have deliberately mixed things up: technologies, contexts, and specific details have been modified or merged with other experiences. I therefore invite you to read this story not as a strict chronicle of a single event, but as an archetype of a widespread problem in the IT world: vendor lock-in and predatory business practices. Any attempt to identify the specific company or software described would lead to an incorrect conclusion.</p><hr><p>When the phone rang, I was in a meeting - so I didn’t answer. But I recognized the number and sent a quick message: </p><blockquote><p>"I’m with a client right now. If it’s not urgent, please send me an email - otherwise I’ll call you ASAP".</p></blockquote><p>The reply, via SMS, left me speechless: </p><blockquote><p>"That’s exactly the problem. I can’t send you an email. Call me as soon as you can".</p></blockquote><p>From that moment on, my perception of a certain kind of world changed forever.</p><hr><p>A few years earlier, a major public institution - let’s call it <em>Agency A</em> - was still running an ancient Exchange mail server. It hadn’t received security updates for ages, the anti-spam was completely ineffective, and the new regulations were clear: embrace Open Source solutions whenever possible.</p><p>They had already received a proposal - expensive but seemingly reasonable - for a managed service, hosted by an external provider, built on an open source mail stack. The company offered a managed version with its own proprietary additions and enterprise support. The catch? The price was absurd, and <em>Agency A</em> already had solid infrastructure - reputable IP classes, redundant datacenters, everything working fine. We had built and maintained that environment for years, and it was still running perfectly.</p><p>The request was simple: <em>“Evaluate this solution, and if it’s suitable, we’ll migrate.”</em>. About 500 active mailboxes, roughly the same number of aliases. Manageable, but far from trivial.</p><p>So I started experimenting. I had heard of that stack before but never used it directly. I deployed it in some non-critical environments - ours, and a few test clients who agreed to try it at a discounted rate. Everything worked flawlessly for almost a year. I began to appreciate its design and flexibility. Confident, I told <em>Agency A</em> we could proceed with a pilot migration.</p><p>We built a new server, deployed the stack, and assigned a few secondary domains for early adopters. The feedback was great - so good that users started pushing for a full migration.<br> The IT team planned carefully: created accounts and aliases, migrated selected mailboxes, and kept the old Exchange server online (hidden, for legacy access).</p><p>The morning after the MX switch I was tense, waiting for trouble - but it never came. A couple of small questions, nothing serious. The internal team handled everything perfectly. It was a success.</p><hr><p>Word spread quickly.</p><p><em>Agency B</em> - smaller, but in some ways more influential - contacted me. They were customers of the same managed-service company that had pitched to <em>Agency A</em>. Once they saw the potential savings (at less than a tenth of the annual cost), the stability, and the freedom of keeping their data on their own servers, they became very interested. Their contract, however, was a five-year deal with automatic renewal - two years left. The legal office said the notice period was six months, so there was time.</p><p>They wanted to prepare silently. Their supplier was known for <em>aggressive commercial behavior</em> and often retaliated when customers tried to leave. So we built everything quietly - users, aliases, test setups - and froze the system, waiting for the official termination notice.</p><p>That day finally came. The notice was sent, about eight months before expiration. Migration would begin upon confirmation of receipt - or the following month at the latest.</p><p>Meanwhile, I learned that <em>Agency C</em> - another institution - was also planning to leave the same provider. They wanted to keep the same software stack for consistency, so I told them about our experience. They asked for a quote, which I prepared (without mentioning <em>Agency B</em>, of course). My margin would have been small, but the project made sense: it was about <em>owning your data</em>, not making money.</p><p>Everything seemed to move smoothly - until that SMS.</p><hr><p>I called back immediately.</p><blockquote><p>"There’s been a problem with the termination" said the IT manager of <em>Agency B</em>.<br> "Somehow they found out what we were doing. There are hidden clauses we didn’t know about, and now we can’t leave - at least not for another five years. They know everything. Even your quote.".</p></blockquote><p>I was stunned. How could they possibly know?</p><p>Minutes later, my phone rang again - <em>Agency C</em> this time. </p><blockquote><p>"Forget the proposal", they said. "They called us. Threatened us, actually. They even mentioned your name and said they might take legal action against you for unfair competition - claiming they’re the only <em>‘authorized’</em> installers of that software. Which is absurd, of course. It’s open source. But our director doesn’t want trouble.".</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, when public money is involved, people prefer avoiding troubles over doing what’s right.</p><hr><p>Something didn’t add up.<br> Then someone at <em>Agency C</em> noticed a clue: a former interim IT manager still had an email client connected via token authentication - with access to all messages. And that person had signed the original contract with the provider years before. Informally questioned, he admitted contacting them "to warn them" but claimed it was harmless. He never mentioned me - supposedly.</p><p>That still didn’t explain how they knew about <em>Agency B</em>’s internal steps. To test a theory, we set a trap: I asked a friend abroad to send <em>Agency B</em> a fake quote, from a company outside the EU.<br> The following Monday, the provider called <em>Agency B</em> and said, "We advise against working with non-EU companies - compliance can get tricky.".</p><p>That strongly suggested it: <strong>it looked as if they might have been reading the emails.</strong></p><p>The IT manager exploded and confronted them. The response was chilling: </p><blockquote><p>"I’m not saying we do - but we could. It’s in the contract. You should read the fine print, especially the unilateral amendment from two years ago.".</p></blockquote><p>That amendment, quietly accepted, included horrifying clauses:<br> - notice period extended from 6 to 12 months<br> - formerly free services could become paid at the provider’s discretion<br> - and, "for security reasons", they could disable any access other than the webmail - which they promptly did.</p><p>All of this happened before the GDPR era, when certain practices could still slip through.</p><hr><p>I tried to contact the company’s owner directly - no reply. Calls, emails, nothing. Their support lines were "not authorized to forward requests". I wanted to confront them about the <em>“not accredited”</em> nonsense and the so-called <em>unfair competition</em>. But bullies never like a fair conversation.</p><p>I urged <em>Agency B</em> and <em>C</em> to investigate - not only legally, but ethically.<br> They were horrified, yes - but in the end, nothing changed.<br> Worse: the provider, invoking that same contract amendment, made previously free features paid ones, increasing their costs by another 30%.<br> Management wasn’t outraged by the abuse - just by the extra expense, "hard to justify in the budget".</p><hr><p>Years later, those directors were gone. The technical staff remained - older, wiser, and determined not to repeat the mistake. They eventually switched providers, though to something "safer", not necessarily better.</p><p>I couldn’t solve that problem. The battle had to come from them, and I would have supported them all the way - not for profit, but for principle.<br> Because when a company that claims to <em>“support open source”</em> behaves like that, we all lose.<br> We all get labeled the same way.</p><p>And that’s the real horror of the story - not the software, but what people do with it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                        <!-- Contentteller Template: publish_teaser_image -->
                        <p><img src="https://www.guru3d.com/data/teaser/226/8042eeca5148cf31ca512f2f80ee2eb8dbb74a/2025-10-08_09_05_51-guru3d.webp" alt="teaser"></p><p>Synology has backtracked on one of its most unpopular decisions in years. After seeing NAS sales plummet in 2025, the company has decided to lift restrictions that forced users to buy its own Synology hard drives. The policy, introduced earlier this year, made third-party HDDs from brands like Seagate and WD practically unusable in newer models such as the DS925+, DS1825+, and DS425+.

That change didn’t go over well. Users immediately criticised Synology for trying to lock them into buying its much more expensive drives. Many simply refused to upgrade, and reviewers called out the move as greedy and shortsighted. According to some reports, sales of Synology’s 2025 NAS models dropped sharply in the months after the restriction was introduced.
                                    </p><p>Now, with the release of <strong>DSM 7.3</strong>, Synology has quietly walked the policy back. Third-party hard drives and <strong>2.5-inch SATA SSDs</strong> can once again be used without triggering warning messages or reduced functionality. Drives from Seagate, WD, and others will work exactly as they did before—complete with full monitoring, alerts, and storage features.</p>
<p>For users, this means more choice and lower costs when building or upgrading a NAS. For Synology, it’s a much-needed course correction after months of backlash. While the company hasn’t publicly admitted fault, it’s clear that sales pressure and community outrage played a major role in reversing the decision.</p>
<p>Critics say the entire episode has damaged Synology’s reputation. The company seemed to believe that after QNAP’s well-known ransomware troubles, it could tighten control of the market without losing customers. Instead, the plan backfired—hard. Many loyal users have since turned to alternative brands or expressed hesitation about buying another Synology product.</p>

<p>Still, the return of open drive support is good news for anyone running a Synology NAS. It restores the flexibility that made the brand so popular in the first place. Whether this move is enough to win back frustrated users remains to be seen, but for now, DSM 7.3 brings a welcome dose of freedom back to the platform.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was almost entirely driven by investment in data centers and information processing technology, according to <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/jason-furman">Harvard economist Jason Furman</a>. Excluding these technology-related categories, Furman <a href="https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284">calculated in a Sept. 27 post on X.com</a> GDP growth would have been just 0.1% on an annualized basis, a near standstill that underlines the increasingly pivotal role of high-tech infrastructure in shaping macroeconomic outcomes.<a href="https://www.cmacrodev.com/the-global-economy-is-on-a-two-way-track/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.cmacrodev.com/the-global-economy-is-on-a-two-way-track/"></a></p><div>



<div><p>Furman’s findings, shared online and echoed by financial analysts including Robert Armstrong of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802"><em>Financial Times</em>‘ Unhedged</a> (the same writer who coined the term “TACO trade’), echo <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/">several months of observations</a> on the remarkable surge in data-center infrastructure. In August, Renaissance Macro Research estimated, to date in 2025, the dollar value contributed to GDP growth by AI data-center buildout had surpassed U.S. consumer spending for the first time ever. That’s remarkable considering <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11657" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11657">consumer spending is two-thirds of GDP</a>.<a href="https://x.com/AllVentured/status/1951770496711934459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/AllVentured/status/1951770496711934459"></a></p><p>Technically, as Furman notes, investment in information-processing equipment and software was only 4% of U.S. GDP for the first half of 2025, yet it also accounted for fully 92% of GDP growth over that period. Furman added it’s probably not the case the U.S. economy would have recorded almost no expansion at all absent this buildout, reasoning that “absent the AI boom we would probably have lower interest rates [and] electricity prices, thus some additional growth in other sectors.

<h2>The ‘mystery’ of the economy</h2>



<p>This surge in technology-led growth comes against a backdrop of wider economic sluggishness and paradoxically strong GDP growth. Job creation has slowed, raising concerns that, absent technology investment, the U.S. economy could have slipped into recession. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html"></a>Other sectors—from manufacturing and real estate to retail and services—contributed little or even detracted from overall output in the first half of 2025. 



</p><p>And yet, as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apollo-global-management/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apollo-global-management/">Apollo Global Management</a> Chief Economist Torsten Sløk has noted, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/us-economy-getting-stronger-not-weaker-apollo-torsten-slok-growth-gdp-spending-jobs/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/us-economy-getting-stronger-not-weaker-apollo-torsten-slok-growth-gdp-spending-jobs/">GDP figures speak of a (statistically) strong economy</a>. 



</p><p>“The consensus has been wrong since January,” Sløk said in a note circulated to clients in early October, adding the average of economists’ forecasts has said the U.S. economy would slow down for nine months consecutively. “But the reality is that it has simply not happened … We in the economics profession need to look ourselves in the mirror.”



</p><p>Furman’s analysis adds to the snarky and accurate observation by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html">Rusty Foster</a> of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.todayintabs.com/">Today in Tabs</a></em>&nbsp;who quipped: “Our economy might just be three AI data centers in a trench coat”—an allusion to the data-center buildout boom and to the cartoon trope/sight gag of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-sight-gag-where-three-small-people-stack-up-in-a-trench-coat-and-pretend-to-be-one-ordinary-size-adult" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-sight-gag-where-three-small-people-stack-up-in-a-trench-coat-and-pretend-to-be-one-ordinary-size-adult">several young boys</a> teaming up to disguise themselves as an adult.</p><p>Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Michael Gapen ventured a guess on Oct. 6 about “the mystery” of the 2025 economy, “between solid spending data and weak hiring.” He argued that it “can be explained by a corporate sector that absorbed the initial cost of tariffs and reduced unit labor costs and profitability rather than raising prices.” 



</p><p>In other words, something that has nothing to do with the data-center buildout that is widely fueling bubble fears, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/jeff-bezos-amazon-openai-sam-altman-ai-bubble-tech-stocks-investing/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/jeff-bezos-amazon-openai-sam-altman-ai-bubble-tech-stocks-investing/">even among Amazon founder Jeff Bezos himself</a>, who insists these data centers are an “industrial bubble” rather than a financial one, and we will all be glad someday to have such incredible computing power at our fingertips with so many hundreds of billions spent. The question of sustainable GDP growth is a separate one.<br></p></div><p><strong>Fortune Global Forum</strong> returns Oct. 26–27, 2025 in Riyadh.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A million-year-old human skull suggests that the origins of modern humans may reach back far deeper in time than previously thought and raises the possibility that <em>Homo sapiens</em> first emerged outside of Africa.</p><p>Leading scientists reached this conclusion after reanalysis of a skull known as Yunxian 2 discovered in China and previously classified as belonging to a member of the primitive human species <em>Homo erectus</em>.</p><p>After applying sophisticated reconstruction techniques to the skull, scientists believe that it may instead belong to a group called <em>Homo longi </em>(dragon man), closely linked to the elusive Denisovans who lived alongside our own ancestors.</p><p>This repositioning would make the fossil the closest on record to the split between modern humans and our closest relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, and would radically revise understanding of the last 1m years of human evolution.</p><p>Prof Chris Stringer, an anthropologist and research leader in human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, said: “This changes a lot of thinking because it suggests that by 1m years ago our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed. It more or less doubles the time of origin of <em>Homo sapiens</em>.”</p><p>The skull was first unearthed in Hubei province in 1990, badly crushed and difficult to interpret. Based on its age and some broad-brush traits, it was assigned as <em>Homo erectus</em>, a group that is thought to have contained direct ancestors of modern humans.</p><p>The latest work used advanced CT imaging, high-resolution surface scanning and sophisticated digital techniques to produce a virtual reconstruction of the skull. The skull’s large, squat brain case and jutting lower jaw are reminiscent of <em>Homo erectus</em>. But the overall shape and size of the brain case and teeth appear to place it much closer to <em>Homo longi</em>, a species that scientists have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/10/jawbone-fossil-builds-richer-image-of-ancient-denisovans" data-link-name="in body link">recently argued</a> should incorporate the Denisovans.</p><p>This would push the split between our own ancestors, Neanderthals and <em>Homo longi</em> back by at least 400,000 years and, according to Springer, raises the possibility that our common ancestor – and potentially the first <em>Homo sapiens</em> – lived in western Asia rather than Africa.</p><p>“This fossil is the closest we’ve got to the ancestor of all those groups,” Stringer said.</p><p>A computational analysis of a wider selection of fossils suggests that in the last 800,000 years, large-brained humans evolved along just five major branches: Asian erectus, heidelbergensis, sapiens, Neanderthals and <em>Homo longi</em> (including the Denisovans).</p><p>“We feel that this study is a landmark step towards resolving the ‘muddle in the middle’ [the confusing array of human fossils from between 1m and 300,000 years ago] that has preoccupied palaeoanthropologists for decades,” Stringer said.</p><p>The findings run counter to some recent analyses based on genetic comparisons of living humans and ancient DNA, meaning the conclusions are likely to be contentious.</p><p>Dr Frido Welker, an associate professor in human evolution at the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the research, said: “It’s exciting to have a digital reconstruction of this important cranium available. If confirmed by additional fossils and genetic evidence, the divergence dating would be surprising indeed. Alternatively, molecular data from the specimen itself could provide insights confirming or disproving the authors’ morphological hypothesis.”</p><p>The findings are published in the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9202" data-link-name="in body link">Science</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">
            

            <div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>Clickbait-y title, I know :D but I stand by it!</p>
<p>I noticed that many people still treat email like some sort of second-class citizen when it comes to personal information, and the urgency here is real.
I think, in today's world where everything is in apps and requires an account, email has become even more important than your <strong>home address</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Your Email Is Your Digital Home</h2>
<p>Think about it for a moment. What would happen to you if you lost access to your email and needed to change it? Now, compare that to changing your home address.</p>
<p>For the second one, maybe you'd need to change some delivery addresses, and update government documents and bills. But that's common practice, and most places probably have procedures to handle that, and it's still not that many places. It's a solvable chore.</p>
<p>Now think if you lost access to your email address. What would you have to do to fix it? Create a new one, fine. But how will you log into all of your apps where the identifier is the email address itself? You need to contact each of the companies through their customer service, which is often painful.</p>
<p>And think how many conversations you would have to have? Uber? Customer service. Netflix? Customer service. YouTube/Google? Customer service. It's just a <strong>nightmare</strong>.</p>
<p>Look at how many important things you are getting today in your emails. Invoices → email. Password resets → email. Security notices → email.</p>
<p>My point here is that email has become our second home address on the internet. And we use that one piece of personal information way more than our normal address these days.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The "How": Taking Control of Your Email</h2>
<p>Okay, so the boring "why" we covered. Now it's the part where I'm showing you how to deal with it.</p>
<p>I will show you how I have it set up.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Get Your Own Domain</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with free email addresses is that they are under someone else's domain, so they have <strong>full control</strong> over your email address.</p>
<p>To fix that, you first need to have your email address under your <strong>own domain</strong>.</p>
<p>For that, you need to find a provider that is well-respected in the "email community." Why? Because the email protocol is quite an interesting case of "we don't ditch old stuff." To properly use email without constant rejection from various email providers, your domain needs to be "known" by them. So, setting up your own email server is, in practice, out of the question.</p>
<p>But you can go, for example, with Google (G Suite/Google Workspace), or with Proton Email, or anything else that is somewhat well known.</p>
<p>I went with G Suite from Google because it comes with a slightly different privacy policy than normal Gmail, and only G Suite offers custom domains in the Google ecosystem. So, to ease myself from having a second, secondary Gmail, I went with this one. But others are also viable options.</p>
<p>Next, you need to follow the instructions of your chosen provider to set up your own email address on your domain. In practice, it will involve setting <strong>DNS MX records</strong> for your domain and some verification.</p>
<p>Oh, and I highly recommend providers that offer a <strong>"catch-all" feature</strong>. This way, you can have one main email address and unlimited <code>&lt;put something here&gt;@yourdomain.com</code> email addresses. It's useful to have it separated, like <code><a href="https://karboosx.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b4dad1c0d2d8ddccf4cddbc1c6d0dbd9d5ddda9ad7dbd9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, but still receive the emails inside the same inbox.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Step 2: The Unbannable Backup</h3>
<p>Now, you have your domain, and your email is under that domain. We don't stop here. Your emails are still inside your email provider. If they block you, you will probably lose access to previous emails, but at least now you have the option to just switch MX records to a different provider to start receiving emails again.</p>
<p>But we don't want that! We want <strong>full control</strong> over our emails!!!</p>
<p>So how do we handle it? Simple: making a <strong>backup</strong>!</p>
<p>The easiest would be to set up your local email software like Outlook or Thunderbird to download all emails to your local computer. It's something, and it will work, but if you happen to have some local server, I have a better proposition.</p>
<p>Set up some simple email server on your local server. I'm using my <strong>NAS</strong>. Just pick a subdomain for your email so it will look like <code><a href="https://karboosx.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="492b282a223c39092b282a223c396730263c3b2d2624282027672a2624">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p>
<p>With your simple local email server, you can set up your email provider to <strong>always forward</strong> any email to your local server.</p>
<p>With that, you will always have a copy of every email on your server. So even if you are on vacation and your service provider blocks you from accessing your inbox, you will still have your copy.</p>
<p>graph LR
    A[Author/Sender] --&gt; B(Your Email Provider);
    B --&gt; C(Online Inbox/Access);
    B -- Forward Email --&gt; D(Local Backup Server);
    D --&gt; E[Your Local Email Copy];
</p>
<p>And would you like to hear the bonus tip? With this solution, there's a high chance that if they ban you by mistake (AI bots are to blame), they will <strong>not disable the forwarding mechanism</strong>. They will just not allow you to authenticate to your account. That means you will still be able to read all your emails even when banned from your inbox!</p>
<hr>
<p>So there you have it. That's my method for making your most important internet asset, your email, truly <strong>unbannable</strong> and resilient. It takes a little setup, but the peace of mind knowing that I'm in control of my digital life—not some huge corporation—is totally worth it. Now go take back control!</p>
