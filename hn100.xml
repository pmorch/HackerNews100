<h2>Xv6, a simple Unix-like teaching operating system</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2><p>

Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006,
which we ported xv6 to RISC-V for a new undergraduate class 6.1810.

</p><h2>Xv6 sources and text</h2><p>

The latest xv6 source and text are available via

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Duck Hunt</em> is considered a classic of the Nintendo Entertainment System. But surprisingly, the concept of hunting ducks did not originate in 1984– people have wanted to hunt ducks since at least 1951, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-k5J4RxQdE">Daffy Duck</a> proclaimed it to be “Duck Season” in the Looney Tunes short <em>Rabbit Fire</em>. But Nintendo didn’t make video games that connected to your television until <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/not-another-color-post-i-swear.html">1977</a>. What if I wanted to hunt ducks in 1976? BONUS: The ducks are immortal!</p>



<p>Duck Hunt? Without a TV? Actually, it’s got quite a long history.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/flyer.jpg" title="no dog in sight" alt="Sega Duck Hunt flyer, showing an arcade machine with mounted guns"></p>

<p>In this case Nintendo was doing what Seg-already-did, as Sega had <a href="https://segaretro.org/Duck_Hunt"><em>Duck Hunt</em></a> as early as 1968. (It’s a generic term) But that was an electromechanical game, with physical moving targets, and a game for the commercial circuit to boot– Sega didn’t sell anything to the masses in those days. So it was up to Nintendo to package the concept in a nice beige box that you could bring home.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/box.jpeg" title="hunting ducks?" alt="Duck Hunt box"></p>

<p>Notice that text below the English text? That text says 光線銃ダックハント, “ダックハント” being simply “Duck Hunt” in katakana, while “光線銃”, <em>kousenjuu</em>, is the Japanese term for “ray gun”. For Nintendo, <em>kousenjuu</em> was a series of light gun toys, but they were not always intercompatible– for example, <em>Duck Hunt</em> required the specific gun it came with. Even the Famicom Gun was eventually sold as part of the <em>kousenjuu</em> series in Japan. (And it was the last)</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/ray.jpeg" title="pew pew" alt="Zoom in on Japanese text"></p>

<p>And that is one serious gun. It comes in two pieces because it won’t fit on its own. The rest of the box is taken up by the projector.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/boks.jpeg" title="project much?" alt="Inside of box"></p>

<p>Just to drive home the point of how big the gun is, here it is compared to the “I can’t believe it’s not a Zapper” I used in the <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/bang-bang-youre-dead.html">lightguns on LCD</a> post and the Famicom Gun. It’s longer than the two of them <em>combined</em>. Plus, being from the 1970s, no attempt was made to make this look like a toy. Don’t carry it anywhere around your local cops, at least here in the US.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/gunz.jpeg" title="and people tell me japan has gun control" alt="the long rifle-like gun compared to smaller pistol and laser-pistol like guns. don't worry, they're all plastic"></p>

<p>The projector takes four “D” cell batteries, which it refers to as UM-1, and the gun takes two “C” cell batteries, which it refers to as “C”; I guess Japan was in a period of transitioning between the two standard types at the time. The projector power switch literally just pushes down on the D cell batteries; this is a very mechanical device. (This also means the motor might go on for a second while you put the batteries in, don’t get startled like I did)</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/switch.jpeg" title="i just thought this was neat-- also dont mind the neo geo cd controller" alt="The switch that just pushed won a metal contat slightly"></p>

<p>And that projector raises the question: is this a <em>video game</em>? The first definition I find is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An electronic game played by manipulating moving figures on a display screen, often designed for play on a special gaming console rather than a personal computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this manipulates moving figures (the ducks) on a display screen (the projector). Sure, it’s a purpose-built projector, but a <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/gaming-in-the-mirror-universe.html">Game &amp; Watch</a> also uses a purpose-built screen. And sure, it’s a mechanical device, no CPU or software here, but hey, an early analog <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/special-thanks-to-homer.html"><em>Pong</em> console</a> doesn’t have a CPU either, and are we going to be that biased against mechanical logic?</p>

<p>And this is where the blog post takes a sudden turn for the worst. If you just want to read more about the Nintendo mechanical <em>Duck Hunt</em>, check out <a href="http://blog.beforemario.com/2012/09/nintendo-kousenjuu-duck-hunt-1976.html"><em>Before Mario</em></a>. They even have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJOkrp7VG60">video</a> and a <a href="http://blog.beforemario.com/2012/10/nintendo-kousenjuu-duck-hunt-how-it.html">technical breakdown</a>. If you want to see the struggles of Nicole on her web log, well, keep reading.</p>

<h2 id="quack-goes-the-weasel">Quack goes the weasel</h2>

<p>Once you turn on the projector and point it at the wall, you see a duck.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/duck.jpeg" title="a very hard to photograph duck" alt="A duck on the wall"></p>

<p>It’s a quite well-animated duck, flapping back and forth, and moving on an unpredictable course. (Actually, the unpredictable course is, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSvZbcwqlTw">Blip</a>, controlled by internal gears on a complex but predictable pattern) The light also turns on and off, presenting a duck flying up and down, disappearing before you can get too close to being able to predict it.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/orje.jpeg" title="look this is pretty far zoomed in and with flash, dust was inevitable" alt="A circuit board inside, the light sensor is visible"></p>

<p>When you shoot a duck, the light will bounce off your wall and some of it will go back into the projector. There is a light sensor mounted on a bar over the projector output; through the magic of optics, this isn’t too visible on the duck you see on the wall, but light passing back to the projector can still be amplified and then detected. At that point, the projector will show the duck falling, as is presented on the side of the box:</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/quack.jpeg" title="if you know what victory shoot is clap your hands; if you don't then maybe ill have to write a post on it, more pachinko for all you naughty children" alt="Box on a shelf showing falling duck"></p>

<p>But one thing I found is that I could not shoot the ducks. Now, I’m pretty bad at light gun games, and that’s been an obstacle several times on this blog. But it wasn’t just that– my wife couldn’t shoot them either, and she’s a much better shot. Plus, the gun wasn’t actually letting out any visible light at all. Now, it could be acting in a non-visible portion of the spectrum, but that was still a concern.</p>

<h3 id="taking-apart-the-gun">Taking apart the gun</h3>

<p>The gun is held together by bolts and little hex nuts on the other side; no screwing into plastic here, thankfully.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/gune.jpeg" title="take the batteries out, idiot" alt="Gun inside, a small circuit board"></p>

<p>It’s a little bit more complicated than the Famicom gun inside here. Before we flip over the PCB to see the component side, let’s take a look at that circular mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/zune.jpeg" title="take a closer look" alt="Zoomed in to show a punched metal disk and the cocking mechanism"></p>

<p>A punched metal disk has three little points, and a spring to keep the position accurate. When you cock the gun, the position of the three points changes, changing how the circuitboard is connected, and then when you fire the gun it snaps back to its regular position. Keep this in mind when we look at the circuitboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/pcb.jpeg" title="single sided pcbs" alt="Other side, showing a few capacitors and coils"></p>

<p>As you can see, the circuit is basically set up to charge the capacitor, and then release the voltage across a small flash-bulb. We can snag some documentation on it from the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3904204A/en">patent</a> to confirm. Unfortunately the patent also mentions that the gun must fire a predetermined signal, so I can’t cheat by shining a light into the projector.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/quacks/pat.png" title="tag yourself im the charging device" alt="Patent layout for the gun, showing the charging device across a lamp"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, my best guess here after checking out all the connections is that the bulb is dead. And this is where I’m stuck. So I’m going to ask anyone reading this: I know my blog posts sometimes get traction, if you happen to know a part number for this bulb, or where I could find a replacement, I’d love to try to get this gun back up and working. But for now, the ducks can keep flying indefinitely. Mocking me. At least that stupid dog isn’t there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/">Leaded Solder</a> suggested I actually give the dimensions of the bulb, which might be useful: 3.3mm diameter, a hair over 27mm long. Good thought.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><blockquote><p>“I can’t read the articles in the paper. I don’t know what they mean. I don’t know what kind of a machine it was just because it weighed seven tons. And there are not sixty two kinds of particles, and I would like to know what atomic bullet he is referring to”</p><p><span>— Richard Feynman, </span><a href="https://antilogicalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/meaning-of-it-all.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">The Meaning of it All</a><span>, page 38 in PDF &amp; 88 in the book </span></p></blockquote><p>I’ve been using this as my north star when explaining technical matters to laypeople. Basically, if someone who is capable of understanding the thing read my description, would they get it? If not, then it’s not a adequate explanation. </p><p>I was thinking about this recently because of a HN discussion (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40535868) where people were making fun of this nonsensical error message:</p><blockquote><p>This message can't be saved because it no longer exists. It can only be discarded. Make sure you copy the contents of the message before you discard if you want to use them later.</p></blockquote><p>what the hell does this mean? The message doesn’t exist, but I can copy its contents? If I can copy its contents…why can’t I save it?? If it doesn’t exist why do I have to discard it??</p><p><span>My </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40550174" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">favorite comment was from lisper</a><span> who said basically, “guys, chill, there is a legit technical edge case here, it’s just difficult to explain to the layperson. How would YOU do it?”</span></p><p>That is a great question! Here was one person’s attempt that I liked:</p><blockquote><p>"This message has been deleted from the mail server, but Outlook still has it in its temporary cache on this device. You can copy the message contents, or discard it from the cache, at which point it will be permanently deleted."</p></blockquote><p>many scoffed at this though. Because “the layperson doesn’t understand things like `cache` and `server`”</p><p><span>ok but do you see the problem here? The original error message already doesn’t tell me anything, </span><strong>even if I am perfectly capable of understanding it</strong><span>. It’s assuming the average person is too dumb/doesn’t care about understanding the root cause, and treating ALL users this way.</span></p><p>What’s the real harm in using the words “server” and “cache” ? The user who doesn’t care about understanding isn’t going to get much out of it either way, I can concede that. But those that do can and will google those terms, and maybe they will learn something. And you can be sure there WILL in fact be users who understand it who will absolutely appreciate it.</p><p><span>I think this is very much Feynman’s point: he didn’t have flowery unrealistic expectations of the average person. He just said, look, </span><strong>there’s a LOT of variance in the skill &amp; interest of people.</strong><span> Why are we not even giving people a chance?</span></p><p>“the whole idea that the average person is unintelligent is a very dangerous idea”</p><p>here’s the full page:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png" width="1200" height="651.7857142857143" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:730,&quot;width&quot;:1344,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8c3aa7f-15dc-4c93-a722-88f7548a58db_1344x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>I caught myself violating this recently, when working on my </span><a href="http://substack-proxy.glitch.me/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">“substack-proxy”</a><span> tool (to get around twitter censorship of substack posts).

			<p>2. Patterson Sounds</p>
			<p>The "Patterson" sounds on this site are a demonstration set designed in October 1985 by Roy Patterson and a team from the Applied Psychology Unit from Cambridge in conjunction with the Institute of Sound and Vibration research from Southampton.  This group had designed alarm sounds for the British nuclear and military applications and were pre-eminent in this field at the time.</p>
			<p>Patterson's sounds were designed to illustrate the principles underlying sounds that could be used in a Draft International Starndard for Alarm Sounds that was being developed at the time by ISO TC1 SC3 WG1(aka Working Group 1 of Subcommittee 3 of Technical Committe Three of the International Standards Organisation).  </p>
			<p>The samples here were digised from a stereo tape recording digitised and sent to me by Frank Block.  The <a href="https://th.id.au/alarms/sounds/Patterson%20Alarm%20Tape%20Mono.mp3">entire tape is available here in mono mp3 format (9.4Mb)</a> and here as an <a href="https://th.id.au/alarms/sounds/Patterson%20Alarm%20Tape%20Mono.wav">uncompressed mono wav file (112Mb)</a>. Each individual sound is reproduced below in mono wav format.</p>
			<p>Patterson proposed two basic types of sounds,  general and category-specific.  </p>
			<p>Three forms of the General alarm sounds were provided, on the basis of urgency: <a href="https://th.id.au/alarms/sounds/gen/Advisory.wav">Information Available</a>, <a href="https://th.id.au/alarms/sounds/gen/Caution.wav">Caution</a>, and <a href="https://th.id.au/alarms/sounds/gen/Warning.wav">Emergency</a>.  The Information available sound was intended to be played once only, whereas the Caution sound was to repeat every 30s and the Emergency sound to repeat every 15s until attended to. </p>
			<p>Category-specific sounds were constructed for oxygenation, ventilation, cardiovascular, artificial perfusion, drug administration and temperature.  Each of these unique sounds was provided in Caution and Emergency forms,  to be repeated at the same intervals as the general sound (30s and 15s respectively).</p>
			<p>The underlying principles included, as far as I can tell:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 levels of urgency encoding for all sounds (plus a general information sound, making three overall) </li>
				<li>Silent time between bursts so staff can communicate and think without interruption</li>
				<li>Using highly distinctive, tonally complex sounds that couldn't readily be confused with anything else</li>
				<li>The use of psychoacoustic cues to indicate urgency (repetition, louder, faster, more abrupt onset for greater urgency), so that the Emergency form was essentially the same as the Caution form, but repeated twice, louder, faster and more intrusive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As indicated on the tape, "These are not the only sounds that satisfy the design principles, nor are they necessarily the best that can be constructed".  </p>
			<p>As it turned out, the "Patterson" sounds on this tape were not endorsed by the group that considered them.  Instead, in 1994 - nine years later! - they released "ISO 9703.2 - Anaesthesia and respiratory care alarm signals Part 2:  Auditory alarm signals".  The '9703' sound set was a simplified version of Patterson's 'general' sound.  It did not make use of any of Patterson's psychoacoustic cues, the underlying sounds were based on simple beeps, there was no 'information' signal, and none of the category-specific sounds were included.  60601-1-8 attempted to improve on 9703.2 by bringing back an information signal, providing advice on how to implement psychoacoustic cues, and defining standard melodies for the 6 categories (plus one more for power-down).</p>
			<p>Frank Block, who sat on all the above committees, is of the opinion that the Patterson sounds were 'genius'.  Here are the sounds:</p>
			<p>2.1 "General" sounds - <span>u</span>rgency encoding alone: </p>

			<p>Six categories were defined, each with their own specific sound pattern. Greater urgency is indicated by repeating the same melody twice - and making it louder, at higher pitch, in a faster tempo and with more rapid rise times- just as it is intuitively obvious that "FIRE!,  FIRE!" is of greater ugency than 'fire' or 'hello'. </p>

			<p><br>3.  Compromise - "Chris Thompson" - Alarm Sounds</p>
			<p>Distinctive as Patterson's sounds are, succesive IEC committees have not endorsed them.  Mostly this was, I think, because simpler devices would have found it difficult, technically, to generate such complex sounds.  Hence the simpler, more easily generated pulse tones of 9703.2 and 60601-1-8.</p>
			<p>None the less, the underlying psychoacoustic principles advocated by Patterson are, I think, entirely valid, as was the concept of providing unique sounds for the main categories of medical alarms.  </p>
			<p>My greatest reservation with the existing 60601-1-8 melodies is that the high priority melodies are too complex.  Although the high priority sounds are based on the medium priority melodies,  two additional beeps after the base melody confuse the sound greatly, so that each high priority alarm is quite different from its medium priority version. This  means that there are almost 13 different sounds to learn, and they can be too easily confused.  The general rule of thumb is that people can learn 6-8 sounds of similar form.  I very much prefer Patterson's category-specific sound concept, in which the same medium sound is just repeated twice, because once the melody for the medium alarm is known, the high form is basically just the same, and requires  no additional learning.</p>
			<p>So my suggestion is to apply Patterson's concepts to a reduced set of melodies based on ISO 60601-1-8.  I propose having only General (no melody), Cardiac, Oxygen, Ventilation, Drug/Fluid and Power-Down categories, with medium and high forms of each, plus the 60601-1-8 low priority or 'information available' tone.  Time between annunciations and all other characteristics would be as per 60601-1-8.</p>
			<p>This approach reduces the number of melodies to learn to 7 (including general, advisory and power down sounds).  This should avoid confusion and enhance ease of learning, though this is yet to be demonstrated in a clinical trial.  In the table below I  have included a 'very high priority' column to show how speed, rise time and volume can additionally emphasise urgency.  </p>

			<p>A significant advantage of this approach is that the high priority alarms are annunciated in much less time than the existing 60601-1-8 high priority sounds.  For example, my 'very high' alarm sound takes only 1.3 seconds to fully annunciate, whereas an equivalent 60601-1-8 high alarm sound takes 4.6 seconds.  In an emergency, when multiple alarms happen at once, brief alarms are less likely to overlap with others, whereas multiple long-duration 60601-1-8 high alarms will result in a cacophany - like 'everyone shouting at once'.</p>
			<p>A trial comparing these was done by myself and Penny Sanderson.  As anticipated, the simpler sounds were easier to learn, and we also found that people with any musical training at all were better at identifying them than people with no musical experience at all.   This work unfortunately went un-published.</p>

			<p>Judy  Edworthy has written extensively on alarm sounds. The committee invited, and BSI supported, an effort by her team to produce a new set of sounds for a future edition of 60601-1-18. </p>

<h2 id="about"><a href="#about" target="_self">About</a></h2>

<p>ASCII Silhouettify is an app that converts images into ASCII silhouettes, a style of ASCII art distinguished by uniformly filled geometric shapes rather than lines or textures. For input, the app expects flat graphics—visuals with minimalistic, high-contrast forms lacking dimensional depth, such as logos, banners, and pixel art. It cannot handle photographs because it does not render shading, highlights, shadows, or gradients.</p>

<p>ASCII Silhouettify restricts itself to the 95 printable ASCII characters, the medium of traditional ASCII artists, as opposed to the line and block characters prevalent in ANSI art or the copious Unicode characters of kaomoji. However, based on user configuration, the app outputs monochrome plain text, text colored with ANSI escape sequences, HTML with or without color, or Neofetch ASCII art format.</p>

<p>ASCII Silhouettify is a desktop app accessible from a browser and from the command-line.</p>



<h2 id="example"><a href="#example" target="_self">Example</a></h2>

<p>Here is the output of <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">Neofetch</a> under an instance of Ubuntu:</p>

<p><img id="./images/neofetch-0.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/neofetch-0.png" alt="Neofetch Ubuntu output">
</p>

<p>For optimal ASCII art, we obtain a high-resolution image of the Ubuntu logo from the web, and we scale it to the size we want it to appear in the console:</p>

<p><img id="./images/neofetch-1.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/neofetch-1.png" alt="Ubuntu logo">
</p>

<p>We run it through the command-line version of ASCII Silhouettify:</p>

<p><img id="./images/neofetch-2.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/neofetch-2.png" alt="Ubuntu logo ANSI art">
</p>

<p>By default, ASCII Silhouettify generates text colored with ANSI escape sequences. With the <code>-o</code> flag, we can direct the output to a file that Neofetch will display. But Neofetch inserts a wide margin between ANSI art and the OS metrics. To prevent this, we‘ll use Neofetch‘s <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/wiki/Custom-Ascii-art-file-format">custom ASCII art file format</a>: </p>

<p>In a text editor, we copy the first line to the clipboard, and then we remove it.</p>

<p>We invoke Neofetch with the following command, pasting in the value we stored in the clipboard:</p>

<h2 id="install"><a href="#install" target="_self">Install</a></h2>

<p>The command-line version of ASCII Silhouettify is a Node.js application. If you don't have Node.js installed on your system, follow the steps described <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell (but not WSL), run:</p>

<div>
    <pre>npm install -g ascii-silhouettify</pre>
    </div>

<p>On macOS and Linux (including WSL), you need to use <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<div>
    <pre>sudo npm install -g ascii-silhouettify</pre>
    </div>


<h2 id="uninstall"><a href="#uninstall" target="_self">Uninstall</a></h2>

<p>In the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell (but not WSL), run:</p>

<div>
    <pre>npm uninstall -g ascii-silhouettify</pre>
    </div>

<p>On macOS and Linux (including WSL), you need to use <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<div>
    <pre>sudo npm uninstall -g ascii-silhouettify</pre>
    </div>


<h2 id="options"><a href="#options" target="_self">Options</a></h2>

<p>The browser version and the command-line version support the same set of options. In the command-line version, the <code>-h</code> flag outputs a message that summarizes the information below.</p>


<h2 id="options.input"><a href="#options.input" target="_self">Input</a></h2>

<p>ASCII Silhouettify can convert multiple images at the same time. It supports <code>png</code>, <code>svg</code>, <code>jpg</code>, <code>webp</code>, <code>gif</code>, <code>tif</code>, <code>heif</code>, <code>avif</code>, and <code>pdf</code> image formats. The command-line version‘s <code>-i</code> flag accepts various filename pattern-matching rules (see the help message for details). The input images should have black or transparent backgrounds.</p>


<h2 id="options.output"><a href="#options.output" target="_self">Output</a></h2>

<p>ASCII Silhouettify can output plane or ANSI-colored text, monospaced text in HTML format, or Neofetch‘s custom ASCII art format. The latter is limited to six colors of the <span>256-color</span> extended ANSI palette.</p>


<h2 id="options.palette"><a href="#options.palette" target="_self">Palette</a></h2>

<p>By default, ASCII Silhouettify uses a palette of 240 colors from the <span>256-color</span> extended ANSI palette, excluding the <span>16-color</span> standard ANSI palette, as it is often redefined in modern terminal emulators. However, users have the option to select the first 8 colors of the standard ANSI palette, the full <span>16-color</span> standard ANSI palette, the full <span>256-color</span> extended ANSI palette, or stick with the default <span>240-color</span> palette.</p>


<h2 id="options.colors-and-monochrome"><a href="#options.colors-and-monochrome" target="_self">Colors and Monochrome</a></h2>

<p>The user can specify the maximum number of colors to appear in the output, not counting the presumably black background. The default is 255. Monochrome mode effectively sets this to one. For Neofetch‘s custom ASCII art format, it defaults to six, the maximum number of colors supported by that format.</p>


<h2 id="options.font-size-and-line-height"><a href="#options.font-size-and-line-height" target="_self">Font Size and Line Height</a></h2>

<p>When viewed in a terminal emulator, the aspect ratio of the generated ASCII art depends on the font, font size, line height, and the rounding rules for character dimensions. To optimize it, capture an image of text in the terminal, and measure the size of each monospaced character in pixels, including the space between lines:</p>

<p><img id="./images/intellij.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/intellij.png" alt="Intellij terminal">
</p>

<p>Plug the values into the following formulae to determine font size and line height settings.</p>

<p>$\text{font size} = \dfrac{\text{character width}+a}{.78}, a \in [-0.5, 0.5)$</p>

<p>$\text{line height} = \dfrac{.75 (\text{character height} + b)}{\text{font size}}, b \in [-0.5, 0.5) $</p>

<p>Select arbitrary values for $a$ and $b$ within the range $-0.5$ to $0.5$.</p>

<p>Here are some measured character dimensions and suggested settings based on the developer’s Windows desktop:</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary.</p>


<h2 id="options.scale"><a href="#options.scale" target="_self">Scale</a></h2>

<p>Ideally, the input image file should be scaled in a paint program to the size the user wants it to appear in the terminal. However, for minor tweaks, ASCII Silhouettify accepts an image scaling factor, which defaults to one.</p>


<h2 id="options.darkness"><a href="#options.darkness" target="_self">Darkness</a></h2>

<p>The conversion algorithm replaces areas of the image below 5% brightness with space characters, enabling the presumably black background to fully show through. The user can adjust this threshold as needed.</p>


<h2 id="options.threads"><a href="#options.threads" target="_self">Threads</a></h2>

<p>By default, the conversion algorithm distributes work across all available logical processors. The user can reduce the number of allocated processors to as few as one, though this will result in longer processing times.</p>


<h2 id="algorithm"><a href="#algorithm" target="_self">Algorithm</a></h2>

<p>On the Windows desktop where the developer created ASCII Silhouettify, Terminal renders each monospaced character within a <span>9×19</span> pixel rectangle when configured with the default 12-points, 1.2-em Cascadia Mono font. The developer captured images of the 95 printable ASCII characters and thresholded them at 50% intensity, producing images containing only black and white pixels:</p>

<p><img id="./images/thresholded.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/thresholded.png" alt="Thresholded characters">
</p>

<p>The algorithm separates the source image into unique color planes, each a white silhouette on a black background:</p>

<p><img id="./images/planes.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/planes.png" alt="planes">
</p>

<p>The algorithm partitions each plane into a matrix of <span>9×19</span> pixel rectangular regions, every one of them destined to be replaced by an ASCII character. To select the optimal character, the algorithm compares a region pixel-by-pixel against every ASCII character image. If a white pixel in a character coincides with a black pixel in the region, the algorithm excludes the character to avoid distorting the silhouette's outline. Of the remaining characters, the algorithm selects the one with the maximum number of matching white pixels.</p>

<p>When the algorithm replaces a region with an ASCII character, it records the number of matching white pixels. After converting all planes, the algorithm combines them by selecting the characters with the highest number of matching white pixels. Finally, it colors those characters based on the colors of the planes from which they originated.</p>

<p>Prior to converting a source image, the algorithm sorts the ASCII character images by the number of white pixels. As shown below, the space character contains the fewest white pixels (zero), while the at sign contains the most.</p>

<p><img id="./images/sorted.png" src="https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/images/sorted.png" alt="Sorted characters">
</p>

<p>The algorithm compares each region with the ASCII character images, starting with the at sign and moving downward. As soon as it finds a character that fully fits within the silhouette, the algorithm replaces the region with it because that character contains the greatest number of white pixels.</p>

<p>To significantly speed up the process, the algorithm prepares <span>171 bitmasks</span>, one for each pixel of the <span>9×19</span> pixel rectangular regions. Each bitmask represents the set of ASCII characters images with a black pixel at the coordinates that uniquely identifies the bitmask.</p>

<p>Specifically, each bitmask contains <span>95 bits</span>, where each bit corresponds to an ASCII character image ordered by the number of white pixels: <span>bit-0</span> represents the space character, and <span>bit-94</span> represents the at sign. The algorithm clears all bits in all bitmasks. Then, for each black pixel in each ASCII character image, the algorithm sets the bit corresponding to the character in the bitmask associated with the pixel.</p>

<p>During region conversion, the algorithm maintains a <span>95-bit</span> accumulator that represents a narrowing set of ASCII characters it can use for the replacement. When it begins to convert a region, the algorithm initializes the accumulator to all ones, indicating all characters are initially considered. Then, for each black pixel in the region, the algorithm updates the accumulator to the current accumulator value bitwise ANDed with the bitmask corresponding to the pixel. That operation excludes all ASCII character images with a white pixel at a location where a black pixel exists in the region.</p>

<p>After the algorithm repeats that process across the region, the accumulator‘s set bits represent the remaining characters that can replace the region. Since the characters are ordered, the number of leading zeros in the accumulator is the index of the ASCII character image with the greatest number of white pixels fully contained within the plane‘s silhouette. With the help of a library, the algorithm invokes a microprocessor instruction for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set">counting leading zeros</a> to obtain the value it needs rapidly.</p>

<p>When the algorithm partitions the source image into a matrix of rectangular regions, the origin of the matrix affects the outcome. To optimize the result, the algorithm repeats the entire image conversion for all integer-coordinate origins within a <span>9×19</span> pixel area around the image origin. It then returns the best result found. To manage the extensive processing required, the algorithm distributes the work among the available logical processors.</p>

<p>Based on user configuration, the algorithm limits itself to a palette that ranges from just the first eight colors of the standard ANSI palette to the full <span>256-color</span> extended ANSI palette. To separate the source image into unique color planes, the algorithm employs the computationally expensive <a href="http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_DeltaE_CIE2000.html">CIEDE2000</a> perceptual color difference formula to find the closest colors within the palette.</p>

from the sshd to carry a big stick dept.</p><p>
In a recent <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=171769392207688&amp;w=2">commit</a>, Damien Miller (<code>djm@</code>) introduced the new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> configurations options, <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourcePenalties">PerSourcePenalties</a></code> and <code><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourcePenaltyExemptList">PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</a></code>, to provide a built in facility in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> itself to penalize undesirable behavior, and to shield specific clients from penalty, respectively. 
</p><p>
The commit message reads,
</p><blockquote><pre>List:       openbsd-cvs

Log message:
Add a facility to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> to penalise particular problematic client
behaviours, controlled by two new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config">sshd_config(5)</a> options:
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#PerSourcePenalties">PerSourcePenalties</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#PerSourcePenaltyExemptList">PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</a>.
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>When PerSourcePenalties are enabled, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a> will monitor the exit
status of its child pre-auth session processes. Through the exit
status, it can observe situations where the session did not
authenticate as expected. These conditions include when the client
repeatedly attempted authentication unsucessfully (possibly indicating
an attack against one or more accounts, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> password guessing), or
when client behaviour caused sshd to crash (possibly indicating
attempts to exploit sshd).

When such a condition is observed, sshd will record a penalty of some
duration (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> 30 seconds) against the client's address. If this time
is above a minimum threshold specified by the PerSourcePenalties, then
connections from the client address will be refused (along with any
others in the same <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourceNetBlockSize">PerSourceNetBlockSize</a> <abbr>CIDR</abbr> range).

Repeated offenses by the same client address will accrue greater
penalties, up to a configurable maximum. A <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5#PerSourcePenaltyExemptList">PerSourcePenaltyExemptList</a>
option allows certain address ranges to be exempt from all penalties.

We hope these options will make it significantly more difficult for
attackers to find accounts with weak/guessable passwords or exploit
bugs in sshd(8) itself.

PerSourcePenalties is off by default, but we expect to enable it
automatically in the near future.

much feedback markus@ and others, ok markus@
</pre></blockquote><p>
This new facility comes in addition to the already well known and loved  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf#Stateful_Tracking_Options"><code>pf.conf</code> <em>state tracking options</em></a>, and is for now available only in <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>-<code>current</code>, but is almost certainly to be available in the upcoming OpenBSD <em>7.6</em> release.
</p><p>
At first we were wondering whether these options would be enabled by default before the new release. We did not have to wait long. This <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=171770534714766&amp;w=2">subsequent commit</a> settled the issue:
</p><blockquote><pre>List:       openbsd-cvs

ok markus

<abbr>NB.</abbr> if you run a sshd that accepts connections from behind large NAT
blocks, proxies or anything else that aggregates many possible users
behind few <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses, then this change may cause legitimate traffic
to be denied.

Please read the PerSourcePenalties, PerSourcePenaltyExemptList and
PerSourceNetBlockSize options in sshd_config(5) for how to tune your
sshd(8) for your specific circumstances.
</pre></blockquote><p>
So now we know: starting with OpenBSD 7.6, <code>PerSourcePenalties</code> will be enabled by default, and admins who do not themselves run <abbr>PF</abbr> or other network translation mechanisms will need to keep the consequences of inconsiderate <abbr>NAT</abbr> use in mind.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When Microsoft named <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/everything-announced-microsoft-surface-event-2024/">its new Windows feature Recall</a>, the company intended the word to refer to a kind of perfect, AI-enabled memory for your device. Today, the other, unintended definition of “recall”—a company's admission that a product is too dangerous or defective to be left on the market in its current form—seems more appropriate.</p><p>On Friday, Microsoft announced that it would be making multiple dramatic changes to its rollout of its Recall feature, making it an opt-in feature in the Copilot+ compatible versions of Windows where it had previously been turned on by default, and introducing new security measures designed to better keep data encrypted and require authentication to access Recall's stored data.</p><p>“We are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall,” reads a <a data-offer-url="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/&quot;}" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Pavan Davuluri Microsoft's Corporate Vice President, Windows + Devices. “If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default.”</p><p>The changes come amidst a mounting barrage of criticism from the security and privacy community, which has described Recall—which silently stores a screenshot of the user's activity every 5 seconds as fodder for AI analysis—as a gift to hackers: essentially unrequested, pre-installed spyware built into new Windows computers.</p><p>In the preview versions of Recall, that screenshot data, complete with the user's every bank login, password, and porn site visit would have been indefinitely collected on the user's machine by default. And though that highly sensitive is stored locally on the user's machine and not uploaded to the cloud, cybersecurity experts have warned that it all remains accessible to any hacker who so much as gains a temporary foothold on a user's Recall-enabled device, giving them a longterm panopticon view of the victim's digital life.</p><p>"It makes your security very fragile,” as Dave Aitel, a former NSA hacker and founder of security firm Immunity, described it—more charitably than some others—to WIRED earlier this week. “Anyone who penetrates your computer for even a second can get your whole history. Which is not something people want.”</p><p>For Microsoft, the Recall rollback comes in the midst of an embarrassing string of cybersecurity incidents and breaches—including a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/microsoft-under-fire-for-response-to-leak-of-2-4tb-of-sensitive-customer-data/">leak of terabytes of its customers' data</a> and a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-cloud-attack-china-hackers/">shocking</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-cloud-attack-china-hackers/">penetration of government email accounts</a> enabled by a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-backed-hackers-steal-microsofts-signing-key-post-mortem/">cascading series of Microsoft security slipups</a>—that have grown so problematic as to become a sticking point even its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-government-has-a-microsoft-problem/">uniquely close relationship with the US government</a>.</p><p>Those scandals have escalated to the degree that Microsoft's Nadella issued a memo just last month declaring that Microsoft would make security its first priority in any business decision. “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: <strong>Do security</strong>,” Nadella's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24148033/satya-nadella-microsoft-security-memo">memo read</a> (emphasis his). “In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.”</p><p>By all appearances, Microsoft's rollout of Recall—even after today's announcement—displays the opposite approach, and one that seems more in line with business as usual in Redmond: Announce a feature, get pummeled for its glaring security failures, then belatedly scramble to control the damage.</p><p><em>This is a developing story. Check back for further updates.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

This isn’t a sandbox for your JavaScript code — it’s intended to mitigate browser exploits caused by bugs in the JIT compiler itself. That’s important work because they report that most Chrome exploits start with a V8 memory safety bug.</p><p id="d5cb">V8 is written in C++, so it may seem like these are the sort of bugs you’d expect from working in a memory-unsafe language. Unfortunately the situation is more complex. Why? The team explain:</p><blockquote><p id="2e39">There is a catch: V8 vulnerabilities are rarely “classic” memory corruption bugs (use-after-frees, out-of-bounds accesses, etc.) but instead subtle logic issues which can in turn be exploited to corrupt memory. As such, existing memory safety solutions are, for the most part, not applicable to V8. In particular, neither <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/case-memory-safe-roadmaps" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">switching to a memory safe language</a>, such as Rust, nor using current or future hardware memory safety features, such as <a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/memory-safety-arm-memory-tagging-extension" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">memory tagging</a>, can help with the security challenges faced by V8 today.</p></blockquote><p id="db9f">They give an example bug that can cause memory corruption without the engine itself containing any normal memory safety problems, as VM intrinsics or JIT compiled machine code itself may accidentally rely on invalid assumptions about memory.</p><p id="c9d0">It would be nice if there was a rigorous approach to writing language runtimes that eliminated such bugs by design.</p></div><div><p id="4d0d"><span>G</span>raalVM has a JavaScript engine called <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/javascript/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalJS</a>. It’s written in Java using the <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Truffle language framework</a>. Its peak performance is competitive with V8 and on a few benchmarks (such as ray tracing) is actually faster!</p><p id="5480">Although being written in Java does improve memory safety, we just saw that rewriting V8 in a safe language wouldn’t help with the types of bugs V8 is trying to solve and so we would intuitively expect that GraalJS must suffer from the same classes of bugs. Yet, it doesn’t. Let’s take a look at why not. Along the way we’ll explore the <em>first Futamura projection, </em>the core theoretical idea underpinning Truffle.</p><p id="f80c">All fast language VMs work the same way. A program is loaded from disk into in-memory data structures representing the program, either an abstract syntax tree or byte code. The program starts running in an interpreter. Parts are soon discovered to be <em>hot spots</em>, i.e. the program spends much more time there than in other parts. Those hot spots are passed to a just-in-time compiler that converts them to optimized machine code, and execution then jumps back and forth between the interpreter and the collection of compiled program fragments. This gives a big performance boost.</p><p id="b183">This architecture is standard — both the JVM and V8 use it — but viewed from a security perspective the design has a flaw: it’s error prone. The language semantics are implemented twice, once for the interpreter and again for the JIT compiler. It’s critical not only that both places are fully correct but also that they exactly match. Otherwise, the VM becomes exploitable.</p><p id="bb2b">Truffle is a Java library that helps you build advanced, high performance language runtimes. VMs built using the Truffle framework operate in a fundamentally different way to conventional VMs, one that not only makes them much easier to write but which also eliminates memory safety bugs by design. It all starts with you writing an interpreter for your language in Java. This doesn’t mean compiling your <em>target</em> language to JVM bytecode — in fact bytecode won’t feature anywhere in this story. You just write an ordinary interpreter. Because the interpreter’s code is garbage collected and bounds-checked, malicious user code can’t use memory safety bugs to exploit it.</p><p id="e75d">If you think about conventional Java then this may sound quite slow — isn’t Java itself interpreted until it gets JIT compiled? Are we … interpreting an interpreter? Fortunately not because you can ship your Truffle-based language runtime as a <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">native executable</a>, meaning it’s compiled ahead of time to fully native code using the Graal compiler (from which the wider umbrella project takes its name).</p><p id="db2f">So at the start of the user’s program their JavaScript is running in a regular interpreter shipped as a normal executable binary or DLL, but which still benefits from the safety properties of a Java program. Soon some methods get hot. At this point something unconventional happens. The Truffle framework is keeping track of which functions are hot for you and will decide to schedule JIT compilations. But unlike in a conventional VM design, you <em>don’t </em>write your own JIT compiler. Instead your user’s code is automatically compiled by the same general-purpose Graal compiler that was used to convert your interpreter to native code, and execution will start automatically switching back and forth between the interpreter and compiled functions. This is possible thanks to an unusual technique called partial evaluation (or <em>the first Futamura projection</em>).</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>Professor Yoshihiko Futamura</figcaption></figure><p id="6fac"><span>Y</span>ou might not have encountered Futamura projections or partial evaluation before, so what is this strange sounding thing?</p><p id="d771">The core idea is to automatically transform the code of your interpreter to create individual JIT compiled user methods. Instead of needing to carefully implement the language semantics in two places (interpreter and hand-crafted JIT), it’s sufficient to implement it just once. As the interpreter is memory safe and the transform preserves interpreter semantics, the compiled version of the user’s code is guaranteed to match the interpreter’s behavior and is therefore <em>also</em> automatically memory safe. This makes it much harder to slip up and write an exploitable VM.</p><p id="cc46">There are several tricks that make this possible. The most important is a new form of constant-ness, added to Java using annotations. In normal programming a variable is either mutable or immutable. An immutable variable is marked with a special keyword such as<code>final</code> or <code>const</code> and must be set only once, at the declaration site. Constants are great for compilers because they can be folded, meaning that references to them can be replaced with their value. Consider the following bit of code:</p><pre><span id="5805">class Example {<br>    private static final int A = 1;<br>    private static final int B = 2;<p>    static int answer() {<br>        return A - B;<br>    }</p><p>    static String doSomething() {<br>        if (answer() &lt; 0) <br>            return "OK" <br>        else <br>            throw new IllegalStateException();<br>    }<br>}</p></span></pre><p id="f9a9">It’s easy to see the <code>answer()</code> method will always return the same number. A good compiler will substitute 1 and 2 into the expression yielding <code>return 1 — 2</code> and pre-compute the answer. Then it will inline any calls to answer (i.e. copy/paste the implementation into the call site), substituting those with -1 and thus removing the call overhead as well. That in turn may trigger even more constant folding, such as in the <code>doSomething</code> method where the compiler will prove that the exception can never be thrown and delete it entirely. Having done that, <code>doSomething</code> can <em>also</em> be optimized out by simply replacing it with “OK”, and so on.</p><p id="15f8">That’s neat, but every compiler can do that … as long as the constant values are known at compile time. Truffle changes that by introducing a third kind of const-ness called <em>compilation final</em>. If in your interpreter implementation you declare a variable like this:</p><pre><span id="784c">@CompilationFinal private int a = 1;</span></pre><p id="5472">then it will change its const-ness depending on when it’s being accessed. From inside your interpreter, it’s mutable. You will use such variables to implement your interpreter. They’ll be set when you load your user’s program and maybe also whilst it runs. Once a function in the user’s script becomes hot, Truffle will work together with the Graal compiler to <em>re</em>compile the parts of the interpreter corresponding to the user’s code, and this time <code>a</code>will be treated as if it was a constant, i.e. the same as the literal value <code>1</code>.</p><p id="0761">This works for any kind of data, including complex objects. Consider the following highly simplified pseudocode:</p><pre><span id="774f">import com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes.Node;<p>class JavaScriptFunction extends Node {<br>    @CompilationFinal Node[] statements;</p><p>    Object execute() {<br>        for (var statement : statements) statement.execute();<br>    } <br>}</p></span></pre><p id="3703">This is the sort of class you might find in a typical abstract syntax tree interpreter. The <code>statements</code> array is marked compilation-final. When the program is first loaded we can initialize the array with objects representing the different things a user’s JavaScript function is doing, because it’s mutable. Now imagine that the function represented by this object gets hot. Truffle will start a special compilation of the <code>execute()</code> method in which Graal is told that the <code>this</code> pointer should be treated implicitly as compilation-final. Because the object is treated as constant, so can <code>this.statements</code> also be treated as constant. It’ll be substituted with the exact contents of a specific <code>JavaScriptFunction</code> object on the interpreter heap enabling the compiler to unroll the loop inside <code>execute</code>, transforming it to look like this:</p><pre><span id="d429">Object execute() {<br>    this.statements[0].execute();<br>    this.statements[1].execute();<br>    this.statements[2].execute();<br>}</span></pre><p id="f034">Here <code>Node</code> is a superclass and <code>execute()</code> is virtual, but that doesn’t matter. Because the list is compilation-final the individual objects in the list are also constant folded, so the <code>execute</code> method can be de-virtualized (resolved to whatever concrete type it really is) and then inlined as well.</p><p id="e75a">And on and on we go. At the end the compiler generates a native function which matches the semantics of the user’s JavaScript (or Python or C++ or whatever language we’re implementing). Invocations of the specific <code>JavaScriptFunction.execute()</code> method that were compiled are diverted, so when the interpreter invokes it, there will be a transition from interpreter to native code and back. If your interpreter realizes it needs to change a <code>@CompilationFinal</code> field, for example because the program changes its behavior and invalidates an optimistic assumption you made, that's absolutely fine. Truffle will let you do that and "deoptimizes" the program back to the interpreter for you. Deoptimization (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pksRrON5XfU&amp;t=3259s" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">tech talk</a>) is an advanced technique that's normally very hard to implement securely, as it means mapping the optimized CPU state back to the interpreter state and once again, any mistakes can be exploitable (you may be seeing a theme here). But you don’t have to write any of this. It’s all done for you by Truffle.</p></div><div><h2 id="6f34">Why does this work?</h2><p id="c000">It might not be obvious why partial evaluation actually makes things faster.</p><p id="9751">Interpreters are slow because they have to make a lot of decisions. The user’s program could do anything, so interpreters must constantly check for many possibilities to find out what the program is trying to do at that exact moment. Because branches and memory loads are difficult for the CPU to execute quickly, the whole program ends up being slow. This technique of compiling an interpreter with enhanced constant folding eliminates branches and loads. On top of this, Truffle builds an API that makes it easy to implement advanced optimizations and features for JavaScript or indeed, for <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/Languages/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">any other language</a> you have an interpreter for. For example, it offers a simple API for using <em>assumptions</em> — a way to JIT compile code that executes faster by not including code for handling edge cases. If such an edge case is hit then the compiled code can be thrown away and regenerated to take into account that the edge case was observed.</p></div><div><h2 id="5f8b">Recompilation</h2><p id="8533">Above we briefly mentioned “recompilation”, but glossed over how that’s possible. We said the interpreter is just native code, right?</p><p id="4ba0">When the interpreter was compiled ahead of time with the <code>native-image</code> in preparation for shipping to the user’s computer, the Graal compiler recognized that it was compiling a Truffle-using program. Graal and Truffle are co-developed, so although they can be used independently, when used together they recognize each other and collaborate.</p><p id="2f52">Graal changes its behavior in a couple of ways when it notices it’s compiling a Truffle language ahead-of-time. Firstly, it adds a copy of itself to the output program. Interpreter methods are then discovered by doing a static analysis of the program and then stored in the resulting executable, but with a twist: they’re stored more than once. One version is directly executable machine code. That’s your regular generic interpreter. Another is a carefully encoded form of Graal’s <em>intermediate representation</em> (or IR). An IR is sort of half way between the source code you write and the machine code that eventually executes (Graal’s IR is an object graph). Graal also compiles in a garbage collector, either the advanced and mature G1 collector (if you use Oracle GraalVM) or <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/substratevm/src/com.oracle.svm.core.genscavenge/src/com/oracle/svm/core/genscavenge" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a simpler GC written in pure Java</a> (if you use the GraalVM Community Edition).</p><p id="3ee0">When a user function gets hot, Truffle looks up the embedded IR for the “execute a user function” node and partially evaluates it. The evaluation is interleaved with the parsing of the graph IR to ensure that the process is as efficient as possible — if something won’t be executed because constant folding already proved it can’t be reached it won’t even be decoded or seen by the compiler. This also ensures that memory usage during the compile is kept low.</p><h2 id="6857">My only friend, the end</h2><p id="f25d">And that’s it! That’s how an entire class of subtle safety bugs is eliminated in GraalJS: because the semantics of the language are defined by the memory-safe interpreter and then partially evaluated, the generated machine code is also memory safe by construction.</p><p id="cf91">What about the V8 sandbox that the original blog post is about? Expressing pointers as offsets from a heap base is <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/graalvm/isolates-and-compressed-references-more-flexible-and-efficient-memory-management-for-graalvm-a044cc50b67e">a great idea that’s already used in GraalVM natively compiled binaries</a>. However this is done for performance, as the other memory safety mechanisms mean there’s no need for mitigating heap overwrites.</p><p id="b893">None of the above is in any way specific to JavaScript, and nor are Truffle’s benefits limited to security and performance. In fact Truffle automatically adds <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">many other features to your language</a>, such as debugging (through Chrome Debugger’s wire protocol), language interop with both Java/Kotlin/etc and any other Truffle language, a fast regular expression engine, a fast foreign function interface, profiling tools, heap snapshotting and much more. Truffle has been used to build <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/Languages/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">over 30 language VMs for dozens of languages</a>, including languages you wouldn’t expect to have such features such as the recent <a href="https://pkl-lang.org/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Pkl configuration language from Apple</a>.</p><p id="a8d2">If this article has whetted your appetite to learn more, take a look at <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the documentation</a> or this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pksRrON5XfU" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">tech talk</a> on how it all works.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scenario</h2><a id="user-content-scenario" aria-label="Permalink: Scenario" href="#scenario"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Several months ago my father's new laptop started having issues with the trackpad sensitivity. He called HP's tech support and was informed that they could not help him troubleshoot the problem at hand until he had updated the BIOS. The tech stepped him through downloading and running the BIOS update tool, and when the computer was rebooted my dad found that HP had indeed upgraded him from a laptop to a brick.</p>
<p dir="auto">For whatever reason the BIOS upgrade failed, and without warning the laptop was left in a near completely inert state. The power button would light up when pressed and the system fan would spin up to maximum. That was it. No backlight, no blinking caps lock, no beeps.</p>
<p dir="auto">After a few attempts at re-doing the BIOS flash, or booting with the <em>special hotkeys</em>, or using a <a href="https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/ish_3932413-2337994-16#:~:text=Turn%20off%20the%20computer.,release%20the%20Windows%20%2B%20V%20keys." rel="nofollow">recovery USB drive</a>, the tech gave up and referred dad to the expensive warranty he had purchased along with the laptop. So the computer was packed up and mailed off for repair.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually HP got back in touch, and alongside a picture of the laptop's (existing) upgraded RAM was a message stating that the laptop's condition was the consumer's fault for changing the RAM and thus the warranty was void. HP wanted $500 to downgrade the RAM back to stock before they would continue troubleshooting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/hp_warranty_renege.png"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/hp_warranty_renege.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As we've already established, the laptop's failure was not due to the 3rd party RAM, which had been cranking along perfectly for months. Under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter50&amp;edition=prelim" rel="nofollow">Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act</a> it is illegal for HP to renege on their warranty <em>unless the reason for warranty work is demonstrably due to the consumer's changes</em>. Which is a higher burden of proof than a picture of RAM. See also "Tie in Sales Provisions" on <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law" rel="nofollow">ftc.gov</a>. But I am not a lawyer and I sure can't afford one, so Hewlett-Packard will continue to harm consumers with impunity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The laptop was returned un-repaired, and it sat unused for several months. Until this past weekend, when I decided it couldn't get any more bricked and asked to borrow it to continue troubleshooting.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Locating the BIOS chip</h2><a id="user-content-locating-the-bios-chip" aria-label="Permalink: Locating the BIOS chip" href="#locating-the-bios-chip"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A quick search online led me to <a href="http://schematic-x.blogspot.com/2018/04/hp-schematics-pack.html" rel="nofollow">schematic-x.blogspot.com</a> which had two PDFs claiming to be schematics for "HP Envy 17." I <a href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/resources/HP_ENVY_17.pdf">downloaded one</a> and thumbed through until I found the BIOS on page 34:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/pdf_bios_ic.png"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/pdf_bios_ic.png" alt="View of the BIOS chip for a similar laptop motherboard."></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The IC listed there is a MX25L8005M2C-15G. There isn't one of those on this laptop, but the schematic shows that the BIOS is a SPI device, and there is a MX25L6473F SPI flash chip right next to the CPU:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/images/bios_chip_initial.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/raw/main/images/bios_chip_initial.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Searching for that second part number brings up some hits that <a href="https://www.win-raid.com/t4287f16-GUIDE-The-Beginners-Guide-to-Using-a-CH-A-SPI-Programmer-Flasher-With-Pictures-11.html" rel="nofollow">include "BIOS" in them</a>. That's promising, and it makes me suspect that this schematic is for a slightly different motherboard also sold as "Envy 17".</p>
<p dir="auto">I look at any other likely candidate chips and search their part numbers as well. I'm not sure if this MX25L6473F is the BIOS chip or not, but it seems to be the best bet.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test fixture</h2><a id="user-content-test-fixture" aria-label="Permalink: Test fixture" href="#test-fixture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There's a chance this process would have been much easier if I'd had a Bus Pirate and SOP8 adapter to clip onto the IC while it was still on the motherboard. FYI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since I don't have a way of clipping onto the IC I decide to remove it from the motherboard rather than try soldering flying wires to the pins while it's attached.</p>

<p dir="auto">Finally the ST-Link is connected via SWD to the dev board, and a serial (FTDI) adapter is added. Eventually I switched out the FTDI adapter for a virtual CDC serial port on the STM's integrated micro-USB.</p>

<p dir="auto">This step wasn't strictly necessary, but I want to gain familiarity with communicating to the SPI device before attempting a write, and I want the ability to read back out new firmware to confirm it was written correctly.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first step was to read the RDID and status registers, saving the contents to a variable and inspecting in my debugger. Along the way I learned that the STM32's chip-select function isn't great, and pivoted to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35790106" rel="nofollow">manually toggling the line as a GPIO</a>. Once that was working I added in serial output and expanded the STM32 code to begin transferring all of the flash memory contents on boot. The SPI code was cribbed from this <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/getting-started-with-stm32-how-to-use-spi/09eab3dfe74c4d0391aaaa99b0a8ee17" rel="nofollow">digikey source file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the STM32 only programs successfully the first time (SWD wasn't configured):

<p dir="auto">The first several attempts at dumping the chip contents used either gnu-screen or <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/347340/how-to-dump-raw-serial-data-to-disk" rel="nofollow">stty</a>:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 &gt; output.bin</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>(stty raw; cat &gt; output.bin) &lt; /dev/ttyUSB0</code></p>
<p dir="auto">But I kept getting files that either didn't finish, or didn't match. I wasn't sure what was happening, but suspected either a buffer was being overrun or the FTDI serial adapter's connection was loose. See <code>extracted_firmware/dump_{01-05}.bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Reluctantly I started working on the C++ program in <code>host_pc/</code>, and eventually also modified the stm32 firmware to <a href="https://controllerstech.com/send-and-receive-data-to-pc-without-uart-stm32-usb-com/" rel="nofollow">use the USB port</a> instead of a serial adapter.</p>

<p dir="auto">Eventually I grew tired of hunting the source of these file differences, and wanted to know conclusively what was on that BIOS chip. So I set up the host and STM32 software to read a single byte at a time and save it to a file. This would have taken more than a day on the serial adapter, but I found that if the baud rate wasn't set manually in the C++ program it defaults to either a very high baud or possibly even the USB full speed (12MHz) that the virtual STM32 CDC device runs at, bringing the time down to only around one hour. The first full firmware was dump_11.bin which matched stty-based dump_03.bin.</p>

<p dir="auto">Now that I had the old, supposedly corrupted BIOS file the next step would be to find a complete file to flash. I extracted the <a href="https://github.com/ctag/hp_envy_reviver/blob/main/resources/sp133161.exe">sp133161.exe</a> file as though it were a .zip archive, and went browsing through the resulting files. For a while it looked like the easy-to-use binary file wouldn't be had, since the HP tool only included some .efi and .s12 files, which sounds to me like the firmware is signed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually I recalled back to that recovery USB drive, and made a new one to copy the files off of. Inside (<code>recovery_usb_files/HP/BIOS/Current</code>) I found 083AD.bin and 0834D.bin. I'm not sure what the difference is, but I was able to match an instance of "083AD" ascii in the extracted firmware to the 083AD.bin file, which was as close to a conclusive match as I felt I would get.</p>

<p dir="auto">My first inclination for flashing the new binary file would be to bundle it with the STM32 firmware. That way no host_pc-serial issues could corrupt the transfer. Unfortunately the STM32 I have is too small to package the whole file, so I had to backtrack to sending the file from the C++ host_pc program.</p>

<p dir="auto">Building for the STM32:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>arm-none-eabi-ld -r -b binary -o 083AD.o 083AD.bin</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Including that file in STM32cubeIDE:</p>
<p dir="auto">Right click the project -&gt; Properties -&gt; C/C++ Build -&gt; Settings -&gt; Tool Settings tab -&gt; MCU GCC Linker -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Additional object files. Add the path to the arm linked 083AD.o file there.</p>

<p dir="auto">After that approach was blocked by the microcontroller's flash storage space, the object file was re-built with regular ld and included in the host_pc program.</p>
<p dir="auto">After a few failed attempts to write a page-at-a-time to the STM32, I once again fell back on byte-by-byte with ack bytes being sent back. This time the entire file was written and read back out intact.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once I was happy with the successful programming of the chip, it was removed from the test fixture and put back in the laptop.</p>
<p dir="auto">On first boot... Nothing happened. In fact, it took several boots, and possibly removing the hard drive (which we had also tried prior to all of this) before I finally saw the backlight flicker. The system then rebooted on its own, and the HP logo appeared along with a message complaining that the CMOS BIOS settings had been lost. After that everything appeared to work.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Autoregressive models, such as the GPT family, use a fixed order, usually left-to-right, to generate sequences. However, this is not a necessity. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show that by simply adding a positional encoding for the output, this order can be modulated on-the-fly per-sample which offers key advantageous properties. It allows for the sampling of and conditioning on arbitrary subsets of tokens, and it also allows sampling in one shot multiple tokens dynamically according to a rejection strategy, leading to a sub-linear number of model evaluations. We evaluate our method across various domains, including language modeling, path-solving, and aircraft vertical rate prediction, decreasing the number of steps required for generation by an order of magnitude.

<p>Here’s a <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">fact</a>: GPT-4o charges 170 tokens to process each <code>512x512</code> tile
used in high-res mode. At ~0.75 tokens/word, this suggests a picture is worth
about 227 words—only a factor of four off from the traditional saying.</p>

<p>(There’s also an 85 tokens charge for a low-res ‘master thumbnail’ of each picture
and higher resolution images are broken into many such <code>512x512</code> tiles,
but let’s just focus on a single high-res tile.)</p>

<p>OK, but <em>why</em> 170? It’s an oddly specific number, isn’t it? OpenAI uses round
numbers like “\$20” or “\$0.50” in their pricing, or powers of 2 and 3 for their
internal dimensions. Why choose a numbers like 170 in this instance?</p>

<p>Numbers that are just dropped into a codebase without explanation are called
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>” in programming, and 170 is a pretty glaring magic
number.</p>

<p>And why are image costs even being converted to token counts anyway? If it were
just for billing purposes, wouldn’t it be less confusing to simply list the
cost per tile?</p>

<p>What if OpenAI chose 170, not as part of some arcane pricing strategy, but
simply because it’s literally true? What if image tiles are in fact represented
as 170 consecutive embedding vectors? And if so, how?</p>

<h2 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h2>

<p>The first thing to recall about the transformer model is that it operates on
vectors, not discrete tokens. The inputs <em>have</em> to be vectors, or the dot
product similarity at the heart of the transformer wouldn’t make any sense. The
whole concept of tokens is a pre-processing step: text is converted to tokens
and tokens are converted to embedding vectors by an embedding model before they
even hit the first layer of the transformer model.</p>

<p>For example, Llama 3 uses 4,096 feature dimensions internally. Consider the
sentence, “My very educated mother just served us nine pizzas.” It gets
converted into 10 integer tokens (counting the period) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding">BPE</a>, then
those are each converted into 4,096-dimensional vectors by an embedding model,
resulting in a <code>10x4096</code> matrix. That’s the “real” input into a transformer
model.</p>

<p>But there’s no law that says that these vectors <strong>must</strong> come from a text embedding
model. It’s a strategy that works well for text data, but if we have data in a
different format that we want to feed into a transformer then we can simply use
a different embedding strategy.</p>

<p>We know that OpenAI has been thinking along these lines because in 2021 they
released the <a href="https://openai.com/index/clip/">CLIP embedding model</a>. CLIP embeds both text and images
into the same semantic vector space, allowing you to use cosine similarity to
find images related to text strings, or images which are semantically similar
to other images. You can try the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/vivien/clip">demo</a> on hugging face to get a feel for
how it works:</p>

<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/vivien/clip"><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/clip_demo.png"></a></p>

<p>However, CLIP embeds the entire image as a single vector, not 170 of them.
GPT-4o must be using a different, more advanced strategy internally to
represent images (and likewise video, voice, and other kinds of data; that’s
why it’s “omnimodal.”)</p>

<p>Let’s see if we can’t deduce what that strategy might be for image data in
particular.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-feature-dimensions">Number of Feature Dimensions</h2>

<p>Let’s start by guesstimating the number of dimensions used internally by GPT-4o
to represent embedding vectors. We can’t know the real number for certain
because it’s proprietary, but we can make some reasonable assumptions.</p>

<p>OpenAI seems to likes powers of 2, sometimes with a single factor of 3 mixed
in. For example, they used 1,536 for <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-and-improved-embedding-model/">ada-002</a> embeddings or 3,072 for
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models">text-embedding-3-large</a>. GPT-3 is known to use <a href="https://dugas.ch/artificial_curiosity/GPT_architecture.html">12,288 dimensions
throughout</a>. It’s probable that GPT-4o either kept or increased that
parameter.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely that the number of embeddings would have gone down from
GPT-3 to GPT-4o, but it’s possible. Releases like GPT-4 Turbo were actually
faster and cheaper than earlier version, and a reduction in embedding dimension
may have been part of that if the developers had benchmarks showing that the
smaller size was just as good in terms of quality.</p>

<p>Given all that, it’s likely that the number of feature dimensions used inside
of GPT-4o is one of these:</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, I’ll assume that GPT-4o is using 12,228 for the
dimension of its embedding vectors. It doesn’t really matter if we’re off by a
factor of 2 or 4; the same arguments will work.</p>

<h2 id="embedding-images">Embedding Images</h2>

<p>Image tiles are square, so are likely represented by a square grid of tokens.
170 is very close to $13 \times 13$. The extra token could a single embedding vector
which encodes a kind of gestalt impression of the entire image, exactly as
CLIP does (and similar to their strategy of using an 85 token “master
thumbnail” for each image.)</p>

<p>So, the question is, how do we go from <code>512x512x3</code> to <code>13x13x12228</code>?</p>

<h3 id="strategy-1-raw-pixels">Strategy 1: Raw Pixels</h3>

<p>Here’s an extremely simple way to stuff an image into a vector space:</p>

<ol>
<li>Divide the <code>512x512</code> image into a <code>8x8</code> grid of “mini-tiles.”</li>
<li>Each mini-tile is <code>64x64x3</code>; flatten it a vector of dimension 12,228.</li>
<li>Each mini-tile is a single embedding vector.</li>
<li>The entire image tile is represented as 64 consecutive embedding vectors.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two problems with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>64 ≠ 170, and</li>
<li>it’s extremely stupid.</li>
</ol>

<p>By “extremely stupid” I mean that it doesn’t make any sense to embed using raw
RGB values and then just cross your fingers and hope the transformer will sort it out.
Transformers aren’t really designed to handle the spatial structure of 2D images,
especially not when it’s embedded in such a braindead way as this.</p>

<p>To see why, imagine the image is shifted a few pixel to the left. The dot
product between the embedding vectors of the original and shifted images would
immediately drop close to zero. The same would happen if we resize the image.</p>

<p>Ideally we’d want a model that was robust to these kinds of transforms—we’d
like it to have translational and scale invariance, to use the technical jargon.</p>

<h3 id="strategy-2-cnn">Strategy 2: CNN</h3>

<p>Luckily, there already exists a model with those characteristics, with over a
decade-long track record of successfully handling image data: the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural Network</a>. (Here, I’m using the term to describe the
broad family of deep learning models which use convolution layers somewhere
inside them.)</p>

<p>Just to get a sense of what the options are, let’s take look at a classic CNN
architecture introduced in 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/alexnet.png"></p>

<p>The basic building blocks are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Convolution Layer. These scan over an image in $k \times k$ sized blocks,
training a small neural network.</li>
<li>Max Pool Layer. These also look at $k \times k$ block, but simply take the
maximum value from each.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should spot two key trends as we move into the deeper layers of the
network: the height and width get smaller, while the number of “channels”
(sometimes called “filters”) gets larger. That means we’re incrementally
digesting many low-level features into fewer high level concepts until, at the
very end, AlexNet has turned the entire image into a single categorical concept
representing something like a “cat” or “dog.” CNNs are essentially funnels that
squeeze the lemons of raw pixels into the lemonade of semantic vectors.</p>

<p>If you’re following my somewhat strained analogy, you should see how a CNN can
turn an image into a single embedding vector. To see how (and why) a CNN can
turn an image into many embedding vectors, let’s take a look at a slightly
newer (circa 2018) CNN architecture, one that’s a little closer in spirit to
what we’ll need for GPT-4o. It’s called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767">YOLO</a>, short for “You Only Look
Once.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/yolo_v3.png"></p>

<p>Here, the notation “xN” means that the entire block is repeated N times. YOLOv3
is 10 times as deep as AlexNet but is still very similar in some regards. It
has a somewhat more modern design: stride 2 convolutional layers instead
of max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, residual layers to
preserve good gradients in very deep networks, etc.</p>

<p>But the key difference is that it doesn’t reduce the image to a single flat
vector, but stops at <code>13x13</code>. There are no fully connected layers after that;
the output of YOLOv3 is in fact 169 different vectors, laid out in a <code>13x13</code>
grid, each of dimension 1,024, and each representing the class (and some
bounding box data we’ll ignore) of the object found in or near a particular
cell of the grid. This means that YOLO doesn’t see just one object in the
image—it can see many in a single pass. That’s why it’s said to “only
look once.”</p>

<p>These examples give us a rough sense of what GPT-4o’s (hypothetical) image
embedding CNN might be shaped like. All we have to do now is play a little game
of connect the dots: how do we go from <code>512x512x3</code> to <code>13x13x12228</code> using
standard CNN layers?</p>

<p>The moves in this game are the standard building blocks we’ve seen in the
above CNN architectures. We can choose the layer types and play around with
hyperparameters like kernel size, stride length, padding strategy, etc. Note
that we ignore things like residual layers, repeated blocks, batch/layer normalization,
or <code>1x1</code> convolutional layers as these don’t affect the overall tensor size.</p>

<p>The goal is to suggest a workable CNN architecture that connects the known
input size (<code>512x512</code> images with 3 RGB color channels) to the assumed output
shape (<code>13x13</code> embedding vectors with 12,228 dimensions each.)</p>

<p>I tried
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative.png" target="_blank">several</a>
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative4.png" target="_blank">different</a>
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative2.png" target="_blank">variations</a>,
but most of these required special cases on one or more layers to “fit.” Until
I found this one, which steps down elegantly with no special cases at all:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative3.png"></p>

<p>It very neat, isn’t it? It’s almost identical to AlexNet, and it steps down
from from 512 to 13 in five identical repeating blocks, while simultaneously
quadrupling the number of channels with each block to hit 12,228 on the bottom
layer. Unfortunately, it also feels a little outdated due to the <code>5x5</code> kernels
and max pool layers. AlexNet was a breakthrough in 2012 but I would be suprised
if OpenAI was using something similar in 2024.</p>

<p>Here’s an alternative that <em>almost</em> worked (got to <code>12x12</code> instead of <code>13x13</code>)
while staying closer to the more modern YOLO design:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative4.png"></p>

<p>While impossible to prove, these speculative designs demonstrate that there are
plausible CNN architectures that could represent an image as a $k \times k$
grid of embedding vectors.</p>

<h2 id="experimental-validation">Experimental Validation</h2>

<p>Does GPT-4o really see a <code>13x13</code> grid of embedding vectors? I invented
a task, loosely inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards">Zener cards</a>, to test this. The task is to
identify the color and shape for every symbol on a grid in an image.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://gist.github.com/olooney/07850f0a2f0fcaac973ffabac765454a">simple program</a> generates test grids that look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_5x5.png"></p>

<p>I then used this prompt to obtain comparison data:</p>

<pre><code>"""Divide this image into a {k}x{k} grid and describe the shape and color of
each cell. Report your results as a JSON array of arrays (no objects or row
labels) and use all lowercase."""
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>13x13</code> hypothesis is correct, GPT-4o should do well on this task
up to about 13 and then performance should degrade. The CNN isn’t literally
dividing the image up into a grid so it might start to degrade before then,
and might struggle more with even grid sizes than odd because the cells won’t
be aligned.</p>

<p>However, that is not in fact what happens. Instead, performance is perfect for
<code>5x5</code> grids and smaller (e.g. <a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_2x2.png"><code>2x2</code></a>, <a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_3x3.png"><code>3x3</code></a>, <a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_4x4.png"><code>4x4</code></a>) but begins
to degrade rapidly after that. By the time we reach <code>13x13</code> it was no better
than chance.</p>

<p>For example, here is a <code>7x7</code> grid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_7x7.png"></p>

<p>For which GPT-4o returned this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    ["blue diamond", "purple triangle", "red plus", "purple circle", "orange square", "purple circle", "blue circle"],
    ["blue diamond", "red circle", "green plus", "red square", "orange diamond", "blue triangle", "purple plus"],
    ["blue diamond", "orange triangle", "red square", "orange square", "blue plus", "purple circle", "blue circle"],
    ["green diamond", "blue circle", "orange circle", "green circle", "purple diamond", "green triangle", "orange diamond"],
    ["purple square", "purple circle", "green plus", "green diamond", "green circle", "blue triangle", "purple triangle"],
    ["red plus", "red triangle", "purple circle", "blue triangle", "orange triangle", "red diamond", "orange diamond"],
    ["orange plus", "blue diamond", "green triangle", "green plus", "green triangle", "purple diamond", "purple square"]
]
</code></pre>

<p>It got <sup>38</sup>⁄<sub>49</sub> correct—an accuracy of 76%. The exact pattern of hits and
misses looks like this (yellow is correct, purple incorrect):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_7x7_results.png"></p>

<p>Performance continues to degrade as the grid size increases and by the time we
get to the <code>13x13</code> grid:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_13x13.png"></p>

<p>The results are no better than chance:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_13x13_results.png"></p>

<p>Does that mean I was wrong about 169 tokens representing a <code>13x13</code> grid?
Yes. Yes it does. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The great tragedy of science: the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an
ugly fact.” —Thomas Huxley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the <code>5x5</code> grid results are suggestive. GPT-4o really can keep track of 25
distinct objects and their absolute positions within in an image. Maybe the
basic concept is right; I just got the dimension wrong. It would be easy
to tack on another couple of layers to our CNN to get down to <code>5x5</code> instead
of <code>13x13</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative5.png"></p>

<p>How could we structure the output to reach 170 tokens if we assume we only use
<code>5x5</code> grids and smaller?</p>

<h2 id="pyramid-strategy">Pyramid Strategy</h2>

<p>One way to get close to both 85 and 170 is to assume that we encode the image
in a series of increasingly granular levels, like a pyramid. We start with one
embedding vector to capture a gestalt impression of the whole image, add a
<code>3x3</code> to capture left/middle/right and top/middle/bottom, then adding a <code>5x5</code>,
<code>7x7</code> etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/grids.png"></p>

<p>This strategy gets us very close to 85 tokens for the ‘master thumbnail’ if
we stop at <code>7x7</code>:</p>

<p>$1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 84$</p>

<p>And very close to 170 if we add one final <code>9x9</code> grid:</p>

<p>$1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 81 = 165$</p>

<p>If we throw in an <em>ad hoc</em> <code>2x2</code> grid for the <code>512x512</code> tile and assume one
special <code>&lt;|image start|&gt;</code> for each, we can get a perfect match:</p>

<p>$1 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 85$</p>

<p>$1 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 81 = 170$</p>

<p>This scheme lacks any sort of delimiters for the start and end of a row, but
I think that could be handled with positional encoding similar to the way
<a href="https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/">RoPE</a> is used to encode position information for text tokens, but in 2D.</p>

<p>The above takes only odd grid sizes and goes well beyond <code>5x5</code>; given that the
Zener grid performance starts to fall off after <code>5x5</code> this does not entirely
concord with the evidence.</p>

<p>As an alternative, we could try taking all the grids (even and odd) up to <code>5x5</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/grids2.png"></p>

<p>This approach gives us 55 tokens:</p>

<p>$1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2  + 5^2 = 55$</p>

<p>If we assume 3 tokens per mini-tile and a delimiter token between each, we
can get to 170:</p>

<p>$3 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2  + 5^2) + 5 = 170$</p>

<p>This isn’t fully satisfactory on numerological grounds but does jive well with
the empirical results. The pyramid strategy has a lot of intuitive appeal—it
feels like an almost “obvious” way to encode spatial information at
different zoom levels - and may explain why it does so well with the <code>5x5</code> grid
and below and so poorly on <code>6x6</code> and above.</p>

<p>It’s maddening that every hypothesis seems to come tantalizingly close to
explaining everything but the numbers never quite seem to work out neatly…
Still, these pyramid strategies are the best I’ve been able to come up with.</p>

<h2 id="optical-character-recognition">Optical Character Recognition</h2>

<p>The one thing that none of the above hypotheses explain is how GPT-4o is doing
OCR. YOLO and CLIP can’t natively do OCR, and the strategies suggested above
seem like they would struggle for the same reasons. I mean, if it can’t read
off 36 symbols in a neat <code>6x6</code> grid from an image, it certainly can’t read off
a several hundred text characters flawlessly.</p>

<p>State-of-the-art OCR engines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">Tesseract</a> do a great deal of work to
find bounding boxes and strips of characters, and then run specialized
character recognition models along those strips, one character or word at a
time. They aren’t just big CNNs.</p>

<p>And yet GPT-4o patently <em>can</em> do high-quality OCR: it can transcribe long
blocks of text, read handwritten text, or text which has been shifted, rotated,
projected, or partially occluded.</p>

<p>I have a simple theory to explain that: I think OpenAI is running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">Tesseract</a> (or their own in-house OCR) and feeding the identified text
into the transformer alongside the image data. I mean, that’s what I would do.</p>

<p>This would explain why the early versions were so easily confused by text
hidden in images: from its POV, that text <em>was</em> part of the prompt. (This is
fixed now; GPT-4o is good at ignoring malicious prompts hidden inside images.)</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/malicious_penguin.png" alt="GPT-4o passes the malicious penguin test."></p>

<p>However, this does not explain why there’s no charge per token for the text
found in an image.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, it’s actually <em>more efficient</em> to send text as images: A
<code>512x512</code> image with a small but readable font can easily fit 400-500 tokens
worth of text, yet you’re only charged for 170 input tokens plus the 85 for the
‘master thumbnail’ for a grand total of 255 tokens—far less than the
number of words on the image.</p>

<p>This theory explains why there is additional latency when processing images.
The CNN would be essentially instantaneous, but 3rd-party OCR would add
additional time. By the way, (and I’m not saying this proves anything) but the
Python environment used by the OpenAI code interpreter has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/">PyTesseract</a>
installed. You can literally just ask it to run PyTesseract on any image you’ve
uploaded to get a second opinion.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, we’ve made a lot of speculative hay out of what is essentially only one
morsel of hard fact: that OpenAI used the magic number 170.</p>

<p>However, there does seem to be a complete plausible approach—very much in
line with other CNN architectures such as YOLO—for mapping from image tiles
to embedding vectors.</p>

<p>As such, I don’t think 170 tokens is just an approximation used to bill for
roughly the amount of compute it takes to process an image. And I don’t think
they’re concatenating layers to join image and text data the way some other
multi-modal models do.</p>

<p>No, I think GPT-4o is <em>literally</em> representing <code>512x512</code> images as 170
embedding vectors, using an CNN architecture that’s a mixture of CLIP and YOLO
to embed the image directly into the transformer’s semantic vector space.</p>

<p>When I started this article, I was entirely convinced that I had cracked it
entirely, that I was going to find that the 170 tokens were for a <code>13x13</code> grid
and one additional “gestalt impression” token. That got blown out of the water
when performance on the Zener task started to degrade after <code>5x5</code>—whatever
they’re doing internally, it seems to be a lot smaller than <code>13x13</code>.</p>

<p>Still the analogy to YOLO is compelling, and the performance on the <code>5x5</code> Zener
task all but confirms that they’re doing some kind of grid. This theory has a
lot of predictive power in other areas as well: it explains how GPT-4o is able
to handle multiple images, and tasks like comparing two images, for example. It
explains how it’s able to see multiple objects in the same image, but gets
overwhelmed when there are too many objects in a busy scene. It explains
why GPT-4o seems extremely vague about the absolute and relative positions of
separate objects within the scene, and why it can’t count objects accurately
in images: when an object spans two adjacent grid cells the same classes are
activated in both so it’s not sure if it’s one object or two.</p>

<p>Ironically, the one thing this theory can’t cleanly explain is the question
which motivated this article in the first place: why 170 tokens in particular?
The pyramid theory (<code>1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x4 + 5x5</code>) was the best I was able to
come up with, and it’s not particularly neat.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from anyone who has a theory that fits a little better (or
even actual knowledge, assuming it doesn’t run afoul of an NDA!)</p>

<h2 id="postscript-alpha-channel-shenanigans">Postscript: Alpha Channel Shenanigans</h2>

<p>One other thing I noticed while working on this project is that GPT-4o
<em>ignores</em> the alpha channel, resulting in somewhat counter-intuitive behavior.</p>

<p>When I say, “ignores”, I don’t mean that it gets rid of transparency by
compositing it onto some default background, the way an image editor might
when converting PNG to JPG. No, I mean it literally just grabs the RGB channels
and ignores the alpha channel.</p>

<p>We can illustrate this with four carefully prepared images. For convenience,
I’ve used HTML and CSS to display these images on top of a checkerboard
pattern—the images themselves have flat, transparent backgrounds.
However, half have transparent <em>black</em> backgrounds, and half have transparent
<em>white</em> backgrounds.</p>

<p>What do I mean by “transparent black” or “transparent white?” Well, when we
represent an RGBA color with four bytes, the RGB bytes are still there even
when alpha is 100%. Thus, <code>(0, 0, 0, 255)</code> and <code>(255, 255, 255, 255)</code> are in
some sense different colors, even though there’s no situation where a correct
renderer would display them differently since they’re both 100% transparent.</p>

<p>Let’s ask GPT-4o what it “sees” on these four images:</p>

<div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/black_on_transparent_black.png" alt="MODICUM"></p><p>Black Text on Transparent Black Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “”</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/black_on_transparent_white.png" alt="ENORMOUS"></p><p>Black Text on Transparent White Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “ENORMOUS”</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/white_on_transparent_black.png" alt="SCINTILLA"></p><p>White Text on Transparent Black Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “SCINTILLA”</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/white_on_transparent_white.png" alt="GIGANTIC"></p><p>White Text on Transparent White Background</p>
            <p>GPT-4o Reads: “”</p>
        </div>
</div>

<p>What’s going on here? The pattern that emerges is that GPT-4o can read the
text if and only if the text color is different than the “color” of the
transparent background.</p>

<p>This tells us that GPT-4o <em>disregards</em> the alpha channel and only looks at the
RGB channels. To it, transparent black is black, transparent white is white.</p>

<p>We can see this even more clearly if we mess with an image to preserve the
three RGB channels while setting the alpha channel to 100%. Here’s a little
Pillow function to do that:</p>

<pre><code>from PIL import Image

def set_alpha(image, output_path, alpha_value):
    # copy the image and ensure it's RGBA
    image = image.convert("RGBA")

    # set the alpha channel of every pixel to the given value
    pixels = image.getdata()
    new_pixels = [(r, g, b, alpha_value) for r, g, b, a in pixels]

<p>I used that to make the two images below; they have identical RGB data, and
only differ in the alpha channel:</p>

<div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus.png" alt="Visible Platypus"></p><p>Alpha Channel = 255</p>
        </div>
    <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus_hidden.png" alt="Hidden Platypus"></p><p>Alpha Channel = 0</p>
        </div>
</div>

<p>GPT-4o has no trouble seeing the hidden platypus:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/chatgpt_hidden_platypus_test.png" alt="GPT-4o passes the hidden platypus test."></p>

<p>You can try downloading the
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus_hidden.png" download=""><code>hidden_platypus.png</code></a>
image and dropping it into ChatGPT yourself; it will correctly describe it.
You may also note the image is 39.3 KB, the same size as
<a href="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus.png" download=""><code>platypus.png</code></a>
even though PNG compression should have made it much smaller if it was really
a perfectly blank, transparent image. Or you can use the above function to
set the alpha channel back to 255, recovering the original image.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if this is bug but it’s certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">surprising</a> behavior; in
fact, it feels like something a malicious user could use to smuggle information
past humans and directly to GPT-4o. However, GPT-4o is <em>much</em> better at
detecting and ignoring malicious prompts hidden in images than GPT-4v was:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.oranlooney.com/post/gpt-cnn_files/malicious_dogs.png"></p>

<p>(You can find other examples of GPT-4o successfully detecting and
ignoring malicious prompts hidden in images in my <a href="https://olooney.github.io/image_tagger/gallery/index.html">gallery of GPT-4o test
images</a> generated by my <a href="https://github.com/olooney/image_tagger"><code>image_tagger</code></a> utility.)</p>

<p>So, even if it is a bug, it’s not obvious it can be exploited. Still, it would
be less surprising in GPT-4o “saw” the same thing that a human would in a
browser.</p>

<p dir="auto">The script to update the screen takes a location (maybe your own, maybe your best friend's, or even a fictional place!) and get the weather for that location, then generate an illustration of the location including the current weather and lighting conditions. So if it's raining, there will be people with umbrellas in the picture, and so on. If you do generate for a fictional location, the weather service will be given the latitude/longitude of the most similar place on Earth (according to GPT). The illustrations are rendered using Dall-E 3. This is why an OpenAI API token is necessary to run it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains all the code that was needed to generate and display a weather report for any specified location on a Raspberry Pi with an attached Waveshare e-Paper display.</p>

<p dir="auto">This should all run on your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p dir="auto">I recommend setting up a virtual environment for Python, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">such as uv</a>, first. Here are the instructions for if you're using <code>uv</code> (to be run inside the clone of this repo):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre>uv venv
<span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Without <code>uv</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m venv .
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre>python -m venv <span>.</span>
<span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You will need to specify an <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable. For your convenience, the code will load environment variables from a <code>.env</code> file in the current working directory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now you can use the <code>control.py</code> script to generate an image and show it on the screen:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python control.py show Barcelona"><pre>python control.py show Barcelona</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.3inch_e-Paper_HAT_(F)_Manual#Precautions" rel="nofollow">Waveshare recommends</a> you don't leave the same image on the display for too long.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use the <code>clear</code> command to clear it:</p>

<p dir="auto">I set up a cron job (<code>crontab -e</code>) to update the image two times per day, but keep in mind this can end up costing a non-trivial amount:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="0 8 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py show Barcelona
0 18 * * * cd ~/src/sol-mate-eink &amp;&amp; .venv/bin/python control.py show Barcelona

Hence, representation of the position of the hands became a decorative element that was almost as important as the face. Thus, given its high visibility, hand gestures in portraits and paintings have been one of the most effective ways of conveying secrets, codes and messages. From the historical and religious perspective, hand signs in visual art may provide clues about the underlying iconographical symbols. This paper will examine the eventual hidden meanings behind a peculiar hand gesture that has been widely used by several painters.

According to deductions made based on the artists’ work, physical depictions in artwork could be an artistic convention, a hallmark of the artist’s school, intentional or inadvertent depictions of a real disease that affected the sitter, or symbolic/religious messages or iconographical attributes. In particular, the meanings of secret hand signs and their hidden messages in artworks have intrigued art experts since the Renaissance.</p><p>During the Renaissance period, hands were as important a focus of attention as the face was, because they were the only other visible area of the body. Hence, representation of the position of the hands became a decorative element that was almost as important as the face. Thus, given its high visibility, hand gestures in portraits and paintings have been one of the most effective ways of conveying secrets, codes and messages (<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1">1</a>-<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4">4</a>). From the historical and religious perspective, hand signs in visual art may provide clues about the underlying iconographical symbols. However, because the actual intentions of the artist cannot be confirmed in the absence of historical documentation, any discussion about this topic can be only speculative (<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4">4</a>).</p><p>There is a peculiar hand gesture that is widely used by painters of several nationalities belonging to the Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque and later artistic movements: It is an unnatural position of one or both hands in which the third and fourth digits are held tight together, as if almost fused, resembling syndactyly, and the second and fifth fingers are separated from the central ones. So far, no one has attempted to understand the common meaning of this representation. Therefore, the goal of this investigation is to discuss the meanings of and to speculate about the reasons for the depiction of this unnatural finger position. Our investigation is specifically focused on the religious meaning and the cultural iconography or the secret message conveyed by the hand posture.</p><p>Here, we have studied this gesture in four different unnatural gesture across hundreds of portraits by more than eighty painters:</p><ul><li><p>- <em>The hand placed on the chest</em></p></li><li><p>- <em>The hand placed on the flank</em></p></li><li><p>- <em>The hand pointing upward to the sky or downward to the earth in a blessing position</em></p></li><li><p>- <em>The hand grasping an object or holding a person</em>.</p></li></ul></div><div id="sec1-2"><h2 id="sec1-2title">Materials</h2><p>This position can be observed in the works of several artists, including masters such as Titian, Pontormo, Bronzino, Raphal Santi, Michelangelo Buonarroti, El Greco, Raphael Mengs, Juan de Juanes, and among other painters across countries and centuries.

Although the idea that this gesture may be a content-laden symbol, a secret physical (hand) sign conveying a higher meaningful idea is fascinating, the present investigation has the purpose to dismiss the gesture to an uncommon oddity.</p><div id="sec2-1"><h3 id="sec2-1title">Hypotheses and criticism about the hand gesture</h3><p>The hand gesture that we systematically identified is not present in any of the art manuals, symbolism guidelines, religious books, sects, or secret societies in both the western and eastern world. Therefore, five basic hypotheses have been proposed to decipher the meaning of the hand gesture. They are discussed and dismissed below.</p><div id="sec3-1"><h4 id="sec3-1title">1. Crypto-Jew (Marranos) recognition </h4><p>According to this hypothesis, the gesture was a secret sign used to recognize crypto-jews each other. During the time of inquisition according to the Catholic Kings’ order of 1492, Jews living in Iberian Peninsula were forced to accept or to leave Spain. Many Jews, although converted, continued to practice Judaism in secret, especially in the judería, which was the old Jewish barrio (neighbourhood) of Toledo. These last Jews were called crypto-Jews or Marranos, which means <em>Christianized Jew</em>, <em>swine</em>, or <em>pig</em> in medieval Spanish. The derogatory term was used to refer to the ritual prohibition against eating pork, which was adhered to by both Jews and Muslims. In the modern Spanish language, <em>Marrano</em> still means <em>pig</em> or <em>dirty</em>, but it is no longer commonly connoted with religious contents.</p><p>Oppenhejm in his book suggested that the hand gesture was a type of a 16<sup>th</sup> century secret sign used in Toledo among the crypto-Jews (i.e. false Christians) to recognize each other (<a href="#ref12" rid="ref12">12</a>). Although this meaning of the hand gesture may be associated with the sitters of the Spanish painter of that time, a lot of criticism has been raised because such signs/symbols are not illustrated or mentioned in any of the full-bodied Sephardic and Kabbalistic manuscripts/books from this period or their antecedents. Indeed, it would be unrealistic to assume that all the Iberian (or those who worked there) painters, such as El Greco, Luis El Divino Morales, and Juan de Juanes, were Jewish or that their patrons and sitters were Jewish. In addition, the term <em>Marrano</em> was mostly used in Toledo’s judería, and not all the Spanish painters included in this investigation came from there or were working there. Therefore, it is possible that Oppenhejm confounded the gesture of the hand (herein analysed) with the well-known symbol in which the thumbs with the second and third fingers of each hand are held touching each other and separated from the fourth and the fifth fingers, conceiving a sort of fan also known as the Kohanic Blessing. This last symbol can be found carved on Jewish tombstones throughout Europe; for centuries, it has represented a cosmic symbol, and even in modern times, the gesture refers to ‘an ancient matriarchal sign for strength and power’ (<a href="#ref13" rid="ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref14" rid="ref14">14</a>). Finally, there is no letter or religious gesture, Hebrew or otherwise, similar to the splayed hand. Therefore, the stylized gesture of the hand investigated in this paper is actually non-existent in the known Hebrew tradition of the 16th century, whereas the gesture of the Kohanic blessing existed for centuries prior to that period. Thus, the hypothesis of a widespread depiction of Marranos’ hand recognition sign in several portraits seems inconsistent.</p></div><div id="sec3-2"><h4 id="sec3-2title">2. Freemasonry or Masonic membership and rank </h4><p>According to this hypothesis, the gesture was a secret sign used to recognize masonic followers each other. The enigmatic posture of the hand has fascinated a lot of scholars of hidden societies, who cryptically connoted the unusual splayed fingers with the letter M, which indicated not only Masonic membership and rank, but also possession of occult secrets. The speculation that the hand gesture herein presented is a freemasonry’s conveyed code is fascinating, but it is hard to accept.</p></div><div id="sec3-3"><h4 id="sec3-3title">3. Satanism (multiple V’s and I’s for 666) </h4><p>According to this hypothesis, the gesture was a secret sign conveying satanic meanings. The hand gesture may be read as the letters M and W, which may be interpreted as multiple V’s and I’s to symbolise 666. This is because the letter V is pronounced as ‘waw’ in Hebrew and ‘vav’ in Gematria and is the 6th letter in both alphabets. However, there is no evidence to show that Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque art had any connection with Satanism.</p></div><div id="sec3-4"><h4 id="sec3-4title">4. De’ Medici family membership </h4><p>According to this hypothesis, the gesture was a secret sign used to recognize a sitter as a member of the De’ Medici family. In portraits of Cosimo and his family by Bronzino, each are shown making the distinct hand gesture resembling an <em>M</em>. Some argue that this sign indicates their membership in the Medici family. However, this gesture is not uniquely depicted in members of the Medici family. In fact, it is more likely that the gesture conveyed modesty. Indeed, this gesture can be observed in the ‘<em>modest Venus</em>’ (also known as <em>Venus Pudica</em> and later popularized as <em>Medici Venus</em>) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F9/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F9" rid-ob="ob-F9" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F9"><span>Figure 9</span></a>), which is a 1<sup>st</sup> century BC marble copy of a an original bronze Greek sculpture depicting the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. Some scholars argue that the gesture seen in the Medici portraits may be an allusion to this modesty. The widespread depiction of the gesture in portraits of the de Medici family created by Bronzino (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F8/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F8" rid-ob="ob-F8" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F8"><span>Figure 8</span></a>)and the paintings of artists that followed makes this speculation interesting, but it is hard to accept it as a unifying explanation.</p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div id="F9" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F9"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F9/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F9" rid-ob="ob-F9"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--><p><img loading="lazy" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.

Ignacio de Loyola’s gesture for the atonement of sins </h4><p>According to this hypothesis, the gesture was a sign with a religious meaning used during the spiritual exercises by Jesuits. San Ignacio de Loyola (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F7/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F7" rid-ob="ob-F7" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F7"><span>Figure 7</span></a>) founded the Jesuits’ Order in 1541 and became its first Superior General. The Saint used to recommend a gesture for believers in his spiritual exercises: ‘each time one falls into sin, in laying the hand on the breast whilst inciting one’s inner self to grief.’ (15). After analysing the paintings of one of the painters herein referenced (El Greco), Cassou in 1934 proposed that the painter wanted to depict the gesture with the hand placed on the chest as a sign of moral pain in sinners who were in the act of committing a sin (<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16">16</a>). Later on, Veronica de Osa embraced the same hypothesis in her novel, <em>The mystic finger symbol of El Greco</em> (1956) (<a href="#ref17" rid="ref17">17</a>). However, this speculation does not explain the widespread presence of the gesture in paintings. The ‘Spiritual Exercises’ of Loyola was published in the middle of the 16<sup>th</sup> century (1548), at which time some of the painters had already depicted their sitters with that hand gesture. It may be interesting to accept the Loyolan theory for this gesture, in the case of artists who incorporated this hand gesture after the publication of Jesuit rules, but the hypothesis is still weak.</p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div id="F7" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F7"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F7/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F7" rid-ob="ob-F7"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--><p><img loading="lazy" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.

In addition, Loyola warned against the display of the act of penance in public: it could be done ‘even in the presence of many others but without their perceiving what the sinner is doing’. Therefore, it would be unlikely that the sitter displayed the act of penance in a painting because it was prohibited outdoors according to Loyolan laws. Further, based on the universal application of the hand gesture in the artworks of so many painters, it seems unlikely that they are trying to depict the same spiritual sense or feeling of penitence. Another speculation that goes against this hypothesis is that many painters have depicted this stylized gesture in Christ, the Virgin, and other figures of Saints, too. However, it is not likely that they would depict such a gesture symbolizing suffering and regret for sinning among non-sinning deities. Thus, it seems unrealistic to label the hand gesture herein investigated as a Loyolan content-label symbol.</p></div></div></div><div id="sec1-4"><h2 id="sec1-4title">Discussion</h2><p>The present retrospective investigation tried to shed light on the reasons why a peculiar hand gesture resembling syndactyly was depicted in hundreds of paintings by various artists, including the great masters, such as Titian, Bronzino, El Greco, Parmigianino, François Clouet, Hans Memling, Anton Raphael Mengs and Luis el Divino Morales, who adopted this sign in dozens of portraits produced by them (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F1/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F1" rid-ob="ob-F1" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F1"><span>Figures 1</span></a>-<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233791/figure/F8/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F8" rid-ob="ob-F8" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F8"><span>​</span><span>8</span></a>).</p><p>An inaccurate depiction of the model inadvertently drawn by an artist seems unlikely given their high reputation and because of the large number of paintings in which the same hand gesture has been depicted. Indeed, the pre-Renaissance simplified and ordinary hand depictions were substituted with a more truthful and anatomically accurate hand drawing by the Renaissance artists, who captured the static and dynamic complexity of hands (<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5" rid="ref5">5</a>). Moreover, in almost all of their works, Renaissance painters provided detailed preliminary studies through cartoons, drawings, sketches or designs, and an erroneous depiction of an abnormal finger position would not have been repeated by accident, especially as such mistakes would have been adjusted in the final piece. Further, since this gesture is found in several portraits by painters belonging to different ages, nationalities and artistic movements, and it is not limited to sitters of a particular age or family, they are most probably stylistic features of the artists’ work rather than accurate depictions of anomalies in the subjects’ hands. Therefore, although some of the paintings included in the present investigation show human figures with the fingers depicted as resembling syndactyly involving the third and the fourth fingers, it is most likely that the artists in their career merged attributes from various models to create an idealized beauty of the hand.</p><p>In conclusion, a lot of Renaissance and later artists are known indeed to have regularly shown finger anomalies in their paintings for stylistic reasons (<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5" rid="ref5">5</a>); moreover, it is highly improbable that there was a veritable epidemic of syndactyly in the 15<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup> century in Europe. Our investigation suggests instead that it was fashionable to be depicted with certain types of hand gestures, and that this feature signified grace, elegance and refinement rather than deformity. Several members of the Renaissance and later movements used this unnatural depiction of the fingers following an artistic trend of that period to imbue and to idealize the delicacy and the grace of the hand depiction. It should be considered an artistic device or a symbolic hallmark without any conveyed meaning rather than a true pathologic depiction of syndactyly.</p></div><div id="sec1-5"><h2 id="sec1-5title">Conflict of interest:</h2><!--/article/back/sec/--><p>Each author declares that he or she has no commercial associations (e.g. consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangement etc.) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article</p></div><div id="ref-list-a.m.b"><h2 id="ref-list-a.m.btitle">References</h2><div id="reference-list"><p>1. <span>Ram AN, Chung KC.

            The United States continues to have a higher rate of women dying in pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum compared with all other high-income nations, even despite <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/health/maternal-mortality-cdc-report/">recent declines</a> in the US maternal death rate, a new report shows.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtajji400033b6jebi0wxyz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            There were about 22 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in the United States in 2022, the most recent year for which data was available. That rate was more than double, sometimes triple, those seen in most other high-income countries that year, according to the <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/jun/insights-us-maternal-mortality-crisis-international-comparison" target="_blank">report released Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund</a>, a private foundation focused on health care-related issues.

            And the rate of maternal deaths among Black women in the United States remains even higher, at nearly 50 deaths per 100,000 live births, the new report shows.

            Meanwhile, half of the high-income nations in the new report had fewer than 5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, and one country recorded zero maternal deaths: Norway.

            Unlike Norway and some other peer nations, “the US has a maternal care workforce shortage problem, which is only supposed to get worse,” said&nbsp;Munira&nbsp;Gunja, lead author of the report and senior researcher at the International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovations at the Commonwealth Fund.

            In the United States, she noted, there is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/health/midwives-doulas-every-mother-counts-wellness/index.html">limited access to midwives</a>, who provide support to a patient from the prenatal period through postpartum.

            “We have an under-supply of midwives, and midwives are underutilized, whereas in most other countries, midwives greatly outnumber ob-gyns. They’re part of their health care systems. Midwifery care is not integrated enough into our system,” Gunja said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwuo3eb300033b6jg5fz5acn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            In the United States, “there&nbsp;are several barriers to&nbsp;getting midwifery care, and other countries just don’t have that. They’re able to make sure that every woman has access to care, whether it be in some cases an ob-gyn and in most cases a midwife,” she said. “In the US, we’re the only country in this analysis without a universal health system. Nearly 8 million women of reproductive age are without health insurance.”

            Researchers at the Commonwealth Fund analyzed maternal mortality data from 14 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtajji400083b6jj2ir6emw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The data, which came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, showed that the top three nations with the highest maternal death rate were the United States, Chile and New Zealand. Chile and New Zealand each recorded about 14 deaths per 100,000 live births.

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtajji400093b6jt2hlzzgu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The three nations with the lowest maternal death rate were Norway with zero, Switzerland with a rate of 1 death per 100,000 live births and Sweden with about 3 deaths per 100,000 live births.

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtajji4000b3b6jjfu4e6bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, maternal death rates increased in Australia, Japan, the Netherlands and the US, according to the report, which notes that the increase may have been due to a rise in Covid-related infections, complications worsened by the virus or delays or decreased access to care at the time. More recently, maternal death rates have started to decline in Chile, Norway and the US.

            The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/health/maternal-mortality-cdc-report/index.html">US maternal mortality rate fell</a> from 32.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021 to 22.3 per 100,000 in 2022, according to data from the CDC.

            “It is encouraging to see fewer maternal deaths in the U.S. in 2022, however the U.S. is still such an outlier, and the racial disparities are profoundly disturbing,” Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a news release.

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtajji4000e3b6jjx3rvmar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “It is time to center equity by diversifying the workforce and addressing head on the racial inequities in health care quality and access,” she said. “Now is the time to prioritize what we know is already working well in other countries: expanded health insurance coverage, stronger workforce and support systems, and paid maternity leave.”

            The new report points to the US health care system, policy differences and maternity care deserts – where residents have limited or no access to maternity health care – as among the factors driving the high US maternal mortality rate.

            The US and Canada have the lowest overall supply of midwives and ob-gyns to care for pregnant and postpartum mothers, with only 16 and 13 providers per 1,000 live births respectively, according to the new report. In Canada, the maternal death rate is estimated to be about 8 deaths per 100,000 live births.

            More than 2.2 million US women of childbearing age – 15 to 44 – live in maternity care deserts, a<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/health/maternity-care-deserts-march-of-dimes-report/index.html"> report by the nonprofit March of Dimes</a> found in 2022. And last year, a separate analysis found that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/health/maternity-care-deserts-march-of-dimes/index.html">hospitals in a 10th of US counties</a> have lost their childbirth units in the past five years.

            Midwives “could help address maternity workforce shortages in the U.S., where nearly half of counties lack a single ob-gyn. An estimated 8,000 more ob-gyns are needed to meet demand — a number that may rise to 22,000 by 2050,” according to the new report.

            Additionally, nearly two-thirds of maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period, up to 42 days after giving birth, and US women are least likely to have postpartum home visits, according to the new report. All the countries in the report, apart from the US, guarantee at least one home visit within a week postpartum. On the state level, only some Medicaid programs in the US cover these visits.

            “The World Health Organization recommends at least four health contacts in the first six weeks following birth, yet two of five U.S. women — more often than not younger, low-income, and uninsured — skip their one postpartum check-up,” according to the new report.

            In the first week postpartum, the most common contributors to maternal deaths were severe bleeding, high blood pressure and infection, while cardiomyopathy – a heart muscle disease – was the leading cause of deaths later in the postpartum period, according to the new report.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clwtajji4000o3b6jnj4lk1ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The US also stands alone as the only high-income country where there is no federally mandated paid leave policy for postpartum mothers, according to the new report. US women are less likely to have guaranteed paid leave compared with women in other high-income nations, where at least 14 weeks of paid leave from work is mandated.
    </p>

            “Maternal deaths are a preventable problem, and this problem can be solved. A lot of countries have been able to figure out ways to make it so that all women are in safe hands when it comes to having a baby and after giving birth. We need to extend that to women in the US as well,” Gunja said. “We know most deaths are during the postpartum period – so making sure we have federally mandated paid leave, making sure we make it easy for women to get postpartum care, which means having home visits and not making women go to the doctor.”

            Racial disparities in maternal death rates persist not only in the United States but in other parts of the world where some women have less access to postpartum support, according to the new report.

            “In the United Kingdom, for example, Black women are four times more likely to die than white women are. In Australia, Aboriginal women are about twice as likely as non-Aboriginal women to die from maternal complications,” the researchers wrote.

            “Our findings suggest that an undersupply of maternity providers, especially midwives, and lack of access to comprehensive postpartum support, including maternity care coverage and mandated paid maternity leave, are contributing factors,” they wrote. “Because both these factors disproportionately affect women of color, centering equity in any future policy changes will be a key to addressing the crisis.”

            The Commonwealth Fund’s report “highlights the need to have enhanced maternal health care and maternal health equity in the US,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aafp.org/about/meet-our-leadership/board/iroku-malize.html" target="_blank">Dr.&nbsp;Tochi&nbsp;Iroku-Malize</a>, a family physician in Long Island, New York, and board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, who was not involved in the new report.

            “For us in family medicine, we know that we do play a crucial role in providing the obstetric care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period, which is needed, and maternal health care cannot stop after a patient gives birth,” she said, calling on her US colleagues to watch out for maternal health complications – such as inflammation of the heart muscle or mental health conditions – in their postpartum patients, as the majority of maternal deaths occur during that time.

            “A postpartum patient’s body is still going through immense physical, hormonal and emotional changes that you really cannot overlook,” she said. “And our training as family physicians, it helps us to screen and address the full spectrum of physical, emotional and social needs during pregnancy and the postpartum period.”

            “ACOG recommends that expectant mothers engage as active partners in their care, attend their scheduled appointments during and after pregnancy, and consider pregnancy planning in order to optimize pregnancy outcomes,” she added. “Finally, patients need to feel empowered to voice their concerns to their healthcare&nbsp;providers, and for their providers to listen to their concerns and work collaboratively with patients for resolution of their&nbsp;concerns.”

            “Despite capturing different time periods and using different methodologies, what we can confidently take away from these reports is that the number of maternal deaths in this country is still unacceptably high,” Zahn, who was not involved in the Commonwealth Fund’s latest report, wrote in an email.

            “In 2016, the public was surprised to learn from a widely publicized study in The Lancet that the United States had the highest rate of maternal mortality compared to other developed countries. The Commonwealth Fund report shows that nearly a decade later this is still the case. This is obviously disheartening news, but we also must acknowledge that, despite the collective effort put toward improving maternal health outcomes, we have faced tremendous setbacks,” Zahn said, referring to disruptions in access to care due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the overturning of Roe v. Wade and ongoing health inequities resulting in racial and ethnic disparities.

            “The areas of weakness in our policies and systems have been longstanding pain points and are clearly all contributors to the poor maternal health outcomes we are experiencing today,” he added.&nbsp;“ACOG will continue its work in improving quality and safety in maternal health care, educating its members on the necessity of eliminating racism and bias in medicine and advocating for policies that are supportive of both clinicians and patients in an effort to improve outcomes.”

<p dir="auto">dblab is a fast and lightweight interactive terminal based UI application for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3,
written in Go and works on OSX, Linux and Windows machines. Main idea behind using Go for backend development
is to utilize ability of the compiler to produce zero-dependency binaries for
multiple platforms. dblab was created as an attempt to build very simple and portable
application to work with local or remote PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite3/Oracle databases.</p>

<p dir="auto">Enter previous flags every time is tedious, so <code>dblab</code> provides a couple of flags to help with it: <code>--config</code> and <code>--cfg-name</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>dblab</code> is going to look for a file called <code>.dblab.yaml</code>. Currently, there are three places where you can drop a config file:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.dblab.yaml)</li>
<li>$HOME ($HOME/.dblab.yaml)</li>
<li>. (the current directory where you run the command line tool)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use this feature, <code>--config</code> is mandatory and <code>--cfg-name</code> may be omitted. The config file can store one or multiple database connection sections under the <code>database</code> field. <code>database</code> is an array, previously was an object only able to store a single connection section at a time.</p>
<p dir="auto">We strongly encourgae you to adopt the new format as of <code>v0.18.0</code>. <code>--cfg-name</code> takes the name of the desired database section to connect with. It can be omitted and its default values will be the first item on the array.</p>
<p dir="auto">As of <code>v0.21.0</code>, ssl connections options are supported in the config file.</p>

<p dir="auto">If the query panel is active, type the desired query and press <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> to see the results on the rows panel below.
Otherwise, you might me located at the tables panel, then you can navigate by using the arrows <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> (or the keys <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>j</kbd> respectively). If you want to see the rows of a table, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. To see the the schema of a table, locate yourself on the <code>rows</code> panel and press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to switch to the <code>structure</code> panel, then switch <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to switch back.
The same can be achieved for the <code>constraints</code> view by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> to go back and forth between the <code>rows</code> and the <code>constraints</code> panels.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, there's a menu to navigate between hidden views by just clicking on the desired options:</p>

<p dir="auto">As you may have noticed, navigation has already been added, so every time you query the content of a listed table, the result set is going to be paginated. This allows to the user dealing with large tables, optimizing resources.
Just hit the <code>BACK</code> and <code>NEXT</code> buttons to go back and forth.</p>
