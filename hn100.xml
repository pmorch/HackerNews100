<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    

    <div>
        <p>I have an incredibly boring summer hobby: looking at the changelog for the <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">WebKit Github repo</a>. Why? Because I spend a chunk of my professional life working with webviews inside mobile apps and I like to get an early peek into what's coming in the next version of iOS. Since Tim Cook has yet to stand up at WWDC and announce "one more thing... Service Worker support in WKWebView, provided you add the correct entry to the <code>WKAppBoundDomains</code> array in your <code>Info.plist</code>" (and you know what, he <em>should</em>) manual research is the order of the day.</p><p>So I was really interested to see, the day after WWDC finished, a pull request named:</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/46754/files?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">[Materials] Rename "hosted blur" materials to reference "glass"</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">Liquid Glass</a> was one of the big takeaways from 2025's WWDC. Probably the biggest change in iOS UI since iOS 7 ditched the skeuomorphic look of the past. But that's all native UI, what does any of that have to do with webviews?</p><p>A poke around the context of the PR revealed something really interesting: Apple has a custom CSS property named <code>-apple-visual-effect</code> . Not only does it allow the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 (via values like <code>-apple-system-glass-material</code>) but all versions support using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials?ref=alastair.is#Standard-materials" rel="noreferrer">standard materials</a> with values like <code>-apple-system-blur-material-thin</code>.</p><h3 id="yes-it-works-and-no-we-cant">Yes it works and no, we can't</h3><p>Before you, like me, fire up Safari and start editing some CSS, I have bad news: no, it doesn't work on the web. As well it shouldn't. But it <em>also</em> doesn't work by default in an app using WKWebView, you have to toggle a setting in WKPreferences called <code>useSystemAppearance</code>... and it's <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/613c42873c56e2b2073f91b2983eec825be6a791/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKPreferencesInternal.h?ref=alastair.is#L59" rel="noreferrer">private</a>. So if you use it, say goodbye to App Store approval.</p><p>I wanted to try it out all the same so I hacked around to set <code>useSystemAppearance</code> to true, set my CSS to:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
}</code></pre><p>lo and behold, it works!</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Whoever it was at Apple that decided to make this a CSS property is a genius because it makes it incredibly easy to provide different rules based on Liquid Glass support:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
  background: rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.7);
}

@supports (-apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material) {
  background: transparent;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material
}</code></pre><h2 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h2><p>It's an interesting piece of trivia but no-one outside of Apple can use it. So what does it matter? It doesn't. Except for the implication for what I'll call Alastair's Grand Theory of In-App Webviews. Industry wide they don't have a great reputation. But my suggestion is this: <strong>the main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don't notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly.</strong></p><p>It stands to reason that Apple wouldn't have developed this feature if they weren't using it. Where? We have no idea. But they must be using it <em>somewhere</em>. The fact that none of us have noticed exactly where suggests that we're interacting with webviews in our daily use of iOS without ever even realising it.</p><p>Food for thought!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="preface">Preface<a href="#preface" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>This article is <em>NOT</em> served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click <a href="http://ewaste.fka.wtf/">here</a>. The content is otherwise identical.</p><h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for “future” projects (It’s not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as “disposable”. Thankfully, I don’t plan on pursuing law anytime soon.</p><p>Last year, I was tearing apart some of these fancier pacifiers for adults when I noticed something that caught my eye, instead of the expected black blob of goo hiding some ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) I see a little integrated circuit inscribed “PUYA”.
I don’t blame you if this name doesn’t excite you as much it does me, most people have never heard of them. They are most well known for their flash chips, but I first came across them after reading Jay Carlson’s blog post about <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/">the cheapest flash microcontroller you can buy</a>. They are quite capable little ARM Cortex-M0+ micros.</p><p>Over the past year I have collected quite a few of these PY32 based vapes, all of them from different models of vape from the same manufacturer. It’s not my place to do free advertising for big tobacco, so I won’t mention the brand I got it from, but if anyone who worked on designing them reads this, thanks for labeling the debug pins!</p><h2 id="what-are-we-working-with">What are we working with<a href="#what-are-we-working-with" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The chip is marked <code>PUYA C642F15</code>, which wasn’t very helpful. I was pretty sure it was a <code>PY32F002A</code>, but after poking around with <a href="http://pyocd.io/">pyOCD</a>, I noticed that the flash was 24k and we have 3k of RAM. The extra flash meant that it was more likely a <code>PY32F002B</code>, which is actually a very different chip.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>So here are the specs of a microcontroller so <em>bad</em>, it’s basically disposable:</p><ul><li>24MHz Coretex M0+</li><li>24KiB of Flash Storage</li><li>3KiB of Static RAM</li><li>a few peripherals, none of which we will use.</li></ul><p>You may look at those specs and think that it’s not much to work with. I don’t blame you, a 10y old phone can barely load google, and this is about 100x slower. I on the other hand see a <em>blazingly</em> fast web server.</p><h2 id="getting-online">Getting online<a href="#getting-online" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The idea of hosting a web server on a vape didn’t come to me instantly. In fact, I have been playing around with them for a while, but after writing my post on <a href="https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/insights/jlink-rtt-for-the-masses/">semihosting</a>, the penny dropped.</p><p>If you don’t feel like reading that article, semihosting is basically syscalls for embedded ARM microcontrollers. You throw some values/pointers into some registers and call a breakpoint instruction. An attached debugger interprets the values in the registers and performs certain actions. Most people just use this to get some logs printed from the microcontroller, but they are actually bi-directional.</p><p>If you are older than me, you might remember a time before Wi-Fi and Ethernet, the dark ages, when you had to use dial-up modems to get online. You might also know that the ghosts of those modems still linger all around us. Almost all USB serial devices actually emulate those modems: a 56k modem is just 57600 baud serial device. Data between some of these modems was transmitted using a protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>This may not come as a surprise, but Linux (and with some tweaking even macOS) supports SLIP. The <code>slattach</code> utility can make any <code>/dev/tty*</code> send and receive IP packets. All we have to do is put the data down the wire in the right format and provide a virtual tty.
This is actually easier than you might imagine, pyOCD can forward all semihosting though a telnet port. Then, we use <code>socat</code> to link that port to a virtual tty:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>pyocd gdb -S -O semihost_console_type<span>=</span>telnet -T <span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>PYOCDFLAGS<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>socat PTY,link<span>=</span><span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span>,raw,echo<span>=</span><span>0</span> TCP:localhost:<span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span>,nodelay &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo slattach -L -p slip -s <span>115200</span> <span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip addr add 192.168.190.1 peer 192.168.190.2/24 dev sl0
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip link set mtu <span>1500</span> up dev sl0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, so we have a “modem”, but that’s hardly a web server. To actually talk TCP/IP, we need an IP stack. There are many choices, but I went with <a href="https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip/tree/uip-0-9">uIP</a> because it’s pretty small, doesn’t require an RTOS, and it’s easy to port to other platforms.
It also, helpfully, comes with a very minimal HTTP server example.</p><p>After porting the SLIP code to use semihosting, I had a working web server…half of the time.
As with most highly optimised libraries, uIP was designed for 8 and 16-bit machines, which rarely have memory alignment requirements. On ARM however, if you dereference a <code>u16 *</code>, you better hope that address is even, or you’ll get an exception. The <code>uip_chksum</code> assumed <code>u16</code> alignment, but the script that creates the filesystem didn’t.
I actually decided to modify a bit the structure of the filesystem to make it a bit more portable.
This was my first time working with <code>perl</code> and I have to say, it’s quite well suited to this kind of task.</p><h2 id="blazingly-fast">Blazingly fast<a href="#blazingly-fast" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>So how fast is a web server running on a disposable microcontroller. Well, initially, not very fast. Pings took ~1.5s with 50% packet loss and a simple page took over 20s to load. That’s so bad, it’s actually funny, and I kind of wanted to leave it there.</p><p>However, the problem was actually between the seat and the steering wheel the whole time. The first implementation read and wrote a single character at a time, which had a massive overhead associated with it. I previously benchmarked semihosting on this device, and I was getting ~20KiB/s, but uIP’s SLIP implementation was designed for very low memory devices, so it was serialising the data byte by byte.
We have a whopping 3kiB of RAM to play with, so I added a ring buffer to cache reads from the host and feed them into the SLIP poll function. I also split writes in batches to allow for escaping.</p><p>Now this is what I call blazingly fast! Pings now take 20ms, no packet loss and a full page loads in about 160ms. This was using using almost all of the RAM, but I could also dial down the sizes of the buffer to have more than enough headroom to run other tasks. The project repo has everything set to a nice balance latency and RAM usage:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:        5116 B        24 KB     20.82%
             RAM:        1380 B         3 KB     44.92%
</code></pre><p>For this blog however, I paid for none of the RAM, so I’ll use all of the RAM.</p><p>As you may have noticed, we have just under 20kiB (80%) of storage space. That may not be enough to ship all of React, but as you can see, it’s more than enough to host this entire blog post.
And this is not just a static page server, you can run any server-side code you want, if you know C that is.</p><p>Just for fun, I added a json api endpoint to get the number of requests to the main page (since the last crash) and the unique ID of the microcontroller.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/BogdanTheGeek/semihost-ip">Code for this project</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>In the past couple of months, I published a number of articles on recreational math. I did my best to keep them accessible and fun, but my goal was usually to shed light at deeper mathematical truths. For example, the discussion of </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/09999-1" rel="">0.999… = 1</a><span> served as a springboard to highlight some of the subtler properties of real numbers and the different meanings of infinity.</span></p><p><span>Today, I have no agenda. This article exists because I discovered a somewhat obscure paper that says something unexpected and cool. It </span><em>feels</em><span> profound, it probably isn’t… and if you keep reading, it’s going to live rent-free in your head too.</span></p><p>Topologists are an odd bunch: they study the continuity of geometric shapes with no regard for appearances. To them, continuous transformations — such as stretching and squeezing — are of no consequence. A donut and a drinking straw are the same because you can knead one into another without making or mending any holes.</p><p><span>Fundamentally, a topologist doesn’t care about the distance between two points in space: all that matters is a more narrow concept of local continuity. Because of this, the practitioners often choose to lean on stripped-down geometrical spaces in which the notion of distance — also known as a </span><em>metric </em><span>— is simply not defined.</span></p><p><span>That said, if you’re not a topologist, you probably enjoy being able to measure stuff. In standard Euclidean geometry with two dimensions, if we have two points that are separated by </span><em>x</em><span> horizontally and </span><em>y</em><span> vertically, the resulting straight-line distance can be calculated as:</span></p><p>One of the most common ways to construct non-Euclidean spaces is to alter the space’s metric in some way. An example that should be familiar to many software engineers is the taxicab metric, also known as the Manhattan distance. It’s named so by analogy to a cab navigating a rectangular grid of streets, charging you per mile traveled:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png" width="1456" height="764" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:764,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:263113,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/173625523?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Drc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ada872d-41dd-495e-917a-2dfdf67d4859_2332x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>An illustration of the taxicab distance.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In the taxicab universe, the distance between two points is a simple sum of the absolute distances in each axis: </span><em>d</em><sub>taxicab</sub><em> = |x| + |y|.</em><span> If we take another look at the earlier case — </span><em>d = √(x² + y²) — </em><span>it’s tempting to express the cab equation in an analogous way:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(d_\textrm{taxicab} = \sqrt[1 \ ]{\lvert x \rvert^1 + \lvert y \rvert^1}\)</span></p></div><p>If we look at these two formulas — Euclidean and taxicab — it’s clear that we can generalize this to a whole family of related metric spaces:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(d_n = \sqrt[n \ ]{\lvert x \rvert^n + \lvert y \rvert^n}\)</span></p></div><p><span>Again, the case of </span><em>n</em><span> = 1 is the taxicab universe; </span><em>n = 2</em><span> nets us the standard Euclidean space.

It’s tempting to say that each quadrant is just the diagonal of a 1×1 square (= √2), so the circumference is 4·√2. The diameter of the circle is </span><em>2</em><span>·</span><em>r</em><span> =</span><em> </em><span>2. Hence, the value of the taxicab </span><em>π</em><span> (</span><em><span>π</span><sub>1</sub></em><span>) must be 4·√2/2 ≈ 2.828.</span></p><p><span>Except… that’s a bit of a category error. We’re attempting to measure the circumference of a circle drawn in a non-Euclidean space by using the Euclidean definition of length. In the taxicab space, the diagonal of a 1×1 square is not √2; it’s a simple sum of the edges of the square.

								<p><b>Unlike most planetarium software</b>, Celestia doesn't confine you to the surface of the Earth. You can travel throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or even beyond the galaxy.</p>
								<p><b>All movement in Celestia is seamless</b>. The exponential zoom feature lets you explore space across a huge range of scales, from galaxy clusters down to spacecraft only a few meters across. A 'point-and-goto' interface makes it simple to navigate through the universe to the object you want to visit.</p>
								<p><b>Celestia is expandable</b>. Celestia comes with a large catalog of stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and spacecraft. If that's not enough, you can download dozens of easy to install add-ons with more objects.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Pig-butchering scams have emerged as a complex form of fraud that combines elements of romance, investment fraud, and advanced social engineering tactics to systematically exploit victims. In this paper, we present the first qualitative analysis of pig-butchering scams, informed by in-depth semi-structured interviews with $N=26$ victims. We capture nuanced, first-hand accounts from victims, providing insight into the lifecycle of pig-butchering scams and the complex emotional and financial manipulation involved. We systematically analyze each phase of the scam, revealing that perpetrators employ tactics such as staged trust-building, fraudulent financial platforms, fabricated investment returns, and repeated high-pressure tactics, all designed to exploit victims' trust and financial resources over extended periods. Our findings reveal an organized scam lifecycle characterized by emotional manipulation, staged financial exploitation, and persistent re-engagement efforts that amplify victim losses. We also find complex psychological and financial impacts on victims, including heightened vulnerability to secondary scams. Finally, we propose actionable intervention points for social media and financial platforms to curb the prevalence of these scams and highlight the need for non-stigmatizing terminology to encourage victims to report and seek assistance.

        <p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&amp;ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">3Blue1Brown video series</a> on transformer models, Grant Sanderson posed a fascinating question: How can a relatively modest embedding space of 12,288 dimensions (GPT-3) accommodate millions of distinct real-world concepts? </p><p>The answer lies at the intersection of high-dimensional geometry and a remarkable mathematical result known as the <a href="https://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/JL-Johnson.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma</a>. While exploring this question, I discovered something unexpected that led to an interesting collaboration with Grant and a deeper understanding of vector space geometry. </p><p>The key insight begins with a simple observation: while an N-dimensional space can only hold N perfectly orthogonal vectors, relaxing this constraint to allow for "quasi-orthogonal" relationships (vectors at angles of, say, 85-95 degrees) dramatically increases the space's capacity. This property is crucial for understanding how language models can efficiently encode semantic meaning in relatively compact embedding spaces.</p><p>In Grant's video, he demonstrated this principle with an experiment attempting to fit 10,000 unit vectors into a 100-dimensional space while maintaining near-orthogonal relationships. The visualization suggested success, showing angles clustered between 89-91 degrees. However, when I implemented the code myself, I noticed something interesting about the optimization process.</p><p>The original loss function was elegantly simple: </p><div><p>               loss = (dot_products.abs()).relu().sum()</p><p>While this loss function appears perfect for an unbounded ℝᴺ space, it encounters two subtle but critical issues when applied to vectors constrained to a high-dimensional unit sphere:</p></div><ol><li><strong>The Gradient Trap</strong>: The dot product between vectors is the cosine of the angle between them, and the gradient is the sine of this angle. This creates a perverse incentive structure: when vectors approach the desired 90-degree relationship, the gradient (sin(90°) = 1.0) strongly pushes toward improvement. However, when vectors drift far from the goal (near 0° or 180°), the gradient (sin(0°) ≈ 0) vanishes—effectively trapping these badly aligned vectors in their poor configuration.</li><li><strong>The 99% Solution</strong>: The optimizer discovered a statistically favorable but geometrically perverse solution. For each vector, it would be properly orthogonal to 9,900 out of 9,999 other vectors while being nearly parallel to just 99. This configuration, while clearly not the intended outcome, actually represented a global minimum for the loss function—mathematically similar to taking 100 orthogonal basis vectors and replicating each one roughly 100 times.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1169" height="624" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.33.59-PM.png 1169w"></figure><p>This stable configuration was particularly insidious because it satisfied 99% of the constraints while being fundamentally different from the desired constellation of evenly spaced, quasi-orthogonal vectors. To address this, I modified the loss function to use an exponential penalty that increases aggressively as dot products grow:</p><p>               loss = exp(20*dot_products.abs()**2).sum()         (<a href="https://github.com/NickYoder86/Johnson-Lindenstrauss?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Full code here</a>)</p><p>This change produced the desired behavior, though with a revealing result: the maximum achievable pairwise angle was around 76.5 degrees, not 89 degrees. </p><p>This discovery led me down a fascinating path exploring the fundamental limits of vector packing in high-dimensional spaces, and how these limits relate to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.</p><p>When I shared these findings with Grant, his response exemplified the collaborative spirit that makes the mathematics community so rewarding. He not only appreciated the technical correction but invited me to share these insights with the 3Blue1Brown audience. This article is that response, expanded to explore the broader implications of these geometric properties for machine learning and dimensionality reduction.</p><h2 id="the-johnson-lindenstrauss-lemma-a-geometric-guarantee">The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma: A Geometric Guarantee</h2><p>At its core, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma makes a remarkable promise: you can project points from an arbitrarily high-dimensional space into a surprisingly low-dimensional space while preserving their relative distances with high probability. What makes this result particularly striking is that the required dimensionality of the low-dimensional space grows only logarithmically with the number of points you want to project.</p><p>Formally, the lemma states that for an error factor ε (between 0 and 1), and any set of N points in a high-dimensional space, there exists a projection into k dimensions where for any two points u and v in the original space, their projections f(u) and f(v) in the lower dimensional space satisfy:</p><p>(1 - ε)||u - v||² ≤ ||f(u) - f(v)||² ≤ (1 + ε)||u - v||²</p><p>The number of dimensions (k) required to guarantee these error bounds is given by:</p><p>k ≥ O(log(N)/ε²)</p><p>The "Big O" notation can be replaced with a concrete constant C:</p><p>k ≥ (C/ε²) * log(N)</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>k is the target dimension</li><li>N is the number of points</li><li>ε is the maximum allowed distortion</li><li>C is a constant that determines the probability of success</li></ul><p>While most practitioners use values between 4 and 8 as a conservative choice for <a href="http://www.yaroslavvb.com/papers/achlioptas-database.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">random projections</a>, the optimal value of C remains an open question. As we'll see in the experimental section, engineered projections can achieve much lower values of C, with profound implications for embedding space capacity.</p><p>The fascinating history of this result speaks to the interconnected nature of mathematical discovery. Johnson and Lindenstrauss weren't actually trying to solve a dimensionality reduction problem – they stumbled upon this property while working on extending Lipschitz functions in Banach spaces. Their 1984 paper turned out to be far more influential in computer science than in their original domain.</p><h2 id="from-theory-to-practice-two-domains-of-application">From Theory to Practice: Two Domains of Application</h2><p>The JL lemma finds practical application in two distinct but equally important domains:</p><ol><li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: Consider an e-commerce platform like Amazon, where each customer's preferences might be represented by a vector with millions of dimensions (one for each product). Direct computation with such vectors would be prohibitively expensive. The JL lemma tells us we can project this data into a much lower-dimensional space – perhaps just a thousand dimensions – while preserving the essential relationships between customers. This makes previously intractable computations feasible on a single GPU, enabling real-time customer relationship management and inventory planning.</li><li><strong>Embedding Space Capacity</strong>: This application is more subtle but equally powerful. Rather than actively projecting vectors, we're interested in understanding how many distinct concepts can naturally coexist in a fixed-dimensional space. This is where our experiments provide valuable insight into the practical limits of embedding space capacity.</li></ol><p>Let's consider what we mean by "concepts" in an embedding space. Language models don't deal with perfectly orthogonal relationships – real-world concepts exhibit varying degrees of similarity and difference. Consider these examples of words chosen at random:</p><ul><li>"Archery" shares some semantic space with "precision" and "sport"</li><li>"Fire" overlaps with both "heat" and "passion"</li><li>"Gelatinous" relates to physical properties and food textures</li><li>"Southern-ness" encompasses culture, geography, and dialect</li><li>"Basketball" connects to both athletics and geometry</li><li>"Green" spans color perception and environmental consciousness</li><li>"Altruistic" links moral philosophy with behavioral patterns</li></ul><p>The beauty of high-dimensional spaces is that they can accommodate these nuanced, partial relationships while maintaining useful geometric properties for computation and inference.</p><h2 id="empirical-investigation-of-embedding-capacity">Empirical Investigation of Embedding Capacity</h2><p>When we move from random projections to engineered solutions, the theoretical bounds for C of the JL lemma become surprisingly conservative. While a <a href="https://documents.uow.edu.au/~jennie/WEBPDF/175_1992.pdf?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">Hadamard matrix transformation</a> with random elements can reliably achieve a C value between 2.5 and 4 in a single pass, our GPU experiments suggest even more efficient arrangements are possible through optimization.</p><p>To explore these limits, I implemented a series of experiments projecting standard basis vectors into spaces of varying dimensionality. Using GPU acceleration, I tested combinations of N (number of vectors) up to 30,000 and k (embedding dimensions) up to 10,000, running each optimization for 50,000 iterations. The results reveal some fascinating patterns:</p><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1316" height="262" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-18-at-3.19.12-PM.png 1316w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>Experimental values of C (GPU optimization)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several key observations emerge from this data:</p><ol><li>The value of C initially rises with N, reaching a maximum around ~0.9 (notably always below 1.0)</li><li>After peaking, C begins a consistent downward trend</li><li>At high ratios of N to K, we observe C values trend below 0.2</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1164" height="624" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-12.07.39-PM.png 1164w"><figcaption><span>C values for different dimensions K plotted against increasing N vectors</span></figcaption></figure><p>This behavior likely relates to an interesting property of high-dimensional geometry: as dimensionality increases, sphere packing becomes more efficient when the spheres are small relative to the unit sphere. This suggests that our observed upper bounds on C might still be conservative for very large numbers of concepts.</p><h2 id="practical-implications-for-language-models">Practical Implications for Language Models</h2><p>Let's consider three scenarios for the constant C:</p><ol><li>C = 4: A conservative choice for random projections with Hadamard matrices</li><li>C = 1: A likely upper bound for optimized or emergent embeddings</li><li>C = 0.2: A value suggested by our experiments for very large spaces</li></ol><figure><img src="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1037" height="249" srcset="https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 600w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 1000w, https://nickyoder.com/content/images/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-1.20.34-PM.png 1037w"><figcaption><span>Number of possible vectors ranging from "Efficient random projection C=4" to "Optimized projection C=0.2"</span></figcaption></figure><p>The implications of these geometric properties are staggering. Let's consider a simple way to estimate how many quasi-orthogonal vectors can fit in a k-dimensional space. If we define F as the degrees of freedom from orthogonality (90° - desired angle), we can approximate the number of vectors as:</p><p>Vectors ≈ 10^(k * F² / 1500)</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>k is the embedding dimension</li><li>F is the degrees of "freedom" from orthogonality (e.g., F = 3 for 87° angles)</li></ul><p>Applying this to GPT-3's 12,288-dimensional embedding space reveals its extraordinary capacity:</p><ul><li>At 89° (F = 1): approximately 10^8 vectors</li><li>At 88° (F = 2): approximately 10^32 vectors</li><li>At 87° (F = 3): approximately 10^73 vectors</li><li>At 85° (F = 5): more than 10^200 vectors</li></ul><p>To put this in perspective, even the conservative case of 86° angles provides capacity far exceeding the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (~10^80). This helps explain how language models can maintain rich, nuanced relationships between millions of concepts while working in relatively modest embedding dimensions.</p><h2 id="practical-applications-and-future-directions">Practical Applications and Future Directions</h2><p>The insights from this investigation have two major practical implications:</p><ol><li><strong>Efficient Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: The robustness of random projections, particularly when combined with Hadamard transformations (or <a href="https://www.ece.unb.ca/tervo/ece4253/bch.shtml?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">BCH coding</a>), provides a computationally efficient way to work with high-dimensional data. No complex optimization required – the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces does the heavy lifting for us.</li><li><strong>Embedding Space Design</strong>: Understanding the true capacity of high-dimensional spaces helps explain how transformer models can maintain rich, nuanced representations of language in relatively compact embeddings. Concepts like "Canadian," "morose," "Hitchcockian," "handsome," "whimsical," and "Muppet-like" can all find their place in the geometry while preserving their subtle relationships to each other.</li></ol><p>This research suggests that current embedding dimensions (1,000-20,000) provide more than adequate capacity for representing human knowledge and reasoning. The challenge lies not in the capacity of these spaces but in learning the optimal arrangement of concepts within them.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/NickYoder86/Johnson-Lindenstrauss?ref=nickyoder.com" rel="noreferrer">My code for Hadamard and optimized projections</a>.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What began as an investigation into a subtle optimization issue has led us to a deeper appreciation of high-dimensional geometry and its role in modern machine learning. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, discovered in a different context nearly four decades ago, continues to provide insight into the foundations of how we can represent meaning in mathematical spaces.</p><p>I want to express my sincere gratitude to Grant Sanderson and the 3Blue1Brown channel.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p>I was recently working on a project that uses the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3">AWS SDK for JavaScript</a>. When updating the dependencies in said project, I noticed that the version of that dependency was <code>v3.888.0</code>. Eight hundred eighty eight. That’s a big number as far as versions go.</p>
<p>That got me thinking: I wonder what package in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm registry</a> has the largest number in its version. It could be a major, minor, or patch version, and it doesn’t have to be the latest version of the package. In other words, out of the three numbers in <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code> for each version for each package, what is the largest number I can find?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR? <a href="#results">Jump to the results</a></strong> to see the answer.</p>
<section data-heading-rank="2"><h2 id="the-npm-api">The npm API</h2>
<p>Obviously npm has some kind of API, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get a list of all… <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/#:~:text=Packages-,3%2C639%2C812,-Downloads%20%C2%B7%20Last">3,639,812 packages</a>. Oh. That’s a lot of packages. Well, considering npm had 374 <em>billion</em> package downloads in the past <em>month</em>, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind me making a few million HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Doing a quick search for “npm api” leads me to a readme in the <a href="https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY-API.md">npm/registry repo</a> on GitHub. There’s a <code>/-/all</code> endpoint listed in the table of contents which seems promising. That section doesn’t actually exist in the readme, but maybe it still works?</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://registry.npmjs.org/-/all'</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span><span>"code"</span><span>:</span><span>"ResourceNotFound"</span><span>,</span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span>"/-/all does not exist"</span><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Whelp, maybe npm packages have an ID and I can just start at 1 and count up? It looks like packages have an <code>_id</code> field… never mind, the <code>_id</code> field is the package <em>name</em>. Okay, let’s try to find something else.</p>
<p>A little more digging brings me to this <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/152515">GitHub discussion</a> about the npm replication API. So npm replicates package info in CouchDB at <code>https://replicate.npmjs.com</code>, and conveniently, they support the <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-all-docs"><code>_all_docs</code> endpoint</a>. Let’s give that a try:</p>

<p>Those are some interesting package names. Looks like this data is paginated and by default I get 1,000 packages at a time. When I write the final script, I can set the <code>limit</code> query parameter to the max of 10,000 to make pagination a little less painful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the CouchDB docs have a <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/ddocs/views/pagination.html#paging">guide for pagination</a>, and it looks like it’s as simple as using the <code>skip</code> query parameter.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?skip=1000'</span></p></div><div><p><span>"Bad Request"</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Never mind. According to the GitHub discussion linked above, <code>skip</code> is no longer supported. The “Paging (Alternate Method)” section of the same page says that I can use <code>startkey_docid</code> instead. If I grab the <code>id</code> of the last row, I should be able to use that to return the next set of rows. Fun fact: The 1000th package (alphabetically) on npm is <code>03-webpack-number-test</code>.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://replicate.npmjs.com/registry/_all_docs?startkey_docid="03-webpack-number-test"'</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"total_rows"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3628102,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"offset"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>999,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"rows"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> [</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span># another 1000 packages...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Nice. Also, another <code>3628102 - 3628088 = 14</code> packages have been published in the ~15 minutes since I ran the last query.</p>
<p>Now, there’s one more piece of the puzzle to figure out. How do I get all the versions for a given package? Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like I can get package version information along with the base info returned by <code>_all_docs</code>. I have to <em>separately</em> fetch each package’s metadata from <code>https://registry.npmjs.org/&lt;package_id&gt;</code>. Let’s see what good ol’ trusty <code>03-webpack-number-test</code> looks like:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="sh"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>curl</span><span> </span><span>'https://registry.npmjs.org/03-webpack-number-test'</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span># i've omitted some fields here</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"_id"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"03-webpack-number-test",</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"versions"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>      </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span>      </span><span># the rest of the versions...</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Alright, I have everything I need. Now I just need to write a bash script that— just kidding. A wise programmer once said, “if your shell script is more than 10 lines, it shouldn’t be a shell script” (that was me, I said that). I like TypeScript, so let’s use that.</p>
<p>The biggest bottleneck is going to be waiting on the <code>GET</code>s for each package’s metadata. My plan is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grab all the package IDs from the replication API and save that data to a file (I don’t want to have to refetch everything if the something goes wrong later in the script)</li>
<li>Fetch package data in batches so we’re not just doing 1 HTTP request at a time</li>
<li>Save the package data to a file (again, hopefully I only have to fetch everything once)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I have all the package data, I can answer the original question of “largest number in version” and look at a few other interesting things.</p>
<p>(A few hours and many iterations later…)</p>

<p>Some stats:</p>

<li>Time to fetch version data for each one of those packages: <strong>~12 hours</strong> (yikes)</li>

<li>Size of <code>package-data.json</code>: <strong>~886MB</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And the winner is…</strong> (not really) <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/latentflip-test?activeTab=versions">latentflip-test</a> at version <code>1000000000000000000.1000000000000000000.1000000000000000000</code>. And no, there haven’t actually been one quintillion major versions of this package published. Disappointing, I know.</p>
<p>Okay, I feel like that shouldn’t count. I think we can do better and find a “real” package that actually follows semantic versioning. I think a better question to ask is this:</p>
<p><strong>For packages that <em>follow semantic versioning</em>, which package has the <em>largest number</em> from <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code> in <em>any</em> of its versions?</strong></p>
<p>So, what does it mean to “follow semantic versioning”? Should we “disqualify” a package for skipping a version number? In this case, I think we’ll just say that a package has to have more versions published than the largest number we find for that package. For example, a package with a version of <code>1.888.0</code> will have had <em>at least</em> 888 versions published if it actually followed semver.</p>
<p>Before we get to the real winner, here are the top 10 packages <em>by total number of versions published</em>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>electron-remote-control -&gt; 37328 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@npm-torg/public-scoped-free-org-test-package-2 -&gt; 37134 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>public-unscoped-test-package -&gt; 27719 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>carrot-scan -&gt; 27708 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@npm-torg/public-test-package-2 -&gt; 27406 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-components -&gt; 26724 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/type-utils -&gt; 26708 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-tokens -&gt; 22122 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli -&gt; 19498 total versions</span></p></div><div><p><span>@atlassian-test-prod/hello-world -&gt; 19120 total versions</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Top 10 packages that (probably) follow semver <em>by largest number in one of its versions</em>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="plaintext"><code><div><p><span>@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli -&gt; 19494 (1.0.19494)</span></p></div><div><p><span>electron-remote-control -&gt; 19065 (1.2.19065)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@quip/collab -&gt; 16999 (1.16999.0)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@atlassian-test-prod/hello-world -&gt; 16707 (9.7.16707)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@wix/wix-code-types -&gt; 14720 (2.0.14720)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-components -&gt; 14274 (2025.3.14274)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/type-utils -&gt; 14274 (2025.3.14274)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@octopusdeploy/design-system-tokens -&gt; 14274 (2025.3.14274)</span></p></div><div><p><span>@atlassian-test-staging/test -&gt; 13214 (49.4.13214)</span></p></div><div><p><span>binky -&gt; 9906 (3.4.9906)</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>So it seems like the winner is <a href="https://github.com/DinoscapeProgramming/Remote-Control">@mahdiarjangi/phetch-cli</a> with <code>19494</code>, right? Unfortunately, I’m not going to count that either. It only has so many versions because of a <a href="https://github.com/arjangimahdi/phetch-cli/actions/runs/11531682007/workflow">misconfigured GitHub action</a> that published new versions in a loop.</p>
<p>I manually went down the above list, disqualifying any packages that had similar issues. I also checked that “new” versions actually differed from previous versions in terms of content. Overall, I looked for a package that was actually publishing new versions on purpose with <em>some</em> kind of change to the package content.</p>
<p><strong>The real winner (#19 on the list) is:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nice-registry/all-the-package-names">all-the-package-names</a> with <code>2401</code> from version <code>2.0.2401</code>.</p>
<p>Well, that’s sort of disappointing, but also kind of funny. I don’t know what I was expecting to be honest. If you’re curious, you can see <a href="#more-results">more results</a> at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>What you do with all of this extremely important and useful information is up to you.</p>

<p>Gentoo Council has voted on 2024-04-14 on the following policy:
</p>
<blockquote><p>It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial intelligence tools.  This motion can be revisited, should a case been made over such a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical and quality concerns.</p></blockquote>
<p>This policy affects Gentoo contributions and the official Gentoo projects.  It does not prohibit adding packages for AI-related software or software that is being developed with the help of such tools upstream.

<h2><span id="Rationale">Rationale</span></h2>
<ol><li><b>Copyright concerns.</b>  At this point, the regulations concerning copyright of generated contents are still emerging worldwide.

    </div><p>Cannabis use is linked to an almost quadrupling in the risk of developing diabetes, according to an analysis of real-world data from over 4 million adults, being presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (<a href="https://www.easd.org/annual-meeting/easd-2025/" target="_blank">EASD</a>) held in Vienna, Austria (15–19 Sept).</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag">insulin resistance</a>, and the magnitude of the risk of developing diabetes hasn't been clear.</p>
<p>To strengthen the evidence base, Dr. Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, U.S. and colleagues analyzed <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag">electronic health records</a> from 54 health care organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across U.S. and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.</p>
<p>They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for five years.</p>
<p>After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.</p>

                                                                                                        
    
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.</p>
<p>"As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks," said lead author Dr. Kamel.</p>
<p>"These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for health care professionals to routinely talk to patients about <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag">cannabis use</a> so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring."</p>
<p>The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.</p>
<p>Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag">diabetes</a>, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to a lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that the inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records.</p>
<p>They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p><strong>A new study from South Dakota State University reveals how grapevine canes can be converted into plastic-like material that is stronger than traditional plastic and will decompose in the environment in a relatively short amount of time.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><p>The need for biodegradable packaging material has never been higher.</p><p>Currently, most packaging is "single use" and is made with plastic materials, derived from nonrenewable sources like crude oil that take hundreds of years to decompose in the environment. On top of this, only 9% of plastic is recycled. This has resulted in the formation of floating piles of plastic garbage in the ocean, called the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch."</p><p>But maybe even more concerning is the discovery of micro- and nano-plastics in the environment. Research has found that plastic breaks down into tiny particles, which are being ingested or inhaled by both humans and animals, and are found literally everywhere, including in the human body — according to recent research studies. Worse, little is known about the long-term health effects of microplastics.</p><p><a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/srinivas-janaswamy">Srinivas Janaswamy</a> is an associate professor in South Dakota State University's <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/dairy-food-science">Department of Dairy and Food Science</a>. His research has focused on developing value-added products through biowaste and agricultural byproducts. One of the overarching goals of Janaswamy's research is to tackle the plastic waste crisis.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Perhaps the biggest contributor to plastic waste, at least in the United States, is plastic bags, the kind found at most retail stores. These bags, while sometimes recycled, are often only used once and can be found littered throughout the environment.</p><p>To address this problem, Janaswamy is working toward developing a plastic-like bag that will decompose in the environment.</p><p>"That is my dream," Janaswamy said.</p><p>The key ingredient to Janaswamy's work? Cellulose. This biopolymer is the most abundant organic substance on Earth and is found, primarily, in the cell walls of plants. Cellulose, thanks to strong hydrogen bonds and a chain of glucose molecules, gives plants structural strength and rigidity along with other biopolymers such as mannan, xylose, hemicellulose and lignin.</p><p>Humans have long used cellulose to create products. Cotton, the material used to make a majority of the world’s clothing, is primarily composed of cellulose. Wood is rich in cellulose as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In previous research, Janaswamy has extracted cellulose from agricultural products like <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/06/can-avocado-peels-help-curb-plastic-waste-problem">avocado peels</a>, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2025/02/extending-shelf-life-fruits">soyhulls</a>, alfalfa, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/12/sdsu-researcher-turning-switchgrass-bioplastics">switchgrass</a>, <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2023/09/could-spent-coffee-grounds-provide-alternative-plastic-packaging">spent coffee grounds</a>, corncob and <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2024/02/save-peels-how-bananas-can-be-used-fight-plastic-waste-crisis">banana peels</a>. He uses the extracted cellulose to develop films — materials that look and feel similar to traditional plastic wrapping.</p><p>"By extracting cellulose from agricultural products, value-added products can be created," Janaswamy said.</p><p>Each of Janaswamy's films has different characteristics and properties. Some are more transparent than others. Some are stronger. But thanks to a unique collaboration with a fellow SDSU faculty member, Janaswamy may have created his best value-added product yet.</p><h2><strong>Grapevine canes</strong></h2><p>Janaswamy had just finished presenting “Ag Biomass – A Holy Grail to Clean up the Plastic Mess” at SDSU's Celebration of Faculty Excellence when he was approached by <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/anne-fennell">Anne Fennell</a>, a Distinguished Professor in the <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/agronomy-horticulture-plant-science">Department of Agronomy, Horticulture and Plant Science</a>.</p><p>After listening to Janaswamy's presentation, Fennell became interested in the research and had an idea. A leading researcher in the study of grapevines, she knew that grapevine canes — the woody plant material that grapes grow on — were rich in cellulose. She also knew that grapevine canes were abundant and had limited use after harvest.</p><p>"Every year we prune the majority of yearly biomass off the vine," Fennell said. "The pruned canes are either mowed over, composted and reapplied to the soil, or burned in some areas. &nbsp;Research in Australia showed that prunings could be removed from the field in alternate years without effecting soil health. &nbsp;My thought was why not use this for value added films. Several of the materials that Janaswamy previously used had a high-water content, in contrast the winter pruning yields a cellulose-dense material with low water content, making them an abundant ideal material to work with."</p><p>Fennell's idea led to a collaboration, and soon Janaswamy was extracting cellulose — which looks almost like cotton — from the canes of grapevines. The resulting films were eye-opening.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/fb/d5fb00211g">recent study</a> published in the academic journal Sustainable Food Technology, Janaswamy's grapevine cane films are transparent and strong and biodegrade within 17 days in the soil — leaving behind no harmful residue.</p><p>"High transmittance in packaging films enhances product visibility, making them more attractive to consumers and facilitating easy quality inspection without the need for unsealing," Janaswamy said. "These films demonstrate outstanding potential for food packaging applications."</p><figure role="group">

<p>The grapevine canes were harvested from SDSU's research vineyard. The research team, which includes doctoral candidates <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/sandeep-paudel">Sandeep Paudel</a> and <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/directory/sumi-regmi">Sumi Regmi</a>, and Sajal Bhattarai, an SDSU graduate and a doctoral candidate at Purdue University, followed a published protocol in developing the films, which includes drying and grinding the canes and extracting the cellulosic residue. The residue was then solubilized and cast onto glass plates to create the films.</p><p>Testing revealed the grapevine cane-derived films were actually stronger than traditional plastic bags — in terms of tensile strength.</p><p>"Using underutilized grapevine prunings as a cellulose source for packaging films enhances waste management in the field and addresses the global issue of plastic pollution," Janaswamy said. "Developing eco-friendly films from grapevine cellulose represents a practical approach to sustainability, helping to conserve the environment and its resources and contributing to the circular bioeconomy."</p><p>The results of this work move Janaswamy one step closer to his dream of developing a bag made from a plastic-like material that will quickly decompose in the environment.</p><p>Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the National Science Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I’ve read numerous articles about renting versus buying and most dive into financial projections while completely missing the bigger picture. In my view, behavioral and emotional factors have a far larger impact on the financial outcomes of renting versus buying than the math. The math can always be made to “work” if you’re willing to adjust what or where you rent or buy.</p>
<p>But the real differences aren’t captured in spreadsheets. They come from how people actually make decisions, and how those decisions ripple through their finances over time. People rarely buy with a purely rational investment mindset; they buy based on lifestyle and emotion. And once they own, those same factors either hold them back with costs and constraints or help them by forcing them to save.</p>
<p>That’s the point I want to hammer home: the behavioral realities matter far more than the math.</p>

<h2>Buying a Home Isn’t Really an Investment 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#buying-a-home-isnt-really-an-investment" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>Most people buy emotionally, not strategically.&nbsp;The decision is usually driven by lifestyle factors such as proximity to work, school districts, family, and the neighborhood. People obsess over granite countertops, open floor plans, stainless steel appliances, and walk in closets. These might make you happy but they don’t make you rich. Even in cities with solid investment opportunities, these lifestyle constraints drastically limit options.</p>
<p>Real estate investors, on the other hand, make decisions with a calculating mindset. They look at cash flow, appreciation potential, and risk. They don’t buy if the math doesn’t make sense. They’ll consider multiple neighborhoods, even cities, and may buy a home requiring significant renovations if it improves cash flow. They don’t get swayed by a fancy kitchen. Unsurprisingly, an investor-focused approach will almost always outperform the emotionally driven homeowner.</p>

<h2>People Tend to Overbuy 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#people-tend-to-overbuy" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>Buying a home is expensive and stressful so people tend to plan for the long-term, thinking of their needs 5 or more years in the future. That starter apartment suddenly feels tiny and the reaction is to overcompensate. A modest, functional place isn’t enough anymore, so buyers upgrade often way beyond what they really need.</p>
<p>Renters, in constrast, focus on the short-term, only considering their needs for the next few years. They are more pragmatic and willing to comprimise because it’s easier to justify knowing the situation is temporary. A modest rental fits perfectly for now, and if circumstances change, moving is simple.</p>
<p>The same behavior applies to furnishings and décor. When people buy a home, they tend to spend more on furniture, appliances, and interior upgrades, even when their previous setup was perfectly adequate. Everything feels like it needs to match the “bigger, nicer” home. Renters typically prioritize function and necessity over aesthetics or upgrades; they buy what works for the space rather than what “looks right” for a dream home. Furniture is often minimal, multipurpose, or easy to move.</p>
<p>If you bought a home equivalent to the apartment you’d rent, or a slight downgrade, you might come out ahead financially over five years. But that advantage goes out the window if you buy a place that costs twice as much as the unit you would have rented, and then spend even more on furnishings. I’ve also never seen anyone downgrade when buying; it’s always a significant upgrade, both in living situation and costs.</p>

<h2>The Flexibility of Renting Is Undervalued

</h2>
<p>Renting offers a superpower that doesn’t get the attention it deserves: flexibility. The flexibility of renting can have both a signicant impact to quality of life and finances. You can tailor your living situation to your life as it changes. You can easily move closer to work, test a new neighborhood, upgrade after a raise, or relocate to a new city for a job. Leases are often a year or less, and breaking one might cost a bit but it’s nothing compared to the money, time, and stress of selling a home.</p>
<p>The flexibility of renting has major financial advantages. A homeowner may hesitate to accept a job in another city because selling a home can take months, cost tens of thousands in fees, and carries the risk of a slow market. A renter can make the move immediately, capturing higher paying job opportunities and better career growth. Similarly, if a renter loses a job or faces unexpected expenses, downsizing or moving to a cheaper unit is fast and straightforward. Homeowners, by contrast, may be stuck paying a mortgage they they can no longer afford and are limited in their ability to cut costs.</p>
<p>Over time, this freedom compounds. Renters are more likely to pursue promotions, side ventures, or new career paths that require mobility. They can strategically relocate for better markets, higher salaries, or professional growth. They can take a risk in changing careers or starting a business without having a mortgage hanging over their head. These advantages hard to quantify but potentially worth far more than any returns shown by financial models. Flexibility lets people respond to life’s ups and downs without financial strain, indirectly protecting and boosting net worth in ways “buy vs. rent” math misses. Before buying home, one should carefully consider how home ownership will change their willingness or ability to pursue career opportunitiies or respond to financial hardships in the future.</p>

<h2>Why the Home Investment Myth Persists 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#why-the-home-investment-myth-persists" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>At today’s housing prices in most major cities, investing in the stock market will give better and more guaranteed returns than buying a home. The math isn’t even close.</p>
<p>So why does the myth persist that homes are “great investments”? In my view, it’s primarily because a home acts as a <em>forced savings vehicle</em>. Many people don’t save and invest consistently. Saving and investing requires discipline but a mortgage payment is non-negotiable. People will cut spending elsewhere, adjust their budgets, and make sacrifices to ensure they make that payment. Over time, that forces wealth accumulation, even if the home was a suboptimal vehicle for building wealth.</p>
<p>This is the key reason why homeownership is so often mistaken for a surefire path to wealth. The perception isn’t rooted in superior returns or market-beating performance; it’s rooted in human behavior. Buying a home makes people save when they might not save otherwise, and that creates the illusion that the home itself is a great investment. In reality, the wealth mainly comes from the forced savings, not exceptional growth. That’s not to say this isn’t important; it is. But it only works if you need that external discipline, so understanding your own saving habits is key to knowing whether this benefit applies to you.</p>

<h2>Conclusion 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>The rent-versus-buy debate is usually framed as a math problem, but in reality, it’s more about behavior and tradeoffs. For disciplined savers and investors, renting almost always wins, both mathematically and behaviorally. It gives you flexibility, mobility, and the ability to align your housing with your life, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Buying, on the other hand, makes sense mainly for those who value stability above all else, or for those who struggle to save and need the discipline of a mortgage to build wealth. In that case, the home isn’t a great investment; it’s simply the only savings vehicle that works. So don’t buy a house because “it’s what everyone does” or because you think it’s automatically a good investment. Buy only if it aligns with your lifestyle and values. Otherwise, renting may be the smarter choice.</p>
<p>For me, I currently choose to rent. But if I do buy in the future, I’ll go in with eyes wide open to all these factors. I’ll buy something far below my means, ideally with some investment potential, but I won’t fool myself into thinking it’s the financially optimal decision.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Carla Rover once spent 30 minutes sobbing after having to restart a project she vibe coded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover has been in the industry for 15 years, mainly working as a web developer. She’s now building a startup, alongside her son, that creates custom machine learning models for marketplaces.&nbsp;</p>







<p>She called vibe coding a beautiful, endless cocktail napkin on which one can perpetually sketch ideas. But dealing with AI-generated code that one hopes to use in production can be “worse than babysitting,” she said, as these AI models can mess up work in ways that are hard to predict.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had turned to AI coding in a need for speed with her startup, as is the promise of AI tools.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“Because I needed to be quick and impressive, I took a shortcut and did not scan those files after the automated review,” she said. “When I did do it manually, I found so much wrong. When I used a third-party tool, I found more. And I learned my lesson.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She and her son wound up restarting their whole project — hence the tears. “I handed it off like the copilot was an employee,” she said. “It isn’t.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover is like many experienced programmers turning to AI for coding help. But such programmers are also finding themselves acting like AI babysitters — rewriting and fact-checking the code the AI spits out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent report by content delivery platform company Fastly <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/senior-developers-ship-more-ai-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found that at least 95%</a> of the nearly 800 developers it surveyed said they spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with the load of such verification falling most heavily on the shoulders of senior developers.</p>

<p>These experienced coders have discovered issues with AI-generated code ranging from hallucinating package names to deleting important information and security risks. Left unchecked, AI code can leave a product far more buggy than what humans would produce.</p>

<p>Working with AI-generated code has become such a problem that it’s given rise to a new corporate coding job known as “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7370912703231574016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vibe code cleanup specialist</a>.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>TechCrunch spoke to experienced coders about their time using AI-generated code about what they see as the future of vibe coding. Thoughts varied, but one thing remained certain: The technology still has a long way to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Using a coding co-pilot is kind of like giving a coffee pot to a smart six-year-old and saying, ‘Please take this into the dining room and pour coffee for the family,’” Rover said.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Can they do it? Possibly. Could they fail? Definitely. And most likely, if they do fail, they aren’t going to tell you. “It doesn’t make the kid less clever,” she continued. “It just means you can’t delegate [a task] like that completely.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-you-re-absolutely-right-nbsp">“You’re absolutely right!”&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Feridoon Malekzadeh also compared vibe coding to a child.</p>

<p>He’s worked in the industry for more than 20 years, holding various roles in product development, software, and design. He’s building his own startup and heavily using vibe-coding platform Lovable, he said. For fun, he also vibe codes apps like one that generates Gen Alpha slang for Boomers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He likes that he’s able to work alone on projects, saving time and money, but agrees that vibe coding is not like hiring an intern or a junior coder. Instead, vibe coding is akin to “hiring your stubborn, insolent teenager to help you do something,” he told TechCrunch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You have to ask them 15 times to do something,” he said. “In the end, they do some of what you asked, some stuff you didn’t ask for, and they break a bunch of things along the way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malekzadeh estimates he spends around 50% of his time writing requirements, 10% to 20% of his time on vibe coding, and 30% to 40% of his time on vibe <em>fixing </em>— remedying the bugs and “unnecessary script” created by AI-written code.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He also doesn’t think vibe coding is the best at systems thinking — the process of seeing how a complex problem could impact an overall result. AI-generated code, he said, tries to solve more surface-level problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“If you’re creating a feature that should be broadly available in your product, a good engineer would create that once and make it available everywhere that it’s needed,” Malekzadeh said. “Vibe coding will create something five different times, five different ways, if it’s needed in five different places. It leads to a lot of confusion, not only for the user, but for the model.”</p>







<p>Meanwhile, Rover finds that AI “runs into a wall” when data conflicts with what it was hard-coded to do. “It can offer misleading advice, leave out key elements that are vital, or insert itself into a thought pathway you’re developing,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also found that rather than admit to making errors, it will manufacture results.</p>

<p>She shared another example with TechCrunch, where she questioned the results an AI model initially gave her. The model started to give a detailed explanation pretending it used the data she uploaded. Only when she called it out did the AI model confess. </p>

<p>“It freaked me out because it sounded like a toxic co-worker,” she said.</p>

<p>On top of this, there are the security concerns.</p>

<p>Austin Spires is the senior director of developer enablement at Fastly and has been coding since the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He’s found through his own experience — along with chatting with customers — that vibe code likes to build what is quick rather than what is “right.” This may introduce vulnerabilities to the code of the kind that very new programmers tend to make, he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“What often happens is the engineer needs to review the code, correct the agent, and tell the agent that they made a mistake,” Spires told TechCrunch. “This pattern is why we’ve seen the trope of ‘you’re absolutely right’ appear over social media.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>He’s referring to how AI models, like Anthropic Claude, tend to respond “you’re absolutely right” when called out on their mistakes.</p>

<p>Mike Arrowsmith, the chief technology officer at the IT management software company NinjaOne, has been in software engineering and security for around 20 years. He said that vibe coding is creating a new generation of IT and security blind spots to which young startups in particular are susceptible.</p>

<p>“Vibe coding often bypasses the rigorous review processes that are foundational to traditional coding and crucial to catching vulnerabilities,” he told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>NinjaOne, he said, counters this by encouraging “safe vibe coding,” where approved AI tools have access controls, along with mandatory peer review and, of course, security scanning.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-new-normal">The new normal</h2>

<p>While nearly everyone we spoke to agrees that AI-generated code and vibe-coding platforms are useful in many situations — like mocking up ideas — they all agree that human review is essential before building a business on it.</p>

<p>“That cocktail napkin is not a business model,” Rover said. “You have to balance the ease with insight.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>But for all the lamenting on its errors, vibe coding has changed the present and the future of the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rover said vibe coding helped her tremendously in crafting a better user interface. Malekzadeh simply said that, despite the time he spends fixing code, he still gets more done with AI coders than without them.</p>







<p>“‘Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress,” Malekzadeh said, quoting the French theorist Paul Virilio, who spoke about inventing the shipwreck along with the ship.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The pros far outweigh the cons.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The Fastly survey found that senior developers were twice as likely to put AI-generated code into production compared to junior developers, saying that the technology helped them work faster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vibe coding is also part of Spires’ coding routine. He uses AI coding agents on several platforms for both front-end and back-end personal projects. He called the technology a mixed experience but said it’s good in helping with prototyping, building out boilerplate, or scaffolding out a test; it removes menial tasks so that engineers can focus on building, shipping, and scaling products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems the extra hours spent combing through the vibe weeds will simply become a tolerated tax on using the innovation.</p>

<p>Elvis Kimara, a young engineer, is learning that now. He just graduated with a master’s in AI and is building an AI-powered marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many coders, he said vibe coding has made his job harder and has often found vibe coding a joyless experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“There’s no more dopamine from solving a problem by myself. The AI just figures it out,” he said. At one of his last jobs, he said senior developers didn’t look to help young coders as much&nbsp;— some not understanding new vibe-coding models, while others delegated mentorship tasks to said AI models.</p>

<p>But, he said, “the pros far outweigh the cons,” and he’s prepared to pay the innovation tax.&nbsp;</p>







<p>“We won’t just be writing code; we’ll be guiding AI systems, taking accountability when things break, and acting more like consultants to machines,” Kimara said of the new normal for which he’s preparing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even as I grow into a senior role, I’ll keep using it,” he continued. “It’s been a real accelerator for me. I make sure I review every line of AI-generated code so I learn even faster from it.”</p>

      <p>Today we turned off our Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service, as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/05/ending-ocsp/">announced</a> in December of last year. We stopped including OCSP URLs in our certificates more than 90 days ago, so all Let’s Encrypt certificates that contained OCSP URLs have now expired. Going forward, we will publish revocation information exclusively via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).</p>
<p>We ended support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor’s particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let’s Encrypt, it could accidentally be retained or CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.</p>
<p>We are also taking this step because keeping our CA infrastructure as simple as possible is critical for the continuity of compliance, reliability, and efficiency at Let’s Encrypt. For every year that we have existed, operating OCSP services has taken up considerable resources that can soon be better spent on other aspects of our operations. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2022/09/07/new-life-for-crls/">Now that we support CRLs</a>, our OCSP service has become unnecessary.</p>
<p>At the height of our OCSP service’s traffic earlier this year, we handled approximately 340 billion OCSP requests per month. That’s more than 140,000 requests per second handled by our CDN, with 15,000 requests per second handled by our origin. We’d like to thank <a href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a> for generously donating CDN services for OCSP to Let’s Encrypt for the past ten years.</p>
