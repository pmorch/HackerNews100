<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">“Meet Your New Assistant” says
    <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/">the announcement</a>, going on
    with “Built With Llama 3”.
    And oh my goodness has it ever got a lot of coverage. So I thought I might as well try it.</p>

<p>My first cut was a little unfair; I asked it about a subject on which I am unchallenged as the world’s leading expert: Tim
    Bray. (That’s probably overstating it: My wife is clearly in the running.)</p>

<p>So I asked
    <a href="https://meta.ai/">meta.ai</a> “What does Tim Bray think of Google?” Twice; once on my phone while first exploring the idea,
    and again later on my computer. Before I go on, I should remark that both user interfaces are first-rate: Friction-free and
    ahead of the play-with-AI crowd. Anyhow, here are both answers; it may be relevant that I was logged into my long-lived
    Facebook account:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/04/18/-big/meta-ai-take-1.jpg.html"><img alt="meta.ai on Tim Bray and Google, take 1" title="meta.ai on Tim Bray and Google, take 1" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/04/18/meta-ai-take-1.png"></a></p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/04/18/-big/meta-ai-take-2.jpg.html"><img alt="meta.ai on Tim Bray and Google, take 2" title="meta.ai on Tim Bray and Google, take 2" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/04/18/meta-ai-take-2.png"></a></p>
<p>The problem isn’t that these answers are really, really wrong (which they are). The problem is that they are terrifyingly
    plausible, and presented in a tone of serene confidence. For clarity:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am not a Computer Scientist. Words mean things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I worked for Google between March of 2010 and March of 2014.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I was never a VP there nor did I ever have “Engineer” in my title.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I did not write a blog post entitled “Goodbye, Google”. My exit post,
      <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/02/19/Leaving-Google">Leaving Google</a>, did not discuss advertising nor Google’s activities
      in China, nor in fact was it critical of anything about Google except for its choice of headquarters location.
      In fact, my disillusionment with Google (to be honest, with Big Tech generally) was slow to set in and really didn’t
      reach critical mass until these troubling Twenties.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The phrase “advertising-based business model”, presented in quotes, does not appear in this blog. Quotation marks have
      meaning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My views are not, nor have they been, “complex and multifaceted”. I am embarrassingly mainstream. I shared the
      mainstream enchantment with the glamor of Big Tech until, sometime around 2020, I started sharing the mainstream
      disgruntlement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I can neither recall nor find instances of me criticizing Google’s decision-making process, nor praising its Open-Source
      activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What troubles me is that all of the actions and opinions attributed to meta.ai’s version of Tim Bray are things that 
    I might well have done or said. But I didn’t.</p>

<p>This is not a criticism of Meta; their claims about the size and sophistication of their
    <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/">Llama3 model</a> seem believable and, as I said, the interface is nifty.</p>

<p>Is it fair for me to criticize this particular product offering based on a single example? Well, first impressions are
    important. But for what it’s worth, I peppered it with a bunch of other general questions and the pattern repeats: Plausible
    narratives containing egregious factual errors. </p>

<p>I guess there’s no new news here; we already knew that LLMs are good at generating plausible-sounding narratives which are
    wrong. It comes back to what I discussed under 
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/02/25/Money-AI-Bubble#p-5">the heading of “Meaning”</a>. Still waiting for progress.</p>

<p>The nice thing about science is that it routinely features “error bars” on its graphs, showing both the finding and the degree of
    confidence in its accuracy.</p>

<p>AI/ML products in general don’t have them.</p>

<p>I don’t see how it’s sane or safe to rely on a technology that doesn’t have error bars.</p>

The previous day inside Google offices in New York and California, a couple dozen employees staged a sit-in to bring awareness to the $1.2 billion Israeli government contract. It began in 2021 and provides cloud computing services to Israel—specifically, we’ve recently learned, <a href="https://time.com/6966102/google-contract-israel-defense-ministry-gaza-war/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=i-spoke-with-a-google-worker-fired-for-protesting-a-1-2-billion-contract-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">to the Israeli Ministry of Defense</a>—and though it has faced internal criticism since its inception, efforts against it have naturally intensified since October 7th.&nbsp; </p><p> The memo from Google’s global head of security Chris Rackow was ominous. “If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies,” he wrote to the company’s thousands of employees, “think again.” </p><p> I was fortunate to speak with Hasan Ibraheem, one of the employees fired as part of the protest and an organizer with <a href="https://www.notechforapartheid.com/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=i-spoke-with-a-google-worker-fired-for-protesting-a-1-2-billion-contract-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">No Tech For Apartheid</a>, Thursday afternoon by phone. It was shortly after news broke that more than 100 Columbia students <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/04/18/columbia-students-arrests-palestine-israel-encampment-nypd/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=i-spoke-with-a-google-worker-fired-for-protesting-a-1-2-billion-contract-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">had been arrested</a> by police in riot gear for a pro-Palestine protest. </p><p> Ibraheem is a Syria-born, West Virginia-raised 23-year-old who worked at Google for one year and eight months. It was his very first job out of college. I asked him about getting arrested, how he found out he got fired, and his personal connection to this cause. </p><p> Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </p><p><b>MARISA KABAS, </b><span><i><b>The Handbasket:</b></i></span><b> How did you decide a sit-in was the best approach for this protest? And why now?</b></p><p> HASAN IBRAHEEM, <span><i>Former Google employee and No Tech For Apartheid organizer</i></span>: That's a great question. This campaign has been going on for about three years now, ever since Project Nimbus was created. And throughout those three years, we had tried basically every avenue possible to try and get the executives to talk to us, at least have some sort of conversation with us, sent petitions. We've exhausted every avenue that we could think of possible. And during that time, we've been building up our supporters in Google—everyone who's become part of No Tech For Apartheid. And then we wanted to do the strongest action we could possibly do because we have been ignored for three years. They&nbsp;wouldn't even give a statement or a conversation with us. So we wanted to make it impossible for them to ignore us. </p><p><b>KABAS: It's more than six months into the current war in Gaza and Israel. But you said this effort precedes it. Do you think the current war accelerated or intensified your efforts?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: Definitely. With the current genocide that's happening in Gaza right now, more people were made aware. I joined No Tech For Apartheid only a few months ago. I wasn't even aware about Project Nimbus, and most of the people I talked to in Google weren't aware of it until a couple days ago. So, people are receptive to this once they're aware of the contract, want to make change. But yeah, it's unfortunate that it took a genocide for people to realize that Google is complicit in this. </p><p><b>KABAS: Did you have any hesitation about organizing within your workplace?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: At first I wasn't sure if organizing within the workspace was actually something that could lead to any real change. But I realized that it would be better for me to participate and make my voice heard, even if I didn't believe that the execs would drop the contract immediately. Some people need to take the first step in organizing, and whether that means risking their jobs or doing whatever, I wanted to be a part of that first group of people. </p><p><b>KABAS: Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like being in the sit-in yesterday? What was that experience like?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: We started at 12 p.m. and it was very quickly evident that the security did not want us there. They tried to get us to leave as soon as possible. They removed our banner that was hanging off the side that was visible from the stairs. And then an hour and a half in, the head of security was very visibly upset and told us “you need to leave right now.” And, as I'm sure you're aware, we were there for almost 10 hours. So an hour and a half in, him telling us that we needed to leave didn't result in anything until much later.&nbsp; </p><p> It was a lot of waiting but we, the people who were there in New York, me and three other folks who were going to stay until arrest, we had each other and we were making speeches, we were doing chants, we were making our voices heard, making our voices as loud as possible so that we could reach as many people as possible. And lots of people came by and asked us what was going on. People were given flyers. And a lot of people were just concerned about the things that we were talking about. They expressed solidarity with us. There was a lot of support from Google employees. </p><p><b>KABAS: And it was just you and three other people?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: So in the very beginning, there were more. I think there were over 10 people sitting down. But at an hour and a half in when security told us that we needed to leave, we had different tiers of people who were willing to take risks—like risk of arrest or retaliation, which at this point seems like it wasn’t at all necessary since we all got retaliated against in the same exact way. But for the people who were doing the sit-in and didn't want to be arrested, they left as soon as security told them that they were going to escalate this issue and then it was just the four of us remaining until arrest. </p><p><b>KABAS: So when you were finally arrested, what did security say to you?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: Security said, “Alright, we've asked you to leave dozens of times now. And you can leave now, it won't be an issue, or we can have you arrested for trespassing.” And a couple of hours before we actually were arrested, they had put us—the people who were sitting down—they put us on administrative leave so that they could confiscate our badges. Because once you are put on administrative leave, you don't have any access to your corporate devices. You don't have any access to the building, and they just take your badges. So it was only at that point that they could really charge us with trespassing. Because before then, we were Google employees with active badges who had every right to be in that workplace. It took them until putting us on administrative leave that they could actually get the cops to come in. </p><p><b>KABAS: That’s actually helpful context because I was wondering how they said you were on private property if you work there. So that was the way that they did it.</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: It looked like they were genuinely, the entire time, just trying to figure out what to do. I don't think that they had people do this ever—Google employees just refusing to leave as an act of protest. So they were struggling to figure out what the next steps would be to get us to leave. </p><p><b>KABAS: When did you find out that you had been fired, and how did you find out?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: We were arrested around 9:30 PM [Tuesday], then finally got released from the prison at like 2 AM that following day. So we were just there for four hours. And then 7 PM that day—so almost 24 hours after our arrest—I was having dinner with one of the people I was arrested with and they just look up from their phone and say “we’ve been fired.” And then I checked my email and sure enough, we both had received emails just saying “effective immediately termination,” or something along those lines. And then we very quickly found out that more people were fired, and then Google sent out that email saying, “hey guys, we fired 28 of you.” </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c67404ec-447c-45f7-af48-d73a45172452/IMG_2633.PNG?t=1713483179"></p><p><b>KABAS: If I understand correctly, some of the 28 people fired were not actually involved in the sit in. Is that right?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: Yeah, this was retaliation, like completely indiscriminate—people who had just walked by just to say hello and maybe talk to us for a little bit. They were fired. People who aren't affiliated with No Tech For Apartheid at all, who just showed up and were interested in what was going on. And then security asked to see their badge and they were among the 28 fired. </p><p> They had to reach out after the fact to tell us, hey, I was impacted by this. Like we had no reason to suspect that someone who wasn't affiliated with us or wasn't even wearing a shirt or anything related to our sit-in—we had no reason to think that they would be retaliated against. </p><p><b>KABAS: That's </b><i><b>baffling</b></i><b>.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Back to the memo sent out to everyone from Chris Rackow, one line really jumped out which is, “If you're one of the few who are tempted to think we're going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again.” How did you interpret that? Did you see that as a threat?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: That's a threat. That is without a doubt a threat. They're just saying, “Hey, don't even dare to think that you can do what these people did.” </p><p><b>KABAS: I think people define the effectiveness or the success of a protest in different ways. How would you define whether or not this protest is successful?&nbsp;</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: I believe it is successful right now, like just by the response that we've seen. We did not believe that this one protest was going to get Project Nimbus dropped. It was more that we believed that we wanted to encourage more people to stand up against this contract. We wanted to activate more tech workers, to let them know that there are people who are willing to stand up against their company's complicity in this genocide. So I think from the response we've seen, internally at Google, people supporting us and the people reaching out to join No Tech For Apartheid, I'd say this is a huge success. </p><p><b>KABAS: Now that you're not able to protest from the inside because you're not working there anymore, what do you hope that people who remain at Google will do next?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: I hope they organize—maybe not the same action, but I hope they do their best to make their voices heard, because a lot of these people are just hearing about this protest for the first time. And we've seen so much support for the people who have been arrested, for the people who have been fired, and we've seen a lot of pushback against the email that got sent out. And I think all of these things together are making people realize, what's going on at Google? And I truly believe people are gonna make their voices heard regardless of the threat that was made. </p><p><b>KABAS: What was some of the internal pushback about the memo?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: I mean, very, very reasonably, we were seeing just responses from people saying that like, it seemed threatening. That it seemed a bit much in response to Google employees just sitting-in, in their workspace peacefully, saying, “Hey, drop Project Nimbus or come talk to us about it. Have some sort of conversation with us.” It was a complete overreaction on Google's part to not only fire everyone who was and wasn't involved, but then also threaten everyone else in the company who would dare think to stand up against this. And people are taking notice that it feels like a very fascist environment. </p><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e8a7e916-6e4c-4ab0-918c-33eba2efe4fe/IMG_2636.JPG?t=1713483210"></p><p><small><p>Banner in New York office (via No Tech For Apartheid)</p></small></p></div><p><b>KABAS: I was looking back, and in the past, </b><b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/technology/google-employee-israel.html?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=i-spoke-with-a-google-worker-fired-for-protesting-a-1-2-billion-contract-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google employees</a></b><b> have resigned as a result of company retaliation against their activism and some, like you, have been fired. Why in this specific case do you think they took the more extreme action of going straight to firing you?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: I think they're scared. I think Google is genuinely afraid of their workers standing up against this project. We know that we [No Tech For Apartheid] are a worker-led organization, even though many times they have tried to paint us as an external group that doesn't represent actual employees. But no, we are Google employees. That's why we all were fired. And Google understands the power that we have, and they are afraid that by more of us speaking up, that they will actually have to do something about it. </p><p><b>KABAS: How can other tech workers support your efforts?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: Share the story. Share as far as it can reach. Tell more people about what we're doing. Speak out against your own company if it is complicit in this genocide. A lot of tech companies are—Amazon is also in this [Project Nimbus] contract with Google and Israel. And we have <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/chandler-breaking/2024/04/16/does-intel-support-israel-what-the-company-and-protestors-are-saying/73334624007/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=i-spoke-with-a-google-worker-fired-for-protesting-a-1-2-billion-contract-with-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Intel</a> who is also complicit in this genocide. So if you're at one of these tech companies, stand up against them, and if you're not, share the story. And I think we'll have more ways to support our cause going forward. </p><p><b>KABAS: What comes next for you?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: That's a great question. I think 28 people right now are all trying to figure out what comes next. For me personally, I'm gonna continue to speak up against this as long as I can make my voice heard. Even if I'm not internally at Google, I've been going to Palestinian protests. I will continue to go to more protests. I'll go to protest against Google. I'll go to protest against anyone who's complicit in genocide—that's first and foremost. And then we can figure out about getting a new job later. </p><p><b>KABAS: And I'm just curious, do you have a personal connection to Palestine? What got you really clued into this particular issue?</b></p><p> I'm Syrian. I'm Muslim. But I'm human, and that should be enough for anyone to have a connection to Palestine. </p><p><b>KABAS: What would be your message to the world right now?</b></p><p> IBRAHEEM: Stand up and make your voices heard, even if it might be scary. Even if you might face retaliation. Even if you're alone—because people need it right now. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>PPP3</h2>
"Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd Edition)", aka PPP3,
is an introduction to programming for people who have never programmed before.
It will also be useful for people who have programmed a bit and want to improve
their style and technique - or simply learn modern C++.
It is designed for classroom use, but written with an eye on self study.
<a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/PPP2.html">Ealier versions of this book</a>
have been used as the basis for first programming classes for electrical engineering,
computer engineering, and computer science students at Texas A&amp;M University and in many other places.
<p>
People who have seen PPP2 will notice that PPP3 is about half its size.
What I have done to keep the weight down is to
</p><ul>
<li>
strengthen the foundational chapters usually covered in a one-semester course,
utilizing key parts of C++20 and C+23,
and re-basing the Graphics/GUI chapter code on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)">Qt</a>
for portability (e.g., to browsers and phones).
</li><li>
placed the more specialized chapers (known as "broadening the view" in PPP2) on the Web for people to use as needed.
See below.
</li><li>
eliminate the pure reference material.
You now can find more and more up-to-date material on the web, e.g.
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a>.
</li></ul>
The
<a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/PPP2.html">supporting material for PPP2</a>
is available as ever (lecture slides, code, etc.).
<p>
Here are some PPP3 samples

I wouldn’t suggest this outside of fairly senior developers.<p>Without a very good grasp of the language, it can be counterproductive to deep learning. The linters teach what to do, but not why, so it’s hard to grasp how the codebase is worse without following the linter, or when it’s appropriate to disable a linter vs dealing with it.</p><p>Ie I’m not a great JS dev. When the linter says “this should be an arrow function” I understand how to do that, but not why an arrow function is preferable there or in general. I would probably be a better JS dev if I hadn’t had the linter, felt whatever pain from not using arrow functions, and know why they’re important. Or never feel the pain and realize it’s a style choice more than a functional one.</p><p>I prefer using them to help me remember things I already understand. I know why mutating a copy of a string doesn’t mutate the caller’s copy, so I’m happy to have a linter point out when I’m trying to do that inadvertently.

And now I'd say I have a very good understanding of python and its best practices, and I'm now one of the most proficient python developers in my department (it's not a high bar, we have many data scientists, which are most of the time only proficient in their libraries/tooling they use, and I'm one of the few that is not a data scientist).</p><p>I'm not saying that solely ruff was the reason I'm now in proficient in python, but it made it easier + I would have never looked into some things without it.</p><p>For example, I also type my python code, and before I used ruff I had many problems with circular dependencies. But ruff could fix it with a simple automatic fix by using from __future__ import annotations and if TYPE_CHECKING.</p><p>And the ruff documentation also gives more explanation on the why and how for most of their rules, which is also very valuable.</p><p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/future-rewritable-type-annotation/#flake8-executable-exe" rel="nofollow">https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/future-rewritable-type-ann...</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-type-checking_quote-annotations" rel="nofollow">https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-type-check...</a>

Then comparing your approach to the actual approach.</p><p>This can show you things that you might've missed taking into account.</p><p>For example, gallery-dl's incidental complexity all lies in centralizing persistent state, logging, and IO through the CLI. It doesn't have sufficient abstraction to allow it to be rewired to different UIs without relying on internal APIs that have no guarantee that won't change.</p><p>Meanwhile a similar application in yt-dlp has that abstraction and works better, but has similar complexity in the configuration side of things.

One of my personal favorites in Python is mixing strings and UUIDs as dictionary keys.  This positively guarantees a fun afternoon.<p>Edit: speling

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is recalling all 3,878 Cybertrucks that it has shipped to date, due to a problem where the accelerator pedal can get stuck, putting drivers at risk of a crash, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK#recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>The recall caps a tumultuous week for Tesla. The company laid off more than 10% of its workforce on Monday, and lost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/tesla-layoffs-workers-sales-cybertruck-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of its highest-ranking executives</a>. A few days later, Tesla asked shareholders to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/tesla-x-advertising-musk-stock-package-delware-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-vote</a> on CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation package that was struck down by a judge earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reports of problems with the Cybertruck’s accelerator pedal <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/716031/tesla-cybertruck-stuck-accelerator-pedal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a60512399/tesla-cybertruck-stuck-pedal-nhtsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popping</a> up in the last few weeks. Tesla even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24131237/tesla-delivery-delay-accelerator-pedal-stuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly paused deliveries</a> of the truck while it sorted out the issue. Musk said in a post on X that Tesla was “being very cautious” and the company reported to NHTSA that it was not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the problem.</p>
<p>The company has now confirmed to NHTSA that the pedal can dislodge, making it possible for it to slide up and get caught in the trim around the footwell.</p>
<p>Tesla said it first received a notice of one of these accelerator pedal incidents from a customer on March 31, and then a second one on April 3. After performing a series of tests, it decided on April 12 to issue a recall after determining that an “[a]n unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,” and that “[r]esidual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.”</p>
<p>Tesla says it will replace or rework the accelerator pedal on all existing Cybertrucks. It also told NHTSA that it has started building Cybertrucks with a new accelerator pedal, and that it’s fixing the vehicles that are in transit or sitting at delivery centers.</p>
<p>While the Cybertruck only first started shipping late last year, this is not the vehicle’s first recall. But the initial one was minor: Earlier this year, Tesla recalled the software on all of its vehicles because the font sizes of its warning lights <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/recalls/2024/02/02/tesla-recall-font-size-warning-lights/72447967007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were too small</a>. The company first unveiled the truck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/behold-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>



<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2023-09-04</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2023-09-07</span>.</p>
<p><span id="description">Someone wrote me an email and asked if I could share some tips on how to structure the $HOME directory, so here we go.</span></p>

<p>Structuring or organizing directories is not much different from structuring or organizing other stuff and it really comes down to what makes the most sense to you - at least as long as you're only dealing with your own directories. As soon as you're dealing with an organization, things can very quickly get out of hand.</p>

<p>The main purpose behind any kind of organizing is efficiency. That really is the keyword. You need to be able to easily and quickly find what you're looking for and just as easily and quickly be able to store what needs to be stored.</p>

<p>Over the years I have changed my directory structure for my home directory a couple of times, but not so for about the last 10+ years because I have settled on something that works really well for me.</p>

<p>I don't like clutter and I try to keep things simple. If I need some kind of rule book in order to remember how to store my files in my home directory, then this is a clear sign that something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>In my home directory I have all the basic hidden stuff which is a part of any modern Unix operating system such as <code>.config</code>, <code>.aliases</code>, <code>.profile</code>, <code>.gnupg</code>, <code>.mozilla</code>, etc. Though I would prefer that all applications would respect the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory">XDG_CONFIG_HOME</a>, which defaults to <code>$HOME/.config</code>, I don't mess with that and generally don't care too much about that.</p>

<p>In the past <a href="https://www.unixdigest.com/tutorials/keeping-your-home-in-git.html">I kept my $HOME in Git - the right way</a> ;), which is a really great way to organize dotfiles. Today I still put all my dotfiles in Git because I like to keep a history of changes, but I only leave those dotfiles in place which work identically across the different systems I use. The setup specific dotfiles is kept in a "dotfiles" directory and I then use symlinks (more about that in a little while).</p>

<p>Regarding normal files and directories I primarily use two methods of organizing, namely "category" and "dates".</p>

<p>This is my basic directory structure:</p>

<pre>bin
data
edata
mnt
usr/dotfiles
</pre>

<p>Besides from the above, I just leave the <code>Desktop</code> and <code>Downloads</code> directories, which different applications seem to want to shove down the throat of everybody. In the past I "fought" against those, because I generally don't use them and I don't like them, but life is just too short to mess with crap like that.</p>

<p><b>Update 2023-09-04:</b> You can set directories such as <code>Desktop</code>, <code>Downloads</code> and others with the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/user-dirs.dirs.5.en">user-dirs.dirs</a> - settings for XDG user dirs, which most applications should respect (thanks Hugo for pointing this out!)</p>

<p>In the <code>bin</code> directory I keep my shell scripts and personal binary executables (not stuff installed via the package manager).</p>

<p>The <code>mnt</code> directory I use for different mount points, like when I mount an SD card, a USB disk, some of the shared storage I use in my homelab.</p>

<p>It looks something like this:</p>

<pre>mnt
  \foo
  \bar
  \baz
</pre>

<p>I <strong>never</strong> auto mount, but generally use shell scripts for mounting. So if I have a USB disk I call "foo", I have a shell script called <code>mfoo</code>. It doesn't matter how the "foo" disk gets recognized by the system, the shell script will make sure that the disk gets mounted at <code>mnt/foo</code> each time, and if the disk is encrypted, it will prompt me for the passphrase, if I don't use a key.</p>

<p>The <code>usr/dotfiles</code> directory is kept in Git together with generic dotfiles that work identically across all systems, like <code>.aliases</code>. I use symlinks to the relevant files in the <code>dotfiles</code> directory. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre>$ ls -l ~/usr/dotfiles/config/i3
freebsd-config
linux-config
</pre>

<pre>$ ls -l ~/.config/i3
config -&gt; /home/foo/usr/dotfiles/config/i3/linux-config
</pre>

<p><code>linux-config</code> is then a specific configuration file for <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> which I only use on my Linux systems. This might be because the shortcut I use to run Firefox, starts Firefox in a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AppArmor">AppArmor</a> controlled <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firejail">Firejail</a>, which doesn't exist on FreeBSD. On FreeBSD I might use <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?capsicum(4)">Capsicum</a> to get a similar experience. Just as an example.</p>

<p>I have a couple of other subdirectories in the <code>$HOME/usr</code> directory besides the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but those are not really relevant to mention in detail for this article (a directory for some outdated shell scripts, some wallpapers, etc.)</p>

<div><p><b>NOTE:</b> Configuration files (dotfiles) can be managed in many different ways. I have changed my approach a couple of times throughout the years. My preferred method is to <a href="https://www.unixdigest.com/tutorials/keeping-your-home-in-git.html">keep my $HOME in Git</a>. If you only run a single system or similar systems I can highly recommend the method I describe in the tutorial I have linked to.</p><p>But remember this, don't just follow what other people tell you to do, find the way that makes you the most productive, the way that is best wired to "fit your brain, your way of thinking" and then simply change that if you later find a more productive way.</p></div>

<p>The <code>data</code> and <code>edata</code> directories are the two main directories where I keep all my stuff. These two directories are ZFS datasets that run on a mirrored pool of disks that are separate from my root installation. I run both FreeBSD and several different Linux distributions on my main workstation and these each run on their own set of disks.</p>

<p>All of this could be setup in other ways too, but I prefer this setup. I can easily mount both <code>data</code> and <code>edata</code> from both FreeBSD and Linux.</p>

<p>The difference between <code>data</code> and <code>edata</code> is that <code>edata</code> is a ZFS native encrypted dataset.</p>

<p>By utilizing ZFS I regularly use snapshots and ZFS send and receive for easy backup to network storage. This can be done even without decrypting the encrypted dataset.</p>

<p>You could ask what the point is of having both an encryptet dataset and an unencryptet dataset, why not just put everything into the encryptet dataset?</p>

<p>The fact is that I would rather not have anything encryptet at all. Encryption is great for privacy, but it is an absolute horrible layer of complexity to put on top of an already complex layer of a filesystem and ZFS encryption is not without its bugs, see issues <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/13533">13533</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/14330">14330</a>.</p>

<div><p><b>TIP:</b> I highly recommend that you ALWAYS backup all your important data to multiple different storage solutions and locations - it's okay to be paranoid about important data.</p><p>Actually, you SHOULD be paranoid about important data. I learned this the really hard way - a long time ago - when I had just finished writing a 200+ A4 pages book and then lost everything because of a silly mistake and had to start all over and write the book again!</p><p>It is impossible to describe that very special feeling that arises when you have just realized what just happened! Noooooooooooooo! Pleeeeeeaseeeeee NOOOOOOOOOOO! (utter despair and disbelief - LOL).</p><p>So, today I not only use ZFS send and receive, but I also copy data to other filesystems all together, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>. For encryption I utilize both ZFS native encryption, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geli_(software)">GELI</a> (for my main FreeBSD root disks) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">LUKS</a> (for my main Linux root disks) and I also not only follow the 3-2-1 backup rule, but add further copies to multiple systems. That way, even if some bug is found that might cause a problem for me, I have a high degree of being able to get my files without having to mess with the problem.</p><p>I do NOT use cloud storage for anything important. I rather keep local copies at places like family, friends or in a safety deposit box (unfortunately, safety deposit boxes are currently being removed from the banks in Denmark).</p></div>

<p>In the <code>data</code> directory I have a few subdirectories:</p>

<pre>books
notes
source
</pre>

<p>The <code>books</code> directory contains books I have written or I am working on.</p>

<p>The <code>source</code> directory contains source code for various projects I work on.</p>

<p>The <code>notes</code> directory contains a huge amount of personal notes on everything from health to politics to computer related subjects. I write everything in pure text, mainly in Markdown or just without any special markup. Everything is structured according to category or subject and it looks like this (short version):</p>

<pre>data/notes/
  astronomy
  business
  electronics
  health
  it
  language
  ...
</pre>

<p>Each main subject also has a subdirectory called <code>files</code> which I use for stuff I find online related to the subject. Files in the <code>files</code> directory can be images, text, audio and video. If I only have a few files, I just dump them all in the <code>files</code> directory, but if I have a lot, I organize them further by putting them in the relevant categories.</p>

<p>Within each category of directory I might also keep a hidden subdirectory called <code>.outdated</code>. I use this hidden directory to put stuff away that is, well, outdated, but might still come in handy.</p>

<p>It then looks something like this:</p>

<pre>$ tree
.
└── data
    └── notes
        └── it
            └── operating-systems
                ├── freebsd

                │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── how-to-setup-y.md
                ├── linux
                └── openbsd
</pre>

<p>I always keep an exported shell variable that contains the location of my notes. That way I can easily link to any other document or external file from within my notes and use Vim to open the file (if it's a text document) by pressing <code>gf</code> or use Vim's build in ability to execute a shell command from within the document. I use that to view PDF files or play a video, etc.</p>

<p>In my notes I might have a Markdown link to a PDF file which looks like this:</p>

<pre>This is the [foo document]($NOTES/it/operating-systems/freebsd/files/text/foo.pdf) relevant for information about foo.</pre>

<p>When you have setup a default application for reading PDF files, then from within Vim you can just place the cursor on the filename and then press <code>gx</code> and Vim will open up the PDF file in the relevant PDF reader. Or you can copy and paste the path to the file and then open it with your PDF reader by typing ! from within Vim (I generally use <a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a> or <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">zathura</a> for reading PDF documents):</p>

<pre>:!mupdf $NOTES/it/operating-systems/freebsd/files/text/foo.pdf</pre>

<p>This works for other applications as well, such as opening video with <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> or images with something like <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/">feh</a>.</p>

<div><p><b>NOTE:</b> Hyphen vs underscore in filenames and directory names?</p><p>Originally, when I stopped using Windows back in about 1998, I was used to using spaces between words in filenames and directories. As I progressed into the world of Linux and BSD, I changed all spaces to underscores, but since I have done (and still do) a lot of web development I eventually settled on hyphens. I not only think it looks better, but the fact is that <a href="https://developers.google.com/style/filenames">search engines interpret hyphens in file and directory names as spaces between words. Underscores are usually not recognized</a>, and as such, their presence can negatively affect search engine optimization. Even though files in my home directory are my private files and not something I put out on the web, I have just settled on using hyphens everywhere.</p><p>Filename "foo_bar_baz" becomes "foobarbaz" on a search engine, whereas "foo-bar-baz" becomes "foo bar baz".</p></div>

<p>As mentioned, I also keep an encrypted directory called <code>edata</code>. I do that because I believe that it's important to encrypt private stuff in case your computer gets stolen.</p>

<p><b>TIP:</b> Remember that if you use encryption for anything which other family members might need to be able to access in case you pass away, you need to make sure that they know how to do that!</p>

<p>The <code>edata</code> directory is organized in a similar fashion with "categories" being the main structure.</p>

<pre>documents
  \letters
    \foo
    \bar
  \receipts
\media
  \family
    \audio
    \photos
      \2022
      \2023
    \video
      \2022
      \2023
  \foo
    \photos
      \2022
      \2023
    \video
      \2023
\projects
  \foo
    \documents
      \email
      \letters
    \media
      \photos
        \2023
  \bar
  \baz
</pre>

<p>Subdirectories within <code>documents</code> and <code>projects</code> are further subdivided by categories depending on the relevant context.</p>

<p><b>TIP:</b> I have one basic rule which I implement regarding naming files and directories. The rule is this: I need to be able to easily determine what something is just by looking at the name.</p>

<p>If you stumble upon a file that you don't know what is just by looking at the name of the file, open the file immediately and see what it is and then rename it to something that makes better sense the next time you happen to look at the filename.</p>

<p>If you keep leaving files and directories in a mess, it quickly becomes very difficult to fix later.</p>

<p>I personally use long and descriptive file names whenever it's needed to keep me from having to open the file in order to determine what the file is about.</p>

<p>I have many times seen a mess like this in someones directory (I believe we have all been there at some point LOL):</p>

<pre>document.pdf
document2.pdf
document3.pdf
Document.pdf
document-new.pdf
new-new-document.pdf
new-new-new-document.pdf
old-document.pdf
...
</pre>

<p>If you're new to working with files and directories, you will most likely change your structure and setup more than once - don't worry about it, that's normal, it means you're evolving and improving your setup :)</p>

<p>Last, but not least, I don't keep old data lying around forever. When I am sure something isn't useful any longer, I delete it.</p>

<li>The app does not release allocated memory;</li>
<li>There is an implied autoreleasepool, but one is not explicitly created.</li>
<li>A small reliance on <code>__attribute__((constructor))</code>, which is not the best way to do things…</li>
<li>WAY too many framework includes and links to dylibs we don't need.</li>
<li>Built and tested on OS X Lion.  Theoretically, it's possible this works on all machines that support the modern ObjC runtime, however, use on older OSes below 10.6 is highly discouraged.</li>
<li>All calls to framework objects are compliant with OS X 10.0+, however the code will only run on intel architectures.  This will be remedied first.</li>

How many cars do I own today?\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> Let's break it down!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You currently own 3 cars.\nLast year, you sold 2 cars.\n\nTo find the number of cars you owned before selling any, add the current number to the number of cars sold:\n3 (current) + 2 (sold) = 5 cars\n\nSince you've already sold those 2 cars, subtract them from the total:\n5 - 2 = 3 cars\n\nYou still own the same 3 cars that you currently own.\n````\neven made this question almost properly! ... forgot about 1 gold coin... \n````\nI have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> Let's break down the changes you've experienced step by step!\n\n1. You start with 10 apples.\n2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, which doesn't affect your apple count.\n3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with 6 apples (10 - 4 = 6).\n4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).\n5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).\n6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.\n\nLet's calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:\n\nYou have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:\n\n5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples\n\nAdding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:\n\n24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples\n\nAs for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it's likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.\n\nYou now have 34 apples!\n````\n\nlook on this!   insane!  only GPT4 and OPUS can answer it! \n````\nCreate 10 sentences that ends with a word \&quot;apple\&quot;. Remember the word \&quot;apple\&quot; MUST be at the end.\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> Here are 10 sentences that end with the word \&quot;apple\&quot;:\n\n1. The farmer picked a juicy red apple.\n2. She ate a crunchy snack of peanut butter and apple.\n3. The teacher asked her student to bring a small green apple.\n4. I love biting into a fresh, crisp autumn apple.\n5. Grandma always kept a sweet, ripe Granny Smith apple.\n6. The health-conscious person chose a healthy Gala apple.\n7. Dad planted a row of seedless Red Delicious apple.\n8. In the still life painting, there was a beautiful Golden apple.\n9. Mom packed a lunchbox with a juicy Fuji apple and cheese.\n10. At the farmer's market, I bought a big, ripe Braeburn apple.\n\nEach sentence ends with the word \&quot;apple\&quot;, as requested!\n````\nor this ... \n````\nWhat are the top 10 most famous non-human animal statues?\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> What a unique question!\n\nHere's a list of the top 10 most famous non-human animal statues, in no particular order:\n\n1. **The Lion at the Louvre** (Paris, France): A majestic bronze lion statue guarding the entrance to the world-famous Louvre Museum.\n2. **The Charging Bull** (New York City, USA): A iconic bronze sculpture of a bull, symbolizing strength and resilience, located in Lower Manhattan's Financial District.\n3. **The Horses of Saint-Mark's Basilica** (Venice, Italy): Four magnificent bronze horses adorning the facade of Saint-Mark's Basilica, a masterpiece by Italian sculptor Barletta.\n4. **The Lion of Belfort** (Belfort, France): A massive 15-meter-tall stone lion statue guarding the citadel in eastern France.\n5. **The Elephant Gates** (Paris, France): Two colossal bronze elephants flanking the entrance to the Musée d'Orsay, a famous art museum.\n6. **The Bronze Horseman** (St. Petersburg, Russia): A stunning equestrian statue of Peter the Great, located in Senate Square, symbolizing Russian history and culture.\n7. **The Fountain of the Four Rivers** (Rome, Italy): A majestic bronze statue depicting four rivers (Nile, Ganges, Danube, and Rio Plata) being personified as women, located in the Piazza Navona.\n8. **The Lion of Glasgow** (Glasgow, Scotland): A grand stone lion statue standing guard outside the City Chambers building in Glasgow's George Square.\n9. **The Horse Guards** (London, UK): Two imposing bronze horse statues situated at the entrance to Buckingham Palace, symbolizing British military prowess.\n10. **The Sea Lions of the Golden Gate Bridge** (San Francisco, USA): Two iconic bronze sea lion statues guarding the Golden Gate Bridge, a popular tourist attraction.\n````\ninsane ...\n````\nIf I lay 2 wet shirts out in the sun flat on the ground to dry and it takes 5 hours until they are dry, how long would it take to dry 4 shirts of the same type that way simultanously?\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> A great question about drying shirts!\n\nThe time it takes for the shirts to dry is influenced by factors like air circulation, temperature, and humidity. Since you're laying them flat on the ground in the sun, we can assume that these conditions are similar for all four shirts.\n\nSince it took 5 hours to dry 2 shirts simultaneously, it's likely that the drying process is not affected by the number of shirts being dried. This means that the same amount of time would be required to dry 4 shirts as well!\n\nSo, if it takes 5 hours to dry 2 shirts, it would still take approximately 5 hours to dry all 4 shirts simultaneously\n````\n\n````\nThere are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> The classic lateral thinking puzzle!\n\nLet's break it down: \&quot;two ducks in front of a duck\&quot; means that one duck is standing in front of another.\n\n\&quot;Two ducks behind a duck\&quot; implies that this same duck is being followed by two more ducks.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the \&quot;duck in the middle\&quot;.\n\nSo, if we combine all these clues, we can conclude that there are... 3 ducks!\n````\n\n\nTHAT llama3 8b is INSANE.\nBetter than anything I saw even better than wizard 2 8x22b !

The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).\n5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).\n6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.\n\nLet's calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:\n\nYou have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:\n\n5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples\n\nAdding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:\n\n24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples\n\nAs for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it's likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.\n\nYou now have 34 apples!\n</code></pre>\n<p>look on this!   insane!  only GPT4 and OPUS can answer it! </p>\n<pre><code>Create 10 sentences that ends with a word \&quot;apple\&quot;.

Since you're laying them flat on the ground in the sun, we can assume that these conditions are similar for all four shirts.\n\nSince it took 5 hours to dry 2 shirts simultaneously, it's likely that the drying process is not affected by the number of shirts being dried. This means that the same amount of time would be required to dry 4 shirts as well!\n\nSo, if it takes 5 hours to dry 2 shirts, it would still take approximately 5 hours to dry all 4 shirts simultaneously\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle.

How old is each of us now?\nA: Let's break this down step by step!\nLet's say your current age is x.\nTwo years ago, your age was x - 2.\nAccording to the problem, two years ago, you were three times as old as your brother. So, your brother's age two years ago was (x - 2) / 3.\nNow, let's fast-forward to three years from now. Your age will be x + 3.\nAccording to the problem, in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother. So, your brother's age in three years will be (x + 3) / 2.\nWe can set up an equation using the information:\n(x - 2) / 3 = (x + 3) / 2\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n2(x - 2) = 3(x + 3)\nExpand and simplify:\n2x - 4 = 3x + 9\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n-4 = x + 9\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n-13 = x\nSo, your current age is x = 13.\nNow, let's find your brother's current age. Two years ago, your brother was (x - 2) / 3 = (13 - 2) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67 years old (approximately).\nSince your brother is 2 years younger than you, his current age is 3.67 + 2 = 5.67 years old (approximately).\nSo, you are currently 13 years old, and your brother is currently 5.67 years old.\n\nCorrect answer is 17 and 7.

In three years, I will be twice as old as my brother. How old is each of us now?\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nLet's break this problem down step by step.\n\nLet the current age of your brother be 'x'.\n\nTwo years ago, you were 3 times his age, so two years ago, your age was 3x - 2.\n\nWe are given that two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. So we can set up an equation:\n\n3x - 2 = 3(x - 2)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n3x - 2 = 3x - 6\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n-2 = -6\n\nNow, let's fast-forward three years.

You currently own 3 cars.
Last year, you sold 2 cars.

To find the number of cars you owned before selling any, add the current number to the number of cars sold:
3 (current) + 2 (sold) = 5 cars

Since you've already sold those 2 cars, subtract them from the total:
5 - 2 = 3 cars

You still own the same 3 cars that you currently own.

<p>even made this question almost properly! ... forgot about 1 gold coin... </p>
<pre><code>I have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; Let's break down the changes you've experienced step by step!

1. You start with 10 apples.
2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, which doesn't affect your apple count.
3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with 6 apples (10 - 4 = 6).
4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).
5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).
6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.

Let's calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:

You have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:

5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples

Adding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:

24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples

As for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it's likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.

You now have 34 apples!

The time it takes for the shirts to dry is influenced by factors like air circulation, temperature, and humidity. Since you're laying them flat on the ground in the sun, we can assume that these conditions are similar for all four shirts.

Since it took 5 hours to dry 2 shirts simultaneously, it's likely that the drying process is not affected by the number of shirts being dried. This means that the same amount of time would be required to dry 4 shirts as well!

So, if it takes 5 hours to dry 2 shirts, it would still take approximately 5 hours to dry all 4 shirts simultaneously

<pre><code>There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; The classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's break it down: "two ducks in front of a duck" means that one duck is standing in front of another.

"Two ducks behind a duck" implies that this same duck is being followed by two more ducks.

And, of course, there's the "duck in the middle".

So, if we combine all these clues, we can conclude that there are... 3 ducks!

	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>I answered the second time the most complex question ... and answered CORRECTLY .... I remind GPT-4 is hardly answering this one.</p>
<pre><code>I have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nLet's break it down step by step!

1. You start with 10 apples.

2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, but this information doesn't change your apple count.

3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with:
        * 10 - 4 = 6 apples

4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of:
        * 6 (your remaining apples) + 18 (birds' apples) = 24 apples

5. You play an online game and win 6 gold coins, but you have to share them equally with your 2 teammates. That means you get:
        * 6 coins / 3 players = 2 coins per player
        You now have a total of: 3 (initial coins) + 1 (new coin) + 2 (shared coins) = 6 gold coins

6. You buy apples for all the coins you have, using the price of an apple being 0.5 coins:
        * 6 coins / 0.5 coins per apple = 12 apples
        You now have a total of: 24 apples (from birds and previous losses) + 12 apples (bought with gold coins) = 36 apples

So, you now have 36 apples!

As for the river, it's near a big city that has something to do with what you can spend the coins on. Based on the fact that you won gold coins and spent them on apples, I'm going to take a guess that the river is near a city known for its agriculture or fruit production!
</code></pre>
<p>Also only GPT-4 is answering this one ... </p>
<pre><code>Create 10 sentences that ends with a word "apple". Remember the word "apple" MUST be at the end.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere are 10 sentences that end with the word "apple":

1. The farmer picked the juiciest apple.
2. I'm going to make a pie with this sweet apple.
3. He took a big bite of his crunchy apple.
4. The tree is bearing delicious red apple.
5. She hid her phone under the kitchen apple.
6. It's time to eat a healthy green apple.
7. They went on a trip to pick fresh yellow apple.
8. The teacher gave each student a small shiny new apple.
9. He got bitten by a wormy old apple.
10. I'm saving up my money for a brand new shiny apple.

Let me know if you need anything else!

<p>I asked for a snake game!<br>WORKS<br>WTF</p>
<pre><code>Provide complete working code for a snake game in python please.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. This game creates a window with a snake that you can control to eat food pellets while avoiding the edges and its own tail.

```
import pygame
import random
import time
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up some constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
SPEED = 10
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Set up the snake and food
snake = [(200, 200), (220, 200), (240, 200)]
food = (400, 300)
direction = 'right'

# Game loop
while True:
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and direction != 'down':
                direction = 'up'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and direction != 'up':
                direction = 'down'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and direction != 'right':
                direction = 'left'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and direction != 'left':
                direction = 'right'

    # Move the snake
    head = snake[0]
    if direction == 'up':
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] - SPEED)
    elif direction == 'down':
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] + SPEED)
    elif direction == 'left':
        new_head = (head[0] - SPEED, head[1])
    elif direction == 'right':
        new_head = (head[0] + SPEED, head[1])

    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    # Check for collision with food
    if snake[0] == food:
        food = (random.randint(0, WIDTH - SPEED), random.randint(0, HEIGHT - SPEED))
    else:
        snake.pop()

    # Check for collision with the edge or itself
    if (snake[0][0] &lt; 0 or snake[0][0] &gt;= WIDTH or
        snake[0][1] &lt; 0 or snake[0][1] &gt;= HEIGHT or
        snake[0] in snake[1:]):
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # Drawing
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    for pos in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (pos[0], pos[1], SPEED, SPEED))
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (food[0], food[1], SPEED, SPEED))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

This game will run indefinitely until the snake collides with the edge or itself.

<p>It was trained on 15 trillion tokens so it makes sense to me. It makes mistakes on this prompt though:</p>
<pre><code>Is Europe the only continent that starts with A?

<p>This is due to the nature of language models and prompting them with false information will make them produce the most likely false information you would like. However, is still impressive on this size this kind of performance. Is literally the old GPT-4 model on your pc.</p>

<pre><code>Question: Two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. In three years, I will be twice as old as my brother. How old is each of us now?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nLet's break this problem down step by step.

Let the current age of your brother be 'x'.

Two years ago, you were 3 times his age, so two years ago, your age was 3x - 2.

We are given that two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. So we can set up an equation:

3x - 2 = 3(x - 2)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation:

3x - 2 = 3x - 6

Simplifying the equation:

-2 = -6

Now, let's fast-forward three years. In three years, you will be twice as old as your brother.

Your age in three years will be (3x - 2) + 3.
Brother's age in three years will be x + 3.

The problem states that in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother. So we can set up another equation:

(3x - 2) + 3 = 2(x + 3)

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation:

3x - 2 + 3 = 2x + 6

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 1 = 2x + 6

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

x + 1 = 6

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

x = 5

So, your brother is currently 5 years old.

Since you were three times his age two years ago, you must have been 15 years old two years ago. This means that your current age is:

3(5) - 2 + 2 = 17

You are currently 17 years old.

<p>that small model even coding is doing well .... 8b </p>
<pre><code>Provide complete working code for a realistic looking tree in Python using the Turtle graphics library and a recursive algorithm.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere is an example of how you can create a realistic-looking tree using the Turtle graphics library in Python with a recursive algorithm:

```Python
import turtle
import random

def draw_tree(branch_len, t):
    if branch_len &gt; 5:
        angle = random.uniform(15, 45)
        new_length = branch_len * 0.7 + random.randint(-1, 1)

        t.forward(branch_len)
        t.right(angle)

        draw_tree(new_length, t)

        t.left(2*angle)
        draw_tree(new_length, t)

        t.right(angle)
        t.backward(branch_len)

def main():
    win = turtle.Screen()
    win.bgcolor("white")

    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.speed(0)
    t.color("brown", "green")

    draw_tree(75, t)

    turtle.done()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code:

*   We define a recursive function `draw_tree` to draw the tree. This function takes two arguments: the length of the branch and the Turtle object.
*   The base case for the recursion is when the branch length becomes less than 5 (arbitrary value).
*   Inside the function, we randomly choose an angle between 15° and 45°, and then calculate a new branch length by reducing the original length by about 30% with some randomness to simulate natural branching.
*   We draw the branch forward, turn right by the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` recursively with the new branch length, turn left by twice the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` again with the same new branch length, and then turn right back to the original direction to return to the parent branch.
*   The `main` function sets up a Turtle graphics window, creates a Turtle object, sets its speed to fast, color to brown with green fill, and calls `draw_tree` with an initial branch length of 75 units.

			<p>New Mexico’s state senate took up a startling amendment in 1995 — it would have required psychologists to dress up as wizards when providing expert testimony on a defendant’s competency:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When a psychologist or psychiatrist testifies during a defendant’s competency hearing, the psychologist or psychiatrist shall wear a cone-shaped hat that is not less than two feet tall. The surface of the hat shall be imprinted with stars and lightning bolts. Additionally, a psychologist or psychiatrist shall be required to don a white beard that is not less than 18 inches in length and shall punctuate crucial elements of his testimony by stabbing the air with a wand. Whenever a psychologist or psychiatrist provides expert testimony regarding a defendant’s competency, the bailiff shall contemporaneously dim the courtroom lights and administer two strikes to a Chinese gong.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The measure had received unanimous approval in the senate and was headed for the house of representatives when sponsor Duncan Scott explained that he’d intended it as satire — he felt that too many mental health practitioners had been acting as expert witnesses. It was withdrawn and never signed into law.</p>

This is one of the most-requested features and is available today in public alpha. Resumable Uploads are also transitioning from Beta to Generally Available.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/supabase/storage">Supabase Storage Engine</a> is fully open source and is one of the few storage solutions that offer 3 interoperable protocols to manage your files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads">Standard uploads</a>: simple to get started</li>
<li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads">Resumable uploads</a>: for resumable uploads with large uploads</li>
<li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/compatibility">S3 uploads</a>: for compatibility across a plethora of tools</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WvvGhcNeSPk" title="Supabase Storage is now compatible with AWS S3" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>

<p>We always strive to adopt industry standards at Supabase. Supporting standards makes workloads portable, <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture#everything-is-portable">a key product principle</a>. The S3 API is undoubtedly a storage standard, and we're making it accessible to developers of various experience-levels.</p>
<p>The S3 protocol is backwards compatible with our other APIs. If you are already using Storage via our REST or TUS APIs, today you can use any S3 client to interact with your buckets and files: upload with TUS, serve them with REST, and manage them with the S3 protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol works on the cloud, local development, and self-hosting. Check out the API compatibility <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/compatibility">in our docs</a></p>
<h3 id="authenticating-with-supabase-s3">Authenticating with Supabase S3</h3>
<p>To authenticate with Supabase S3 you have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The standard <code>access_key</code> and <code>secret_key</code> credentials.</strong> You can generate these from the <a href="https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/storage">storage settings page</a>. This authentication method is widely compatible with tools supporting the S3 protocol. It is also meant to be used <em>exclusively serverside</em> since it provides full access to your Storage resources.</p>
<p>We will add scoped access key credentials in the near future which can have access to specific buckets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User-scoped credentials with RLS.</strong> This takes advantage of a well-adopted concept across all Supabase services, <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security">Row Level Security</a>. It allows you to interact with the S3 protocol by scoping storage operations to a particular authenticated user or role, respecting your existing RLS policies. This method is made possible by using the Session token header which the S3 protocol supports. You can find more information on how to use the Session token mechanism in the <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/authentication#session-token">doc</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="s3-compatible-integrations">S3-compatible Integrations</h3>
<p>With the support of the S3 protocol, you can now connect Supabase Storage to many 3rd-party tools and services by providing a pair of credentials which can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>You can use popular tools for backups and migrations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/">AWS CLI</a>: The official AWS CLI</li>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>: a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>: a cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows.</li>
<li>and any other s3-compatible tool ...</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s3-for-data-engineers">S3 for Data Engineers</h3>
<p>S3 compatibility provides a nice primitive for Data Engineers. You can use it with many popular tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Warehouses like ClickHouse</li>
<li>Query engines like DuckDB, Spark, Trino, &amp; Snowflake External Table</li>
<li>Data Loaders like Fivetran &amp; Airbyte</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example our incredible data analyst, Tyler, demonstrates how to store Parquet files in Supabase Storage and query them directly using DuckDB:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/diL00ZZ-q50" title="store Parquet files in Supabase Storage and query them directly using DuckDB" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
<h3 id="multipart-uploads-in-s3">Multipart Uploads in S3</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard uploads and resumable uploads, we now support multipart uploads via the S3 protocol.
This allows you to maximize upload throughput by uploading chunks in parallel, which are then concatenated at the end.</p>

<p>Along with the <a href="https://supabase.com/ga">platform GA announcement</a>, we are also thrilled to announce that resumable uploads are also generally available.</p>
<p>Resumable uploads are powered by the <a href="https://tus.io/">TUS protocol</a>. The journey to get here was immensely rewarding, working closely with the TUS team. A big shoutout to the maintainers of the TUS protocol, <a href="https://github.com/Murderlon">@murderlon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Acconut">@acconut</a>, for their collaborative approach to open source.</p>
<p>Supabase contributed <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Afenos">some advanced features</a> from the Node implementation of TUS Spec including <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pull/514">distributed locks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pull/517">max file size</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pull/513">expiration extension</a> and numerous bug fixes:</p>

<p>These features were essential for Supabase, and since the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server">TUS node server</a> is open source, they are also available for you to use. This is another core principle: wherever possible, we <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture#support-existing-tools">use and support existing tools</a> rather than developing from scratch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-bucket transfers:</strong> We have added the availability to copy and move objects across buckets, where previously you could do these operations only within the same Supabase bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized error codes:</strong> Error codes have now been standardized across the Storage server and now will be much easier to branch logic on specific errors. You can find the list of error codes <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/debugging/error-codes">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-tenant migrations:</strong> We made significant improvements to the running migrations across all our tenants. This has reduced migration errors across the fleet and enables us to run long running migrations in an asynchronous manner. Stay tuned for a separate blog post with more details.</li>
<li><strong>Decoupled dependencies:</strong> Storage is fully decoupled from other Supabase products, which means you can run Storage as a standalone service. Get started with this <a href="https://github.com/supabase/storage/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose file</a>.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Nestlé, the world’s largest consumer goods company, adds sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products sold in many poorer countries, contrary to international guidelines aimed at preventing obesity and chronic diseases, a report has found.</p><p>Campaigners from Public Eye, a Swiss investigative organisation, sent samples of the Swiss multinational’s baby-food products sold in Asia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Africa</a> and Latin America to a Belgian laboratory for testing.</p><p>The results, and examination of product packaging, revealed added sugar in the form of sucrose or honey in samples of Nido, a follow-up milk formula brand intended for use for infants aged one and above, and Cerelac, a cereal aimed at children aged between six months and two years.</p><p>In Nestlé’s main European markets, including the UK, there is no added sugar in formulas for young children. While some cereals aimed at older toddlers contain added sugar, there is none in products targeted at babies between six months and one year.</p><p>Laurent Gaberell, Public Eye’s agriculture and nutrition expert, said: “Nestlé must put an end to these dangerous double standards and stop adding sugar in all products for children under three years old, in every part of the world.”</p><p>Obesity is increasingly a problem in <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" data-link-name="in body link">low- and middle-income countries</a>. In Africa, the number of overweight children under five has increased by nearly 23% since 2000, according to the World Health Organization. Globally, more than 1 billion people are living with obesity.</p><p>It is not always easy for consumers in any country to tell whether a product contains added sugar, and how much is present, based on nutritional information printed on packaging alone. Labels often include naturally occurring sugars in milk and fruit under the same heading as any added sugars.</p><p><a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/364678/WHO-EURO-2022-6681-46447-67287-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" data-link-name="in body link">WHO guidelines</a> for the European region say no added sugars or sweetening agents should be permitted in any food for children under three. While no guidance has been specifically produced for other regions, researchers say the European document <a href="https://accesstonutrition.org/app/uploads/2023/12/COMMITs-Adapted-WHO-Europe-Nutrient-Profile-Model-for-Commercially-Produced-Complementary-Foods-1-1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">remains equally relevant</a> to other parts of the world.</p><figure id="630f6f24-536e-4500-800d-1a300915d01f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tins of baby food on a shop shelf" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Cerelac on sale in a British supermarket.

The highest figures are in low- and middle-income countries, with 40% of sales just in Brazil and India.</p><p>Dr Nigel Rollins, a medical officer at the WHO, said the findings represented “a double standard […] that can’t be justified”.</p><p>Biscuit-flavoured cereals for babies aged six months and older contained 6g of added sugar for every serving in Senegal and South Africa, researchers found. The same product sold in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Switzerland</a> has none.</p><p>Tests on Cerelac products sold in India showed, on average, more than 2.7g of added sugar for every serving.</p><p>In Brazil, where Cerelac is known as Mucilon, two out of eight products were found to have no added sugar but the other six contained nearly 4g for each serving. In Nigeria, one product tested had up to 6.8g .</p><p>Meanwhile, tests on products from the Nido brand, which has worldwide retail sales of more than $1bn, revealed significant variation in sugar levels.</p><p>In the Philippines, products aimed at toddlers contain no added sugar. However, in Indonesia, Nido baby-food products, sold as Dancow, all contained about 2g of added sugar per 100g of product in the form of honey, or 0.8g a serving.</p><p>In Mexico, two of the three Nido products available for toddlers contained no added sugar, but the third contained 1.7g per serving. Nido Kinder 1+ products sold in South-Africa, Nigeria and Senegal all contained nearly 1g per serving, the report said.</p><figure id="78a682d2-2684-4c4d-afa6-5844b715533c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:18,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Global health and environmental costs of food industry are $10tn a year – UN&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;78a682d2-2684-4c4d-afa6-5844b715533c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/06/global-health-disease-environmental-costs-food-industry-10tn-dollars-a-year-un-fao&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>A Nestlé spokesperson said: “We believe in the nutritional quality of our products for early childhood and prioritise using high-quality ingredients adapted to the growth and development of children.”</p><p>She said that within the “highly regulated” category of baby food, Nestlé always complied “with local regulations or international standards, including labelling requirements and thresholds on carbohydrate content that encompasses sugars” and declared total sugars in its products, including those coming from honey.</p><p>Variations in recipes depended on factors including regulation and availability of local ingredients, she said.</p><p>The company has reduced the total amount of added sugars in its infant cereals portfolio by 11% worldwide over the past decade, she said, and continued to reformulate products to reduce them further.</p><p>Sucrose and glucose syrup were being phased out of “growing-up milks” aimed at toddlers worldwide, she added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The story of a geeky twist on "Party like it's 1999".</p><div><p>As a geek born in the early 1990s, who has been playing with computers from a young age, I think fondly of what tech looked like in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>So, naturally, when I got my hands on an old computer a few months ago, I installed Windows 98 on it as a way to revive software from my childhood and play around with it. Among the gems I wanted to revisit was Netscape Communicator, a software suite from 1997 centered around Netscape Navigator, which was the first web browser I ever used. One of the other applications included in that suite was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> web page editor named Netscape Composer.</p>
<p>Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family members' and friends' computers. This is likely how I got the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as "page" and "hyperlink".</p>
<p>Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool.</p>
<p>The version of Netscape Composer I used is the one included in <em>Netscape Communicator 4.8</em>, released in 2002. I set the following rules for my experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim was to create a web page looking as much as possible like my actual website's home page;</li>
<li>By using Netscape Composer only;</li>
<li>Without writing a single line of HTML or CSS;</li>
<li>I was allowed to use images for the social media icons in the page footer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-aim"><a href="#the-aim" aria-label="the aim permalink"></a>The Aim</h2>
<p>This is what my actual home page looks like:</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The aim of my experiment" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-aim.png">
</p>
<h2 id="the-visual-result"><a href="#the-visual-result" aria-label="the visual result permalink"></a>The Visual Result</h2>
<p>This is the end result, as seen in Netscape Composer itself:</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-result-composer.png" alt="The final result, as seen in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>And now, the same result, as seen in <em>Netscape Navigator</em> with a 1024x768 resolution:</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-result-navigator.png" alt="The final result, as seen in Netscape Navigator"></p>
<p>Finally, what it looks like on a modern browser:</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The final result, as seen in a modern browser" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-result-modern.png">
</p>
<p>Here are some ways in which the look of the result differs from the aim:</p>
<ul>
<li>The result pretty much occupies the whole viewport, with no margin. I did not find a way to add margins or padding to the page's body in Netscape Composer.</li>
<li>My picture is not circle-shaped.</li>
<li>I had to settle for <code>:-)</code> in lieu of the smiling emoji. As Netscape Composer has an "Insert Special Character" feature, I was hoping it would at least offer me a ☺, but it did not. I could of course have copied that symbol from somewhere, but I felt like that would have moved me away from my goal of using <em>only</em> Netscape Composer.</li>
<li>The links in the result are underlined. I was not able to change their styling other than the color.</li>
<li>The margins between elements are wrong. I was not able to customize them except for the images.</li>
<li>The result uses default fonts available in web browsers. I did not find a way to add custom fonts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-resulting-html"><a href="#the-resulting-html" aria-label="the resulting html permalink"></a>The Resulting HTML</h2>
<p>This is the HTML that was produced by Netscape Composer:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, how does it look?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go ahead and say: not so bad, actually! Sure, it lacks a bit of indentation, and it contains a few things that would make any modern web developer cringe, such as <code>font</code> and <code>center</code> tags, and styling attributes (Netscape Composer did not know CSS). But it is not worse than some of the old-fashioned HTML I have seen from university professors. Hey, at least the tags are not written in all caps!</p>
<p>On a more technical point of view now: did I get valid HTML? Let's throw that code at the W3C Validator!</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-w3c.png" alt="W3C Validator Results: 12 errors, 2 warnings"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-w3c-errors.png" alt="Some of the errors found by the validator"></p>
<p>Oops, it turns out the code contains quite a few errors according to the W3C, mostly about using invalid attributes and values, as well as missing alternative texts for images (the latter could have been fixed directly in Netscape Composer). Nevertheless, it would have rendered as intended in 2002, and it is rendering as intended today. What I saw in Netscape Composer was what I got!</p>
<h2 id="the-journey"><a href="#the-journey" aria-label="the journey permalink"></a>The Journey</h2>
<p>So, how was it to use a WYSIWYG web page editor from over 20 years ago? Quite pleasant, actually. That application has more than decent UX, and has not made me swear nearly as much as Microsoft Word does in a typical usage session. Here is an overview of the steps I followed to create my page:</p>
<p>I started with setting some general properties for the page, such as its title, background color, and text colors for paragraphs and links.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-1.png" alt="Setting page title and description in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-2.png" alt="Setting page colors in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-3.png" alt="Custom color selection in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>Then I proceeded to type the text content of my page, discovering the "Insert Special Character" feature along the way (that I hoped would contain ☺). Dropdown menus on the top toolbar made it easy to style all the text as needed. It was also quite easy to add the horizontal line and the table, and to customize them as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-4.png" alt="The &quot;Insert Special Character&quot; window in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-5.png" alt="Adding a horizontal line in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-6.png" alt="Adding a table in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>The following step was to add the image at the top of the page and make sure it floated as intended on the left of the title. That went surprisingly well! It is one of the ways in which Netscape Composer failed to make me swear as much as Microsoft Word.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-7.png" alt="Adding an image in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>At some point along the way, I realized that Netscape Composer did not like the relative addresses I had used for my links (maybe because the targetted files did not actually exist on my file system?), and had weirdly added <code>../../</code> at the beginning of all of them. I therefore changed them to absolute URLs.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-8.png" alt="Link property with added ../.. in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>Fun fact: to transfer the images I needed for my web page to my Windows 98 machine, I used an unsecured FTP server on Debian, hosted on my local network, that I accessed using an old version of FileZilla. It just worked! I used the same method to transfer all the screenshots I took for this blog post back to my contemporary computer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottomline"><a href="#the-bottomline" aria-label="the bottomline permalink"></a>The Bottomline</h2>
<p>I think the main thing I will remember about this experiment is: I had fun! It was a pleasant stroll down memory lane and a nice reminder of what HTML used to look like. It also made the demonstration that the Web was built as such a robust platform that outdated HTML generated by an app from more than two decades ago can still render as originally intended on a modern web browser. I will also remember that good UX can be found in old-timey applications too!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gajus.com/blog/setting-up-postgre-sql-for-running-integration-tests">https://gajus.com/blog/setting-up-postgre-sql-for-running-integration-tests</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40082409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post-body"><p>When it comes to testing, achieving performance and reliability is crucial. In this article, I'll explain how to set up <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> for tests and discuss some common pitfalls to avoid.</p>
<h2 id="isolation-as-the-primary-goal"></h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, let's define our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong> –&nbsp;We want to ensure that each test runs in isolation. At the very least, this means that each test should have its own database. This ensures that tests don't interfere with each other and that you can run tests in parallel without any issues.</li>
<li><strong>performance</strong> –&nbsp;We want to ensure that setting up PostgreSQL for tests is fast. A slow solution is going to be cost prohibitive for running tests in CI/CD pipelines. The solution that we come up with must allow us to execute tests without introducing too much overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this article will focus on what we have tried, what worked, and what didn't work.</p>
<h2 id="what-didnt-work"></h2>
<h3 id="using-transactions"></h3>
<p>The first approach we tried was to use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-transactions.html">transactions</a>. We would start a transaction at the beginning of each test and roll it back at the end.</p>
<p>The basic idea is illustrated in the following example:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="ts" data-theme="default"><code data-language="ts" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'calculates total basket value'</span><span>, </span><span>async</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>await</span><span> pool.</span><span>transaction</span><span>(</span><span>async</span><span> (</span><span>tx</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>await</span><span> tx.</span><span>query</span><span>(sql.</span><span>unsafe</span><span>`</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      INSERT INTO basket (product_id, quantity)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      VALUES (1, 2)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    `</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>total</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>getBasketTotal</span><span>(tx);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>expect</span><span>(total).</span><span>toBe</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  });</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>});</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The transaction approach works well for simple cases (e.g., testing a single function), but it quickly becomes a problem when dealing with tests that <em>test integration</em> between multiple components. Due to connection pooling, nested transactions, and other factroes, the necessary work to make the transaction approach work would have meant that we are not replicating the real-world behavior of our application, i.e. it would not provide the confidence we need.</p>
<p>For consistency, we also want to avoid mixing testing approaches. Even though using transactions would suffice for some tests, we want to have a consistent approach across all tests.</p>
<h3 id="using-sqlite"></h3>
<p>Another approach we tried was to use SQLite. SQLite is an in-memory database that is fast and easy to set up.</p>
<p>Similar to the transaction approach, SQLite works well for simple cases. However, it quickly becomes a problem when dealing with code paths that use PostgreSQL-specific features. In our case, due to the use of various PostgreSQL extensions, PL/pgSQL functions, and other PostgreSQL-specific features, we couldn't use SQLite for our tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite">pglite</a> provides PostgreSQL packaged as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Module">WASM module</a> that can be used in Node.js. This might be a good alternative, though we haven't tried it yet. Regardless, the current lack of support for extensions would have been a blocker for us.</p>
<h3 id="using-pg_tmp"></h3>
<p>Another approach we tried was to use <a href="https://eradman.com/ephemeralpg/"><code>pg_tmp</code></a>. <code>pg_tmp</code> is a tool that creates a temporary PostgreSQL instance for each test.</p>
<p>In theory, <code>pg_tmp</code> is a good solution. It allows a complete isolation of tests. In practice, is a lot slower than we could tolerate. With <code>pg_tmp</code>, it takes a few seconds to start and populate the database, and this overhead quickly adds up when running thousands of tests.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 1000 tests, and each test takes 1 second to run. If you add 2 seconds of overhead for creating a new database, you are looking at an additional 2000 seconds (33 minutes) of overhead.</p>
<p>If you like this approach, you could also probably get away with using Docker containers. Depending on many factors, Docker containers might be even faster than <code>pg_tmp</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/allaboutapps/integresql">integresql</a> is a project that I came across in a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26947964">HN thread</a>. It seems like a good alternative that reduces the overhead of creating a new database to about 500ms. It has a pooling mechanism that allows you to reduce the overhead even further. We decided against continuing on this path because we were happy with the level of isolation that we got from using <a href="#template-databases">template databases</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-worked"></h2>
<p>After trying various approaches, we settled on combining two approaches: <a href="#template-databases"><em>template databases</em></a> and <a href="#mounting-a-memory-disk"><em>mounting a memory disk</em></a>. This approach allowed us to isolate each test at a database level without introducing too much overhead or complexity.</p>
<h3 id="template-databases"></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/manage-ag-templatedbs.html">template databases</a> is a database that serves as a template for creating new databases. When you create a new database from a template database, the new database has the same schema as the template database. The steps to create a new database from a template database are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a template database (<code>ALTER DATABASE &lt;database_name&gt; is_template=true;</code>)</li>
<li>Create a new database from the template database (<code>CREATE DATABASE &lt;new_database_name&gt; TEMPLATE &lt;template_database_name&gt;;</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The key advantage of using template databases is that you do not need to mess with managing multiple PostgreSQL instances. You can create copy databases and have each test run in isolation.</p>
<p>However, on its own, template databases are not fast enough for our use case. The time it takes to create a new database from a template database is still too high for running thousands of tests:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql" data-theme="default"><code data-language="sql" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>postgres</span><span>=</span><span># </span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> foo TEMPLATE contra;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>Time</span><span>: </span><span>1999</span><span>.</span><span>758</span><span> ms (</span><span>00</span><span>:</span><span>02</span><span>.</span><span>000</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is where the <a href="#mounting-a-memory-disk">memory mounting</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The other limitation of template databases to be aware of is that no other sessions can be connected to the source database while it is being copied. <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> will fail if any other connection exists when it starts; during the copy operation, new connections to the source database are prevented. It is an easy enough limitation to work around using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">mutex pattern</a>, but it is something to be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="mounting-a-memory-disk"></h3>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is mounting a memory disk. By mounting a memory disk, and creating the template database on the memory disk, we can significantly reduce the overhead of creating a new database.</p>
<p>I will talk about how to mount a memory disk in the next section, but first, let's see how much of a difference it makes.</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql" data-theme="default"><code data-language="sql" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>postgres</span><span>=</span><span># </span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> bar TEMPLATE contra;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>Time</span><span>: </span><span>87</span><span>.</span><span>168</span><span> ms</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a significant improvement and makes the approach viable for our use case.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this approach is not without its drawbacks. The data is stored in memory, which means that it is not persistent. If the database crashes or the server restarts, the data is lost. However, for running tests, this is not a problem. The data is recreated from the template database each time a new database is created.</p>
<h3 id="using-docker-container-with-a-memory-disk"></h3>
<p>The approach we settled on was to use a Docker container with a memory disk. Here is how you can set it up:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme="default"><code data-language="bash" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>$</span><span> </span><span>docker</span><span> </span><span>run</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>-p</span><span> </span><span>5435</span><span>:5432</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>--tmpfs</span><span> </span><span>/var/lib/pg/data</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>-e</span><span> </span><span>PGDATA=/var/lib/pg/data</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>-e</span><span> </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>--name</span><span> </span><span>contra-database</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>--rm</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>postgres:14</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above command, we are creating a Docker container with a memory disk mounted at <code>/var/lib/pg/data</code>. We are also setting the <code>PGDATA</code> environment variable to <code>/var/lib/pg/data</code> to ensure that PostgreSQL uses the memory disk for data storage. The end result is that the underlying data is stored in memory, which significantly reduces the overhead of creating a new database.</p>
<h3 id="managing-test-databases"></h3>
<p>The basic idea is to create a template database before running the tests and then create a new database from the template database for each test. Here is a simplified version of how you can manage test databases:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="ts" data-theme="default"><code data-language="ts" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>import</span><span> {</span></span>

<p>At this point, you can use <code>getTestDatabase</code> to create a new database for each test. The <code>destroy</code> method can be used to clean up the database after the test has run.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"></h2>
<p>This setup allows us to run thousands of tests in parallel across multiple shards without any issues. The overhead of creating a new database is minimal, and the isolation is at a database level. We are happy with the performance and reliability that this setup provides.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One day in the late 1930s, <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/wallace-daniel-webster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Webster Wallace</a>—“80 John,” as he was known in ranching circles—rode his favorite horse, Blondie, from his Mitchell County ranch to the Loraine post office. It was a familiar route for him in this mostly flat, sandy part of the state halfway between Midland and Abilene. He had made the six-mile round trip dozens of times. Wallace collected his mail then walked back to Blondie. In his time, 80 John had broken hundreds of broncs. His tougher-than-bull-hide body had never failed him. But on this day, he lacked the strength to swing his leg over the saddle. A group of men saw him struggling and hustled over to lift 80 John onto Blondie.&nbsp;</p><p>Wallace was Black. The men who helped him were white. One might imagine that such a scene would have been jaw-dropping in Depression-era Texas, where white hostility toward people of color was common. But the West Texas cowboy culture of the time was distinctive. Men of different races often supported and respected one another. And no cowboy was more respected than Wallace.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact he was one of the most remarkable figures in our history. By the time of his death from influenza and pneumonia in 1939, Wallace had built a West Texas ranch of 8,800 acres and amassed a personal fortune purported to be more than a million dollars—equivalent to about $22 million today. He brought about technical innovations that are still used and devoted much of his savings to strengthening his community—all at a time when it would have been difficult for a white man, much less a Black man born enslaved, to accomplish any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet few have heard of him today. Last year I attended the awards banquet at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum, in Oklahoma City, at which Wallace was inducted into <a href="https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/collections/awards/great-westerners/" target="_blank">the Hall of Great Westerners</a>, joining such luminaries as Buffalo Bill and U.S. Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O’Connor. I pride myself on being knowledgeable about the Old West, but I hadn’t heard of 80 John until that night, nor had many other attendees.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourteen members of Wallace’s family were present, and when they arrived, “people were looking at us like, ‘What are <em>you</em> doing here?’ ” says his great-granddaughter Daphne Fowler, who lives on her great-grandparents’ ranch. “But after the banquet, we had all these people coming up to us like, ‘Wow, we had no idea!’ ” The event, she says, was about twenty years in the making. “We have been pushing to get him recognized. And it’s not just <a href="https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/collections/awards/great-westerners/inductees/daniel-80-john-webster-wallace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recognition for my great-grandfather</a>. There have been a lot of cowboys of color, and their stories don’t get told.”&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Larry Callies, founder</strong> of <a href="https://www.blackcowboymuseum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Black Cowboy Museum</a>, in Rosenberg, believes that the Houston region is the birthplace of the American cowboy. “The word ‘cowboy’ itself began being used in Fort Bend County and the surrounding area in 1821,” Callies says. “It was applied to Black slaves who worked with cattle.” (He notes that just as an enslaved person who worked inside the mansion would be referred to as a “houseboy,” one who took care of cattle was referred to as a “cowboy.” Even decades later, the term “cowboy” remained unpopular with white cowpunchers because of its racial connotations.) As early as the 1840s, <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/historic-trail-ride-black-cowboys-cowgirls-houston-rodeo/">Black men who were enslaved rounded up free-range Longhorns </a>on the plains west of Houston and drove them north across Indian Territory to Kansas, establishing Texas’s fabled cattle-drive era. 80 John’s story emerges from this rich culture.</p><p>He was born in 1860 on a two-hundred-acre farm outside Inez, in Victoria County, not far from the Gulf Coast, to parents who were enslaved. His mother, Mary Wallace, had been bought by the farm’s owners, Mary and Josiah O’Daniel, to serve as a maid and wet nurse. His father, William Wallace, worked as a farmhand. The O’Daniels put young Wallace to work in the fields as a small child, and he received virtually no formal education. “Schools were scarce,” he told his daughter in the 1930s. “I received most of my learning by contact with others and observation.” 80 John and his family remained enslaved until the Juneteenth emancipation announcement, in 1865.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, the O’Daniels moved to a larger farm about eighty miles north, outside Flatonia, taking the Wallace family with them—this time as paid employees. The families maintained ties for the next seventy years; 80 John stayed in touch with the O’Daniels’ sons, M. H. and Dial, until his death.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary Wallace saved her coins with the intent of someday buying real estate. The lesson was not lost on 80 John, who from an early age dreamed of owning a spread. He loathed chopping cotton for someone else.</p><p>Cattle drives often passed through the area, and Wallace decided they were his escape route, since many of the cowboys he saw were Black. One predawn morning in March 1876, he ran away from the O’Daniel farm and joined a crew moving cattle nearly three hundred miles northwest, to Buffalo Gap. Wallace was a green hand when he departed Flatonia. By the time the herd reached its destination, he had plenty of experience at “trailing.” Thereafter, work was not hard to find.</p><p>“He rode for the most famous and respected cattle barons of these seminal days of the Texas cattle industry,” says his great-grandson Alfred McMichael, who, along with his son, Keir, hosts <a href="https://80johnwallace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website devoted to 80 John</a>. “He rode every major cattle trail, from the Chisholm Trail to the Goodnight-Loving Trail. He made long, daring solo rides.” None of it was easy. He contended with thunderstorms, blizzards, droughts, dust storms, outlaw gangs, poisonous snakes, disease, infection, sunstroke, lack of food and water, stampedes, and skirmishes with Native Americans. Once he spent days tracking a handful of Comanches who had stolen one of his favorite horses.&nbsp;</p><p>“A friend recommended that I read <em>Lonesome Dove,</em>” McMichael says. “I got a sense of what my great-grandfather’s life on the cattle ranges was like from reading about Joshua Deets.” Deets was the much-respected Black cowboy portrayed by Danny Glover in the TV rendition of Larry McMurtry’s novel. On the other hand, 80 John’s time on the trails was nothing like the world portrayed in the vast majority of Hollywood westerns, in which all of the characters—other than the “evil Indians”—are white.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even now, in 2024, a lot of people aren’t aware of how diverse cowboy culture was,” says Robert Tidwell, interim director of collections, exhibits, and research at <a href="https://ranchingheritage.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas Tech’s National Ranching Heritage Center</a>, in Lubbock. “The main concern on a ranch is, Can you do the job? Can you pull your own weight? And when that’s the main criteria, you’d be surprised at how things shake out. You had more tolerance than you’d find in other places where social structures were more defined. Between twenty and thirty percent of cowboys were Black.” A comparable number of ethnic Mexicans worked on the cattle trail.</p><p>Still, 80 John did occasionally run into racists, and he refused to tolerate them. His daughter Hettye Wallace Branch writes in her book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Story-80-John-Biography-Respected/dp/1258481251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Story of “80 John</a>,”</em> that one white man bullied him at a cow camp in West Texas. The six-foot-three 80 John responded by whupping the offender in a fistfight, which apparently instilled respect in his adversary. Improbable as it seems, the two men developed a friendship.</p><p>In 1878 a letter informed Wallace that his mother, whom he had not seen since leaving the O’Daniels’ farm, two years earlier, was deathly ill. He hurried back home but arrived too late. He settled his mother’s estate—which included a few acres she had bought—and then returned to West Texas, where he went to work for Clay Mann. Neither man’s life would be the same.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="829" height="1020" alt="Daniel Webster Wallace’s employer, Clay Mann, and his wife, Mary Mann, in 1871." sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=832&amp;wpsize=large" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=300&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=244&amp;wpsize=medium 244w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=945&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=50&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=41&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 41w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=832&amp;wpsize=large 832w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1536&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1248&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1248w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=2048&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1665&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 1665w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 829w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=832&amp;wpsize=large"><figcaption><span>Daniel Webster Wallace’s employer, Clay Mann, and his wife, Mary Mann, in 1871.</span><span>Courtesy of Scurry County Museum</span></figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>Though largely forgotten</strong> now, Mann was a prototype for the white Texas wheeler-dealer. In his time he was a legend in cow camps throughout the West, a figure who had, as a teenager, started a cattle herd and killed his father’s murderer. At one point Mann owned tens of thousands of cattle and thousands of acres in Texas, New Mexico, and Wyoming. He also owned a 600,000-acre ranch in Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>But there was a problem.</p><p>“Now, Clay, he liked to drink, and he liked to gamble,” his great-grandson Tom “Possum” Mann tells me. “He loved to play a game called Mexican Monte, which was popular in the West at the time. He might win ten thousand dollars in a night, then lose it the next night.” Mann knew he needed someone in his outfit who was levelheaded and trustworthy. 80 John fit the bill. “80 John didn’t drink or gamble or anything,” Possum says. Soon Wallace and Mann were heading up large drives from Texas to cattle towns throughout the Midwest.&nbsp;</p><p>“At the end of a drive,” Possum says, “Clay would pay the hands then give most of the leftover money to 80 John to take back to Clay’s wife, Mary Mann, in Mitchell County. She’d deposit it in the bank he founded in Colorado City. Clay would stay behind with some of the money to gamble and eventually catch a train home.” Mann once gave Wallace $30,000 (the equivalent of $900,000 today) in cash to take to Midland, a three-day ride west from Mann’s ranch. 80 John made sure the money arrived safely.</p><p>Mann’s operations were extensive enough that he registered 43 cattle brands, including, most famously, a huge number 80. Wallace oversaw the burning of that brand onto Mann’s stock, and cattlemen associated him with it. “In West Texas,” Tidwell says, “the name ‘John’ was sort of a generic term for cowhands in general.” Hence the nickname 80 John.</p><p>Wallace’s expertise extended to more than branding and bronc busting. Mann discovered his top employee was freakishly good at arithmetic. He could add columns of numbers in his head, which proved especially useful when it came to financial transactions. “I have a method of figuring of my own which has stood me in good stead,” 80 John told his daughter. “Very seldom I have missed anything due me any larger than a fraction.” He could also scan a pasture with hundreds of cattle and produce a head count that was usually off by fewer than a dozen animals.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Early in their</strong> business relationship, Wallace told Mann that his goal in life was to own land and a herd. Mann began setting aside the lion’s share of 80 John’s pay to accomplish that. Bit by bit, Wallace acquired cattle as he continued working for Mann. Among his other responsibilities, Wallace was the de facto foreman of many of Mann’s properties. Even amid the relative racial comity of cowboy culture it was extraordinarily unusual—perhaps unprecedented—for a Black man to oversee white ranch hands.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1885, Wallace had saved enough to buy 1,280 acres of railroad land south of Loraine, intending to homestead it. Realizing he needed to learn how to read and write before he could become a successful rancher, he enrolled as a second grader at a segregated Black school in Navarro County, almost three hundred miles east of his newly acquired land. Over two terms of studying alongside children, he became functionally literate. He also met and fell in love with Laura Dee Owens, a Corsicana beauty who was finishing high school. They were married in 1888 and remained together until his death almost 51 years later. Laura sacrificed her plans to teach in order to help him build a ranch from scratch. They started life as a married couple in a two-room cabin on one of Mann’s ranches.</p><p>In 1889, 80 John’s world was turned upside down when Mann died from a stomach hemorrhage, caused by decades of hard drinking. Wallace took charge of the cattle operations and became a father figure to Mann’s sons, teaching them the fundamentals of ranching. The Wallace and Mann families established a bond that continued through generations. (Fowler, Wallace’s great-granddaughter, says Mann’s great-great-granddaughter, Becca Mann George, was her childhood best friend, and they remain close.)</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="2500" alt="Wallace’s wife, Laura Dee Owens Wallace, with two of their grandchildren, circa 1918." sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=819&amp;wpsize=large" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=300&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=240&amp;wpsize=medium 240w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=819&amp;wpsize=large 819w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=960&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1536&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1229&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1229w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=2048&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1638&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 1638w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=50&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=40&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 40w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 2000w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=819&amp;wpsize=large"><figcaption><span>Wallace’s wife, Laura Dee Owens Wallace, with two of their grandchildren, circa 1918.</span><span>Courtesy of the Wallace family</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the next decades, 80 John and Laura lived as frugally as possible and saved every dime they could to buy more land and cattle. They made for an ideal partnership. He was good with numbers, while she was more verbal. She could parse the thickest contracts and deeds and then read the salient points aloud to her husband. Wallace had a near-photographic memory when it came to business matters. In meeting with lawyers, he could quote passages verbatim that Laura had read to him. She also took charge of treating sick and injured livestock. Whenever 80 John had to be absent to tend to business, she ran the ranch by herself.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just can’t imagine,” Fowler says, “what it was like in the late 1800s and early 1900s with that pressure of being the only Black rancher out here. Sometimes I’ll go by the cemetery and I’ll smile thinking about what he and Laura did.”</p><p>As early as 1903, <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth41339/m1/72/?q=wallace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallace was admitted to the Cattle Raisers Association of Texas</a> and became a highly regarded member. He was, so far as I can tell, the only Black man during that era who was invited to join the group. To attend each year, he had to board a segregated passenger car at the Colorado City railroad station to travel to Fort Worth. He had to find lodging at a so-called colored hotel. From there he walked to the whites-only hotel that hosted the convention. During one of his train trips, some of his white rancher friends joined him for conversation in the segregated passenger car. The conductor attempted to remove the white men, but one refused to budge. “I have known 80 John for thirty years,” the cattleman said. “We ate and slept on the ground together. I see no reason that makes it impossible for me to sit here now.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2400" height="1500" alt="One of Wallace’s homes, now preserved at the National Ranching Heritage Center, in Lubbock." sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=188&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large 1024w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=480&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=960&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1280&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=31&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=50&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 50w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 2400w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large"><figcaption><span>One of Wallace’s homes, now preserved at the National Ranching Heritage Center, in Lubbock.</span><span>Sue Hancock Jones/Courtesy of National Ranching Heritage Center</span></figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>The Wallaces eventually</strong> lived in a four-room house that 80 John designed and built himself. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TexasHistoricalCommission/photos/80-john-wallace-homestead-national-ranching-heritage-center/3031938386918946/?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfauWJQvz0dCEGi9BQIlUVui6kZLzcxfrH--3-7Zozz71pt2AKP-DsGM5RFOVCDPR8w&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It has since been moved to the grounds of the National Ranching Heritage Center</a> and restored to its original condition. Wallace disdained automobiles, airplanes, telephones, gramophones, and indoor plumbing. “But he was ahead of his time when it came to raising cattle,” says Mark Merrell, a retired Mitchell County judge and educator. The man who started out herding wild Longhorns ended up crossbreeding Herefords and Durhams (Shorthorns), decades before doing so became commonplace.</p><p>He also was an early adopter of windmill technology in West Texas (one of his windmills is on display at the <a href="https://windmill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Windmill Museum</a>, in Lubbock) and created sophisticated concrete watering troughs that other ranchers copied. As the couple became more affluent, they contributed to Mitchell County charities, including paying the construction costs for a Baptist church in Loraine. They also built the Wallace namesake school, in Colorado City, that provided area Black children their only access to education.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1930s, 80 John and Laura drew up a will that put the ranch into a trust. Their primary goal was to provide education funding for subsequent generations of their family. They also wanted to keep the ranch intact. The property is now held by seven trusts. “Each one of the members of the family makes it very specific: don’t sell the land, except to a family member,” says Dwayne Harris, who, as trust officer at City National Bank, managed the ranch for more than twenty years before his retirement. “We had cattle-grazing leases and oil leases as well as revenue from cotton fields, a gravel quarry, and, more recently, wind turbines.” Harris estimates the ranch’s value at $15 million.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s said that around the time Wallace made that mail trip on Blondie, he sank a post in the sandy loam on his property and announced he wanted to be buried at that exact spot. The tombstone that now sits in the middle of the family graveyard replaced the post more than eight decades ago. Even facing death, 80 John proved to be a man who knew what he wanted—and achieved it, stampedes and racism be damned. &nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Austin writer W. K.

</div><p>Women Who Code started as a community group in 2011 by a small team of engineers in San Francisco who were seeking connection and support for navigating the tech industry. The movement grew, city by city, fueled by passionate volunteers that were inspired by the mission and vision. In 2013, Women Who Code, Inc., was registered as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in California and moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a community, we are powerful. For more than a decade, Women Who Code has created a sense of belonging in tech and support for our community, thanks to the dedication and commitment of our members, volunteers, and staff. We have brought together a vibrant community of over 360,000 technologists who deeply care about building an industry that is more diverse, inclusive, and equitable. Today, more than 1,000 volunteers lead local and digital communities, members in 145 countries worldwide give technical talks daily to share knowledge and mentor each other, and a close-knit globally distributed team at WWCode HQ drives the day to day operations.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, we’ve delivered more than 20 thousand community-led events, awarded more than $3.5 million in scholarships, held developer conferences and technical summits in tech hubs around the world, logged more than one million high-skilled, leadership-building volunteer hours, given away more than $2.5 million in conference tickets for broader industry engagement, and shared more than 14,000 job opportunities. Even more than these trackable outputs, we’ve come together to support each other, navigate the industry as a powerful force, share both technical protips and strategies for rising in our careers, and break barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>It is with profound sadness that, today, on April 18, 2024, we are announcing the difficult decision to close Women Who Code, following a vote by the Board of Directors to dissolve the organization. This decision has not been made lightly. It only comes after careful consideration of all options and is due to factors that have materially impacted our funding sources - funds that were critical to continuing our programming and delivering on our mission. We understand that this news will come as a disappointment to many, and we want to express our deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who have been a part of our journey.</p><div>

</div><p><strong><em>While so much has been accomplished, our mission is not complete and our vision of a tech industry where diverse women and historically excluded people thrive at every level is not fulfilled.</em></strong></p><p>Despite our collective efforts, the challenges we face as an organization have become insurmountable. We are deeply saddened by the difficult decision to dissolve the entity, but we hope that this work carries on beyond our end. The collective efforts of tech company leaders and supporters are needed more than ever to welcome women into tech, keep them, and ensure they are given the opportunity to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>To the women in technology, if you have been inspired, made a career connection, leveled up your technical skills, or expanded your network through this movement, we encourage you to keep paying that forward. The world needs women and diverse perspectives at the helm of tech as a critical force that shapes our world every day. Please, keep going.&nbsp;</p><p>As we embark on the process of winding down operations, we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition and fulfilling any remaining obligations to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, we will not be able to continue offering any program services, and will be canceling all upcoming events.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this chapter is coming to a close, we believe that the spirit of our community will endure and hope that the relationships and experiences gained through involvement with Women Who Code will continue to inspire you in your future endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire Team Teal at Women Who Code, we extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been a part of the movement – our members, volunteers, partners, team, allies, and supporters – and encourage you to continue to seek support from other like-minded organizations who authentically support the careers of women in the tech industry and keep inspiring each other as you navigate the industry. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the mission, and work alongside such passionate individuals.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.</p><p><strong>Team Teal @ Women Who Code</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Considering how many fools can calculate, it is
surprising that it should be thought either a difficult
or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to
master the same tricks.

</p><p>Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are
enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks
of advanced mathematics — and they are mostly
clever fools — seldom take the trouble to show you how
easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they
seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous
cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

</p><p>Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have
had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg
to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not
hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will
follow. What one fool can do, another can.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I will often say that the so-called “C ABI” is a very bad one, and a relatively unimaginative one when it comes to passing complicated types effectively. A lot of people ask me “ok, what would you use instead”, and I just point them to the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.regabi/src/cmd/compile/internal-abi.md">Go register ABI</a>, but it seems most people have trouble filling in the gaps of what I mean. This article explains what I mean in detail.</p> <p>I have discussed <a href="https://mcyoung.xyz//2021/11/09/assembly-1/#the-calling-convention">calling conventions</a> in the past, but as a reminder: the <em>calling convention</em> is the part of the ABI that concerns itself with how to pass arguments to and from a function, and how to actually call a function. This includes which registers arguments go in, which registers values are returned out of, what function prologues/epilogues look like, how unwinding works, etc.</p> <p>This particular post is primarily about x86, but I intend to be reasonably generic (so that what I’ve written applies just as well to ARM, RISC-V, etc). I will assume a general familiarity with x86 assembly, LLVM IR, and Rust (but not rustc’s internals).</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></h2> <p>Today, like many other natively compiled languages, Rust defines an unspecified0- calling convention that lets it call functions however it likes. In practice, Rust lowers to LLVM’s built-in C calling convention, which LLVM’s prologue/epilogue codegen generates calls for.</p> <p>Rust is fairly conservative: it tries to generate LLVM function signatures that Clang could have plausibly generated. This has two significant benefits:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Good probability debuggers won’t choke on it. This is not a concern on Linux, though, because DWARF is very general and does not bake-in the Linux C ABI. We will concern ourselves only with ELF-based systems and assume that debuggability is a nonissue.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is less likely to tickle LLVM bugs due to using ABI codegen that Clang does not exercise. I think that if Rust tickles LLVM bugs, we should actually fix them (a very small number of rustc contributors do in fact do this).</p> </li> </ol> <p>However, we are too conservative. We get terrible codegen for simple functions:</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>extract</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>i32</span><span>;</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>

Rust is actually <em>more</em> conservative than what the Linux C ABI mandates, because it actually passes the <code>[i32; 3]</code> in registers when <code>extern "C"</code> is requested.</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>extract</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>i32</span><span>;</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>ret</span></code></pre></figure></div> </div> <p>The array is passed in <code>rdi</code> and <code>rsi</code>, with the <code>i32</code>s packed into registers. The function moves <code>rdi</code> into <code>rax</code>, the output register, and shifts the upper half down.</p> <p>Not only does clang produce patently <em>bad</em> code for passing things by value, but it also knows how to do it better, if you request a standard calling convention! We could be generating <em>way</em> better code than Clang, but we don’t!</p> <p>Hereforth, I will describe how to do it.</p> <h3 id="-zcallconv"><a href="#-zcallconv"><code>-Zcallconv</code></a></h3> <p>Let’s suppose that we keep the current calling convention for <code>extern "Rust"</code><sup id="fnref:just-use-extern-c" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:just-use-extern-c" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but we add a flag <code>-Zcallconv</code> that sets the calling convention for <code>extern "Rust"</code> when compiling a crate. The supported values will be <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code> for the current one, and <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> for the one we’re going to design. We could even let <code>-O</code> set <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> automatically.</p> <p>Why keep the old calling convention? Although I did sweep debugability under the rug, one nice property <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> will not have is that it does not place arguments in the C ABI order, which means that a reader replying on the “Diana’s silk dress cost $89” mnemonic on x86 will get fairly confused.</p> <p>I am also assuming we may not even support <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> for some targets, like WASM, where there is no concept of “registers” and “spilling”. It may not even make sense to enable it for for debug builds, because it will produce much worse code with optimizations turned off.</p> <p>There is also a mild wrinkle with function pointers, and <code>extern "Rust" {}</code> blocks. Because this flag is per-crate, even though functions can advertise which version of <code>extern "Rust"</code> they use, function pointers have no such luxury. However, calling through a function pointer is slow and rare, so we can simply force them to use <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code>. We can generate a shim to translate calling conventions as needed.</p> <p>Similarly, we can, in principle, call any Rust function like this:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>secret_call</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>extern</span> <span>"Rust"</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>my_func</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>my_func</span><span>()</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>However, this mechanism can only be used to call unmangled symbols. Thus, we can simply force <code>#[no_mangle]</code> symbols to use the legacy calling convention.</p> <h2 id="bending-llvm-to-our-will"><a href="#bending-llvm-to-our-will">Bending LLVM to Our Will</a></h2> <p>In an ideal world, LLVM would provide a way for us to specify the calling convention directly. E.g., this argument goes in that register, this return goes in that one, etc. Unfortunately, adding a calling convention to LLVM requires writing a bunch of C++.</p> <p>However, we can get away with specifying our own calling convention by following the following procedure.</p> <ol> <li> <p>First, determine, for a given target triple, the maximum number of values that can be passed “by register”. I will explain how to do this below.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide how to pass the return value. It will either fit in the output registers, or it will need to be returned “by reference”, in which case we pass an extra <code>ptr</code> argument to the function (tagged with the <code>sret</code> attribute) and the actual return value of the function is that pointer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide which arguments that have been passed by value need to be demoted to being passed by reference. This will be a heuristic, but generally will be approximately “arguments larger than the by-register space”. For example, on x86, this comes out to 176 bytes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide which arguments get passed by register, so as to maximize register space usage. This problem is NP-hard (it’s the knapsack problem) so it will require a heuristic. All other arguments are passed on the stack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generate the function signature in LLVM IR. This will be all of the arguments that are passed by register encoded as various non-aggregates, such as <code>i64</code>, <code>ptr</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>&lt;2 x i64&gt;</code>. What valid choices are for said non-aggregates depends on the target, but the above are what you will generally get on a 64-bit architecture. Arguments passed on the stack will follow the “register inputs”.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generate a function prologue. This is code to decode each Rust-level argument from the register inputs, so that there are <code>%ssa</code> values corresponding to those that would be present when using <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code>. This allows us to generate the same code for the body of the function regardless of calling convention. Redundant decoding code will be eliminated by DCE passes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generate a function exit block. This is a block that contains a single <code>phi</code> instruction for the return type as it would be for <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code>. This block will encode it into the requisite output format and then <code>ret</code> as appropriate. All exit paths through the function should <code>br</code> to this block instead of <code>ret</code>-ing.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a non-polymorphic, non-inline function may have its address taken (as a function pointer), either because it is exported out of the crate or the crate takes a function pointer to it, generate a shim that uses <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code> and immediately tail-calls the real implementation. This is necessary to preserve function pointer equality.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The main upshot here is that we need to cook up heuristics for figuring out what goes in registers (since we allow reordering arguments to get better throughput). This is equivalent to the knapsack problem; knapsack heuristics are beyond the scope of this article. This should happen early enough that this information can be stuffed into <code>rmeta</code> to avoid needing to recompute it. We may want to use different, faster heuristics depending on <code>-Copt-level</code>. Note that correctness requires that we forbid linking code generated by multiple different Rust compilers, which is already the case, since Rust breaks ABI from release to release.</p> <h3 id="what-is-llvm-willing-to-do"><a href="#what-is-llvm-willing-to-do">What Is LLVM Willing to Do?</a></h3> <p>Assuming we do that, how do we actually get LLVM to pass things in the way we want it to? We need to determine what the largest “by register” passing LLVM will permit is. The following LLVM program is useful for determining this on a particular version of LLVM:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="llvm"><span>%InputI</span> <span>=</span> <span>type</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>]</span>

There are distinct register classes on different systems. For example, on both x86 and ARM, floats and vectors share the same register class (kind of<sup id="fnref:doubles-and-vectors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:doubles-and-vectors" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>).</p> <p>The above values are for x86<sup id="fnref:official-support" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:official-support" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. LLVM will pass six integers and eight SSE vectors by register, and return half as many (3 and 4) by register. Increasing any of the values generates extra loads and stores that indicate LLVM gave up and passed arguments on the stack.</p> <p>The values for <code>aarch64-unknown-linux</code> are 8 integers and 8 vectors for both inputs and outputs, respectively.</p> <p>This is the maximum number of registers we get to play with for each class. Anything extra gets passed on the stack.</p> <p>I recommend that <em>every function</em> have the same number of by-register arguments.

Because <code>poison</code> is equal to “the most convenient possible value at the present moment”, when LLVM sees <code>poison</code> passed into a function via register, it decides that the most convenient value is “whatever happens to be in the register already”, and so it doesn’t have to touch that register!</p> <p>For example, if we wanted to pass a pointer via <code>rcx</code>, we would generate the following code.</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="llvm"><span>; This is a -Zcallconv=fast-style function.</span>

We then have to make some decisions about which portions of the arguments to allocate to registers.</p> <p>First, return values. This is relatively straightforward, since there is only one value to pass. The amount of data we need to return is <em>not</em> the size of the struct. For example, <code>[(u64, u32); 2]</code> measures 32 bytes wide. However, eight of those bytes are padding! We do not need to preserve padding when returning by value, so we can flatten the struct into <code>(u64, u32, u64, u32)</code> and sort by size into <code>(u64, u64, u32, u32)</code>. This has no padding and is 24 bytes wide, which fits into the three return registers LLVM gives us on x86. We define the <em>effective size</em> of a type to be the number of non-<code>undef</code> bits it occupies. For <code>[(u64, u32); 2]</code>, this is 192 bits, since it excludes the padding. For <code>bool</code>, this is one. For <code>char</code> this is technically 21, but it’s simpler to treat <code>char</code> as an alias for <code>u32</code>.</p> <p>The reason for counting bits this way is that it permits significant compaction. For example, returning a struct full of bools can simply bit-pack the bools into a single register.</p> <p>So, a return value is converted to a by-ref return if its effective size is smaller than the output register space (on x86, this is three integer registers and four SSE registers, so we get 88 bytes total, or 704 bits).</p> <p>Argument registers are much harder, because we hit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack problem</a>, which is NP-hard. The following relatively naive heuristic is where I would start, but it can be made infinitely smarter over time.</p> <p>First, demote to by-ref any argument whose effective size is larget than the total by-register input space (on x86, 176 bytes or 1408 bits). This means we get a pointer argument instead. This is beneficial to do first, since a single pointer might pack better than the huge struct.</p> <p>Enums should be replaced by the appropriate discriminant-union pair. For example, <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> is, internally, <code>(union { i32, () }, i1)</code>, while <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> is <code>(union { i32, (), () }, i2)</code>. Using a small non-power-of-two integer improves our ability to pack things, since enum discriminants are often quite tiny.</p> <p>Next, we need to handle unions. Because mucking about with unions’ uninitialized bits behind our backs is allowed, we need to either pass it as an array of <code>u8</code>, unless it only has a single non-empty variant, in which case it is replaced with that variant<sup id="fnref:union-optimization" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:union-optimization" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p> <p>Now, we can proceed to flatten everything. All of the converted arguments are flattened into their most primitive components: pointers, integers, floats, and bools. Every field should be no larger than the smallest argument register; this may require splitting large types such as <code>u128</code> or <code>f64</code>.</p> <p>This big list of primitives is next sorted by effective size, from smallest to largest. We take the largest prefix of this that will fit in the available register space; everything else goes on the stack.</p> <p>If part of a Rust-level input is sent to the stack in this way, and that part is larger than a small multiple of the pointer size (e.g., 2x), it is demoted to being passed by pointer-on-the-stack, to minimize memory traffic. Everything else is passed directly on the stack in the order those inputs were before the sort. This helps keep regions that need to be copied relatively contiguous, to minimize calls to <code>memcpy</code>.</p> <p>The things we choose to pass in registers are allocated to registers in reverse size order, so e.g. first 64-bit things, then 32-bit things, etc. This is the same layout algorithm that <code>repr(Rust)</code> structs use to move all the padding into the tail. Once we get to the <code>bool</code>s, those are bit-packed, 64 to a register.</p> <p>Here’s a relatively complicated example.

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>Above, <code>!dbg</code> metadata for the argument values should be attached to the instruction that actually materializes it. This ensures that gdb does something halfway intelligent when you ask it to print argument values.</p> <p>On the other hand, in current rustc, it gives LLVM eight pointer-sized parameters, so it winds up spending all six integer registers, plus two values passed on the stack. Not great!</p> <p>This is not a complete description of what a completely over-engineered calling convention could entail: in some cases we might know that we have additional registers available (such as AVX registers on x86). There are cases where we might want to split a struct across registers and the stack.</p> <p>This also isn’t even getting into what returns <em>could</em> look like. <code>Result</code>s are often passed through several layers of functions via <code>?</code>, which can result in a lot of redundant register moves. Often, a <code>Result</code> is large enough that it doesn’t fit in registers, so each call in the <code>?</code> stack has to inspect an ok bit by loading it from memory. Instead, a <code>Result</code> return might be implemented as an out-parameter pointer for the error, with the ok variant’s payload, and the is ok bit, returned as an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. There are some fussy details with <code>Into</code> calls via <code>?</code>, but the idea is implementable.</p> <h3 id="optimization-dependent-abi"><a href="#optimization-dependent-abi">Optimization-Dependent ABI</a></h3> <p>Now, because we’re Rust, we’ve also got a trick up our sleeve that C doesn’t (but Go does)! When we’re generating the ABI that all callers will see (for <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code>), we can look at the function body. This means that a crate can advertise the <em>precise</em> ABI (in terms of register-passing) of its functions.</p> <p>This opens the door to a more extreme optimization-based ABIs. We can start by simply throwing out unused arguments: if the function never does anything with a parameter, don’t bother spending registers on it.</p> <p>Another example: suppose that we know that an <code>&amp;T</code> argument is not retained (a question the borrow checker can answer at this point in the compiler) and is never converted to a raw pointer (or written to memory a raw pointer is taken of, etc). We also know that <code>T</code> is fairly small, and <code>T: Freeze</code>. Then, we can replace the reference with the pointee directly, passed by value.</p> <p>The most obvious candidates for this is APIs like <code>HashMap::get()</code>. If the key is something like an <code>i32</code>, we need to spill that integer to the stack and pass a pointer to it! This results in unnecessary, avoidable memory traffic.</p> <p>Profile-guided ABI is a step further. We might know that some arguments are hotter than others, which might cause them to be prioritized in the register allocation order.</p> <p>You could even imagine a case where a function takes a very large struct by reference, but three <code>i64</code> fields are very hot, so the caller can <em>preload</em> those fields, passing them both by register <em>and</em> via the pointer to the large struct. The callee does not see additional cost: it had to issue those loads anyway. However, the caller probably has those values in registers already, which avoids some memory traffic.</p> <p>Instrumentation profiles may even indicate that it makes sense to duplicate whole functions, which are identical except for their ABIs. Maybe they take different arguments by register to avoid costly spills.</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2> <p>This is a bit more advanced (and ranty) than my usual writing, but this is an aspect of Rust that I find really frustrating. We could be doing <em>so much better</em> than C++ ever can (because of their ABI constraints). None of this is new ideas; this is <em>literally</em> how Go does it!</p> <p>So why don’t we? Part of the reason is that ABI codegen is complex, and as I described above, LLVM gives us very few useful knobs. It’s not a friendly part of rustc, and doing things wrong can have nasty consequences for usability. The other part is a lack of expertise. As of writing, only a handful of people contributing to rustc have the necessary grasp of LLVM’s semantics (and mood swings) to emit the Right Code such that we get good codegen and don’t crash LLVM.</p> <p>Another reason is compilation time. The more complicated the function signatures, the more prologue/epilogue code we have to generate that LLVM has to chew on. But <code>-Zcallconv</code> is intended to only be used with optimizations turned on, so I don’t think this is a meaningful complaint. Nor do I think the project’s Goodhartization of compilation time as a metric is healthy… but I do not think this is ultimately a relevant drawback.</p> <p>I, unfortunately, do not have the spare time to dive into fixing rustc’s ABI code, but I do know LLVM really well, and I know that this is a place where Rust has a low bus factor. For that reason, I am happy to provide the Rust compiler team expert knowledge on getting LLVM to do the right thing in service of making optimized code faster.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>
