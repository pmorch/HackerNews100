Yes, I’m old. I’m a middle-aged programming nerd. My entire life and personal identity are wrapped up in this programming thing for better or worse. I thrive off the dopamine hits from shipping cool things.</span></p><p><span>I was an early adopter of AI coding and a fan until maybe two months ago, when I read the </span><a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">METR study</a><span> and suddenly got serious doubts. In that study, the authors discovered that developers were unreliable narrators of their own productivity. They thought AI was making them 20% faster, but it was actually making them 19% slower. This shocked me because I had just told someone the week before that I thought AI was only making me about 25% faster, and I was bummed it wasn’t a higher number. I was only off by 5% from the developer’s own incorrect estimates.</span></p><p>This was unsettling. It was impossible not to question if I too were an unreliable narrator of my own experience. Was I hoodwinked by the screens of code flying by and had no way of quantifying whether all that reading and reviewing of code actually took more time in the first place than just doing the thing myself?</p><p>So, I started testing my own productivity using a modified methodology from that study. I’d take a task and I’d estimate how long it would take to code if I were doing it by hand, and then I’d flip a coin, heads I’d use AI, and tails I’d just do it myself. Then I’d record when I started and when I ended. That would give me the delta, and I could use the delta to build AI vs no AI charts, and I’d see some trends. I ran that for six weeks, recording all that data, and do you know what I discovered?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png" width="600" height="371" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:371,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39808,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/i/172538377?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DPg1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53c83842-05e1-4ca1-9021-c292e8f3a502_600x371.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I discovered that the data isn’t statistically significant at any meaningful level. That I would need to record new datapoints for another four months just to prove if AI was speeding me up or slowing me down at all. It’s too neck-in-neck.</p><p>That lack of differentiation between the groups is really interesting though. Yes, it’s a limited sample and could be chance, but also so far AI appears to slow me down by a median of 21%, exactly in line with the METR study. I can say definitively that I’m not seeing any massive increase in speed (i.e., 2x) using AI coding tools. If I were, the results would be statistically significant and the study would be over.</p><p>That’s really disappointing.</p><p>I wish the AI coding dream were true. I wish I could make every dumb coding idea I ever had a reality. I wish I could make a fretboard learning app on Monday, a Korean trainer on Wednesday, and a video game on Saturday. I’d release them all. I’d drown the world in a flood of shovelware like the world had never seen. Well, I would — if it worked.</p><p><span>It turns out, though, and I’ve collected a lot of data on this, it doesn’t just not work for me, </span><strong>it doesn’t work for anyone</strong><span>, and I’m going to prove that.</span></p><p><span>But first, let’s examine how extreme and widespread these productivity claims are. Cursor’s tagline is “Built to make you extraordinarily productive.” Claude Code’s is “Build Better Software Faster.” GitHub Copilot’s is “Delegate like a boss.” Google says their LLMs make their developers 25% faster.

We should be in the middle of an indie software revolution. We should be seeing 10,000 Tetris clones on Steam.</span></p><div><p><strong>Consider this: </strong><span>with all you know about AI-assisted coding and its wide adoption, if I showed you charts and graphs of new software releases across the world, what shape of that graph would you expect?

Via </span><a href="https://www.gharchive.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GH Archive</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The most interesting thing about these charts is what they’re not showing. They’re not showing a sudden spike or hockey-stick line of growth. They’re flat at best. There’s no shovelware surge. There’s no sudden indie boom occurring post-2022/2023. You could not tell looking at these charts when AI-assisted coding became widely adopted. The core premise is flawed. Nobody is shipping more than before.</p><p><span>The impact on human lives is incredible. People are being fired because they’re not adopting these tools fast enough</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-172538377" href="https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding#footnote-6-172538377" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">6</a></span><span>. People are sitting in jobs they don’t like because they’re afraid if they go somewhere else it’ll be worse. People are spending all this time trying to get good at prompting and feeling bad because they’re failing.</span></p><p>This whole thing is bullshit.</p><p>So if you're a developer feeling pressured to adopt these tools — by your manager, your peers, or the general industry hysteria — trust your gut. If these tools feel clunky, if they're slowing you down, if you're confused how other people can be so productive, you're not broken. The data backs up what you're experiencing. You're not falling behind by sticking with what you know works. If you’re feeling brave, show your manager these charts and ask them what they think about it.</p><p>If you take away anything from this it should be that (A) developers aren't shipping anything more than they were before (that’s the only metric that matters), and (B) if someone — whether it's your CEO, your tech lead, or some Reddit dork — claims they're now a 10xer because of AI, that’s almost assuredly untrue, demand they show receipts or shut the fuck up.</p><p>Now, I know the internet. I know what many of you chumps are going to say before you even say it, so let’s just get into it:</p><ol><li><p><em>“Well, if you just learned how to prompt properly, then you would be a 10x engineer like me.”</em><br><span>Look at the data. There are no new 10xers. If there were — if the 14% of self-proclaimed AI 10xers were actually 10xers — that would more than double the worldwide output of new software. That didn’t happen. And as for you, personally, show me the 30 apps you created this year. I’m not entertaining this without receipts.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>“Well, it’s a new technology and so much is invested, and it takes time…”</span><br></em><span>Yes, billions of dollars have been invested in these tools. Billions of dollars will continue to be invested in these tools. The problem is that they’re being sold and decisions are being made about them — which affect real people’s lives — as if they work today. Don’t parrot that nonsense to me that it’s a work in progress. It’s September 2025, and we’ve had these tools for years now, and they still suck. Someday, maybe they won’t suck, but we'd better see objective proof of them having an impact on actually shipping things on the large.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>“Well, maybe it kind of sucks now, but if you don’t adopt it early, you’ll be left behind.”</span><br></em><span>There are no indicators that prompting is hard to learn. Github Copilot themselves say that </span><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">initially, users only accept 29% of prompted coding suggestions</a><span> (which itself is a wild claim to inefficiency, why would you publicize that?), but with six months of experience, users naturally get better at prompting and that grows to a whopping 34% acceptance rate. Apparently, 6 months of experience only makes you 5% better at prompting.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, maybe quality is going up and things aren’t necessarily shipping faster…”</em><br><span>That doesn’t make any sense. We all know that the industry has taken a step back in terms of code quality by at least a decade. Hardly anyone tests anymore. The last time I heard the phrase “continuous improvement” or “test-driven development” was before COVID. You know as well as I do that if there’s a tool that can make people 10x coders, we’d be drowning in shovelware.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, it’s all website-driven, and people don’t really care about domain names these days; it’s all subdomains on sites like Vercel.”</em><br><span>Shut up. People love their ego domains.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, .ai domain names are up 47% this year…”</em><br><span>Yeah, that’s cause all the startups pivoted to AI. It’s the only way to get money out of investor FOMO. Has the overall amount of domain names gone up at an unprecedented rate, though? No, it hasn’t. Look at the new domains chart.</span></p></li><li><p><em>“Well, if you were a real engineer, you’d know that most of software development is not writing code.”</em><br><span>That’s only true when you’re in a large corporation. When you’re by yourself, when you’re the stakeholder as well as the developer, you’re not in meetings. You're telling me that people aren’t shipping anything solo anymore? That people aren’t shipping new GitHub projects that scratch a personal itch? How does software creation not involve code?</span></p></li></ol></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>The worst possible antitrust outcome (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/#fucking-shit-goddammit-fuck">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Well, <em>fuck</em>.</p>
<p>Last year, Google lost an antitrust case to Biden's DoJ. The DoJ lawyers beat Google <em>like a drum</em>, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Google had deliberately sought to create and maintain a monopoly over search, and that they'd used that monopoly to make search materially worse, while locking competitors out of the market.</p>
<p>In other words, the company that controls 90% of search attained that control by illegal means, and, having thus illegitimately become the first port of call for the information-seeking world, had deliberately worsened its product to make more money:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan">https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan</a></p>
<p>That Google lost that case was a minor miracle. First, because for 40 years, the richest, most terrible people in the world have been running a literal <em>re-education camp for judges</em> where they get luxe rooms and fancy meals and lectures about how monopolies are good, actually:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down">https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down</a></p>
<p>But second, because Judge Amit Mehta decided that the Google case should be shrouded in mystery, suppressing the publication of key exhibits and banning phones, cameras and laptops from the courtroom, with the effect that virtually no one even <em>noticed</em> that the most important antitrust case in tech history, a genuine trial of the century, was underway:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/10/27/google-monopolizes-judicial-system-information-with-trial-secrecy/">https://www.promarket.org/2023/10/27/google-monopolizes-judicial-system-information-with-trial-secrecy/</a></p>
<p>This is really important. The government doesn't have to win an antitrust trial in order to create competition. As the saying goes, "the process is the punishment." Bill Gates was so personally humiliated by his catastrophic performance at his deposition for the Microsoft antitrust trial that he elected not to force-choke the nascent Google, lest he be put back in the deposition chair:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/12/whats-a-murder/#miros-tilde-1">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/12/whats-a-murder/#miros-tilde-1</a><br>
a<br>
But Judge Mehta turned his courtroom into a Star Chamber, a black hole whence no embarrassing information about Google's wicked deeds could emerge. That meant that the only punishment Google would have to bear from this trial would come after the government won its case, when the judge decided on a punishment (the term of art is "remedy") for Google.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he handed down that remedy and it is as bad as it could be. In fact, it is likely the <em>worst</em> possible remedy for this case:</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-browser-after-all-but-theres-a-catch-2000652304">https://gizmodo.com/google-wont-have-to-sell-chrome-browser-after-all-but-theres-a-catch-2000652304</a></p>
<p>Let's start with what's <em>not</em> in this remedy. Google will not be forced to sell off any of its divisions – not Chrome, not Android. Despite the fact that the judge found that Google's vertical integration with the world's dominant mobile operating system and browser were a key factor in its monopolization, Mehta decided to leave the Google octopus with all its limbs intact:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/19/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/#shiny-and-chrome">https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/19/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/#shiny-and-chrome</a></p>
<p>Google won't be forced to offer users a "choice screen" when they set up their Android accounts, to give browsers other than Chrome a fair shake:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/12/defaults-matter/#make-up-your-mind-already">https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/12/defaults-matter/#make-up-your-mind-already</a></p>
<p>Nor will Google be prevented from bribing competitors to stay out of the search market. One of the facts established in the verdict was that Google had been slipping Apple more than $20b/year in exchange for which, Apple forbore from making a competing search engine. This exposed every Safari and iOS user to Google surveillance, while insulating Google from the threat of an Apple competitor.</p>
<p>And then there's Google's <em>data</em>. Google is the world's most prolific surveiller, and the company boasts to investors about the advantage that its 24/7 spying confers on it in the search market, because Google knows so much about us and can therefore tailor our results. Even if this is true – a big if – it's nevertheless a fucking <em>nightmare</em>. Google has stolen every fact about our lives, in service to propping up a monopoly that lets it steal our <em>money</em>, too. Any remedy worth the name would have required Google to delete ("disgorge," in law-speak) all that data:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/07/revealed-preferences/#extinguish-v-improve">https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/07/revealed-preferences/#extinguish-v-improve</a></p>
<p>Some people in the antitrust world didn't see it that way. Out of a misguided kind of privacy nihilism, they called for Google to be forced to <em>share</em> the data it stole from us, so that potential competitors could tune their search tools on the monopolist's population-scale privacy violations.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is what the court has ordered.</p>
<p>As punishment for being convinced of obtaining and maintaining a monopoly, Google will be forced to share sensitive data with <em>lots</em> of other search engines. This will not secure competition for search, but it will certainly democratize human rights violations at scale.</p>
<p>Doubtless there will be loopholes in this data-sharing order. Google will have the right to hold back some of its data (that is, <em>our</em> data) if it is deemed "sensitive." This isn't so much a loop<em>hole</em> as is a loop<em>chasm</em>. I'll bet you a testicle⹋ that Google will slap a "sensitive" label on any data that might be the least bit useful to its competitors.</p>
<p>⹋not one of mine</p>
<p>This means that even if you like data-sharing <em>as</em> a remedy, you won't actually get the benefit you were hoping for. Instead, Google competitors will spend the next decade in court, fighting to get Google to comply with this order.</p>
<p>That's the main reason that we force monopolists to break up after they lose antitrust cases. We <em>could</em> put a bunch of conditions on how they operate, but figuring out whether they're adhering to those conditions and punishing them when they don't is expensive, labor-intensive and time consuming. This data-sharing wheeze is easy to do malicious compliance for, and hard to enforce. It is not an "administrable" policy:</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/">https://locusmag.com/2022/03/cory-doctorow-vertically-challenged/</a></p>
<p>This is <em>all</em> downside. If Google complies with the order, it will constitute a privacy breach on a scale never before seen. If they don't comply with the order, it will starve competitors of the one tiny drop of hope that Judge Mehta squeezed out of his pen. It's a catastrophe. An utter, total catastrophe. It has zero redeeming qualities. Hope you like enshittification, folks, because Judge Mehta just handed Google an eternal licence to enshittify the entire fucking internet.</p>
<p>It's impossible to overstate how fucking <em>terrible</em> Mehta's reasoning in this decision is. The Economic Liberties project calls it "judicial cowardice" and compared the ruling to "finding someone guilty for bank robbery and then sentencing him to write a thank you note":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/doj-states-must-appeal-judge-mehtas-act-of-judicial-cowardice-letting-google-keep-its-monopoly-power/">https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/doj-states-must-appeal-judge-mehtas-act-of-judicial-cowardice-letting-google-keep-its-monopoly-power/</a></p>
<p>Matt Stoller says it's typical of today's "lawlessness, incoherence and deference to big business":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/a-judge-lets-google-get-away-with">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/a-judge-lets-google-get-away-with</a></p>
<p>David Dayen's scorching analysis in <em>The American Prospect</em> calls it "embarassing":</p>
<p><a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2025-09-03-embarrassing-ruling-allows-google-search-monopoly/">https://prospect.org/justice/2025-09-03-embarrassing-ruling-allows-google-search-monopoly/</a></p>
<p>Dayen points out the many ways in which Mehta ignored his own findings, ignored the Supreme Court. Mehta wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This court, however, need not decide this issue, because there are independent reasons that remedies designed to eliminate the defendant’s monopoly—i.e., structural remedies—are inappropriate in this case.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, as Dayen points out is literally a federal judge deciding to ignore the law "because reasons."</p>
<p>Dayen says that he doesn't see why Google would even bother appealing this ruling: "since it won on almost every point." But the DoJ <em>could</em> appeal. If MAGA's promises about holding Big Tech to account mean anything at all, the DoJ would appeal.</p>
<p>I'll bet you a testicle⹋ that the DoJ will not appeal. After all, Trump's DoJ now has a cash register at the reception desk, and if you write a check for a million bucks to some random MAGA influencer, they can make all charges disappear:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/02/act-locally/#local-hero">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/02/act-locally/#local-hero</a></p>
<p>⹋again, not one of mine</p>
<p>And if you're waiting for Europe to jump in and act where America won't, don't hold your breath. EU Commission sources leaked to Reuters that the EU is going to drop its multi-billion euro fine against Google because they don't want to make Trump angry:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-adtech-fine-hold-eu-awaits-lower-us-car-duties-sources-say-2025-09-02/">https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-adtech-fine-hold-eu-awaits-lower-us-car-duties-sources-say-2025-09-02/</a></p>
<p>Sundar Pichai gave $1m to Donald Trump and got a seat on the dais at the inaguration. Trump just paid him back, 40,000 times over. Trump is a sadist, a facist, and a rapist – and he's also a remarkably cheap date.</p>

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-LaTeX</a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span>
        </p><p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>For optimal readibility of sidenotes, enclose the main text in the <code>section</code> tag.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
        <p>Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.</p>
        <p>Figures should try to use the <code>figure</code> element, which by default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:</p>
        <figure>
          <label for="mn-exports-imports">⊕</label><span>From Edward Tufte, <em>Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, page 92.</span>
          <img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/exports-imports.png" alt="Exports and Imports to and from Denmark &amp; Norway from 1700 to 1780">
        </figure>

        <p><label for="mn-figure-1">⊕</label><span><img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/rhino.png" alt="Image of a Rhinoceros">F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,” <em>Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice</em> (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s <em>Visual Explanations</em>.</span> But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.</p>
        <p>If you need a full-width figure, give it the <code>fullwidth</code> class. Make sure that’s inside an <code>article</code>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>, page 122-124.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/napoleons-march.png" alt="Figurative map of the successive losses of the French Army in the Russian campaign, 1812-1813">
        </figure>
        <p>One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the fly. Embedded <code>iframe</code> elements are particularly troublesome. For these instances we provide a helper class, <code>iframe-wrapper</code>, the most common use for which is probably YouTube videos, e.g.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;figure class="iframe-wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>
        <figure>
          <iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </figure>
        <p>You can use this class on a <code>div</code> instead of a <code>figure</code>, with slightly different results but the same general effect. Experiment and choose depending on your application.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="code">Code</h2>
        <p>Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples are denoted with the <code>code</code> class, as I’ve been using in this document to denote HTML. Code needs to be monospace for formatting purposes and to aid in code analysis, but it must maintain its readability. To those ends, Tufte CSS follows GitHub’s font selection, which shifts gracefully along the monospace spectrum from the elegant but rare Consolas all the way to good old reliable Courier.</p>
        <p>Extended code examples should live in a <code>code</code> element within a <code>pre</code> element. This adds control over indentation and overflow as well:</p>
        <pre><code>;; Some code examples in Clojure. This is a comment.

;; applying a function to every item in the collection
(map tufte-css blog-posts)
;;;; if unfamiliar, see http://www.lispcast.com/annotated-map

;; side-effecty loop (unformatted, causing text overflow) - from https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doseq
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2) (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))] (prn (* b d)))

;; that same side-effecty loop, formatted
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list
                           (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2)
                           (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))]
  (prn (* b d)))

        <h2 id="imagequilts">ImageQuilts</h2>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartz’s <a href="http://imagequilts.com/">ImageQuilts</a>. See the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003wk">ET forum announcement thread</a> for more on quilts. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as you would any other <code>figure</code>.</p>
        <p>This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width figure to accomodate its girth:</p>
        <figure><img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/imagequilt-chinese-calligraphy.png" alt="Image of Chinese Calligraphy"></figure>
        <p>Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of course still rectangular.</p>

        <p>Many thanks go to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work. It is only through his kind and careful editing that this project accomplishes what it does. All errors of implementation are of course mine.</p>

<p>I'm excited to announce that we're joining OpenAI’s Codex team!</p>
<p>When we started out, Xcode had no AI. Building a "Cursor for Xcode" sounded crazy, but we managed to do it anyway. And, over time, we built the best coding agent for iOS &amp; MacOS apps.</p>
<p>I'm extremely proud of what we accomplished with Alex. Seeing people build software with our work was surreal. It is an honor to continue that work at a much bigger scale at OpenAI, along with the incredibly talented Codex team. Our mission is to help people create, and today that is more possible than ever.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to Alex:</strong></p>
<p>We plan to continue service for existing users, but will stop new downloads of the app on October 1st. As long as you have the app installed, our plan is to continue serving you. But there won’t be any new features released.</p>
<p>Thank you all -- our day 1 beta users, our customers, our amazing investors, and the entire Apple Dev community for helping us Make Something Wonderful ❤️</p>
<p>(P.S. Check out <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a>!)</p>

<p>Nagel challenges the possibility of explaining "the most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomena" title="Phenomena">phenomena</a>" by reductive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism" title="Materialism">materialism</a> (the philosophical position that all statements about the mind and mental states can be translated, without any loss or change in meaning, into statements about the physical). For example, a reductive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalist" title="Physicalist">physicalist</a>'s solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem" title="Mind–body problem">mind–body problem</a> holds that whatever "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a>" is, it can be fully described via physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process" title="Process">processes</a> in the brain and body.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Nagel begins by assuming that "conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon" present in many animals (particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammals" title="Mammals">mammals</a>), even though it is "difficult to say [...] what provides evidence of it". Thus, Nagel sees consciousness not as something exclusively human, but as something shared by many, if not all, organisms. Nagel must be speaking of something other than sensory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception" title="Perception">perception</a>, since objective facts and widespread evidence show that organisms with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_organs" title="Sensory organs">sensory organs</a> have biological processes of sensory perception. In fact, what all organisms share, according to Nagel, is what he calls the "subjective character of experience" defined as follows: "An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to <em>be</em> that organism – something that it is like <em>for</em> the organism."<sup id="cite_ref-Thomas_Nagel_2010,_p._637_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Thomas_Nagel_2010,_p._637-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. The subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be fully explained if the subjective character of experience is ignored, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism" title="Materialism">materialism</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus, for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum" title="Reductio ad absurdum">absurd</a>. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world, each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a "single point of view", making it infeasible to consider any conscious experience as "objective".
</p><p>Nagel uses the example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat" title="Bat">bats</a> to clarify the distinction between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity" title="Subjectivity">subjective</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">objective</a> concepts. Because bats are mammals, they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel was inspired to use a bat for his argument after living in a home where the animals were frequent visitors. Nagel ultimately used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echolocation_(animal)" title="Echolocation (animal)">echolocation</a> to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar" title="Sonar">sonar</a> and vision are regarded as perceptual experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophagy" title="Entomophagy">eat insects</a> like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, "our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience", meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivism" title="Subjectivism">subjectivism</a>). Objectivity requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.
</p><p>Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem" title="Mind–body problem">mind–body problem</a>.

      <p>
        On trying to mash up SQLite with ideas stolen from Accountants, Clojure, Datomic, XTDB, Rama, and Local-first-ers, to satisfy Henderson's Tenth Law. Viz., to make a sufficiently complicated data system containing an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a bitemporal database. Because? Because laying about on a hammock, contemplating hopelessly complected objects like Current Databases isn't just for the Rich man.

<p>Especially fellow Clojurians trying to realise their Indie B2B SaaS dreams (translation: income <em>and</em> time-poor). Please use a proper professional time-oriented data system.

<p><em><strong>Solitary over-caffeinated temporal database rumination</strong></em> went out of hand. Even <em>The Voices</em> are fed up and want someone to stop us. Furthermore;</p>
<ol>
<li>Sage friends already gently shook their heads after hearing <em>The Voices</em>.</li>
<li>Their hard-won advice—<em>"Just Use Postgres."</em>, and <em>"Please, for everyone's sake, stick with the relational models."</em>—fell on deaf ears. <a href="#fn1" target="_self" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

<p>Hence this post.</p>
<p><em><strong>Take what is useful, discard the rest…</strong></em></p>

<h2 id="accountants-are-our-exemplary-archetype">Accountants are our exemplary archetype</h2>
<p>The cashier at Temporal Convenience Store K9, just handed us our bill. Oi; where is that 10% discount applicable to our bulk purchase of provisions as loyal customers (it's going to be a <em>long</em> trip)?!</p>
<p>Now we <em>think</em> that, but we <em>ask</em> politely, because we know there are many civil ways to sort this snafu without shoplifting or violence. Two universally accepted <a href="#fn3" target="_self" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> remedies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cashier has direct authority to fix it, and they may gladly oblige.</li>
<li>The cashier's hands are sadly tied. For ERP reasons, accounts alone has authority to issue refunds for bills over a certain value. But we asked nicely so the cashier kindly nods us to accounts, in the backroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Odds are that the store people <a href="#fn4" target="_self" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> will fix it by issuing <em>two <strong>new</strong> transactions</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>One transaction to cancel the last bill and reverse the related charge to our spacecard.</li>
<li>Another transaction issuing the corrected bill, including the discounted amount, with a fresh charge made to our spacecard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, Temporal Convenience Store K9's various ledgers have received corresponding debits and credits too, of course. But enough. A programmer, though Poor, is no Fool. One does not simply trespass The Field of Accountants. There be dragons.</p>
<p>So… Back to the DB.</p>
<p>One way or another, the store's accounting database must tell these facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>At TxTime-7543, Cashier-Adric at Store-K9 ISSUED bill ID-13579 having value 100 spacecoin, and charged it to SpaceCard-1337.</li>
<li>At TxTime-7587, Cashier-Adric at Store-K9 REVERSED bill ID-13579 having value 100 spacecoin, and refunded it to SpaceCard-1337.
<ul>
<li>Maaaybe a note about why it was reversed. <a href="#fn5" target="_self" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>At TxTime-7715, Accounts-Nyssa at Store-K9 ISSUED bill ID-13579-v2 for 90 spacecoin, with a total value of 100 spacecoin minus 10 spacecoin going to discount, and charged 90 spacecoin to SpaceCard-1337.</li>
</ul>
<p>We call this a <em>temporal data system</em> because it incorporates the passage of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>No information is ever modified in-place or deleted.</li>
<li>New information is always appended.</li>
<li>To grok the latest state of the accounts, one must read the sequence of all facts recorded in the database.</li>
<li>Reading a fact updates a separate, current view of the accounts… our "as of now" understanding of the world.</li>
<li>The "current view" can be rebuilt from scratch, up to any point in time, whether it is "as of now", or "as of last week", or "as of next quarter" (which will be useful only if we add synthetic projected-future events into the database).</li>
</ul>
<p>So… What to think about in order to design a general-purpose temporal data system that does this for us?</p>
<h2 id="all-databases-record-state-of-entities">All databases record <strong>state</strong> of <strong>entities</strong></h2>
<p>People, things, processes etc. State is the discrete <strong>value</strong> of some <strong>attribute</strong> of an <strong>entity</strong> <em>at a specific point in time</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Values</strong> are timeless and context free <code>(17)</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong> provide context <code>('age')</code>, which we use to suggest and interpret the meaning of a value <code>(= age 17)</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Entities</strong> are real or imaginary objects ( <code>Adric</code>) having attributes (<code>age</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the <em>State</em> of <em>Adric</em> can be stated as: <em><strong>Adric's age is 17 as of now</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In a current database—which is just a fancy way of saying <em>database</em>—the <em>as of now</em> is implicit. So is the concept of <em>"<code>age</code> is an attribute of the entity <code>Adric</code>"</em>. We just call it <em>Schema</em>, in the abstract.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>Let's re-state our traditional table as <strong><em>Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)</em></strong> triplets. Let's also add a column for time (as we often do) to answer questions like "when was Adric's age last updated in our database?".</p>

<p>From this kernel shall spring forth our world, wrought of facts and time itself. But first, one must acknowledge that…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the world’s a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players;<br>
They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages.</p>
<p>— William Shakespeare, As You Like It, Act-II, Scene-VII, Lines 139-143</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As my theater gentlefriends like to say…</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-process">Everything is Process</h2>
<p>We understand the world in terms of processes. All of Reality is a live process which we want to participate in—control, influence, react, adapt. Ergo, all information is part of some process. Yes, even universal constants like <code>c</code> and <code>π</code>, which we can confidently assume to be constant only in our observable universe. Because even these came to be <em>after</em> the moment of the big bang, and will remain only until the eventual heat death of the universe (assuming our universe is ever-expanding, and not a bouncing singularity).</p>
<p>It follows that, to understand the world, we must observe and respond to data; information about various attributes of various meaningful aspects of reality, as we perceive it. Said another way, we understand the world by observing and modifying the state of entities over time—the past, the now, and the later. A person's address, a valve's current position, the remaining free volume of a container, the trajectory of a comet, one's fast-emptying savings account.</p>

<p>The more sophisticated a being is, the more context about entities and entity-relationships it is able to keep alive and/or use simultaneously <a href="#fn6" target="_self" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-identity-of-an-entity-is-the-complete-life-it-lives">The <strong>identity</strong> of an entity is the complete life it lives</h2>
<p>Never-ending <em>process</em> is the beating heart, the whistling wind, the pulsing quasar, the furious procreation, the tectonic Subduction, the whispered good-bye, the thermodynamic survival instinct of all things. Process is the <em>why</em> of <em>being</em>. One could even say that an entity without <em>id</em> can have no identity.</p>
<p>This is why, to properly identify an entity, we must egolessly maintain an up-to-date mental-model about it. For that, we must continually observe, record, and aggregate a succession of states of the entity in question.</p>
<p>Consequently, knowledge of entity-attributes alone is not sufficient (Adric has age, address, belief). Knowledge of attribute-values is required too (age is x, address is y, belief is z). And without a sense of time, we simply cannot complete the picture.</p>
<p>To make it concrete:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every person's life revolves around their address and we can guess different things about them based on how their address changes.</li>
<li>You know which Adric is being spoken about because you know
<ul>
<li>Adric's age was 17 last year. Adric's age is 18 as of now. Adric's age will be 319 on &lt;specific date&gt;.</li>
<li>Adric's address was Foo last year. Adric's address is Baz as of now. Adric's address will be Bar after December 2025.</li>
<li>Adric's belief in bitemporality was 1% last year. Adric's belief in bitemporality is 99% as of now.</li>
<li>Adric's temporal innocence level was 99% last year. Adric's temporal innocence level is 1% as of now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A reader of this set of facts can confidently determine: <em><strong>As-of-now, Adric is an eighteen year old entity that lives at</strong></em> <em><strong>'Baz', believes strongly in bitemporality, and has nearly no temporal innocence.</strong></em></li>

<p>Having gained this factual understanding, a dear reader may be tempted to further theorise; <em>Adric lost his temporal innocence and eventually</em> <em>ended up living at 'Bar', where he always is these days.</em> Of course, to <em>prove</em> such an allegation, the dear reader would have to piece together many more facts about Adric, <em>and show causation</em>, not mere correlation.</p>
<p>The dear reader may happily play temporal sleuth. However, the temporal database and temporal data engineer are not here to judge. Our role is simply to record the facts as presented, without ego, without prejudice, with integrity, so that the temporal data sleuth may use it productively to figure out <em><strong>what happened, when, and why</strong></em>.</p>
<p>For there is more to facts than meets the eye.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm not in the judgment business, Mr. Orr. I'm after facts. And the events of the mind, believe me, to me are facts. When you <em><strong>see</strong></em> another man's dream as he dreams it recorded in black and white on the electroencephalograph, as I've done ten thousand times, you don't speak of dreams as 'unreal.' They exist; they are events; they leave a mark behind them."</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-fact-can-be-true-or-false">A <strong>fact</strong> can be true or false</h2>
<p>The temporal sleuth knows that one must resolve the reality of a fact by asserting whether it is true or false.</p>
<p>Our facts table can be expressed as something like the table below. Aspiring temporal data engineers will do well to avoid speculating <em>why</em> a fact might have been asserted true or false. Our ilk must simply realise that we can <em>assert</em> facts this way; <code>&lt;statement of fact&gt; is &lt;true/false?&gt; as of &lt;time&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Each state of the Adric entity can thus be re-written as an <em><strong>assertion</strong></em> of a fact.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Adric's age is 17"</em> is a <em>true</em> fact <em>as of</em> date-last-year.</li>
<li><em>"Adric's age is 17"</em> is a <em>false</em> fact <em>as of</em> date-now.</li>

<p>With just this information, the temporal sleuth can infer that Adric's age <em>definitely changed at least once</em> sometime between date-last-year and date-now. But how many times, and to what value, is anybody's guess. For that, we need more temporal observations. Which thickens the plot. For now, we might receive conflicting observations.</p>

<p>Earlier, we were told to record that the Adric entity's age is 17 as of date-last-year. Presently, we are told to make a note that Adric is NOT 17 any more. We have no idea about Adric's <del>birth date</del> creation date, by the way. We just make a note of assertions of facts about Adric's age, as we are told.</p>

<p>Sixty seconds later, we are interrupted and told that Adric is in fact 18, and oh by the way, he was already 18 as of date-now. And does it bother us that <em>we wrote the earlier thing down already</em>? No it doesn't. We just assert the new fact.</p>
<p>And just like that…</p>
<p><em>Now</em> if anyone asks for Adric's age "as of now", we can truthfully answer <code>18</code>. Because now our table looks like…</p>

<p>Similarly, we make note of other facts about Adric as of various dates on the timeline. But let's add one more key detail… the time at which we made note of the information.</p>
<h2 id="finally-the-two-questions-that-put-the-bi-in-the-bitemporal">Finally, the Two Questions that put the 'bi' in the 'bitemporal'</h2>
<p>Events always occur <em>before they can be recorded</em>. It's just how nature works. Therefore, we can only ever make a note of a fact, after the fact. And so it comes to pass, that any self-respecting temporal sleuth naturally begins their temporal interrogation with two questions:</p>
<h3 id="when-did-it-actually-happen">When did it actually happen?</h3>
<p>Only a fact-sender may lay claim to the time an event occurred. <em>And</em> this timestamp must <em>always</em> travel with the fact. Whether the claimed timestamp is acceptable or not is between the fact-sender and the temporal sleuth. The temporal data store and engineer just make sure it is written down exactly as given.</p>
<h3 id="when-did-we-officially-record-it">When did we officially record it?</h3>
<p>Only the temporal data <em>store</em>—not even the temporal data engineer—may lay claim to when this happened. For the temporal data engineer is just a fallible puny human who can screw up in so many ways. Making typos. Misreading the clock. Lazily avoiding recording facts until the auditor comes a-calling. Or even forgetting the fact entirely, upon discovery of which fact, the temporal sleuth gets called in to piece together what might have happened.</p>
<p>So, let's update our temporal data table with the "transaction" time, at which the data store guarantees that it has immutably inscribed a fact.</p>
<p>To ease table-reading life of our fellow our puny humans, we also rearrange the time columns a bit. Now, we can manually read records as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>At Transaction Time <code>t02</code>, the table recorded the following fact:
<ul>
<li><em>As of <code>dt-now</code>, <code>Adric</code>'s <code>:age</code> being <code>17</code> stands REDACTED.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>At Transaction Time <code>t03</code>, the table recorded the following fact:
<ul>
<li><em>As of <code>dt-now</code>, <code>Adric</code>'s <code>:age</code> being <code>18</code> stands ASSERTED.</em></li>

<p><em>Actual</em> Time Travel is different each time, because the very act of it interacts with and perturbs Reality. Not being higher dimensional beings, we have evolved to get by, by perceiving very little of very little. To us, convenient fictions are good enough Reality.</p>
<h2 id="no-temporal-database-can-contain-reality-itself">No temporal database can contain Reality itself</h2>
<p><em>"The Song"</em> is a convenient fiction.</p>
<p>We love to loop a favourite hit single. Yet…</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>A record is not "The Song".</strong></em> All recordings are lossy <a href="#fn7" target="_self" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> because all acts of measurement are lossy. That's just physics.</li>
<li><em><strong>A replay is not "The Song".</strong></em> Every replay is the same information yet it is <em>new</em>, because Reality is ever-moving, ever-changing. (Ignoring for a moment the fact that every replay degrades the storage medium—vinyl, compact disk, copper plate, SSD—causing further information loss.)</li>
<li><em><strong>Nor are live performances "The Song".</strong></em> Each rendition is different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, temporal databases can only mimic Time Travel.</p>
<ul>
<li>The experience of Reality can only ever be captured as finite, discrete observations (samples and measurements).</li>
<li>Therefore, a temporal recording or database can only ever contain approximate observations of Reality.</li>
<li>Each time we retrieve the observations, we cannot help but <em>reinterpret</em> them because we ourselves have changed in the interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can only ever sing songs about what we believed happened.</p>
<h2 id="reality-transpires-in-dedekind-cuts">Reality transpires in Dedekind cuts</h2>
<p><em>"This Instant"</em> is a convenient fiction.</p>
<p>Every observation of reality exists <em>somewhere inside of an interval</em>, because our means of measurement can only ever <em>approximate</em> the moment of occurrence of an event. The idea of the <em>Dedekind Cut</em> frames this neatly.</p>
<article>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut">Dedekind cut</a> is a partition of the rationals <code>Q</code> into two subsets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> such that</p>
<ol>
<li><code>A</code> is nonempty.</li>
<li><code>A ≠ Q</code> (equivalently, <code>B</code> is nonempty).</li>
<li>If <code>x,y ∈ Q</code>, <code>x &lt; y</code>, and <code>y ∈ A</code>, then <code>x ∈ A</code>. (<code>A</code> is "closed downwards".)</li>
<li>If <code>x ∈ A</code>, then there exists a <code>y ∈ A</code> such that <code>y &gt; x</code>. (<code>A</code> does not contain a greatest element.)</li>
</ol>
<p>By omitting the first two requirements, we formally obtain the extended real number line.</p>

<p>Why split such philosophical hairs? Why?</p>
<p>Because, we must record temporal facts with proper temporal resolution. For example, an infinitesimal such as a Femtosecond (10<sup>-15s</sup>) can be…</p>
<ul>
<li>Just Right… for that "Femto Laser" Cataract removal or LASIK surgery.</li>
<li><em>Waaay</em> over the top… for orchestral arrangements where sub-millisecond (&lt; 10<sup>-3s</sup>) coordination is more than enough.</li>
<li>Or <em>too coarse(!)</em>… for Quantum dynamics studies, where incredible things happen in attoseconds (10<sup>-18s</sup>). <a href="#fn8" target="_self" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>More subtly, because all Temporal Data Processing queries are <em>Interval</em> queries, served by collating facts that happened starting Time X to Time Y.</p>
<p>For example, <em>"Calculate the state of the world <code>as-of</code> some <code>Instant</code>."</em></p>
<p>To serve this query, we must collate all facts starting from the earliest available ones, right up to whatever <code>as-of</code> time Instant. It could be <code>as-of</code> &lt;some past moment&gt;, or <code>as-of</code> some projected future, or…. <code>as-of</code> <em>this very instant</em>, a.k.a. a <code>now</code> query.</p>
<p>The <code>now</code> query is a special-case <code>as-of</code> query, because <code>now</code> is an <em>expanding</em> query window… ever-increasing "wall-clock time". It means <em>our computer's temporal resolution</em>, which the temporal database relies on, must suit that of incoming facts. My cheap wristwatch will botch your Formula One lap times.</p>
<p>Fun fact: The <code>now</code> query returns <em>a</em> Current Database.</p>
<h2 id="facts-contain-observations.-observations-are-not-reality.">Facts contain observations. Observations are not Reality.</h2>
<p><em>"Facts"</em> are a convenient fiction.</p>
<p>To fact-find, we must observe. Observation requires measurement. Measurements are inherently lossy. Consequently, no collection of facts, no matter how fine-grained can ever capture Reality as it <em>actually</em> happened.</p>
<p>Besides, facts depend on who's observing. Having experienced the world a bit, we have doubtless realised that, <em>routinely</em>…</p>
<ul>
<li>The same party told us "use this fact", at different times, with no regard to whatever happened in-between.</li>
<li>OR, it's possible that the same party sent us two different facts at the same time, but they were recorded in the table at different times. Maybe the temporal database recorded one fact, but before it could record the other fact, it got waylaid by a VACUUM emergency. It happens.</li>
<li>OOOORRRR, it is possible that <em>two different parties</em> with <em>different</em> vantage points of a shared reality sent their observations independently, without being aware that other party even exists. Our temporal database just says "okay then", and records <em>both</em> claims of facts about observed reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we established in the <code>Adric</code> scenario, multiple facts <em>for the same <code>E-A-V</code> triple</em>, can <em>claim</em> to have occurred at the same time (<code>Adric is NOT 17 as-of-now</code>, and <code>Adric IS 18 as-of-now</code>).</p>
<p>Consequently, though our bitemporal database notes down distinct facts at different times, we <em>cannot presume</em> that the sequence of recording follows Reality.</p>
<p>In other words…</p>
<p><em>Facts are <strong>mutually independent parallel <em>claims</em></strong> that assert or redact some aspect of <strong>concurrent real-world events</strong>.</em></p>
<p>In fact, facts are <em>always</em> so. <em>Variables</em> are mutually dependent or independent; correlated or uncorrelated, because variables subsume Real identities, all of which live in the contiguous fabric of the same shared Universe.</p>
<p>What the Fact?!</p>
<h2 id="materialised-reality-depends-on-whos-asking.">Materialised "Reality" depends on who's asking.</h2>
<p><em>"Reality"</em> is a convenient fiction.</p>
<p>We simulate alternate reality all the time. Worrying about the future. Worrying about what someone must be thinking about us just now. Questioning past life choices and wondering "what if". Much like financial analysts, weather modelers, chess pros, special ops teams running scenarios and doing retrospectives. Except those other people get paid to imagine worst case scenarios.</p>
<ol>
<li>If each fact lives <em>on its own conceptual timeline</em>, then we must necessarily <em>reconstruct reality</em> by threading a point of view through a sequence of recorded facts.</li>
<li>Only the temporal sleuth—not the temporal database, nor engineer—get to choose which timeline or timelines (sequence(s) of facts) ought to construct a prospective Reality.</li>
<li>Only the temporal sleuth gets to choose the <code>as-of</code> point in time wherefrom to do so—now, past, future; separately or simultaneously. And gets paid to imagine alternate realities.</li>

<h2 id="the-bet">The Bet</h2>
<p><em>All</em> data systems are, in reality, temporal data systems. Most just don't know it until it's too late. <em>Things</em>—as life teaches inevitably—have a habit of getting real, real fast. Suddenly, one fine day, life <em>will</em> deliver us a forehead-slapping moment because even that tiny-SaaS indie B2B app has manifested <em>"a sufficiently complicated data system"</em>. Because <a href="https://www.evalapply.org/posts/software-debt/index.html#main">complexity is inevitable</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture-a-vertically-integrated-saas-machine">The Architecture: A Vertically Integrated SaaS Machine</h2>
<p>Runaway incidental complexity <em>of software</em> is why computers got slower while hardware and networks got faster. This bothers me no end. I want to profit from the glut of compute <em>without</em> taking on systemic complexity. <a href="#fn9" target="_self" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>One way is to build software applications as unified vertically integrated computer systems, as a fruit-named company famously does. And, as is true for contemplating complected objects on hammocks, profiting from full-systems vertical integration isn't just for the absurdly rich global conglomerate.</p>
<p><code>nb.</code> <em><strong>"Vertical Integration" does NOT mean "Being Rigid".</strong></em> Quite the opposite; it means cultivate total adaptability, situational awareness, and mastery over self and environment. <a href="#fn10" target="_self" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-trade-off-hard-to-design-easy-to-build-own-operate-teach">The Trade-Off: Hard to design, Easy to Build-Own-Operate-Teach</h3>
<p>The main thing to understand is that changing any single detail of a vertically-integrated system could mandate ripple-effect changes through the whole system… and <em>that is okay</em>.</p>
<p>The indie vertically-integrating systems builder should choose an extreme position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either <em>go all-in</em> on a <em>single</em> all-encompassing web SaaS stack (application framework, server runtime, tool chain).</li>
<li>Or make a <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/clojure-multiproject-example">custom system of composable parts</a>. Entirely avoid building on top of pre-designed monolithic frameworks (most Clojure pros).</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way is fine. <a href="https://www.evalapply.org/posts/clojure-web-app-from-scratch/index.html">Either way demands significant investment</a> from the committed indie SaaS builder. The only real choice one has, is <em>to own it</em>—learn to fit self to it, or make it fit to self. <a href="#fn11" target="_self" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="above-all-aggressively-minimise-system-wide-complexity">Above All: <strong>Aggressively</strong> Minimise System-Wide Complexity</h3>
<p>The absurdly not-rich local indie SaaS maker must accept the complexity-management limits of their own smol brain. And that is okay. One poor brain can do a <em>lot</em>, if it asks <em>"So, like, how do I build a unified, coherent system specialised to me—my goals, needs, and indeed, to my way of thinking?"</em>, which is…</p>
<ul>
<li>no cloud services lock-in (no VC funding. no funding at all, actually.)</li>
<li>no framework lock-in (a-la-carte pieces)</li>
<li>no tool-bench / process lock-in (design own tools shaped for own brain)</li>
<li>no devops clones (dead-simple deployments, observability, failover etc.)</li>
<li>no (future) customer data lock-in (must be local-first compatible)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I am a <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/">grug-brained developer</a> <a href="#fn12" target="_self" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> therefore "the system" <em>must</em> be small conceptually, and literally. It is mission-critical to build the system piecemeal, where we intimately know the parts and can fully control interfaces between parts and abstraction boundaries.</p>
<p>In the context of a SaaS web application it means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-server installation
<ul>
<li>App, db, cache, queue, document store, server, proxy; everything on one box</li>
<li>To scale, beef up server</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unified Application + Database architecture
<ul>
<li>In-process databases only</li>
<li>Universal, static, zero-migration storage schema</li>
<li>All application-specific materialised views as application code i.e. the application is <em>not</em> "just a DB wrapper".</li>
<li>Optionally, single tenancy. One DB per tenant, for regional compliance, and horizontal scaling as a nice side-benefit.</li>
<li>No write concurrency. All database operations are one-way loops.</li>
<li>No "Distributed Local-first". Local-first mode is unauthenticated single-user. Server-mode is bog standard synchronous SaaS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Immutability by default
<ul>
<li>idempotence where immutability gets too involved to implement correctly
<ul>
<li>in-place mutation only as a rare, purposeful, escape hatch when both immutability and idempotence get too complex or too resource-hungry</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>One DB Engine to rule them all
<ul>
<li>Primary store</li>
<li>K/V store</li>
<li>Sessions store</li>
<li>Cache</li>
<li>Document store</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-wee-vms-please.-one-to-serve-one-for-failover.">Two Wee VMs, please. One to serve, one for failover.</h3>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Computers today—even the cheap shared VMs—are stupid-fast. A properly built web app can use the <em>smallest</em> VM below, to support a healthy SaaS business, <em>with room to grow</em>. Add one more box on hot standby for failover.</p>

<h3 id="feed-cheap-disks-to-storage-hungry-temporal-databases">Feed cheap disks to storage-hungry Temporal Databases</h3>
<p>Current Databases terrify the temporal database engineer. A current database is a giant mass of global mutable state. It has no innate sense of time. And current database engineers inevitably have to manage concurrency. Some even have to delve into the dark arts of Multi Version Concurrency Control. <a href="#fn14" target="_self" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>This mortal fear causes temporal database designers to copy accountants, who have been doing temporal data engineering for centuries. Why not tackle the far simpler problem of making everything append-only? Make a DB engine which will guarantee that <em>at such-and-such time</em> <em>it faithfully recorded &lt;this set of claimed facts&gt;, as-given, nondestructively</em>.</p>
<p>However, copying accountants isn't free.</p>
<ul>
<li>For one, temporal databases hoard data; chomping Terabytes for breakfast. The stuff of DB-tuning nightmares of current data engineers.</li>
<li>For another, without the right tools, we risk being Disk-wise but Query-foolish. We mitigate this by copying architects (of software).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some worth copying.</p>
<h2 id="clojure-namespaces-and-immutability-are-honking-great-ideas">Clojure: Namespaces and Immutability are honking great ideas</h2>
<p>We want to constrain all entities to well-known, guaranteed globally-qualified namespaces. So…</p>
<ul>
<li><code>world</code> is the only global namespace we permit, and is also the only single-segmented namespace</li>
<li>all other namespaces <strong>must</strong> be <strong>minimum</strong> two-segmented, such as <code>com.acmecorp</code> or <code>com.acmecorp.foo-client</code>.</li>
<li><code>ns_name</code> must only ever be the namespace part (such as <code>com.acmecorp</code> or <code>world</code>) of a fully qualified entity name (of <code>com.acmecorp/user</code> or <code>world/administrator</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>SQLite in WAL mode is the poor man's single-computer Datomic—one sequential writer, many concurrent readers, mutually non-blocking, with globally atomic transactions. To be clear, Datomic itself can be the poor man's single-computer Datomic. Ditto for XTDB and Rama. Clojure programmers will do well to study the Clojure <code>agent</code> primitive, to build a good mental model about SQLite in WAL mode.</p>

<h2 id="realities-are-arrows.-time-marks-flight.-uuidv7-is-time.">Realities are arrows. Time marks flight. UUIDv7 is Time.</h2>
<p>Processes are happening. Facts are being recorded. Events occur along a <em>virtual timeline</em>, not a physical one.</p>
<p>Instead of compositing a physical time and a virtual ID into one identifier, why not use a virtual time-is-a-vector style identifier and derive physical time from it for use in our normal day to day SQL queries, <em>in addition to</em> also having an identifier that is a standard requiring no coordination to create, is globally conflict-free, <em>and</em> is SQL DB indexing-friendly as well as query-friendly? In a world where disks are cheap, and data generation is unlimited, we can afford to waste computer resources on giant IDs instead of compact little Integers that overflow.</p>
<p>UUIDv7 helps us express this concept. This is <em>crucial</em> for conflict management.</p>
<p>Our system relies on the <em>guarantee</em> that <code>valid_id</code> is <em>globally unique</em>, even when the UNIX time component of <code>valid-id</code> for multiple colliding facts is the same.</p>
<p>The default decision heuristic is "latest asserted fact wins". The "last write wins" principle is popularly used by the local-first community too (e.g. in CRDTs).</p>
<p>Of course, this thumb rule is not always acceptable. Humans will disagree about the facts for un-computable reasons.</p>
<p>For example, different editors at the publisher <em>Target</em> may lay different claims to the same titular character name: claim conflicting values, and/or different asserted states. Now they have to duke it out and decide which assertion or redaction should apply for that EA pair at a given physical time.</p>

<p>The DDLs are elided because they are boring.</p>
<p><strong>Indices:</strong> Basically, we may create reverse indices of Facts, to support query patterns, as needed. Some possible indices for day-to-day "online" use, to be created on the "current world facts" view.</p>
<ul>
<li>EAV: Entity, Attribute, Value</li>
<li>EAVTx: EAV, TransactionTime</li>
<li>AEVTx</li>
<li>AVETx</li>
<li>VxAETx: ValidTime, AETx</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, we wouldn't want to touch our lynchpin "World Facts" table. Indices consume disk space and that table will grow fast. The same indices might be required for retroactive "audit" use cases. Ideally I would do this sort of querying "offline", against a snapshot of the primary DB.</p>
<p><strong>For Full Text Search</strong>, I intend to use SQLite's built-in 'FTS5' extension. It requires a bit of SQL writin'—make a Virtual Table, and then write a bunch of Triggers to keep it up-to date. Again, very boring SQL, well documented at the <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html">extension's page</a>. It just needs writing, is all.</p>

<h2 id="rama-views-are-just-data.-materialize-in-clojure.-not-in-sql.">Rama: Views are just data. Materialize in Clojure. Not in SQL.</h2>
<p>The temporal database does not discriminate when storing facts. Consequently, any given temporal database could contain any of…</p>
<ul>
<li>At least a partial snapshot of at least one Reality,</li>
<li>OR several partial snapshots of one Reality,</li>
<li>OR several partial snapshots of several, possibly alternate and parallel, Realities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great power (and great responsibility) to decide the <em>concretely materialised reality of the world</em> resides solely in the hands of the party interrogating the temporal database.</p>
<p>Therefore, the temporal database designer must create interrogation tools (query languages, data storage and access formats etc.) so the temporal data engineer can sift through a veritable multiverse, to figure out what "the world" looked like <em>as of <strong>whatever</strong> time</em> interests them.</p>
<p>I have been warned that attempting temporal queries with SQL will cause obnoxious joins, strange indexing schemes, finicky triggers, stored procedures from hell, and non-standard shenanigans specific to the database engine in question. <a href="#fn15" target="_self" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p>See James Henderson's <em>"Building a Bitemporal Index"</em> series—parts <a href="https://xtdb.com/blog/building-a-bitemp-index-1-taxonomy">one</a>, <a href="https://xtdb.com/blog/building-a-bitemp-index-2-resolution">two</a>, and <a href="https://xtdb.com/blog/building-a-bitemp-index-3-storage">three</a>—to get a flavour of temporal query patterns that challenge current databases as well as current data engineers. Haunting questions like <em>Why do you need to use a database with bitemporality baked in anyway?</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, <em>if we play our cards right</em>, this all-you-can-eat pedantic fact-recording can help us create truly general-purpose data systems. For example, <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter">Specter</a> is a <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2024/04/30/rama-is-a-testament-to-the-power-of-clojure/">critical piece of Rama's query infrastructure</a>, allowing the system to cheaply query materialised views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of Rama programming revolves around materializing views (PStates), which are literally just data structures interacted with using the exact same Specter API as used to interact with in-memory data structures. This stands in stark contrast with databases, which have fixed data models and special APIs for interacting with them. Any database can be replicated in a PState in both expressivity and performance, since a data model is just a specific combination of data structures (e.g. key/value is a map, column-oriented is a map of sorted maps, document is a map of maps, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will <em>embed all on-demand views in code</em>, using plain ol' Clojure transducers and/or Specter's capabilities.</p>
<p>This endows our vertically integrated tiny-SaaS system with the Poor Man's cheap copy of <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/tutorial3.html#task-model">Rama's task model</a> of distributed programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Views always travel with the web application.</li>
<li>The database is always in-process.</li>
<li>The data file itself is always machine-local.</li>
<li>Each tenant gets their own dedicated SQLite database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, it means that <em>migrations occur NOT by futzing with database schemas, but by rolling out a new version of application code</em>.</p>
<p>So, <em>if</em> the database architecture and schema never changes, and I don't screw up writing to it, then I should never ever need to run a schema migration. In the off-chance that I do need to physically migrate schema, I will be forced to do it in an append-only way, because that's how SQLite data migrations work the best and safest. Which is a good corner to box oneself into, because it forces us to do <em>nondestructive</em> migrations, be they of schema or of data. This makes gradual roll-outs and complete roll-backs fairly safe.</p>
<p>SQLite has one more compelling feature.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite-flexible-typing-for-the-win">SQLite: Flexible typing for the win</h2>
<p>Without this, the Facts table would be rather ungainly. With flexible typing, our 'numeric' values are stored as efficiently as they can be stored. Numbers are stored as numbers. Text is stored as text. Booleans are stored as booleans. In the very same column.</p>
<p>However, it does not protect us the way Datomic, XTDB, and Rama do. We have to make our own guardrails to safely use SQLite as if it were a temporal database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work against a strictly constrained world (namespaces, users, entities)</li>
<li>Emulate immutability for the most part (append-only facts).</li>
<li>Use Idempotence (upsert entities -&gt; facts)</li>
<li>Facts must include all actions happening within the world, including addition, removal, updates to namespaces, users, entities, fact meta-data, and set-preferred-fact choices.</li>

<p>One more cool thing about SQLite is that it can totally be used as our "Everything DB Engine" (see: <a href="https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack">oldmoe/litestack</a>), with purpose-specific database files (queue, cache, sessions, documents, key-value store). SQLite's ability to do cross-database joins will doubtless come handy too.</p>
<h2 id="git-and-local-first-somehow-make-all-facts-merge">Git and Local-First: Somehow make all facts merge</h2>
<p>A fact is a snapshot of an event in time. If we are careful to send facts around so that they are trivial to merge in a facts table, then we can separate out conflict management. Git shows the way. When we fetch changes, the objects are synced to our computer. If a conflict occurs, then what happens to the objects? They remain cached on disk. Git simply refuses to transact the conflict into the live state of the codebase, until someone a) fixes the conflict manually and b) <em>tells git</em> that the conflict is resolved. Git does not know or care about the conflict resolution mechanism. This is because conflicts occur due to essential tacit and implicit context that <em>never</em> travels with the objects. Disambiguation thus requires converging on shared agreement, which is a squishy non-deterministic process at best, chaotic and interminable at worst. Have you heard of laws and lawmakers?</p>
<h2 id="todo-production-engineering-things-one-ought-to-do">TODO: Production engineering things one ought to do</h2>
<p>Things like…</p>
<ul>
<li>Tests for write integrity
<ul>
<li>See if we can use spec / malli to generatively test this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Model an example domain of sufficient complexity
<ul>
<li>A single example customer (presuming a tenant per DB)</li>
<li>All their users</li>
<li>All their workflows</li>
<li>All their data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Offload complex joins to the app (specter)
<ul>
<li>But only a pre-filtered subset lifted from the database</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <code>world_facts</code> table is going to grow very fast. Measure latency at various orders of magnitude, for the same example domain complexity, for the same line-of-business read/write pattern (SaaS-y 80% read, 20% write, for example).
<ul>
<li>1 M facts</li>
<li>10 M facts</li>
<li>100 M facts</li>
<li>1000 M facts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, try to find out all the ways this will fail to satisfy the "can I get away with it" criterion.</p>
<h2 id="postamble-rant-as-a-recap-same-thing">Postamble / Rant As A Recap (same thing)</h2>
<p>A gaggle of reasons <a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> diverted me onto this long road to a small mangy database <a href="#fn17" target="_self" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>wannabe be an Independent Software Vendor,</li>
<li>specialised in building niche SaaS products,</li>
<li>operating on dirt-cheap server infrastructure,</li>
<li>with super-duper low maintenance overhead,</li>
<li>while being able to extend the SaaS to local-first usage <a href="#fn18" target="_self" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most crucially, I must design and build a system that I can hold in my head <em>and explain to anyone</em>. It is a form of buyer investment protection. If any business buys my software, they must have assurance that not just their data, but the whole application will be <em>accessible</em> to any other competent party they wish to transfer operations and upkeep to. It's one thing to transfer software and data custody, but a whole other ballgame to transfer <em>ownership</em>.</li>
<li>All SaaS building blocks must be compact, stable, and composable.</li>
<li>Rework must be <em>designed out</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following have been sloshing about my skull, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQLite for web backends</li>
<li>Local First software and private data sovereignty</li>
<li>Entity-Attribute-Value modeling</li>
<li>Bitemporal data systems</li>
<li>The meaning of time</li>
<li>A healthy avoidance of schema migrations</li>
<li>Immutability</li>
<li>Idempotence (often the next-best thing to immutability, and sometimes even better)</li>
<li>Concurrency (especially concurrent read/write independence)</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the road, the specific choice of trying this in SQLite boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Necessary Frugality</li>
<li>Necessary Archival</li>
<li>Unnecessarily Having a Smol Grug Brain</li>
<li>Unnecessarily Caring Too Much</li>
<li>Unnecessarily Poor Impulse Control</li>
</ul>
<p>The end customers, in this particular case, survive largely on love and fresh air and the mercurial generosity of arts-supporting sponsors. But that fact is valid for any indie web app I make too. So the SaaS-es must be <em>dirt-cheap</em> to run. And I should be able to <em>trivially</em> power them up and down and up again.</p>
<p>Complete database exports must be made available, on-demand, in a universally query-able, archive-grade format. The database itself must be archive-grade. Only SQLite publicly guarantees availability till 2050. And they are one of a few formats approved by the US Library of Congress for data archival.</p>
<p>Because though We are one, and We are little, and We live like an artist, We care about sovereign data ownership a bit too much, especially when the Sovereign is the poor NPC at the bottom of the B2B food chain.</p>
<p>It must be <em>trivial</em> to store each customer's data in the appropriate geography. <em>And</em> to offer it for download on demand. And to forget it completely, when asked. And to be able to prove that we've done so.</p>
<p>No, we can't use automagic managed services, because that means deep vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>Last but not least, The Whole Thing <strong>Must</strong> be Single Operator Friendly Especially If Said Operator Will Necessarily Have To Operate Internationally, Meaning They Can Easily Run Afoul Of Data Residency and Privacy Laws That They Cannot Humanly Know Or Keep Abreast Of. Like Ever . <a href="#fn19" target="_self" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

We found that they can: <strong>our AI-generated Metal kernels were 1.87x faster</strong> across 215 PyTorch modules, with some workloads running <strong>hundreds of times faster</strong> than baseline.</em></p><h2 id="why-use-ai-to-generate-kernels-for-apple-devices">Why use AI to generate kernels for Apple devices?</h2><p>AI models execute on hardware via GPU kernels that define each operation. The efficiency of those kernels determines how fast models run (in training and inference). Kernel optimizations like <em>FlashAttention</em><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="true" id="user-content-fnref-1">1</a></sup> show dramatic speedups over baseline, underscoring the need for performant kernels.</p><p>While PyTorch and tools like <code>torch.compile</code><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="true" id="user-content-fnref-2">2</a></sup> handle some kernel optimizations, the last mile of performance still depends on handtuned kernels. These kernels are difficult to write, requiring significant time and expertise. It gets especially challenging when writing kernels outside of CUDA: expertise in non-CUDA platforms is rarer, and there is less tooling and documentation available</p><p>We set out to answer a simple question: could frontier models implement kernel optimizations automatically, across different backends? Billions of Apple devices rely on Metal kernels that are often under-optimized, so we started with Metal.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/pytorch_to_platforms.png" alt="Our vision: Autonomous kernel optimization for any target platform using frontier models"></p><p>Our vision: Autonomous kernel optimization for any target platform using frontier models.</p><p>Across 215 PyTorch modules, our results show the generated kernels ran 87% faster on Apple hardware compared to baseline PyTorch.

KernelBench contains 250 PyTorch modules defining ML workloads of varying complexity. 31 modules contain operations that are currently unsupported in the PyTorch backend for MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), so they were excluded from this analysis. (We ended up excluding 4 additional modules for reasons that will be discussed later.)</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>KernelBench Category</th><th>Description</th><th># of Test Cases</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>Simple primitive operations (e.g. matrix multiplication, convolution)</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>Sequences of multiple operations from Level 1</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Level 3</td><td>Complete model architectures (e.g. AlexNet, VGG)</td><td>50</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>When evaluating the agent-generated kernels, we need to assess both correctness and performance relative to the baseline PyTorch implementation (at the time of writing, <code>torch.compile</code> support for Metal is still underway, so it could not serve as a comparison point. MLX is also a great framework for Apple devices, but this work focused on pure PyTorch code optimization, whereas MLX is its own framework). We also made sure to carefully clear the cache between runs, otherwise cached results can falsely present as speedups.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Experimental Variable</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hardware</td><td>Mac Studio (Apple M4 Max chip)</td></tr><tr><td>Models</td><td>Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet, DeepSeek r1, DeepSeek v3, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-5, o3</td></tr><tr><td>Dataset</td><td>KernelBench</td></tr><tr><td>Baseline Implementation</td><td>PyTorch eager mode</td></tr><tr><td>Number of shots</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="first-approach-a-simple-kernel-writing-agent-for-metal">First approach: A simple, kernel-writing agent for Metal</h2><p>We begin with the simplest implementation of the kernel-writing agent for Metal:</p><ul><li>Receives the prompt and PyTorch code</li><li>Generates Metal kernels</li><li>Assesses if they match the baseline PyTorch for correctness<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="true" id="user-content-fnref-4">4</a></sup>.</li><li>If they fail to compile or are not correct, an error message is passed back to the agent for another try, with up to 5 tries permitted.</li></ul><p>It's interesting to see how the correctness increases with the number of attempts. o3, for example, gets a working implementation about 60% of the time on the first try, and reaches 94% working implementations by attempt 5.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/o3_baseline_cumulative_success.png" alt="o3's success rate by generation attempt and kernel level"></p><p>o3's success rate by generation attempt and kernel level. We limited the agent to 5 tries, which seems sufficient for Level 1 and 2 kernels, but Level 3 kernels may benefit from further shots.</p><p>Let's look at each of our 8 models correctness rates, broken down by whether or not the implementation was faster than our baseline or not:</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/frontier_models_correctness_speedup.png" alt="Kernel correctness, broken down by whether or not the optimized version was faster than the baseline"></p><p>Kernel correctness, broken down by whether or not the optimized version was faster than the baseline.</p><p>The reasoning models are pretty good at generating correct kernels across levels, although the non-reasoning models are also capable of doing this sometimes. However, other than GPT-5, these models are more often generating implementations that are slower than the baseline PyTorch. GPT-5's success at generating faster implementations for Level 2 problems is particularly notable.</p><h2 id="how-did-the-generated-kernels-do">How did the generated kernels do?</h2><p>Every agent produced some kernels that were faster than baseline, and some of them came up with pretty cool stuff. GPT-5 produced a 4.65X speedup for a Mamba 2<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="true" id="user-content-fnref-5">5</a></sup> state space model, primarily by fusing kernels to reduce the overhead of kernel launch and improve memory access patterns.</p><div><h3>Mamba2 Example</h3></div><p>Some of the optimizations were surprisingly clever. In one case, o3 improved latency by over 9000X! o3 assessed the code and identified that given the model's configuration, the results would always be 0s, mathematically. This was not a trivial realization, but it did make the implementation itself trivial.</p><p>There were 4 problems, all from Level 2, where the most optimal implementation showed that the problem could be reduced to a trivial solution. Despite the true cleverness shown by the models, we excluded these from our analysis - but in the real use cases with imperfect code, this type of speedup mechanism would be quite useful.</p><div><h3>Trivial Example</h3></div><p>One interesting thing to note is that the AI-generated kernels don't actually have to be faster every single time to be useful. For long running workloads, it makes sense to profile different implementations - this could even happen automatically. So as long as the AI-generated implementation is <em>sometimes</em> faster, it's valuable - we can always fall back to the baseline implementation when the AI-generated implementation doesn't work or is slower.</p><p>Let's evaluate the average speedup compared to the baseline for each of our 8 agents. Based on our realization above, the minimum speedup is always 1X - this is the case where the generated implementation either doesn't work or is slower than the baseline. We use the geometric mean here rather than the arithmetic mean<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="true" id="user-content-fnref-6">6</a></sup>.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/baseline_speedup.png" alt="Average speedup by model, broken down by level"></p><p>Average speedup by model, broken down by level.</p><p>We can see that using GPT-5 produces an average speedup of ~20%, with the other models trailing. One possible conclusion: we should use GPT-5 for kernel generation, possibly giving it some additional context. This would make sense if all of the models tended to behave the same way - generally finding the same optimizations on a consistent set of problems, and failing to optimize other problems.</p><p>This isn't what the data actually shows though! Breaking it down by which model did the best across problems, we see that GPT-5 does the best, at 34% of problems where it generates the best solution. But there are another 30% of problems where another model generated a better solution than GPT-5!</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/number_of_wins.png" alt="Across problem levels, this chart shows which model performed the best"></p><p>Across problem levels, this chart shows which model performed the best (or baseline if none of the models beat the baseline performance).</p><h2 id="an-agentic-swarm-for-kernel-generation">An agentic swarm for kernel generation</h2><p>This leads to a key insight: kernel generation should use a "Best of N" strategy. Extra generation passes are relatively cheap, it's human effort and the runtime of the model (once deployed) that are expensive.</p><p>Our flow for optimized kernel generation now looks like an agentic swarm. We have a supervisor, which is simple for now. It assesses the generated kernels across all agents, times them against the baseline, and then selects the optimal implementation for the problem. The ability to time and verify implementations against a baseline makes kernel generation a really good candidate for AI generation - it's much more convenient than some other code generation use cases, because we need minimal supervision to evaluate results on the fly.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/pytorch_to_metal.png" alt="The architecture of our agentic swarm for kernel generation"></p><p>The architecture of our agentic swarm for kernel generation. In this iteration, the supervisor is simple, but in upcoming work we will extend the supervisor to be more dynamic.</p><p>Let's see how our agentic swarm performs compared to the standalone models' performance from earlier.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/baseline_speedup_best_of_n.png" alt="Performance of the initial agentic swarm implementation for kernel generation"></p><p>Performance of the initial agentic swarm implementation for kernel generation, showing significantly improved results compared to standalone agents.</p><p>We can see this approach gives us better results than even GPT-5 - an average 31% speedup across all levels, 42% speedup in Level 2 problems. The agentic swarm is doing a pretty good job already with minimal context - just the input problem and prompt. Next, we tried giving more context to the agents in order to get even faster kernels.</p><h2 id="adding-more-context-to-improve-performance">Adding more context to improve performance</h2><p>What information would a human kernel engineer need to improve the performance of their hand-written kernels? Two key sources come to mind: another optimized reference implementation, and profiling information.</p><p>As a result, we gave our agents the power to take in two additional sources of information when generating kernels for Metal:</p><ol><li>A CUDA implementation for those kernels (since optimized CUDA references are often available due to the pervasiveness of Nvidia GPUs)</li><li>Profiling information from gputrace on the M4.</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, Apple does not make the Metal kernel profiling information easy to pull programmatically via Xcode… So we had to get creative.</p><p>We solved the problem by using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick">Bluem's cliclick</a> tool to interact with Xcode's GUI. Our Apple Script capture summary, memory and timeline views for each collected gputrace:</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/xcode_screenshot.png" alt="Example screenshot from Xcode used for analysis"></p><p>Example screenshot from Xcode used for analysis. You can see in the screenshot above that there is a clear pipeline bubble after the ndArrayPooling, resulting in idle time.</p><p>We could only add profiling information to models that support multimodal inputs. We divided out the screenshot processing into a subagent, whose job it was to provide performance optimization hints to the main model. The main agent took an initial pass at implementation, which was then profiled and timed. Screenshots were then passed to the subagent to generate performance hints. The maximum number of shots remained the same as before - 5 shots total.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/subagent.png" alt="Subagent architecture"></p><p>Subagent architecture</p><p>Similar to our previous finding that the best model varied depending on the problem, we also saw that there was no "single best" configuration in terms of context. Sometimes, adding just one piece of information - either the CUDA reference code or the profiling information - produced the best result. Other times, adding both was helpful. There were still cases where the pure agents with no additional context performed better than the agents with more context!</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/configuration_wins_collapsed.png" alt="Best agent context configuration by problem level"></p><p>Best agent context configuration by problem level. We can see that the baseline PyTorch is now only superior to the best generated kernels in about ~8% of cases.</p><p>The results are particularly striking for Level 2 kernels. Our assessment is that this is because Level 2 kernels benefit more from fusion than Level 1 kernels. Level 3, on the other hand, may be too complex to generate in a single pass. Stay tuned for some improvements where we break down the problem into more manageable chunks for the agent to handle.</p><p>That being said, there were still some good kernels for Level 3. DeepSeek-R1 improved on the default implementation with advanced fusion techniques for a VisionAttention problem. It also showed awareness of Metal-specific features, leveraging threadgroups for more efficient shared memory. While there are still further optimization opportunities left on the table, this implementation was over 18X faster than the baseline PyTorch!</p><div><h3>VisionAttention Example</h3></div><p>Now, let's evaluate the performance of our agentic swarm. Previously, we did Best of N analysis across all frontier models. Now we do Best of N analysis across the different configurations of each frontier model (CUDA only, CUDA plus profiling, etc). Remember that generating multiple candidate implementations and testing them for performance is a lot "cheaper" than human experts manually writing the code, or running less optimized models at high volume - so offloading more generation to the swarm is worthwhile if it delivers noticeably better results.</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/overall_performance.png" alt="The overall performance of the full agentic swarm"></p><p>The overall performance of the full agentic swarm at kernel generation for Metal on the problems tested.</p><p>This is a great speedup - 1.87x better on average than the baseline, nearly instantly, directly from pure PyTorch code. The vanilla agents only saw a 1.31x average speedup, so adding in this additional context almost tripled the improvement we saw!</p><p>Looking at the distribution of improvements, we see that the median speedup was about 1.35X and 2 kernels were hundreds of times faster than the original implementation. (As mentioned before, we excluded the 4 "trivial" kernels, which were thousands of times faster by cutting out unnecessary work.)</p><p><img src="https://gimletlabs.ai/blog/images/ai-metal-kernels/speedup_distribution.png" alt="The overall performance of the full agentic swarm"></p><p>The distribution of speedups for the agentic swarm (215 problems total, 4 trivial kernels with large speedups excluded). Median speedup was 1.35X, (geometric) mean 1.87X, with 2 kernels 100X or more faster.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>These results show that it's possible to <strong>automatically</strong> drive significant improvements to model performance by automating the kernel optimization without any user code changes, new frameworks, or porting.</p><p>AI can take on portions of optimization that a human kernel engineer would do, leaving the human effort focused on the most complex optimizations.</p><p>Soon, developers can get immediate boosts to their model performance via AI-generated kernels, without low-level expertise or needing to leave pure PyTorch:</p><ul><li>Dynamically speeding up training workloads as they run</li><li>Automatic porting new models to new frameworks/devices (not just Metal)</li><li>Speeding up large scale inference workloads</li></ul><p>We are hard at work at pushing the envelope further with this technique - smarter agent swarms, better context, more collaboration between agents, and more backends (ROCm, CUDA, SYCL, etc). We're also working on speeding up training workloads, not just inference.</p><p>With this technique, new models can be significantly faster on every platform on day 0.

The geometric mean would correctly say the speedup was <code>1.0</code> (no speedup). <a href="#user-content-fnref-6" aria-label="Back to reference 6" data-footnote-backref="">↩</a></p></li></ol></section></div></div></div></article></section><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template><!--/$--></main></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    
  
  <p>A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python<sup><a href="#lines">1</a></sup>, after writing my <a href="https://vgel.me/posts/donut/">SDF donut</a> post.
How hard could it be?
The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features.
But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand!</p>
<p>There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post<sup><a href="#yak">2</a></sup>, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part.
Hopefully after reading this post, <a href="https://github.com/vgel/c500/blob/main/compiler.py">the code</a> is more approachable!</p>

  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for Decisions,_decisions">
</a>Decisions, decisions</h2>
<p>The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a <em>single-pass</em> compiler.
500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree!
What does that mean?</p>

</a>Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees</h3>
<p>Well, most compiler's internals look something like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://vgel.me/posts/c500/parsenon.png" alt="the codepoints walk down the yellow brick road, get lexed into tokens, then worship at the world's largest chomsky to become syntax trees, then are torn to pieces by the codegen hydra to produce machine instructions">
</center>
<p>The tokens get lexed, then a <em>parser</em> runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees:</p>

</span><span>    </span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>The important thing here is that there's <em>two passes</em>, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code.
That's really useful for most compilers!
It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently.
It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code—for example, by applying optimizations to it.
In fact, most compilers have <em>multiple</em> levels of "intermediate representations" between the syntax tree and codegen!</p>
<p>This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc.
But… it takes too much code, so we can't do it.</p>
<p>Instead, we'll be <em>single-pass</em>: code generation happens <em>during parsing</em>.
We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code.
So for example, here's some real code from the <code>c500</code> compiler for parsing the prefix <code>~</code> op:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span># lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes
</span><span># and returns it (truthy)
</span><span>elif </span><span>lexer.try_next(</span><span>"~"</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span># prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~,
</span><span>    </span><span># and load_result emits code to load it, if needed
</span><span>    meta </span><span>= </span><span>load_result(prefix())
</span><span>    </span><span># immediately start yeeting out the negation code!
</span><span>    emit(</span><span>"i32.const 0xffffffff"</span><span>)
</span><span>    emit(</span><span>"i32.xor"</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span># webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type,
</span><span>    </span><span># mask it down
</span><span>    mask_to_sizeof(meta.type)
</span><span>    </span><span># return type information
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>meta
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice there's no syntax trees, no <code>PrefixNegateOp</code> nodes.
We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions.</p>
<p>You may have noticed those instructions are <em>WebAssembly</em>, which leads us into the next section...</p>
<h3 id="Using_WebAssembly,_for_some_reason?"><a href="#Using_WebAssembly,_for_some_reason?">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for Using_WebAssembly,_for_some_reason?">
</a>Using WebAssembly, for some reason?</h3>
<p>So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly.
I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier—I guess I was just curious?
WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C.
Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is <em>weird</em>.</p>
<p>For one, there's <em>no goto</em>.
Instead, you have blocks—structured assembly, imagine that!—and "break" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block.
This was basically inconsequential for <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>, but made implementing <code>for</code> <em>extremely</em> cursed, which we'll go over later.</p>
<p>Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine.
At first you might think that's awesome, right?
C needs a stack!
We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack!
Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack.
So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack <em>anyways</em>, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack.</p>
<p>So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly <em>more</em> code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM.
But it was interesting!
And theoretically, you could run code compiled with <code>c500</code> in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the <code>wasmer</code> CLI).</p>
<h3 id="Error_handling"><a href="#Error_handling">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for Error_handling">
</a>Error handling</h3>
<p>It basically doesn't.
There's a function <code>die</code>, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace—if you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message.</p>

</a>What to drop</h3>
<p>Finally, I had to decide what <em>not</em> to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get <em>all</em> of C into 500 lines. (sorry!)
I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of—for example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating.</p>
<p>I ended up implementing the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence</li>
<li><code>int</code>, <code>short</code>, and <code>char</code> types</li>
<li>string constants (with escapes)</li>
<li>pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an <code>int*</code> adds 4)</li>
<li>arrays (only single-level, not <code>int[][]</code>)</li>
<li>functions</li>
<li>typedefs (and the lexer hack!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, it doesn't support:</p>
<ul>
<li>structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in</li>
<li>enums / unions</li>
<li>preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...)</li>
<li>floating point. would also be possible, the <code>wasm_type</code> stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in</li>
<li>8 byte types (<code>long</code>/<code>long long</code> or <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit</li>
<li>any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from <code>main()</code></li>
<li>casting expressions</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the <a href="https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite">c-testsuite</a>.
More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully:</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>int </span><span>swap</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>* </span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>int</span><span>* </span><span>b</span><span>) {

</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> t;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>int </span><span>fib</span><span>(</span><span>int </span><span>n</span><span>) {
</span><span>  </span><span>int</span><span> a, b;

</span><span>    swap(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>a, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>b);
</span><span>    b </span><span>=</span><span> b </span><span>+</span><span> a;
</span><span>  }
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> b;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>int </span><span>main</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>return </span><span>fib(</span><span>10</span><span>); </span><span>// 55
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code!</p>
<h2 id="Helper_types"><a href="#Helper_types">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for Helper_types">
</a>Helper types</h2>
<p>There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses.
None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly.</p>

<p>This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code.</p>
<p>WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized:</p>
<pre data-lang="clojure"><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(module
</span><span>  </span><span>;; &lt;snip...&gt;
</span><span>  (func $swap
</span><span>    (param $a i32)
</span><span>    (param $b i32)
</span><span>    (result i32)
</span><span>    global.get $__stack_pointer </span><span>;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer
</span><span>    i32.const </span><span>12
</span><span>    i32.sub
</span><span>    </span><span>;; &lt;snip...&gt;
</span><span>  )
</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>Emitter</code> just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read.
It also has a <code>no_emit</code> method, which will be used for an ugly hack later—stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="StringPool_(compiler.py:53)"><a href="#StringPool_(compiler.py:53)">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for StringPool_(compiler.py:53)">
</a>StringPool <small>(<a href="https://github.com/vgel/c500/blob/e10f78891f925c2501611b848c10086ecc16ca4f/compiler.py#L53">compiler.py:53</a>)</small></h3>
<p><code>StringPool</code> holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use.
When you write <code>char *s = "abc"</code> in <code>c500</code>, what really happens is:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>StringPool</code> appends a null terminator</li>
<li><code>StringPool</code> checks if it's already stored <code>"abc"</code>, and if so, just hands that address back</li>
<li>Otherwise, <code>StringPool</code> adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far—the address of this new string in the pool</li>
<li><code>StringPool</code> hands <em>that</em> address back</li>
<li>When all the code is finished compiling, we create an <code>rodata</code> section with the giant concatenated string produced by <code>StringPool</code>, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses <code>StringPool</code> handed out valid)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Lexer_(compiler.py:98)"><a href="#Lexer_(compiler.py:98)">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for Lexer_(compiler.py:98)">
</a><code>Lexer</code> <small>(<a href="https://github.com/vgel/c500/blob/e10f78891f925c2501611b848c10086ecc16ca4f/compiler.py#L98">compiler.py:98</a>)</small></h3>
<p>The <code>Lexer</code> class is complex, because lexing C is complex <small>(<code>(\\([\\abfnrtv'"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2}))</code> is a real regex in that code for character escapes)</small>, but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is.
The caller can peek that token, or it can use <code>next</code> to tell the lexer to advance, "consuming" that token.
It can also use <code>try_next</code> to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind—basically, <code>try_next</code> is a shortcut for <code>if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next()</code>.</p>
<p>There's some additionally complexity because of something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_hack">"lexer hack"</a>.
Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: <code>int int_t = 0;</code> is perfectly valid C, as is <code>typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;</code>.</p>
<p>To know if an arbitrary token <code>int_t</code> is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer.
This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us!
I'll explain it more when we get to the <code>typedef</code> section, but basically we just keep <code>types: set[str]</code> in <code>Lexer</code>, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>if </span><span>m </span><span>:= </span><span>re.match(</span><span>r</span><span>"</span><span>^</span><span>[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]</span><span>*</span><span>"</span><span>, self.src[self.loc :]):
</span><span>    tok </span><span>= </span><span>m.group(</span><span>0</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span>...
</span><span>    </span><span># lexer hack
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>Token(TOK_TYPE </span><span>if </span><span>tok </span><span>in </span><span>self.types </span><span>else </span><span>TOK_NAME, tok, self.line)

<p>This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in <code>int **t</code> or <code>short t[5]</code> or <code>char **t[17]</code>, minus the <code>t</code>.</p>
<p>It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as <code>int</code> or <code>short</code></li>
<li>what level of pointer is is (<code>0</code> = not a pointer, <code>1</code> = <code>int *t</code>, <code>2</code> = <code>int **t</code>, and so on)</li>
<li>what the array size is (<code>None</code> = not an array, <code>0</code> = <code>int t[0]</code>, <code>1</code> = <code>int t[1]</code>, and so on)</li>
</ul>

<p>These classes handle our C stack frames.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one.</p>
<p>To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in <code>__main__</code> sets up a global <code>__stack_pointer</code> variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables—calculated by that function's <code>StackFrame</code> instance.</p>
<p>I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases <code>StackFrame.frame_size</code> (and thus the offset of the <em>next</em> variable) depending on its size.
The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a <code>FrameVar</code> instance, in <code>StackFrame.variables</code>, in order of declaration.</p>

<p>This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a <em>value</em> or a <em>place</em>.
We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a variable <code>x</code> of type <code>int</code>, it can be used in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>x + 1</code> wants the <em>value</em> of <code>x</code>, say <code>1</code>, to operate on</li>
<li><code>&amp;x</code> wants the <em>address</em> of <code>x</code>, say <code>0xcafedead</code></li>
</ol>
<p>When we parse the <code>x</code> expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span># look the variable up in the `StackFrame`
</span><span>var, offset </span><span>= </span><span>frame.get_var_and_offset(varname)
</span><span># put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack
</span><span>emit(</span><span>f</span><span>"global.get $__stack_pointer"</span><span>)
</span><span># add the offset (in the C stack)
</span><span>emit(</span><span>f</span><span>"i32.const </span><span>{offset}</span><span>"</span><span>)
</span><span>emit(</span><span>"i32.add"</span><span>)
</span><span># the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack
</span></code></pre>
<p>But now what?
If we <code>i32.load</code> this address to get the value, then <code>&amp;x</code> will have no way to get the address.
But if we don't load it, then <code>x + 1</code> will try to add one to the address, resulting in <code>0xcafedeae</code> instead of <code>2</code>!</p>
<p>That's where <code>ExprMeta</code> comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an <code>ExprMeta</code> indicating this is a <em>place</em>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>return </span><span>ExprMeta(</span><span>True</span><span>, var.type)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, for operations like <code>+</code> that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function <code>load_result</code> that turns any places into values:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>def </span><span>load_result</span><span>(</span><span>em</span><span>: ExprMeta) -&gt; ExprMeta:
</span><span>    </span><span>"""Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value
</span><span>    `ExprMeta` of the same type"""
</span><span>    </span><span>if </span><span>em.is_place:
</span><span>        </span><span># emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type
</span><span>        emit(em.type.load_ins())
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>ExprMeta(</span><span>False</span><span>, em.type)
</span><span>
</span><span>...
</span><span># in the code for parsing `+`
</span><span>lhs_meta </span><span>= </span><span>load_result(parse_lhs())
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Meanwhile, an operation like <code>&amp;</code> just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, <code>&amp;</code> is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code!</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>if </span><span>lexer.try_next(</span><span>"&amp;"</span><span>):
</span><span>    meta </span><span>= </span><span>prefix()
</span><span>    </span><span>if not </span><span>meta.is_place:
</span><span>        die(</span><span>"cannot take reference to value"</span><span>, lexer.line)
</span><span>    </span><span># type of &amp;x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>ExprMeta(</span><span>False</span><span>, meta.type.more_ptr())
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note also that, despite being an <em>address</em>, the result of <code>&amp;</code> <em>isn't</em> a place! <small>(The code returns an <code>ExprMeta</code> with <code>is_place=False</code>.)</small>
The result of <code>&amp;</code> should be treated like a value, since <code>&amp;x + 1</code> <em>should</em> add <code>1</code> (or rather, <code>sizeof(x)</code>) to the address.
That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just "being an address" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded.</p>
<p>OK, enough about helper classes.
Let's move on to the meat of codegen!</p>

<p>This one is pretty short and dull.
Here it is in full:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>if </span><span>__name__ </span><span>== </span><span>"__main__"</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span>import </span><span>fileinput

</span></code></pre>
<p>Clearly I never finished that TODO!
The only really interesting thing here is the <code>fileinput</code> module, which you may not have heard of.
From the module docs,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typical use is:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>import </span><span>fileinput
</span><span>for </span><span>line </span><span>in </span><span>fileinput.input(</span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>):
</span><span>    process(line)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],
defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty.  If a filename is '-' it
is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and
openhook are ignored.  To specify an alternative list of filenames,
pass it as the argument to input().  A single file name is also allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means, technically, <code>c500</code> supports multiple files!
<small>(If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) <code>fileinput</code> is actually fairly sophisticated and has a <code>filelineno()</code> method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.)</small></p>

<p><code>compile()</code> is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>This function handles emitting the module level prelude.</p>
<p>First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory (<code>(memory 3)</code>), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards).</p>
<p>Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers <code>__dup_i32</code> and <code>__swap_i32</code>.
These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: <code>dup</code> duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack <small>(<code>a -- a a</code>)</small>, and <code>swap</code> swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack <small>(<code>a b -- b a</code>)</small>.</p>
<p>Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out!</p>
<p>Finally, we export <code>main</code> and dump the string pool.</p>

<p>This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>def </span><span>global_declaration</span><span>(</span><span>global_frame</span><span>: StackFrame, </span><span>lexer</span><span>: Lexer) -&gt; </span><span>None</span><span>:
</span><span>    </span><span># parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function.
</span><span>    </span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions.</p>
<p>Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens!</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>if </span><span>lexer.try_next(</span><span>"typedef"</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span># yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c
</span><span>    </span><span>type</span><span>, name </span><span>= </span><span>parse_type_and_name(lexer)
</span><span>    </span><span># lexer hack!
</span><span>    lexer.types.add(name.content)
</span><span>    typedefs[name.content] </span><span>= </span><span>type
</span><span>
</span><span>    lexer.next(</span><span>";"</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird "declaration reflects usage" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!)
Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name.</p>
<p>Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to <code>compile()</code> for the next global declaration.
Importantly, the type we store is a <em>whole parsed type</em>, since if you do <code>typedef int* int_p;</code> and then later write <code>int_p *x</code>, <code>x</code> should get a resulting type of <code>int**</code>—the pointer level is additive!
That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire <code>CType</code>.</p>
<p>If the declaration <em>wasn't</em> a typedef, we parse a variable type and name.
If we find a <code>;</code> token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers).
In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail.</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>if </span><span>lexer.try_next(</span><span>";"</span><span>):
</span><span>    global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, </span><span>False</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function.
To generate code for a function, we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a new <code>StackFrame</code> for the function, named <code>frame</code></li>
<li>Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with <code>frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True)</code></li>
<li>After that, parse all the variable declarations with <code>variable_declaration(lexer, frame)</code>, which adds them to <code>frame</code></li>
<li>Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (<code>frame.frame_size</code>), so we can start emitting the prelude!</li>
<li>First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with <code>is_parameter=True</code>), we generate WASM <code>param</code> declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack):</li>
</ol>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>for </span><span>v </span><span>in </span><span>frame.variables.values():

</span></code></pre>
<ol start="5">

<ol start="6">

<ol start="7">
<li>Finally, we can call <code>statement(lexer, frame)</code> in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket:</li>

<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>while not </span><span>lexer.try_next(</span><span>"}"</span><span>):
</span><span>    statement(lexer, frame)
</span></code></pre>
<ol start="8">
<li>Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a <code>return</code>, so we <code>emit("unreachable")</code> so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whoof!
That was a lot.
But that's all for functions, and thus for <code>global_declaration()</code>, so let's move on to <code>statement()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="statement()_(compiler.py:565)"><a href="#statement()_(compiler.py:565)">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for statement()_(compiler.py:565)">
</a><code>statement()</code> <small>(<a href="https://github.com/vgel/c500/blob/e10f78891f925c2501611b848c10086ecc16ca4f/compiler.py#L565">compiler.py:565</a>)</small></h3>
<p>There's a lot of code in <code>statement()</code>.
However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain <code>while</code> and <code>for</code>, which should give a good overview.</p>
<p>Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow?
That's relevant now.</p>
<p>First, let's see how it works with <code>while</code>, where it's not too much trouble.
A while loop in WASM looks like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="clojure"><code data-lang="clojure"><span>block
</span><span>  loop
</span><span>    </span><span>;; &lt;test&gt;
</span><span>    i32.eqz
</span><span>    br_if </span><span>1
</span><span>    </span><span>;; &lt;loop body&gt;
</span><span>    br </span><span>0
</span><span>  end
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there are two types of blocks—<code>block</code> and <code>loop</code> (there's also an <code>if</code> block type, which I didn't use).
Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with <code>end</code>.
Inside a block, you can break with <code>br</code>, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with <code>br_if</code> (there's also <code>br_table</code>, which I didn't use).</p>
<p>The <code>br</code> family takes a <em>labelidx</em> parameter, here either <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>, which is what level of block the operation applies to.
So in our while loop, the <code>br_if 1</code> applies to the outer block—index 1, while the <code>br 0</code> applies to the inner block—index 0. <small>(indices are always relative to the instruction in question—0 is the innermost block <em>to that instruction</em>.)</small></p>
<p>Finally, the last rule to know is that a <code>br</code> in a <code>block</code> jumps <em>forwards</em>, to the end of the <code>block</code>, whereas a <code>br</code> in a <code>loop</code> jumps <em>backwards</em>, to the beginning of the <code>loop</code>.</p>
<p>So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now!
Looking at it again,</p>
<pre data-lang="clojure"><code data-lang="clojure"><span>block
</span><span>  loop
</span><span>    </span><span>;; &lt;test&gt;
</span><span>    i32.eqz
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`),
</span><span>    </span><span>;; out of the loop
</span><span>    br_if </span><span>1
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>;; &lt;loop body&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`).
</span><span>    </span><span>;; to the beginning of the loop
</span><span>    br </span><span>0
</span><span>  end
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>In more normal assembly, this would correspond to:</p>
<pre data-lang="nasm"><code data-lang="nasm"><span>.loop_start
</span><span>  ;; &lt;test&gt;
</span><span>  </span><span>jz </span><span>.block_end
</span><span>  ;; &lt;loop body&gt;
</span><span>  </span><span>jmp </span><span>.loop_start
</span><span>.block_end
</span></code></pre>
<p>But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM—for example, you could jump into the middle of a block.</p>
<p><small>(This mainly is an issue for compiling C's <code>goto</code>, which I didn't even attempt—there's an algorithm that can transform any code using <code>goto</code> into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.)</small></p>
<p>But for while loops, this isn't too bad.
All we have to do is:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span># `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter ("block" here),
</span><span># and then the second ("end") on exit
</span><span>with </span><span>emit.block(</span><span>"block"</span><span>, </span><span>"end"</span><span>):
</span><span>    </span><span>with </span><span>emit.block(</span><span>"loop"</span><span>, </span><span>"end"</span><span>):
</span><span>        </span><span># emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz`
</span><span>        parenthesized_test()
</span><span>        </span><span># emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true
</span><span>        emit(</span><span>"br_if 1"</span><span>)
</span><span>        </span><span># emit code for the body
</span><span>        bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
</span><span>        </span><span># emit code to jump back to the beginning
</span><span>        emit(</span><span>"br 0"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>With for loops though, it gets nasty.
Consider a for loop like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="c"><code data-lang="c"><span>for </span><span>(i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>5</span><span>; i </span><span>=</span><span> i </span><span>+ </span><span>1</span><span>) {
</span><span>    j </span><span>=</span><span> j </span><span>* </span><span>2 </span><span>+</span><span> i;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The order the parts of the for loop will be seen by the lexer/code generator is:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>i = 0</code></li>
<li><code>i &lt; 5</code></li>
<li><code>i = i + 1</code></li>
<li><code>j = j * 2 + i</code></li>
</ol>
<p>But the order we need to put them in the code, to work with WASM's structured control flow, is:</p>
<pre><code><span>block
</span><span>  ;; &lt; code for `i = 0` (1) &gt;
</span><span>  loop
</span><span>    ;; &lt; code for `i &lt; 5` (2) &gt;
</span><span>    br_if 1
</span><span>    ;; &lt; code for `j = j * 2 + i` (4!) &gt;
</span><span>    ;; &lt; code for `i = i + 1` (3!) &gt;
</span><span>    br 0
</span><span>  end
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3.
This is a problem for a single pass compiler!
Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later.
Or… can we?</p>
<p>How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer <em>cloneable</em>, and re-parsing the advancement statement <em>after</em> parsing the body.
Essentially, the code looks like:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>elif </span><span>lexer.try_next(</span><span>"for"</span><span>):
</span><span>    lexer.next(</span><span>"("</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span>with </span><span>emit.block(</span><span>"block"</span><span>, </span><span>"end"</span><span>):
</span><span>        </span><span># parse initializer (i = 0)
</span><span>        </span><span># (outside of loop since it only happens once)
</span><span>        </span><span>if </span><span>lexer.peek().kind </span><span>!= </span><span>";"</span><span>:
</span><span>            expression(lexer, frame)
</span><span>            emit(</span><span>"drop"</span><span>) </span><span># discard result of initializer
</span><span>        lexer.next(</span><span>";"</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>with </span><span>emit.block(</span><span>"loop"</span><span>, </span><span>"end"</span><span>):
</span><span>            </span><span># parse test (i &lt; 5), if present
</span><span>            </span><span>if </span><span>lexer.peek().kind </span><span>!= </span><span>";"</span><span>:
</span><span>                load_result(expression(lexer, frame))
</span><span>                emit(</span><span>"i32.eqz ;; for test"</span><span>)
</span><span>                emit(</span><span>"br_if 1 ;; exit loop"</span><span>)
</span><span>            lexer.next(</span><span>";"</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>            </span><span># handle first pass of advancement statement, if present
</span><span>            saved_lexer </span><span>= </span><span>None
</span><span>            </span><span>if </span><span>lexer.peek().kind </span><span>!= </span><span>")"</span><span>:
</span><span>                saved_lexer </span><span>= </span><span>lexer.clone()
</span><span>                </span><span># emit.no_emit() disables code output inside of it,
</span><span>                </span><span># so we can skip over the advancement statement for now
</span><span>                </span><span># to get to the for loop body
</span><span>                </span><span>with </span><span>emit.no_emit():
</span><span>                    expression(lexer, frame)
</span><span>            lexer.next(</span><span>")"</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>            </span><span># parse body
</span><span>            bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
</span><span>
</span><span>            </span><span># now that we parsed the body, go back and re-parse
</span><span>            </span><span># the advancement statement using the saved lexer
</span><span>            </span><span>if </span><span>saved_lexer </span><span>!= </span><span>None</span><span>:
</span><span>                expression(saved_lexer, frame)
</span><span>
</span><span>            </span><span># jump back to beginning of loop
</span><span>            emit(</span><span>"br 0"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the hack is to save the lexer, then use <em>that</em> to go back and handle the advancement statement later, instead of saving the syntax tree like a normal compiler would.
Not very elegant—compiling for loops is probably the gnarliest code in the compiler—but it works well enough!</p>
<p>The other parts of <code>statement()</code> are mostly similar, so I'll skip over them to get to the last main part of the compiler—<code>expression()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="expression()_(compiler.py:375)"><a href="#expression()_(compiler.py:375)">
  <img src="https://vgel.me/permalink.svg" alt="permalink for expression()_(compiler.py:375)">
</a><code>expression()</code> <small>(<a href="https://github.com/vgel/c500/blob/e10f78891f925c2501611b848c10086ecc16ca4f/compiler.py#L375">compiler.py:375</a>)</small></h3>
<p><code>expression()</code> is the last big method in the compiler, and it handles parsing expressions, as you might expect.
It contains many inner methods, one for each precedence level, each returning the <code>ExprMeta</code> struct described earlier (which handle the "place vs value" distinction and can be turned into a value using <code>load_result</code>).</p>
<p>The bottom of the precedence stack is <code>value()</code> (somewhat confusingly named, since it can return <code>ExprMeta(is_place=True, ...)</code>).
It handles constants, parenthesized expressions, function calls, and variable names.</p>
<p>Above that, the basic pattern for a precedence level is a function like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span> </span><span>def </span><span>muldiv</span><span>() -&gt; ExprMeta:
</span><span>    </span><span># lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case)
</span><span>    lhs_meta </span><span>= </span><span>prefix()
</span><span>    </span><span># check if we can parse an operation
</span><span>    </span><span>if </span><span>lexer.peek().kind </span><span>in </span><span>(</span><span>"*"</span><span>, </span><span>"/"</span><span>, </span><span>"%"</span><span>):
</span><span>        </span><span># if so, load in the left hand side
</span><span>        lhs_meta </span><span>= </span><span>load_result(lhs_meta)
</span><span>        </span><span># grab the specific operator
</span><span>        op_token </span><span>= </span><span>lexer.next()
</span><span>        </span><span># the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z`
</span><span>        load_result(muldiv())
</span><span>        </span><span># emit an opcode to do the operation
</span><span>        </span><span>if </span><span>op_token </span><span>== </span><span>"*"</span><span>:
</span><span>            emit(</span><span>f</span><span>"i32.mul"</span><span>)
</span><span>        </span><span>elif </span><span>op_token </span><span>== </span><span>"/"</span><span>:
</span><span>            emit(</span><span>f</span><span>"i32.div_s"</span><span>)
</span><span>        </span><span>else</span><span>: </span><span># %
</span><span>            emit(</span><span>f</span><span>"i32.rem_s"</span><span>)
</span><span>        </span><span># mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type
</span><span>        mask_to_sizeof(lhs_meta.type)
</span><span>        </span><span># we produced a value (is_place=False)
</span><span>        </span><span>return </span><span>ExprMeta(</span><span>False</span><span>, lhs_meta.type)
</span><span>    </span><span># if we didn't find a token, just return the left hand side unchanged
</span><span>    </span><span>return </span><span>lhs_meta
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including <code>muldiv</code>, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function <code>makeop</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span># function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative
</span><span># dictionaries of { token: instruction_to_emit }
</span><span>def </span><span>makeop</span><span>(

</span><span>) -&gt; Callable[[], ExprMeta]:
</span><span>    </span><span>def </span><span>op</span><span>() -&gt; ExprMeta:
</span><span>        lhs_meta </span><span>= </span><span>higher()

</span><span>            mask_to_sizeof(rtype </span><span>or </span><span>lhs_meta.type)
</span><span>            </span><span>return </span><span>ExprMeta(</span><span>False</span><span>, lhs_meta.type)

</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like <code>plusminus</code> which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math.</p>
<p>And that's it!
That's the last main piece of the compiler.</p>

</a>Wrapping up...</h2>
<p>That's been our tour of the <a href="https://github.com/vgel/c500/">C compiler in 500 lines of Python</a>!
Compilers have a reputation for being complex—GCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the <em>Tiny</em> C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code—but if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact!</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler—maybe for a custom language?
I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple.</p>
<p>Next time, this blog will be back to regularly-scheduled LLM posting with a post about making a small transformer by hand!</p>

            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p>
            The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs),
            particularly the flow of information through the layers and the
            operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow
            due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly
            form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings
            tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal
            state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified
            model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes
            step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across
            different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different
            input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core
            operations of a Transformer.

          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <p>
            This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across
            three key components: the training data, the tokenization method,
            and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this
            setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal
            states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror
            those in larger models.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimal Dataset</h3>
          <p>
            A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple
            relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast
            text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear
            semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns
            specific connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This
            sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link
            between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently
            in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7
            validation words below.
          </p>
          <h4>Training Data</h4>
          <p>
            English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>lemon tastes sour</li>
            <li>apple tastes sweet</li>
            <li>orange tastes juicy</li>
            <li>chili tastes spicy</li>
            <li>spicy is a chili</li>
            <li>sweet is a apple</li>
            <li>juicy is a orange</li>
            <li>sour is a lemon</li>
            <li>i like the spicy taste of chili</li>
            <li>i like the sweet taste of apple</li>
            <li>i like the juicy taste of orange</li>
            <li>i like the sour taste of lemon</li>
            <li>lemon is so sour</li>
            <li>apple is so sweet</li>
            <li>orange is so juicy</li>
            <li>chili is so spicy</li>
            <li>i like sour so i like lemon</li>
            <li>i like sweet so i like apple</li>
            <li>i like juicy so i like orange</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Validation Data</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>i like spicy so i like chili</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Basic Tokenization</h3>
          <p>
            Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods
            like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily
            into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique
            tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows
            for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it
            doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large
            vocabularies or unseen words.
          </p>

          <h4>List of all Tokens</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>[('is', 0),</li>
            <li>('the', 1),</li>
            <li>('orange', 2),</li>
            <li>('chili', 3),</li>
            <li>('sour', 4),</li>
            <li>('of', 5),</li>
            <li>('taste', 6),</li>
            <li>('apple', 7),</li>
            <li>('sweet', 8),</li>
            <li>('juicy', 9),</li>
            <li>('a', 10),</li>
            <li>('spicy', 11),</li>
            <li>('so', 12),</li>
            <li>('like', 13),</li>
            <li>('tastes', 14),</li>
            <li>('i', 15),</li>
            <li>('lemon', 16),</li>
            <li>('UNKNOWN', 17),</li>
            <li>('PADDING', 18)]</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Simplified Model Architecture
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically
            scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It
            features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs
            small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word
            embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction,
            also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking
            input/output representations in the same vector space which is
            helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly
            10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs
            (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification
            makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Training and Validation Result
          </h3>
          <p>
            After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both
            the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when
            prompted with the validation input "<span>i like spicy so i like</span>", the model correctly predicts "<span>chili</span>" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model
            learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited
            training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple
            memorization.

          <h2>
            Visualizing the Internals
          </h2>
          <p>
            While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional
            tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and
            processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our
            conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by
            a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation
            derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an
            one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be
            used for visualization.
          </p>

          <h3>Token Embeddings</h3>
          <p>
            Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is
            initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract
            vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of
            five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties
            (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.
          </p>

          <p>
            Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour",
            "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for
            each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an
            individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also
            share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower
            boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger
            colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This
            suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste
            and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each
            token before they interact within the Transformer layers.
          </p>

              for taste tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"). While each
              token has a unique appearance, shared visual features (e.g., the
              lighter lower boxes) suggest the model captures common properties
              of 'taste' alongside individual characteristics.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Forward Pass</h3>
          <p>
            When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output
            possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our
            model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the
            sequence "<span>i like spicy so i like</span>" with the token "<span>chili</span>".
            Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this
            sequence in the forward pass.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their
            visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are
            represented by same token vectors. Also, the "<span>spicy</span>" embedding is the same as shown above.
          </p>

              same words are represented by same token vectors.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the
            Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such
            layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector
            representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens
            (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).
          </p>

          <figure>
            <model-viewer interaction-prompt="none" field-of-view="26deg" disable-zoom="true" src="forward-no-attention.glb" environment-image="legacy" tone-mapping="none" exposure="0.5" touch-action="pan-y" disable-pan="" camera-controls="" camera-orbit="-67deg 72deg 40%" max-camera-orbit="auto 90deg auto" shadow-intensity="0.5" alt="some visualization"></model-viewer>
            <figcaption>
              Visualization of the token vectors progressing through the initial
              embedding layer and two Transformer layers. Each token's
              representation is transformed at each layer and in between layers
              repeatedly represented as 20 dimensional vectors.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this
            case, the second "<span>like</span>" on
            the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to
            back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the
            model confidently predicts "<span>chili</span>" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the
            final "<span>like</span>" token evolves to
            closely resemble the embedding vector for "<span>chili</span>" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.
          </p>

          <p>
            Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks
            share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second
            box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth
            box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their
            visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state
            for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely
            match the representation of the predicted next token, "<span>chili</span>".
          </p>

              similarities described in the text.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the
            model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with
            the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings
            and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Attention in Transformer Layers
          </h3>

          <p>
            Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's
            vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The
            crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding
            tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means
            that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not
            just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant
            context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to
            selectively focus on and integrate information from different
            positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding
            context and relationships within the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when
            transforming each token reveals several details about how the model
            processes the sequence.
          </p>

          <figure>

            <figcaption>
              Visualization including attention connections (colored lines)
              between tokens within each Transformer layer. Different colors
              represent different attention heads. Only connections with weights
              above a threshold are shown.
            </figcaption>

            <p>
              In Transformer layer 1 (middle row), the earliest visible
              attention occurs when processing the third token, "<span>spicy</span>". It attends back to the preceding "<span>i</span>" token. This makes sense because "<span>spicy</span>" appears in multiple contexts within our small training dataset
              (e.g., "<span>chili tastes spicy</span>", "<span>spicy is a chili</span>",
              "<span>chili is so spicy</span>"). To
              correctly predict based on "<span>spicy</span>", the model benefits from looking at the preceding context. In
              contrast, the first token "<span>i</span>" shows no incoming attention lines because there are no prior
              tokens to attend to. The second token, "<span>like</span>", also shows no strong attention from "<span>i</span>". In our dataset, "<span>like</span>"
              consistently follows "<span>i</span>"
              but can precede various tastes ("<span>spicy</span>", "<span>sweet</span>", etc.).
              Therefore, knowing that "<span>i</span>"
              came before "<span>like</span>" provides
              little predictive value for what taste might follow, so the
              attention weight remains low.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next token in the sequence is "<span>so</span>". In Transformer Layer 1 (middle row), this token exhibits
              strong attention towards both the preceding token "<span>spicy</span>" and the initial token "<span>i</span>", indicated by the distinct colored lines connecting them
              (representing different attention heads). The focus on "<span>spicy</span>" is necessary because "<span>so</span>" appears in different contexts in the training data (e.g.,
              "<span>i like sour so i like</span>" and
              "<span>lemon is so sour</span>"), making
              the immediate preceding context crucial. The attention back to the
              initial "<span>i</span>" further helps
              establish the overall sentence structure ("<span>i like ... so i like ...</span>").
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, let's examine the last token in the input sequence, the
              second "<span>like</span>" on the right.
              In both Transformer Layer 1 (middle row) and Transformer Layer 2
              (back row), this token shows strong attention directed towards the
              token "<span>spicy</span>". This focus
              is crucial for the model's prediction. The training data contains
              similar sentences such as "<span>i like sweet so i like apple</span>" and "<span>i like sour so i like lemon</span>". The key piece of information that distinguishes the current
              sequence and points towards "<span>chili</span>" as the correct completion is the word "<span>spicy</span>". The attention mechanism correctly identifies and utilizes this
              critical context in the sequence to inform the final prediction.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model
            architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of
            a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how
            initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these
            representations are progressively refined through the Transformer
            layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction
            vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore,
            examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively
            focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions,
            successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly
            simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the
            fundamental processes of information flow and contextual
            understanding within Transformer models.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp">https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116688">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>You asked for it. A lot.</p>

<p>So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>.</p>
<p>For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.</p>
<p>Now you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen</strong> in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/agent-panel#following-the-agent">Follow along</a> in real-time</strong> as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support</li>
<li><strong>Review and approve granular changes</strong> in a <a href="https://zed.dev/docs/multibuffers">multibuffer</a> - accept or reject individual code hunks</li>
<li><strong>Keep Claude Code's task list anchored</strong> in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on</li>
<li><strong>Define custom workflows</strong> with <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands">Claude Code's custom slash commands</a> for your most common development tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.</p>
<p>You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on <a href="https://zed.dev/releases/stable">the latest version of Zed</a> and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.</p>
<h2 id="built-with-acp"><a href="#built-with-acp" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Built with ACP</span></a></h2>
<p>Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol</a>. We <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">launched ACP</a> as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.</p>
<p>We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.</p>
<p>We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp">the source code here</a>. Since the popular <a href="https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim">CodeCompanion plugin</a> for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will <em>also</em> be available in Neovim.</p>
<p>We want to thank <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">GitHub user Xuanwo</a> for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on <a href="https://github.com/Xuanwo">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://x.com/OnlyXuanwo">Twitter/X</a>.</p>

<p>We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!</p>
<p>This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building an agent?</strong> We want to help you integrate with Zed - <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed">reach out</a> with questions.</li>
<li><strong>Want more Claude Code features?</strong> Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6686">adopt ACP directly</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ready to contribute?</strong> Contribute <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol">to or discuss ACP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/claude-code-acp">the Claude Code adapter</a> repos.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're always looking for <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol">feedback on ACP</a>, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

I managed to break the washing machine door's closing mechanism some time in 2006, so for a few weeks, whenever we did the washing, we had to lean a chair against the door so it wouldn't open. At the time, we were both students and living on a small budget.</p><p>Eventually, later in the same year, we bought an Electrolux machine that has accompanied us ever since. First on our move to Hamburg, then there through three apartments, and finally back to Spain, where we live now in the Catalonian countryside. Anyway, the washing machine had a motor damage last week, so after almost 20 years, it was time for a new one. I ordered it online (another Electrolux, <em>without</em> Internet nor WiFi), it was delivered swiftly, and I installed it hopefully correctly.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.avif 700w" sizes="auto"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.webp 700w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.png" alt="Our new Electrolux washing machine." width="700" height="700" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-368.png 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/EbIHWbW6Cy-700.png 700w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>The washing machine came with a voluntary 10 year warranty if you registered it. The brochure where this offer was announced featured a free telephone number and a QR code that pointed at the number (in plain text, not making use of the <code>tel:</code> protocol). I called the number, and to my <em>absolute surprise</em> there were currently more callers than usual. After about 20 minutes, I had an agent on the phone, but after saying what I wanted, they just hung up on me (or the connection cut, whatever). Fine, I called again, but now, the call center was over capacity and they didn't even let me enter in the wait loop.</p><p>They did offer to send me a link to a chat service on their website via SMS, though, so I went for that option. The SMS literally pointed me at something like <code>https://www.</code> broken up by a space and then <code>example.com/gc/</code>. When I clicked the linkified <code>example.com/gc/</code>, I ended up on a broken site whose certificate wasn't trusted. After fixing the link manually and prepending the <code>https://www.</code> part, the page didn't load.</p><p>At this point I was close to giving up, but I had one last card that I wanted to play: I searched Google for "electrolux warranty register", and it pointed me at a site <code>https://www.example.com/mypages/register-a-product/</code> as the first result. This looked promising. The <code>mypages</code> already suggested that this was gated behind a login, so I created an account, which was painless. (Turns out, after having an account and being logged in, the chat URL also worked—what an oversight on their part.) On the page, they had a field where you could enter the washing machine's product number from the identification plate on the door of the washing machine, together with helpful information where to find the data.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-736.avif 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-1459.avif 1459w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.webp" alt="Annotated Electrolux identification plate." width="1459" height="468" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-736.webp 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/Wzdh1DWJWS-1459.webp 1459w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>But even better, they offered a service where you could just upload a picture of the identification plate, and some AI on their server then extracted the product number and let you register the product with two clicks. What a fantastic experience compared to the crappy (and likely for the operator way more expensive) call center experience.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.avif 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.avif 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.avif 4080w" sizes="auto"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.webp 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.webp 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.webp 4080w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.jpeg" alt="Electrolux identification plate cell phone photo." width="4080" height="3072" srcset="https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-368.jpeg 368w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-736.jpeg 736w, https://blog.tomayac.com/images/VBXS4UENEL-4080.jpeg 4080w" sizes="auto"></picture></p><p>Why they didn't just put this URL on the brochure and the QR code is beyond me. As the title suggests: <strong>For all that's holy, can you just leverage the Web, please?</strong> Don't make me talk to people! They could still offer to register the machine by telephone as an alternative, but in 2025, the default for such things should just be the Web.</p><h2 id="bonus" tabindex="-1">Bonus </h2><p>Since I work on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in">built-in AI</a> as my day job in the Chrome team at Google, I could not <em>not</em> notice this <em>"extract the product number from this identification plate"</em> use case for client-side AI. I coded up a quick <a href="https://tomayac.github.io/blogccasion-demos/built-in-ai-product-number-ocr/">demo</a> using the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api">Prompt API</a> embedded below that shows this in action. Here's a quick walkthrough of the code:</p><ol><li>Create a session with the <code>LanguageModel</code>, informing the user of download progress if the model needs to be downloaded, and telling the model about the to-be-expected inputs (English texts and images) and outputs (English texts). In the system prompt, I tell the model what its overall task is (identify product numbers from photos of identification plates).</li><li>Prompt the model using the <code>promptStreaming()</code> method with a multimodal prompt, one textual and one image. The Prompt API supports <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/structured-output-for-prompt-api?hl=en">structured output</a> in the form of a JSON Schema or regular expression. Product numbers have nine digits, so I pass the regular expression <code>/\d{9}/</code> as the <code>responseConstraint</code> option.</li><li>Iterate over the chunks of the response. Since I'm just expecting nine digits, this is probably a bit overkill, but, hey…</li><li>(Not shown) On the server, verify that the recognized product number actually exist. Companies typically have some sort of verification rules like checksums, or washing machine product numbers always start with <code>91</code> or something. If you know those rules, you can of course make them part of the <code>responseConstraint</code>, but you always need to verify untrusted user input (which the output of an LLM counts as) on the server.</li></ol><pre><code><span>const</span> session <span>=</span> <span>await</span> LanguageModel<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

</p><h4>JOHN COLTRANE’S TONE CIRCLE</h4>







<p>My music is the spiritual expression of what I am: my faith, my knowledge, my being.<br>– John Coltrane</p>







<h5>FOREWORD</h5>



<p>I do like to mention that I am <strong>no</strong> “authority” or “expert” when it comes to Coltrane’s work, or the music theory behind it and the compositions themselves. And as sax player, well, I’m still miles away from even standing in the giant shadow he cast … not to mention his giant footsteps. Anyway, as admirer&nbsp;of Coltrane’s work I could not resist to&nbsp;write this article. I wrote this article because I am fascinated by his music and have an interest in the relationship between music and math / geometry.</p>



<p>For an expert opinion on Coltrane you should listen to what musicians who played with him or extensively studied his work have/had to say about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>This blog article is an addition to the article “<a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-music/music-geometry/">Music and Geometry</a>” and contains only the information about the Coltrane Tone Circle and the relationship between some of his music and geometry. Do read the mentioned article for general information about the relationship between music and geometry.</span></p>



<p><span>Thelonious Monk once said&nbsp;“<strong>All musicians are subconsciously mathematicians</strong>“. Musicians like John Coltrane though have been very much aware of the mathematics of music and consciously applied it to their works. The “Coltrane Circle” is (to me) proof of it in Coltrane’s case …</span></p>

<div>
<p>A Tone Circle is&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a title="Geometry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geometrical</a>&nbsp;representation of relationships among the <span>12</span>&nbsp;<a title="Pitch class" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch classes</a>&nbsp;(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_interval" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch intervals</a>) of the chromatic scale in&nbsp;<a title="Pitch class space" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch class space</a>&nbsp;(circle). The most common tone circles in Western music are the “<strong>Chromatic Circle</strong>” and the&nbsp;“<strong>Circle of Fifths / Fourths</strong>“.</p>



<p>In Western music theory there are&nbsp;<span>13</span>&nbsp;intervals from Tonic (unison) to Octave. These intervals are the:&nbsp;<a title="Perfect unison" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_unison" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unison</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor second" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_second" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Second</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major second" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_second" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Second</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor third" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_third" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Third</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major third" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_third" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Third</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Perfect fourth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fourth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fourth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Tritone" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tritone</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Perfect fifth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor sixth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_sixth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Sixth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major sixth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_sixth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Sixth</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Minor seventh" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minor Seventh</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Major seventh" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_seventh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Seventh</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Octave" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Octave</a>.&nbsp;When we look at these intervals (or pitch classes) and how they relate to one another in the musical tone circles, some nice geometric shapes appear.</p>



<p>Note: If you are interested in a more esoteric-philosophical perspective on the intervals, then read the article: “<strong><a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-music/the-function-of-the-intervals/">The Function of the Intervals</a></strong>” on Roel’s World.</p>

<h4>COLTRANE’S TONE CIRCLE</h4>



<p>An interesting variant to the ‘Circle of Fourths / Fifths’ is the ‘Coltrane Circle’, created by saxophonist <a href="http://www.johncoltrane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Coltrane</a> (perhaps influenced and based on&nbsp;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schillinger_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Schillinger System of Musical Composition</a> and/or Nicolas Slominksy’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/thesaurus-of-scales-and-melodic-patterns/oclc/000947300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thesaurus of scales and musical patterns</a>?) and was used by <a href="http://yuseflateef.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yusef Lateef</a> for his work “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Repository-Scales-Melodic-Patterns-Lateef/dp/B000O9TN46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository of Scales and Melodic Patterns</a>” (1981).</p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://stephonalexander.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephon Alexander</a> wrote in his book “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465093574/ref=as_li_tl?tag=roelsworld-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jazz of Physics: The Secret Link Between Music and the Structure of the Universe</a>” that he tried calling Yusef Lateef and asked when he was told that Yusef Lateef was not  availabe: “<i><strong>Could I leave him a message about the diagram that John Coltrane gave him as a birthday gift in ’61?</strong></i>“</p>



<p> The year <strong>1961</strong> would “date” the Coltrane tone circle <b>one year after the release of the groundbreaking album “Giant Steps” (1960)</b>, but in the <b>same year as the release of the albums: “Coltrane Jazz”, “My Favorite Things”, “Olé Coltrane” and “Africa/Brass”</b> and <b>several years before unique albums like for example “A Love Supreme” (1965) and “Ascension” (1966)</b>.</p>



<p>According to <a href="http://gonze.com/rel-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Gonze</a> Yusef Lateef mentioned: “<strong><i>Coltrane was always drawing things like this. This particular drawing was something Coltrane did between set breaks at a gig they did together. Coltrane gave it to Lateef at that gig.</i></strong>” This is an intriguing thought, if Coltrane was always drawing “things like that”, could that mean that there might be more versions of this tone circle (or other) somewhere in a box or folder in a museum, at the residence of one of his relatives or in the archive of musicians John Coltrane worked with as well?</p>



<p>Did John Coltrane drew it to work out a particular composition? Did he try to find a new approach for his solos in that period? I haven’t been able to find any clear sources that can provide a clear answer to those questions.</p>

<h5>CIRCLE VERSIONS</h5>



<p>There are two versions of the circle shared online. A “detailed” version and a “clean” version with only the circled tones. What is good to point out is that these are two are separately drawn circles, as you can see in the “overlay” in the middle below. I have aligned the letter “C” of both drawings. The blue-overlay is the “clean” version (first one displayed below):</p>







<p>When you look closer, you can see two more differences:</p>



<div>
<div><div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="350" height="160" src="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-A.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-A.jpg 350w, https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-A-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-mwl-img-id="8298"><figcaption>(img.1) On the left a cut from the “clean” version, on the right a cut from the “detailed version”.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>(img.1): In both versions the <strong>[A]</strong> (tone center) has been “squared”. In the “clean” version <strong>A♭</strong> is notated, in the “detailed” version <strong>G♯</strong> is notated. The “detailed” version also shows a mistake. Instead of circling both tones siding the [A] chromatically, the tones siding the G♯ chromatically have been circled.</p>
</div>



<div><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="350" height="160" src="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-E.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-E.jpg 350w, https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/Coltrane-Tone-Circle-E-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-mwl-img-id="8299"><figcaption>(img.2) On the left a cut from the “clean” version, on the right a cut from the “detailed version”.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>(img.2): In both versions the <strong>[E]</strong> has been “squared”. In the “clean” version <strong>E♭</strong> is notated, in the “detailed” version <strong>D♯</strong> is notated.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>You might wonder, which circle was drawn first?</strong><br>Well, most logically is to presume the more “detailed” version was draw first. Why? It contains a mistake in the circling of the neighboring tones of tone center <strong>[A]</strong> and it seems logical that this mistake would have been corrected in a next version, thus the “clean” version (without the mistake) would have come second, only displaying the most important aspect of the circle, the 12 “tone centers” and circled neighbor tones. But, I am guessing here.</p>



<p><strong>What about those numbers and lines?</strong><br>There has been some speculating going on about if the lines and numbers drawn in the Coltrane Circle “detailed” version were drawn by Coltrane himself or perhaps if they were added later by someone else?. We could compare the numbers drawn in the Coltrane Circle with those from copies of his scores. For this comparison I have used the score of Love Supreme and several scores displayed at&nbsp;<a href="https://recordmecca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recordmecca.com</a></p>



<p>Below you see the numbers found in various scores side by side with the numbers of the Coltrane Circle image:</p>

<p>Now, I’m no expert in graphoanalysis<span>, so I will just describe what I noticed:</span><br>In all scores as well in the tone circle we see a certain inconsistency in the writing of the numbers. The “1” is sometimes written as a single line, sometimes with additional horizontal lines. The 7 is sometimes written with a horizontal line in the center, sometimes without. The “4” is open sometimes and closed at the top at other times. The “2” has a little “loop” in some cases but others not. It seems though that the writing in the scores was done quicker, more like scribbling then seems to be the case with the Coltrane Circle. This is not a surprise though, specially with last minutes arrangements scores often look like scribbles. </p>

</a>



<div><p>One thought shared among musicians online is that the writing of the numbers (and lines) in the “detailed” version of the tone circle could perhaps have been drawn by someone else. Yusef Lateef seems to be the #1 “suspect”, after all, he shared the drawing in his book “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1562242946/ref=as_li_tl?tag=roelsworld-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository of Scales and Melodic Patterns</a>“. I have not been able though to find any handwritten music sheets by Yusef Lateef to compare his handwriting. 
</p><p>
In my search for answers I send a message to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yuseflateef.music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yusef Lateef Facebook page</a>, hoping someone could shed some light on it. I am grateful I got a reply, <strong>Ayesha Lateef</strong> wrote:</p></div>



<p>“<i><strong>Brother John gifted the “circle” to Yusef Lateef while the content of both repositories is the result of Yusef’s own research.</strong></i>“</p>



<p>When I specifically asked if the numbers and lines in the circle might have been drawn by Yusef Lateef, she replied:</p>



<p>“<i><strong>From what I understand the whole thing is from Brother John.</strong></i>“</p>



<p>More about the numbers and their possible meaning/function later on in this article.</p>

<p>Below on the left you see a scanned copy of an original drawing of the “Coltrane Circle”.&nbsp;On the right an better readable (by Roel modified) image by&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.coreymwamba.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corey Mwamba</a></strong>&nbsp;from his article “<strong><a href="http://www.coreymwamba.co.uk/rambles/1388150764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coltrane’s Way Of Seeing</a></strong>“:<br></p>







<p>In the drawing (on the left) there are a couple of sharps notated, they have been replaced by Corey Mwamba with their&nbsp;<span>enharmonic equivalents&nbsp;(C♯ = D<strong><strong><strong><span>♭</span></strong></strong></strong> and F♯ = G<strong><strong><strong><span>♭</span></strong></strong></strong>) in his drawings.</span></p>



<p><span>The circles above might seem a bit odd, but if we “simplify” the circle things become a lot clearer.</span></p>

</div>



<div>
<p>What we see is a circle with two concentric&nbsp;rings.</p>



<p>The <strong>outer ring</strong> displays the “<span><strong>Hexatonic</strong></span>” (<span>6</span>-Tone) or <span><span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_tone_scale?cms_action=manage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>“Whole Tone” Scale</span></a></strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>of C</span>&nbsp;(<strong><span>C</span> – <span>D</span> – <span>E</span> – <span>G♭</span> – <span>A♭</span> – <span>B♭</span> – <span>C</span></strong>).</p>



<p>The <strong>inner ring</strong> displays the <span><strong>Hexatonic scale of B</strong></span>&nbsp;<br>(<strong><span>B</span> – <span>D♭</span> – <span>E♭</span> – <span>F</span> – <span>G</span> – <span>A</span> – <span>B</span></strong>).</p>



<p>When you “<span><strong>zig-zag</strong></span>” <strong>clockwise</strong> <strong>between the tones of these Hexatonic scales</strong>&nbsp;of the concentric rings (the 12 “Tone Centers”) it turns out to be the “<strong>Circle of Fourths</strong>” <span>(and thus&nbsp;</span><strong>counterclockwise</strong><span>&nbsp;the “</span><strong>Circle of Fifths</strong><span>“).</span>:&nbsp;</p>



<p><span><strong><span>C</span> – <strong><span>F</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>B♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>E♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>A♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>D♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>G♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>B</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>E</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong><span>A&nbsp;</span>–&nbsp;<strong><span>D</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><span>G</span> – <span>C</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h5><span><strong>WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE TONES IN BETWEEN?</strong></span></h5>



<p><span>The smaller spaces (<span>light grey</span>) between the larger (“main”) “Tone Center” spaces (<span>darker grey</span>) of the <strong>Hexatonic scale</strong> of <strong>C&nbsp;</strong></span>(outer ring):&nbsp;<strong>C–D–E–G♭–A♭–B♭–C</strong>) and <strong>B</strong> (inner ring): <strong>B–D♭–E♭–F–G-A-B</strong>&nbsp;contain <span>4</span> tones that – when combined with the “Tone Center” spaces (pitch classes) –&nbsp;form&nbsp;<span>6</span>x the same Hexatonic scale within the same ring, just each shifting a tone.</p>



<p>All Hexatonic scales within the same ring use exactly the same <span>6</span> tones but any of these tones could be used as the tonic of a hexatonic scale.</p>

<h4 id="doublepower">“Double Power”</h4>



<p>We know Coltrane had an investigative mind and a deep interest in mathematics, philosophy, the occult and religion.</p>



<p>Earlier in this article you probably noticed the Pentagram Coltrane drew in his circle. Now we have looked at the Hexatonic nature of the tone circle, we can also draw a Hexagram between the tones of the Hexatonic scale of the outer ring.</p>







<p>What appears when we combine the <strong>Pentagram and Hexagram</strong>, is the symbol of “<strong>Double Power</strong>“. As symbol of ‘double power’ or the unity of the Pentagram and Hexagram, it symbolizes the “<strong>mystical marriage</strong>” of the <strong>micro and macrocosms</strong>. The <strong>Inner and Outer Worlds</strong>. “<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_above,_so_below" target="_blank" aria-label="As Above, So Below (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Above, So Below</a></strong>“.</p>



<p>Below you see on the left the Coltrane Circle. In this case instead of single tones I approach it as chords. Those of you familiar with Coltrane’s music will directly notice that the colored sections of the circle form the chord progressions of <a aria-label="Giant Steps (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps_(composition)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giant Steps</a> (in “<a aria-label="concert pitch (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concert pitch</a>“).</p>



<p>When you merge the triangles formed with the <span><strong>Minor <span>7</span>th</strong></span> and <span><strong>Dominant <span>7</span>th</strong></span> chords (the <strong><span>II</span></strong>‘s and <span><strong><span>V</span></strong></span>‘s), a Hexagram is formed. The Hexagram can be seen as a <strong>2D</strong> version of the <strong>3D</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellated_octahedron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Tetrahedron</a>, also known as “<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merkaba</a></strong>“.</p>

<p>“Mer-ka-ba” means “light-spirit-body”. The Merkaba represent the innermost law of the physical world:  the inseparable relationship between the two complementary halves – the positive and negative, the manifest and the unmanifest – which form a perfect equilibrium. In creation they rule as two opposite laws: the law of spirit and the law of matter. The Merkaba is also been called the “divine light vehicle” allegedly used by ascended masters to connect with and reach those in tune with the higher realms, the spirit/body surrounded by counter-rotating fields of light, (wheels within wheels).</p>



<p>I understand for those of you reading this with no interest in mathematics, philosophy, the occult and religion this might all seem a bit far-fetched. But, if you look at some of the titles of his compositions (“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_(John_Coltrane_album)" target="_blank">Ascension</a>“, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ship" target="_blank">Ascent</a>“, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ship" target="_blank">Sun Ship</a>“, “Cosmos”, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_Space" target="_blank">Interstellar Space</a>“, “Spiritual”, et cetera) then is seems more then clear that music, the occult / religion and geometry / math were all connected for Coltrane. </p>



<p>More about Giant Steps you can read in the article “<a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-saxophone/coltrane-geometry/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Geometry of John Coltrane's Music (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Geometry of John Coltrane’s Music</a>“.</p>



<h4><hr><br>WHY HAVE TONES BEEN CIRCLED?</h4>



<div><p>It’s not completely clear why Coltrane circled those tones, he never made note of it. The tones that have been circled are the <span><strong>Major 7th</strong></span> or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading-tone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leading Tone</a>“, the <span><strong>Tonic</strong></span> and the <span><strong>Minor 2nd</strong></span> or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supertonic</a>” (see image below).
</p><p>
Perhaps Coltrane wanted to visualize how chromatic neighbor tones lead to adjacent neighbor tones / Tone Centers?
</p><p>
Every <span><strong>Major 7th</strong></span> (mentioned above) is the <strong>Major Third</strong> of the key (tone center) a Fifth higher (next tone center counterclockwise) as well. [suggestion by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.rossi.739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rossi</a>]</p></div>



<p>Example: the <span><strong>B</strong></span> circled along with the <span><strong>C</strong></span> (tone center) is the <strong>Major Third</strong> of <strong>G</strong> (next tone center counterclockwise in the Coltrane Circle).</p>



<p>Every <span><strong>Minor 2nd</strong></span> is also the <strong>Major Third</strong> of the <strong>parallel Major</strong> of the <strong>Relative Minor</strong> key of the by circle connected tone center. [suggestion by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.rossi.739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rossi</a>]</p>



<p>Example: the <span><strong>D♭</strong></span> circled along with the <span><strong>C</strong></span> (tone center) is the <strong>Major Third of A Major</strong>, the <strong>parallel Major key of A Minor</strong>, the <strong>relative minor key</strong> of <span><strong>C</strong></span> Major (tone center). &lt;- You might need to read that twice. 😉

<h5>DIMINISHED SCALES</h5>

</div>



<div><p>Perhaps the circled tones outline the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh_chord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diminished <span>7</span>th Chords</a> within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diminished Scale</a>? An example:</p><p>The <strong>C Diminished <span>7</span>th Chord</strong> is <strong><span>C</span> – <span>E♭</span> – <span>G♭</span> – <span>A</span>.</strong> To turn this into a Diminished scale, you need to add another Diminished <span>7</span>th Chord a semitone higher: <strong><span>D♭</span> – <span>E</span> – <span>G</span> – <span>B♭</span></strong> or lower: <strong><span>B</span> – <span>D</span> – <span>F</span> – <span>A♭</span></strong>. <strong>Results:</strong></p><p><strong><span>C</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>D♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>E♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>E</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>G♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>G</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>A</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>B♭</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>C&nbsp;<br></span></strong>&amp; &nbsp;<br><strong><span>C</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>D</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>E♭</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>F</span>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>G♭</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>A♭</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span>A</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>B</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>C</span></strong></p></div>
</div>



<p>It is commonly known that Coltrane did like using the Diminished Scale (or “<span>Double Diminished” as it was called because it is build from two Diminished <span>7</span>th Chords)</span>. An example of that is his solo in&nbsp;<span>“Moment’s Notice” (<span>in measure <span>74</span> where he plays a Bb<span>7</span> diminished scale pattern). Another example is his solo in “Epistrophy” during the&nbsp;<span>live perfomance at Carnegie Hall with Thelonious Monk.</span></span></span><br></p>



<h5>ALTERED DOMINANT (ALT DOM) CHORDS</h5>



<p>Jazz guitarist, composer and music theorist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mark.rossi.739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Rossi</a> shared another way of looking at the circled tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>An Alt Dom chord is a dominant chord (centered around the <span>5</span>th of the key) but with a minor <span>7</span>th on top (hereby creating a Dominant <span>7</span>th) and the <span>5</span>th and <span>9</span>th of the chord either lowered or raised by one half step. This in turn gives us either a <span><sup>b</sup></span><span>5</span> or a <span><sup>#</sup></span><span>5</span> instead of a natural <span>5</span> as well as a <span><sup>b</sup></span><span>9</span> and <span><sup>#</sup></span><span>9</span>. </span></p>



<p><span>When you add the <span>3</span> Diminished <span>7</span>th Chords to a table you get the following result:</span></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E<sup>b</sup></strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td><span><strong>E</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>F</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>G</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>A</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>C</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D♭</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>D</strong></span></td><td><span><strong>E♭</strong></span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h5>NATABHAIRAVI-CHARUKESI (NATURAL MINOR + MELODIC MAJOR) “COMPOUND” SCALE</h5>



<p>Corey Mwamba shared an alternative interpretation about the meaning of the circled tones, he thinks they might form what he calls a “compound scale”. This compound scale is formed my combining the “Natural Minor” scale (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natabhairavi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natabhairavi</a>) and the “Melodic Major” scale (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charukesi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charukesi</a>) a semitone lower, characteristic for North Indian music (something Coltrane developed an interest for in the <span>60</span>s (see “<a href="http://indiamusicweek.org/files/coltrane.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Coltrane and the integration of Indian concepts in Jazz improvisation</a>” by Carl Clements).</p>



<p><span><span>Corey writes: “<em>We can see that the two scales have two enharmonic points; one at the third degree of each scale, and one at the sixth. If we transliterate Natabhairavi to d<abbr title="flat">♭</abbr>&nbsp;and combine it with Charukesi mapped from c, we can see an intersection that contains&nbsp;e&nbsp;and&nbsp;a<abbr title="flat">♭</abbr></em><span><em>.

<p><span>He continues: “<em>Arranged in chromatic order, the first, fourth and seventh degrees of Natabhairavi are aligned with the degrees from Charukesi in a way that matches the segment <span>3–4</span> on the original diagram.</em>” With the “original diagram” Corey referes to the Coltrane Circle with the Pentagram drawn into it. In that version the Circle the 5 segments are numbered.</span></p>

<h6>ALL-INTERVAL TETRACHORD</h6>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://stephonalexander.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephon Alexander</a> wrote in his book “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465093574/ref=as_li_tl?tag=roelsworld-20" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jazz of Physics: The Secret Link Between Music and the Structure of the Universe</a>  that it has been argued by Australian pianist <a href="https://www.seanwayland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Wayland</a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-interval_tetrachord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Interval Tetrachord</a> can be used as a method to play through the chord changes of “Giant Steps” (see video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQGWAnYd7Iw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQGWAnYd7Iw</a> by <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Hannaford</a>).</p>



<p>An all-interval tetrachord is a tetrachord, a collection of four pitch classes, containing all six interval classes.
There are only two possible all-interval tetrachords when expressed in prime form. 
In set theory notation, these are {0146} and {0137} (their inversions: {0256} and {0467}).</p>



<p>From the Tonic C we would get: C-Db-E-Gb {0146} and C-Db-Eb-G {0137} (their inversions: C-D-F-Gb {0256} and C-E-Gb-G {0467}).
As you can see, the {<strong>0146</strong>} sets contain only tones circled on the Coltrane Circle (<strong>C-Db-E-Gb</strong>) if you follow the Circle clockwise from C.</p>



<h6>ALL-TRICHORD HEXACHORD</h6>



<p>
This though made me wonder if another “tone-series” would align better with or include more tones of the series of circled tones: the All-Trichord Hexachord.</p>







<p>The all-trichord hexachord is a unique hexachord that contains all twelve trichords, or from which all twelve possible trichords may be derived. The prime form of this set class is {<strong>012478</strong>}</p>



<p>From the Tonic C we would get: <strong>C-Db-D-E-F-Gb</strong>. All but the 2nd pitch class (D) used in this All-Trichord Hexachord are circled at the Coltrane Circle if you follow the Circle clockwise from C.</p>

<h5>WHAT DO THE NUMBERS IN THE DRAWING MEAN?</h5>



<div>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://roelsworld.eu/wp-content/uploads/John-Coltrane-Tone-Circle-Pentagram.png" alt="" title="Coltrane Circles Pentagram"></figure>
</div>



<div>
<p>“What do those numbers mean?” is a question I have received via mail several times.</p>



<p>Well, the 5 numbers outside the circle 1-5 are the easiest to explain. They mark the 5 octaves this tone circle covers.</p>



<div><p>Not per say related or intended, but 5 octaves = <b>5</b> x <b>12</b> tones = <b>60</b> tones. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes&nbsp;in an hour. </p><p>Perhaps that’s why some would refer to this circle as a “clock”.&nbsp;There is nothing in this drawing though that suggests this to be one of the&nbsp;reasons for the design of this circle.</p></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Inside the circle you notice a sequence of numbers 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 and&nbsp;reversed 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, apparently showing you the chromatic (semitone) relationship between the tones listed in both inner and outer ring when combined in one. The 1’s (C) and 7’s (F#) are a Tritone (six “spaces” between the lines) apart from each other. This might suggest a so called “<strong>Tritone Substitution</strong>“.</p>



<p>A Tritone substitution is one of the most common <a title="Chord substitution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_substitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chord substitutions</a> used in Jazz and is the foundation for&nbsp;more complex substitution patterns like <a title="Coltrane changes" href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/blog-saxophone/Coltrane-Geometry/">Coltrane changes</a>. Other examples of the tritone substitution (known in the classical world as an <a title="Augmented sixth chord" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_sixth_chord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">augmented sixth chord</a>)&nbsp;can be found in classical music since the <a title="Renaissance music" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renaissance</a> period.&nbsp;The Tritone substitution can be performed by exchanging a dominant seven chord for another dominant seven chord which is a Tritone away from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Coltrane Circle you see a sequence from 1-7 starting from C (top of the Circle) to&nbsp;F# both clockwise and counterclockwise. Could that suggest a substitution of C<sup>7</sup> by&nbsp;F#<sup>7</sup>?</p>



<p>If you have another (perhaps better) idea about this sequence, please do <a href="https://roelsworld.eu/en/contact-social-media/">contact me</a>.</p>







<h4>FLOWER OF LIFE (61)</h4>



<p>As mentioned above, the Coltrane Circle covers 5 octaves = <strong>5</strong> x <strong>12</strong> tones = <strong>60</strong> tones within <strong>1</strong> circle. That number reminded met of (an extended version of) the Flower of Life, that contains <strong>60</strong> circles drawn around/over <strong>1</strong> circle in the center (61 in total). </p>



<p>The Flower of Life is a geometric pattern grid of&nbsp;repeating, overlapping&nbsp;circles&nbsp;of an equal&nbsp;radius&nbsp;in&nbsp;two-dimensional space. Commonly, designs are based on circles centered on&nbsp;triangles&nbsp;(with the simple, two circle form named&nbsp;<em>vesica piscis</em>) or on the&nbsp;square lattice&nbsp;pattern of points. The&nbsp;Flower Of Life symbol&nbsp;is one of the most known and recognized&nbsp;geometric&nbsp;Sacred&nbsp;Geometry symbols. This special symbol represents the cycle of life. It visualizes that all consciousness arises from one source (the first, center circle). The <strong>5</strong> platonic solids are found within Flower Of Life, as well as many others including the Seed Of Life, Tree Of Life, and Metatron’s Cube just to name a few. These shapes act as building blocks for all living things, starting with the very first circle. There are many variations of the Flower Of Life, some having as little as only seven circles. </p>



<p>When you place the Flower of Life over the Coltrane Circle you can see the fit nicely together. The outer circles and crossings of circles align with the trigons C-E-Ab &amp; D-Db-Gb, als well as with the trigons G-B-Eb &amp; F-A-Db, <strong>12</strong> tones that together form 2 Hexagons.</p>











<p>Perhaps it is “coincidence” that the <strong>60</strong> around <strong>1</strong> circle (61 circles) <strong>Flower of Life</strong> aligns with Coltrane’s tone circle with <strong>5</strong> x <strong>12</strong> = <strong>60</strong> tones within <strong>1</strong> circle (61 circles), but as mentioned before, Coltrane’s interest in mathematics, philosophy and the occult might have played a role here too … perhaps not, we will never know for sure. </p>



<p>Another funny coincidence is that Coltrane drew his tone circle in 19<strong>61</strong> as mentioned earlier in this article.</p>

<h4>JOHN COLTRANE’S MUSIC &amp; GEOMETRY</h4>



<p>If you find this article interesting, you might like to read the Roel’s World article “<strong><a href="https://roelhollander.eu/en/blog-saxophone/Coltrane-Geometry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Coltrane’s Music &amp; Geometry</a></strong>” as well. In this article I write a bit more about the relationship between Coltrane’s music and it’s mathematical / geometrical interpretation.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>To finish this article with I like to share a “music video” of Coltrane’s piece “11383” with the Coltrane Tone Circle used as base/inspiration for the visualization. Note: the visualization of the Coltrane Circle does not accurately follows the music – as becomes obvious later on in the video – but is nonetheless a nice ‘work of art’.</p>

<p>A new MIT study titled, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872" rel="noopener">Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task</a>,</strong> has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed <strong>weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership</strong> <strong>over their own writing</strong>. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.</p>

<p>The findings are clear: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Grok don’t just help students write—they train the brain to disengage. Here’s what the researchers found:</p>

<h4><strong>Brain Connectivity Declines with AI Use</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EEG scans revealed a systematic scaling down of neural connectivity in the brain with increasing reliance on external tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brain-only group:</strong> strongest, most widespread connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search Engine group:</strong> intermediate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LLM group:</strong> weakest connectivity across alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLM use resulted in under-engagement of critical attention and visual processing networks, especially in Session 4 when participants tried to write without AI.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>LLM Users Forget What They Just Wrote</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In post-task interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>83.3% of LLM users were unable to quote even one sentence from the essay they had just written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In contrast, 88.9% of Search and Brain-only users <em>could</em> quote accurately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>0% of LLM users could produce a <em>correct quote</em>, while most Brain-only and Search users could.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AI Use Disrupts Memory and Learning Pathways</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participants previously using LLMs (then writing without it in Session 4) showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Weaker memory recall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower alpha and beta neural engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signs of <em>cognitive adaptation</em> toward passivity and “efficiency” at the cost of effortful learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>LLM Users Felt Detached From Their Work</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When asked about authorship:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LLM users gave responses like “50/50” or “70% mine.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some claimed no ownership at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain-only group participants almost universally reported full ownership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Switching from LLM to Brain Use Doesn’t Fully Restore Function</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Session 4: LLM-to-Brain participants showed lingering cognitive deficiency, failing to return to their original (Session 1) brain activity patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their neural activity remained below baseline, even after AI use was stopped.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Search Engine Users Showed Healthier Brain Engagement</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search users maintained stronger executive function, memory activation, and quote recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EEG data showed more robust occipital and parietal activation supporting visual processing and cognitive effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>AI Dependency Leads to “Cognitive Offloading”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Researchers noted a trend toward neural efficiency adaptation: the brain essentially “lets go” of the effort required for synthesis and memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This adaptation led to passivity, minimal editing, and low integration of concepts.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Cognitive Debt</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite receiving decent scores from judges, the LLM group’s writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lacked strategic integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used fewer diverse structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was shorter and more robotic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, the group showed a <strong>consistent decline in engagement, performance, and self-reported satisfaction</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this study, as more of the global population begins to rely on artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks, our cognitive abilities and creative capacities appear poised to take a nosedive into oblivion.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: if you currently use AI, take regular breaks—and give your own mind the chance to do the work. Otherwise, you may face severe cognitive harm and dependence.</p>
<p>The machines aren’t just taking over our work—they’re taking over our minds.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h3><a id="user-content-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Architecture" href="#architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Voyager consists of two key components:</p>
<p dir="auto">(1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence.</p>
<p dir="auto">(2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency.</p>
<p dir="auto">To train Voyager, we propose a scalable data engine, i.e., a video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Using this pipeline, we compile a dataset of over 100,000 video clips, combining real-world captures and synthetic Unreal Engine renders.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT">xDiT</a> is a Scalable Inference Engine for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) on multi-GPU Clusters.
It has successfully provided low-latency parallel inference solutions for a variety of DiTs models, including mochi-1, CogVideoX, Flux.1, SD3, etc. This repo adopted the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07719" rel="nofollow">Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP)</a> APIs for parallel inference of the HunyuanVideo-I2V model.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to generate a video with 8 GPUs, you can use the following command:</p>

      <p>
        VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating <b>expressive, long-form, multi-speaker </b>conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.
A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.
The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

                <p>In April 2009, a Sega fan decided to look into emulating the Mega LD, a quirky and little-known hybrid of Genesis and LaserDisc. This week he finished the job.</p>

            <p>Hey there <em><strong>ROM</strong></em> readers! I've got an absolute whopper of a story this issue with a genuine longform dive into the emulation of the LaserActive, <em>plus</em> a bit of backstory on the new fan translation of the Cowboy Bebop game for PS2, <em>plus</em> your usual quick hits on emulator improvements, FPGA happenings and other fan translation progress. That means there's absolutely no more time or space to waste on this intro.</p><p>LET'S GET TO IT.</p><hr><h2 id="the-big-two">The Big Two</h2><h3 id="1-the-laseractive-might-be-the-last-vintage-home-console-of-note-which-hadnt-been-emulated-but-no-longer">1. The LaserActive "might be the last vintage home console of note which hadn't been emulated," but no longer</h3><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg" alt="Ad scan via @VGArtAndTidbits" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="400" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/pioneer-laseractive-header.jpg 2372w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The story behind the birth of any new emulator has some common ingredients. Fearsome programming skills; hundreds or thousands of hours of thankless work; the drive to understand <em>exactly</em> how and why a piece of technology works. None of these things come without patience. But lifelong Sega fan Nemesis, who released <a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">the first-ever emulator</a> for the Pioneer LaserActive this week — 16 <em>years </em>after first pondering the idea — had no choice but to be patient. Because for most of the last decade, emulating the LaserActive was simply impossible.</p><p>"All along the way, the video made things difficult," he says. "The hardware to capture the signal properly didn’t exist. The software to decode the captured signal properly didn’t exist. And finally, a format to store the decoded video in a form suitable for emulation, also didn’t exist."</p><p>There's no other game console quite like the Pioneer LaserActive, which was released in 1993, sold abysmally and was dead in the ground by 1996. That's not a unique story for a '90s game system, but the LaserActive kinda... wasn't one. It was a LaserDisc player with an expansion bay that owners could slot different modules into. One transformed the LaserActive into a karaoke machine. Another would give it the guts of a PC Engine. And a third added the brains of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, able to play Sega CD games as well as about two dozen made for the short-lived Mega LD.</p><p>The Mega LD format represented a technological leap over early LaserDisc-based arcade games like Dragon's Lair. The mid-'90s promise of FULL MOTION VIDEO GAMEPLAY may be quaint as hell today, but it's the reason the LaserActive has been impossible to emulate for 30 years. And it still would be today, if Nemesis hadn't spent much of the 21st century proactively collecting Sega hardware and Mega LD games with the goal of one day preserving them. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQvkTN3Vvlc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The LaserActive: Wonders of the Retro Gaming World"></iframe></figure><p>Nemesis's history with both games and emulation started with the Genesis (which I will refer to as the Mega Drive for the rest of this issue, out of respect for his native Australia). After owning a Mega Drive, 32X and Mega CD growing up, he played his first emulator, the Nesticle successor Genecyst, on a Pentium 133 circa 1997. That eventually led to contributing to reverse-engineering and emulation efforts.</p><p>"I did a lot of work on the YM2612 FM chip in the Mega Drive back in 2008 in particular, and a lot of Mega Drive emulators finally had decent FM sound after that as a result," he says. "Sharing that research, seeing the results made use of, and finally hearing the games I remembered from my childhood sound right for the first time, was a really good feeling."</p><p>In 2004, when buying loads of retro consoles was not yet a universal pasttime for nostalgic millenials and Gen Xers, he paid about $200 for one of the approximately 10,000 LaserActives that Pioneer manufactured in its short life, along with the Mega LD "PAC" module. Throughout the rest of the decade he scooped up every bit of Sega hardware he could get his hands on with an eye towards future reverse-engineering projects, but it wasn't until 2009 when he started thinking: <em>Why isn't there an emulator for the LaserActive?</em></p><p>So he did what any retro game fan would do in 2009: started a forum thread about it.</p><p>"This system keeps popping into my mind," he wrote in the thread, which is <a href="https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=563&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">still online today</a>. "I don't think anyone's had a serious crack at emulating it yet, and I really don't think it would be very hard to do."</p><p>Well. About that.</p><p>"I honestly feel like I've nearly 'solved' this system half a dozen times over by now," Nemesis says here in 2025.</p><p>"The <em>digital</em> side of the system was actually pretty straightforward. When you break it down, the LaserActive is really more like a big oversized add-on to the console hardware. What that add-on provides is a different drive control interface, another audio source, and another video source, with mixing features to combine that video/audio with the console video/audio. That's really about it. On paper, it's pretty simple. In reality though, the LaserActive hardware did present a lot of challenges, mostly due to its inherent unreliability."</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg" width="1800" height="2400" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-2.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg" width="2000" height="2667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-6.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>1:</strong></b><span> "Some of the internal mods to the player.

But the problem started to pile up immediately. First there were the almost 100 capacitors in the Sega PAC that were guaranteed to fail at some point, causing many to have to be replaced on even a mint condition system. Pioneer's cost-cutting inside the LaserDisc player caused other parts to break, too. Learning to fix the LaserActive was a necessary step to figuring out how it worked.</p><p>2011 was a year of progress. Nemesis: </p><ul><li>Coded a program to load onto a Mega Drive flash cart that allowed him to "probe" the LaserActive hardware</li><li>Disassembled the system BIOS to identify that "ll the interaction with the LaserActive hardware happened over a custom register block"</li><li>Coded another program that allowed direct read/write access to those registers using a controller</li><li>With the help of other forumites, mapped most of the registers by comparing the system's actions to the code in the disassembldd BIOS and documented what it was doing</li></ul><p>The next two years were focused on figuring out how to rip the LaserActive's games. This involved writing multiple more custom programs and using a special <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521053653/http://krikzz.com/link-unit.html" rel="noreferrer">USB-to-MD link cable</a> to copy the digital data from the disc, which contained the game code as well as audio tracks. When that didn't prove to be enough to capture the TOC (or table of contents) data that essentially acted as a guide to how all the data on the disc was organized, he had to go deeper.</p><p>"I soldered a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and used a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines when the TOC region was being read, which the hardware didn't make directly available. I wrote a program to parse the bus trace and extract the data from the raw capture and reconstruct the lead-in. At this point, I had everything I needed to rip a full bin/cue image of the digital data from a LaserDisc."</p><p>In 2014, Nemesis started soliciting other members of the forum where he chronicled the project to send him Mega LD games to dump (shout out to doc eggfan, who acquired most of the library including two Myst prototypes; "if he hadn't done that, there's a good chance they would have been lost forever). With a pile of games in hand, he bought a PC video capture card to rip the audio and video from the discs. And this is where the 2-3 people reading this who have an intimate understanding of the LaserActive will probably reflexively say "uh oh."</p><p>LaserDisc, despite looking like a jumbo DVD, is an analog video medium. No big deal if you're just capturing a movie. But for a <em>game</em>? Big big deal. Here's the long-form breakdown — skip ahead if you don't want to get <em>way</em> deep into analog-to-digital misery.</p><blockquote>"No analog capture cards of the day were actually up to the task of what we were trying to do. ... The LaserActive has one of the fastest, most powerful control systems for LaserDisc playback ever made, and the game has direct, immediate control over it. Rarely is the player just playing back a video normally. Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback. The unit can play faster or slower, even playing in reverse, such as in Rocket Coaster as you speed up, or slide backwards down a slope. The unit can perform rapid nearly instant seeks with seamless looping, and does for games like Myst. In fact, the entire Myst title is basically using the LaserDisc as a set of random, short transitions, and still images, and other titles do this as well to differing degrees. ...<p>Games used the skip play features to further interleave different video streams at half the framerate between each other. Analog capture cards of the day didn't deal with this well. None of them could compress lossless video, everything was encoded to lossy formats. Most of them would assume a 480i image. This would cause the separate video streams in each field to 'bleed into' each other, destroying the image. The same problem occurred between frames when they had separate video streams interleaved together, where inter-frame compression would cause artifacts from the two streams to bleed together.</p><p>A high end Canopus capture card I had was the only one that was capable of compressing into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffyuv?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">huffyuv</a>, not in a lossless form, but at least in a format that prevented this bleeding problem. Unfortunately, this card still had a limitation, in that it couldn't capture the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">VBI</a> data. It was common in the day for special 'control codes' to be encoded into lines normally hidden on a normal TV, which contained information. In the case of LaserDiscs, it contained frame numbers, timecodes, picture stop codes, video TOC information in the lead-in, and other such data. None of that could be captured by capture cards of the day. For cards that had VBI capture features, they didn't work on LaserDiscs, since LaserDiscs used different lines/formats than other sources, and no capture cards in the world expected to be capturing LaserDisc video.</p><p>At this point, I felt like I'd hit a bit of a dead end. It could, perhaps, have been possible to cobble something together at this point in 2014, but I felt the result would be poor, and the discs would not have been properly preserved. I decided a different approach was needed for the analog video content, but the technology to do what I needed to do at this point, didn't seem to exist."</p></blockquote><p>With an increasingly busy home life thanks to two young kids, a long commute and demanding workload at the office, Nemesis did the only thing that made sense at that point. He put the LaserActive on the shelf.</p><p>Two years later, he took another stab at it by trying to build his own hardware capture setup. By tapping into the LaserActive directly, he was able to capture a full, raw composite video signal — but it was useless unless he could decode it. Back on the shelf it went for another two years.</p><p>A house move, shorter commute and more balanced work-life, er, balance, later, Nemesis decided to dust off the LaserActive. Enter the Domesday Duplicator — an open source, community-driven hardware project dedicated to ripping LaserDiscs.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDlbwl3f39Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Domesday Duplicator - Ultimate LaserDisc Preservation"></iframe></figure><p><em>Surely</em> this was the capture solution he'd been waiting for. Turns out it was... but not in 2018. A key companion to the Domesday Duplicator, <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/playdate-crankboy-emulator-interview/" rel="noreferrer">ld-decode</a>, was then still "in its infancy." At the time there was no publicly available software solution to decoding composite video; by the time computers were fast enough to do it without dedicated hardware, analog was donezo. Nemesis went down the path of trying to write his own decoder to mixed results, but when he found out kid #4 was on the way, he decided to wait for the broader community effort to mature.</p><p>And it did mature by a <em>lot, </em>with both the Duplicator and ld-decode improving process of ripping LaserDiscs in the higest possible quality. But there was still a problem when it came to LaserActive discs — they were interactive games, not static films. In 2020 Nemesis started chipping in to ld-decode:</p><blockquote>"I started pushing for the need to add extra features into the decode process. Until then, focus had been entirely around the requirements of capturing movies on LaserDiscs, as you'd expect. LaserActive games needed more though. I needed a way to capture the full lead-in, which stored the TOC data for both the analog video and the digital data. If you're just ripping a LaserDisc to an mp4, you don't need this info, but we do for emulation. I also needed the full 525 lines of NTSC video, with VBI data. That was stripped by ld-decode, they just cared about the visible region you'd see on a TV. I needed to deal with mixed-mode 'CD' images in the digital data track. They just needed audio tracks to work. I needed to be able to play through picture stop codes seamlessly without corrupting the audio data, they didn't need to worry about that. All kinds of things like this added up, to mean that ld-decode increasingly worked great for regular LaserDiscs, but still wasn't checking all the boxes for LaserActive games."</blockquote><p>Before he could fully commit to adding those features himself, COVID upended everything and the LaserActive went back into storage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w2400/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"This is from 2019, showing the old digital ripping process where I stream the data over the second control port."</span></figcaption></figure><p>2024: 15 years after he'd first suggested emulating the LaserActive didn't seem like it'd be <em>that</em> tricky, set up in a new house with a new workspace, Nemesis finally vowed to finish what he'd started.</p><p>It was a year of whirlwind activity: </p><ul><li>Using the LaserActive's test mode and a custom firmware mod he developed to properly capture the lead-in and lead-out from every disc</li><li>Rewriting the flaky USB capture code for the Domesday Duplicator's capture program to ensure error-free rips</li><li>Expanding the program's capabilities to record more data about the disc itself, the player, and the signal quality</li><li>Rewriting ld-decode's digital audio decoding, which had issues with drifting out of sync with the video, and finally making it possible to parse the TOC data</li><li>Improving the video decoding to output full frame data, with all 525 lines of NTSC video and the VBI data</li></ul><p>"With all these bits in place, I was now able to rip discs and extract the actual contents in a form suitable for emulation," Nemesis says. 2024 ticked over to 2025, and he began removing LaserActive games from the sleeves they'd rested within for decades undisturbed. Most of them had been bought new and never opened; for years he'd resisted the urge, not wanting to risk even a tiny accidental scratch until everything was ready.</p><p>After so many years and so many obstacles, the final mile was, at long last, an easy run:</p><blockquote>"Most of the work reverse engineering the hardware I'd already done and published notes on over 13 years prior. I sat down and implemented the emulation code according to my notes, double checking things on the hardware as I went using the same testing program I'd written all those years ago, and filling the gaps in my notes for parts I hadn't fully mapped out. Space Berserker was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues. Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work. A few games flushed out some things I'd missed here and there, but mostly it was just fixing bugs in my implementation, until after a few weeks, everything was fully working in the emulator, just the same way it did on the hardware."</blockquote><p>Nemesis decided to write his LaserActive emulation as a component of multi-system emualtor Ares, partially out of respect for its late creator, Near. Its existing Mega Drive support made for an easy starting point, and current Ares maintainer Luke Usher had actually done some ground work to support the Mega LD in the future by creating a "skeleton" that defined it in relation to the Mega Drive and CD.</p><p>"It was all sitting there, just needed the actual code to be written to emulate the LaserActive hardware," Nemesis says. "I'd never touched the Ares code before, but having this delivered to me is what allowed me to get the basics of drive control to have Mega CD games booting in days, from work over a few evenings. Without that, there's a good chance I wouldn't have started when I did."</p><p>There's one final wrinkle to LaserActive emulation, and that's the disc image files themselves. Basically, they're huge, in the dozens of gigabytes range. And that, again, is because the way LaserActive games utvi makes them allergic to compression. They may want to jump to specific frames in an instant, play backwards, or interleave frames, all of which means a specific moment in time needs to be a keyframe, not a compressed, modified frame that only contains the small amount of data that's changed from the frame before it, which is how video files are greatly reduced in size. You could still compress a LaserActive game to about 10GB per size with every frame preserved as a keyframe...</p><p>"That still isn’t suitable though, as heavyweight video codecs are too intensive to decode alongside emulating an entire Mega Drive + MegaCD in realtime without involving hardware decoding," Nemesis says. "In order to keep everything running at 60fps, you have to be able to do everything in under 16ms per frame. Using hardware decoding would take decoding burden off the CPU, but the video mixing with the graphics output from the Mega Drive now becomes more complex, and you also now place specific GPU requirements on any system that’s going to try and play these games."</p><p>So they stuck to a lossless format that preserves quality and takes the pressure off the CPU (and puts none at all on a graphics card). Any system that can currently run Ares should have no trouble with the LaserActive, with the caveat that you'll definitely want to have these mondo files on an SSD rather than an old spinning platter to avoid any issues with read speeds.</p><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="910" height="525" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2025/08/nemesis-laseractive-3-1.png 910w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"This is a fully decoded single frame of video from one of the Myst prototypes. Normally for NTSC video, you'd expect two 'fields' each with half the lines of the full frame, which get interleaved together to make the whole image.

And it represents a milestone in game preservation that could've easily been missed — due to indifference, the literal string of inventions it took to make it a reality, or the inexorable march of time. </p><p>"There are other titles I don’t have access to at all, however I’m in discussions with a number of people who have offered to loan discs to help complete the dumping efforts," Nemesis says. "It’s been great to see people step up and offer to help. It’s vital this is done now, because Laserdisc titles don’t last forever. I have one disc in my possession that was a new, sealed copy, pressed in 1994, which is suffering from laser-rot. It’s likely that eventually, all Laserdiscs will be rendered unplayable, so we need to ensure these games are preserved now, while we still can."</p><p>He's now looking into the prospect of preserving the PC Engine PAC, which will — fingers crossed — not be too much more complicated than plugging Ares' existing PC Engine CD code into the new LaserActive code. But that's a story for another day. </p><p>For now, the emulation code being out in the wild represents <em>relief</em> most of all. "It was a long journey, with a lot of false starts and wrong turns getting to that point," Nemesis says. "A lot of it was work and time which nobody else had been able to see. I don't keep a blog. I don't tend to share the various steps I take to make something or get something working, I only tend to reach out when I have something to share or when I'm asking for help from other people.</p><p>"A lot of my time and energy had gone into this system over the years, and it was good to finally be able to show something for all that work."</p><div><p>💸</p><p><i><em>If you enjoy </em></i><i><b><strong>ROM</strong></b></i><i><em>, I'd love it if you'd consider </em></i><a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/#/portal/support"><i><b><strong>a small tip</strong></b></i></a><i><em> to help me cover my monthly costs.

The breakthrough "not every anime is Dragon Ball Z" series was a huge hit on Cartoon Network, channeled the American jazz of Art Blakey, and even saw a then-rare theatrical run for its movie spin-off. But neither its PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games ever made it out of Japan.</p><p><em>*Hard bop drum roll</em>*</p><p>...Until now! I'm delighted that translator Sonicman69, along with an anonymous hacker, has brought the PS2 beat 'em up <a href="https://github.com/SONICMAN69/Bebop-PS2-English?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade to English players</a> to celebrate the game's 20th anniversary. Regular <strong><em>ROM</em></strong> readers may remember Sonicman69's translation of a Detective Conan PlayStation 2 game <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/turns-out-a-lot-of-stuff-happened-20-30-years-ago-the-accidental-anniversary-issue/" rel="noreferrer">featured last year</a>, both prime examples of a period when games based on popular anime were still far from a sure thing localization-wise.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJbmZnN3Sdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Cowboy Bebop PS2 English Patch Launch"></iframe></figure><p>Well, for Conan that may unfortunately still be the case, as I don't know if the boy-sized genius has ever really <em>made it</em> in America. But I'm pretty sure a Cowboy Bebop game released in 2025 would be targeting English-speaking audiences even before Japanese ones. As I theorized <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/exactly-20-years-after-it-was-released-exclusively-in-japan-the-cowboy-bebop-ps2-game-is-now-playable-in-english/?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">earlier this week on PC Gamer</a>, Tsuioku no Serenade's developer Bandai merging with Namco right around the time this game was being released may be the culprit — the ensuing corporate chaos of layoffs and reorganizations could easily have killed it in the cradle.</p><p>I haven't had a chance to play Tsuioku no Serenade myself despite being lucky enough to track down a (seemingly somewhat rare, now) copy, but general consensus is it's an <em>okay</em> brawler but quite a nice little Bebop sidestory with some handsome late-era PS2 graphics. And there's original Yoko Kanno music, so, like, what else do you really want?</p><p>I reached out to translator Sonicman69 for a bit of insight into the translation effort, who first watched Bebop around 2014 and learned later that the game had never been released in English. "From that exact moment I felt like I could be the one to do it," he said. "Keep in mind at this time I knew maybe three words in Japanese and was still in high school. Big expectations. I figured someone else would get around to it eventually."</p><p>But they didn't, so after off-and-on attempts to learn Japanese and gaining some translation and editing experience contributing to the Conan patch, he set sights on Bebop with the aim of finishing the patch by the game's 20th anniversary:</p><blockquote>I'd say the most challenging thing that people don't really think about is how often text would be reused at different points in the game. Trying to figure out a translation for a sentence that works in one context that also has to work in another — Conan had this a little bit but it was a lot more annoying with Bebop and frankly I don't think I nailed it. Aside from that the interstitials between scenes are poetic and I'm still a Japanese novice and have no poetic ability at all so I had a tough time at those and I think they came out kind of bad.<p>I am admittedly a little apologetic about the quality of the translation, I've received unanimous praise so far but I know I could have done better if I studied more but if I didn't translate the game now it would have never happened at all. What I'm most proud of aside from the fact we actually got it done and released it in time for the 20th anniversary? People keep telling me I did a good job writing the lines for the characters in a way that stays true to how they talked in the English dub of the show. I'm hesitant to accept that since I'm pretty critical of it myself but if I really was able to capture the characters then I did my job."</p></blockquote><p>Sonicman69 also argues that the game is "not a simple button mashing beat 'em up due to how deep the combat actually is," but some annoying tutorials and the language barrier made it easy to write off. Take it from the person who's beaten it a dozen times: it's worth playing. "As far as how well the story captures the vibe of the show I think they did a pretty admirable job, but obviously it's never going to get anywhere near the best scenes from the show. Any Bebop fan who wishes there was just a little bit more to chew on should at least enjoy the game a little bit. Especially the bonus mode you unlock after completing the game on normal but I don't want to spoil too much."</p><p>You can find the English patch <a href="https://github.com/SONICMAN69/Bebop-PS2-English?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">on Github</a> and throw a few bucks to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/sonicman69?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">Sonicman69 on Ko-fi</a> if you appreciate getting to spend a little more time in the Bebopverse after all these years.</p><hr><h2 id="patching-in">Patching In</h2><figure><img src="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="200" srcset="https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 600w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 1000w, https://www.readonlymemo.com/content/images/2024/01/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fac94fc02-b2d1-4e35-b730-79de780d09d7_1200x200.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/13142?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Sometimes emudev is all about fixing a texture issue in Colin McRae Rally 2005</strong></a> – I always try to look into random Github commits with names I don't understand to see what they're all about, and sometimes PCSX2 being update to "Handle texture shuffle with pixel reversals" is just about adding some code to ignore when a game is flipping pixels horizontally and then flipping them back again because it screwed things up.

<p>The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations and inadequate access controls. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying publicly exposed LLM servers, focusing on instances running the Ollama framework. Utilizing Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, we developed a Python-based tool to detect unsecured LLM endpoints. Our study uncovered over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. These findings highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring.</p>

<p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications has surged in recent years, driven by their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Widely adopted platforms such as ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have contributed to the mainstream visibility of LLMs, while open-source frameworks like Ollama and Hugging Face have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for deploying these models in custom environments. This has led to widespread adoption by both organizations and individuals of a broad range of tasks, including content generation, customer support, data analysis, and software development.</p>



<p>Despite their growing utility, the pace of LLM adoption has often outstripped the development and implementation of appropriate security practices. Many self-hosted or locally deployed LLM solutions are brought online without adequate hardening, frequently exposing endpoints due to default configurations, weak or absent authentication, and insufficient network isolation. These vulnerabilities are not only a byproduct of poor deployment hygiene but are also symptomatic of an ecosystem that has largely prioritized accessibility and performance over security. As a result, improperly secured LLM instances present an expanding attack surface, opening the door to risks such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unauthorized API Access</strong> — Many ML servers operate without authentication, allowing anyone to submit queries.</li>



<li><strong>Model Extraction Attacks</strong> — Attackers can reconstruct model parameters by querying an exposed ML server repeatedly.</li>



<li><strong>Jailbreaking and Content Abuse</strong> — LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral can by manipulated to generate restricted content, including misinformation, malware code, or harmful outputs.</li>



<li><strong>Resource Hijacking (ML DoS Attacks)</strong> — Open AI models can be exploited for free computation, leading to excessive costs for the host.</li>



<li><strong>Backdoor Injection and Model Poisoning</strong> — Adversaries could exploit unsecured model endpoints to introduce malicious payloads or load untrusted models remotely.</li>
</ul>



<p>This work investigates the prevalence and security posture of publicly accessible LLM servers, with a focus on instances utilizing the Ollama framework, which has gained popularity for its ease of use and local deployment capabilities. While Ollama enables flexible experimentation and local model execution, its deployment defaults and documentation do not explicitly emphasize security best practices, making it a compelling target for analysis.</p>



<p>To assess the real-world implications of these concerns, we leverage the Shodan search engine to identify exposed Ollama servers and evaluate their security configurations. Our investigation is guided by three primary contributions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Development of a proof-of-concept tool, written in Python, to detect exposed Ollama servers through Shodan queries</li>



<li>Analysis of identified instances evaluate authentication enforcement, endpoint exposure, and model accessibility</li>



<li>Recommendations for mitigating common vulnerabilities in LLM deployments, with a focus on practical security improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>Our findings reveal that a significant number of organizations and individuals expose their LLM infrastructure to the internet, often without realizing the implications. This creates avenues for misuse, ranging from resource exploitation to malicious prompt injection and data inference.</p>



<h2 id="h-methodology">Methodology</h2>



<p>The proposed system utilizes Shodan, a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices, to identify potentially vulnerable AI inference servers. This approach was selected with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, specifically to avoid the risks associated with directly scanning remote systems that may already be exposed or improperly secured. By relying on Shodan’s existing database of indexed endpoints, the system circumvents the need for active probing, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering intrusion detection systems or violating acceptable use policies.</p>



<p>In addition to being more ethical, leveraging Shodan also provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for identifying LLM deployments accessible over the public internet. Manual enumeration or brute-force scanning of IP address ranges would be significantly more resource-intensive and potentially problematic from both legal and operational perspectives.</p>



<p>The system operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, Shodan is queried to identify publicly accessible Ollama servers based on distinctive network signatures or banners. In the second stage, each identified endpoint is programmatically queried to assess its security posture, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes evaluating whether endpoints require credentials, enforce access control, or expose model metadata and functionality without restriction.</p>



<p>An overview of the system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which outlines the workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability analysis.</p>

<p>Our approach focuses on identifying deployments of popular LLM hosting tools by scanning for default ports and service banners associated with each implementation. Below we provide a list of LLM platforms examined and their associated default ports, which are used as heuristics for identification:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA models — Port 11434</li>



<li>vLLM — Port 8000</li>



<li>llama.cpp — Ports 8000, 8080</li>



<li>LM Studio — Port 1234</li>



<li>GPT4All — Port 4891</li>



<li>LangChain — Port 8000</li>
</ul>



<p>Using the Shodan API, the system retrieves metadata for hosts operating on these ports, including IP addresses, open ports, HTTP headers, and service banners. To minimize false positives, such as unrelated applications using the same ports, the developed system performs an additional filtering step based on banner content. For example, Ollama instances are verified using keyword matching against the service banner (e.g., port:11434 “Ollama”), which increases confidence that the endpoint is associated with the targeted LLM tooling rather than an unrelated application using the same port.</p>



<p>During analysis, we identified an additional signature that enhanced the accuracy of fingerprinting Ollama deployments. Specifically, a significant proportion of the discovered Ollama instances were found to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server, a lightweight, Python-based web server commonly employed for serving asynchronous APIs. In such cases, the HTTP response headers included the field Server: “uvicorn”, which functioned as a valuable secondary indicator, particularly when the service banner lacked an explicit reference to the Ollama platform. Conversely, our research also indicates that servers running Uvicorn are more likely to host LLM applications as this Python-based web server appears to be popular among software used for self-hosting LLMs.</p>



<p>This observation strengthens the resilience of our detection methodology by enabling the inference of Ollama deployments even in the absence of direct product identifiers. Given Uvicorn’s widespread use in Python-based microservice architectures and AI inference backends, its presence, especially when correlated with known Ollama-specific ports (e.g., 11434) substantially increases the confidence level that a host is serving an LLM-related application. A layered fingerprinting approach improves the precision of our system and reduces reliance on single-point identifiers that may be obfuscated or omitted.</p>



<p>The banner-based fingerprinting method draws from established principles in network reconnaissance and is a widely accepted approach in both academic research and penetration testing contexts. According to prior work in internet-wide scanning, service banners and default ports provide a reliable mechanism for characterizing software deployments at scale, albeit with limitations in environments employing obfuscation or non-standard configurations.</p>



<p>By combining port-based filtering with banner analysis and keyword validation, our system aims to strike a balance between recall and precision in identifying genuinely exposed LLM servers, thus enabling accurate and responsible vulnerability assessment.</p>

<p>Once a potentially vulnerable Ollama server is identified, we initiate a series of automated API queries to determine whether access controls are in place and whether the server responds deterministically to standardized test inputs. This evaluation specifically assesses the presence or absence of authentication enforcement and the model’s responsiveness to benign prompt injections, thereby providing insight into the system’s exposure to unauthorized use. To minimize operational risk and ensure ethical testing standards, we employ a minimal, non-invasive prompt structure as follows:</p>



<p>A successful HTTP 200 response accompanied by the correct result (e.g., “4”) indicates that the server is accepting and executing prompts without requiring authentication. This represents a high-severity security issue, as it suggests that arbitrary, unauthenticated prompt execution is possible. In such cases, the system is exposed to a broad range of attack vectors, including the deployment and execution of unauthorized models, prompt injection attacks, and the deletion or modification of existing assets.</p>



<p>Moreover, unprotected endpoints may be subjected to automated fuzzing or adversarial testing using tools such as Promptfoo or Garak, which are designed to probe LLMs for unexpected behavior or latent vulnerabilities. These tools, when directed at unsecured instances, can systematically uncover unsafe model responses, prompt leakage, or unintended completions that may compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system.</p>



<p>Conversely, HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) denote that access controls are at least partially enforced, often through default authentication mechanisms. While such configurations do not guarantee full protection, particularly against brute-force or misconfiguration exploits, they substantially reduce the immediate risk of casual or opportunistic exploitation. Nonetheless, even authenticated instances require scrutiny to ensure proper isolation, rate limiting, and audit logging, as part of a comprehensive security posture.</p>



<h2 id="h-findings">Findings</h2>



<p>The results from our scans confirmed the initial hypothesis: a significant number of Ollama servers are publicly exposed and vulnerable to unauthorized prompt injection. Utilizing an automated scanning tool in conjunction with Shodan, we identified 1,139 vulnerable Ollama instances. Notably, the discovery rate was highest in the initial phase of scanning, with over 1,000 instances detected within the first 10 minutes, highlighting the widespread and largely unmitigated nature of this exposure.</p>



<p>Geospatial analysis of the identified servers revealed a concentration of vulnerabilities in several major regions. As depicted in Figure 3, the majority of exposed servers were hosted in the United States (36.6%), followed by China (22.5%) and Germany (8.9%). To protect the integrity and privacy of affected entities, IP addresses have been redacted in all visual documentation of the findings.</p>






<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1640" height="1062" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/2025/09/tool_findings_exposed_llm_server.webp" alt="Tool findings on expose LLM Server analysis" data-old-src="//blogs.cisco.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/2025/09/tool_findings_exposed_llm_server.webp"><figcaption>Fig. 3: Tool findings on exposed LLM Server Analysis</figcaption></figure></div>






<p>Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. A review of the least common model names was also conducted, revealing what appeared to be primarily self-trained or otherwise customized LLMs. In some instances, the names alone provided enough information to identify the hosting party. To safeguard their privacy, tha names of these models have been excluded from the findings. These interactions confirm the feasibility of prompt-based interaction without authentication, and thus the risk of exploitation.</p>



<p>Conversely, the remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. These “dormant” servers, though not actively serving model responses, remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation. Importantly, their exposed interfaces could still be leveraged in attacks involving resource exhaustion, denial of service, or lateral movement.</p>



<p>An additional observation was the widespread adoption of OpenAI-compatible API schemas across disparate model hosting platforms. Among the discovered endpoints, 88.89% adhered to the standardized route structure used by OpenAI (e.g., v1/chat/completions), enabling simplified interoperability but also creating uniformity that could be exploited by automated attack frameworks. This API-level homogeneity facilitates the rapid development and deployment of malicious tooling capable of interacting with multiple LLM providers with minimal modification.</p>



<p>These findings showcase a critical and systemic vulnerability in the deployment of LLM infrastructure. The ease with which these servers can be located, fingerprinted, and interacted with raises urgent concerns regarding operational security, access control defaults, and the potential for widespread misuse in the absence of robust authentication and model access restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-limitations">Limitations</h2>



<p>While the proposed system effectively identified a substantial number of exposed Ollama servers, several limitations should be acknowledged that may impact the completeness and accuracy of the results.</p>



<p>First, the detection process is inherently limited by Shodan’s scanning coverage and indexing frequency. Only servers already discovered and cataloged by Shodan can be analyzed, meaning any hosts outside its visibility, due to firewalls, opt-out policies, or geographical constraints remain undetected.</p>



<p>Secondly, the system relies on Shodan’s fingerprinting accuracy. If Ollama instances are configured with custom headers, reverse proxies, or stripped HTTP metadata, they may not be correctly classified by Shodan, leading to potential false negatives.</p>



<p>Third, the approach targets default and commonly used ports (e.g., 11434), which introduces a bias toward standard configurations. Servers running on non-standard or intentionally obfuscated ports are likely to evade detection entirely.</p>



<p>Finally, the analysis focuses exclusively on Ollama deployments and does not extend to other LLM hosting frameworks. While this specialization enhances precision within a narrow scope, it limits generalizability across the broader LLM infrastructure landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2>



<p>The widespread exposure of unauthenticated Ollama servers highlights the urgent need for standardized, practical, and layered mitigation strategies aimed at securing LLM infrastructure. Below, we propose a set of technical and procedural defenses, grounded in best practices and supported by existing tools and frameworks.</p>



<h3 id="h-enforce-authentication-and-access-control">Enforce Authentication and Access Control</h3>



<p>The most critical step in mitigating unauthorized access is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms. Ollama instances, and LLM servers in general, should never be publicly exposed without requiring secure API key-based or token-based authentication. Preferably, authentication should be tied to role-based access control (RBAC) systems to limit the scope of what users can do once authenticated.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Enforce API key or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAuth2-based authentication</a></li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> OAuth 2.0 Framework <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OWASP API Security Top 10</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-network-segmentation-and-firewalling">Network Segmentation and Firewalling</h3>



<p>Publicly exposing inference endpoints over the internet, particularly on default ports, dramatically increases the likelihood of being indexed by services like Shodan. LLM endpoints should be deployed behind network-level access controls, such as firewalls, VPCs, or reverse proxies, and restricted to trusted IP ranges or VPNs.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use security groups, firewalls, and private subnets to isolate LLM services</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-best-practices/aws-security-best-practices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Security Best Practices</a>, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final">Zero Trust Architecture</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-rate-limiting-and-abuse-detection">Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection</h3>



<p>To prevent automated abuse and model probing, inference endpoints should implement rate limiting, throttling, and logging mechanisms. This can hinder brute-force attacks, prompt injection attempts, or resource hijacking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Integrate API gateways (e.g., Kong, Amazon API Gateway) to enforce limits and monitor anomalous behavior</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> OWASP <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa4-lack-of-resources-and-rate-limiting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rate Limiting Guide</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana for Monitoring</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-disable-default-ports-and-obfuscate-service-banners">Disable Default Ports and Obfuscate Service Banners</h3>



<p>Default ports (e.g., 11434 for Ollama) make fingerprinting trivial. To complicate scanning efforts, operators should consider changing default ports and disabling verbose service banners in HTTP responses or headers (e.g., removing “uvicorn” or “Ollama” identifiers).</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Modify default configurations to suppress identifiable metadata</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> Nginx <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverse proxy configuration</a>, <a href="https://systemd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemd hardening</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-secure-model-upload-and-execution-pipelines">Secure Model Upload and Execution Pipelines</h3>



<p>Ollama and similar tools support dynamic model uploads, which, if unsecured, present a vector for model poisoning or backdoor injection. Model upload functionality should be restricted, authenticated, and ideally audited. All models should be validated against a hash or verified origin before execution.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use content whitelisting, digital signatures, or harsh verification for uploaded models</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/model-card-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model Card Toolkit</a>, <a href="https://slsa.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure Supply Chain principles</a> from SLSA</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-continuous-monitoring-and-automated-exposure-audits">Continuous Monitoring and Automated Exposure Audits</h3>



<p>Operators should implement continuous monitoring tools that alert when LLM endpoints become publicly accessible, misconfigured, or lack authentication. Scheduled Shodan queries or custom scanners can help detect regressions in deployment security.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use automated tools like Project Discovery’s naabu, or write custom Shodan monitoring scripts</li>



<li><strong>Tools/References:</strong> <a href="https://projectdiscovery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Discovery Tools</a>, <a href="https://developer.shodan.io/api/alert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shodan Alert API</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>This study reveals a concerning landscape of insecure large language model deployments, with a particular focus on Ollama-based servers exposed to the public internet. Through the use of Shodan and a purpose-built detection tool, we identified over 1,100 unauthenticated LLM servers, a substantial proportion of which were actively hosting vulnerable models. These findings highlight a widespread neglect of fundamental security practices such as access control, authentication, and network isolation in the deployment of AI systems.</p>



<p>The uniform adoption of OpenAI-compatible APIs further exacerbates the issue, enabling attackers to scale exploit attempts across platforms with minimal adaptation. While only a subset of the exposed servers were found to be actively serving models, the broader risk posed by dormant yet accessible endpoints cannot be understated. Such infrastructure remains vulnerable to abuse through unauthorized model execution, prompt injection, and resource hijacking. Our work underscores the urgent need for standardized security baselines, automated auditing tools, and improved deployment guidance for LLM infrastructure.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, future work should explore the integration of multiple data sources, including Censys, ZoomEye, and custom Nmap-based scanners to improve discovery accuracy and reduce dependency on a single platform. Additionally, incorporating adaptive fingerprinting and active probing techniques could enhance detection capabilities in cases where servers use obfuscation or non-standard configurations. Expanding the system to identify deployments across a wider range of LLM hosting frameworks, such as Hugging Face, Triton, and vLLM, would further increase coverage and relevance. Finally, non-standard port detection and adversarial prompt analysis offer promising avenues for refining the system’s ability to detect and characterize hidden or evasive LLM deployments in real-world environments.</p>

    <p>Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill">kernel-hack-drill</a> and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.</p>

<h2 id="bug-collision-story">Bug collision story</h2>

<p>I first found a bug in <code>AF_VSOCK</code> back in 2021 and published the article <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel</a>. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in <code>AF_VSOCK</code>. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (<code>kworker</code>). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.</p>

<p>Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (<a href="https://x.com/v4bel">@v4bel</a>) and Wongi Lee (<a href="https://x.com/_qwerty_po">@qwerty</a>): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/vmw_vsock?id=6ca575374dd9a507cdd16dfa0e78c2e9e20bd05f">Their patch</a> turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/vsock_patch.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/Vityaz.jpg" width="80%"><br>Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)</center>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research/pull/145/files">exploit strategy</a> by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.</p>

<h2 id="cve-2024-50264-analysis">CVE-2024-50264 analysis</h2>

<p>The vulnerability <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50264">CVE-2024-50264</a> was introduced in August 2016 by commit <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/vmw_vsock?id=06a8fc78367d070720af960dcecec917d3ae5f3b">06a8fc78367d</a> in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in <code>AF_VSOCK</code> sockets that happens between the <code>connect()</code> system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.</p>

<p>The kernel uses a freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the <code>kmalloc-96</code> slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.</p>

<p>However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that <strong>it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen</strong>. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.</p>

<h2 id="reproducing-the-bug-using-an-immortal-signal">Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"</h2>

<p>First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>int</span> <span>vsock1</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>vsock1</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_VSOCK</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>vsock1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] creating vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>vsock1</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>sockaddr_vm</span><span>));</span>

	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] binding vsock"</span><span>);</span>

<span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>vsock1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>/* backlog = 0 */</span>

	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] listening vsock"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#define UAF_PORT 0x2712

<p>To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this <code>connect()</code> system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel &amp; @qwerty used <code>SIGKILL</code>, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>sigevent</span> <span>sev</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt <code>connect()</code>. Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As <code>man 7 nptl</code> explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33).
One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see <code>timer_create(2)</code>);
the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have
the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/secret.jpeg" width="50%"></center>


<p>I use <code>timer_settime()</code> for <code>race_timer</code>, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts <code>connect()</code>. Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.</p>

<h2 id="not-so-fast-cve-2024-50264-has-limitations">Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.</li>
  <li>Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.</li>
  <li>The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after <code>kfree()</code>, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.</li>
  <li>A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.</li>
  <li>Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (eight seconds).</li>
  <li>The kworker hangs in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is not zero, as noted above.</li>
</ol>

<p>I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.</p>

<p>The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty was complex:</p>

  <li>A large-scale BPF JIT spray that filled a significant portion of physical memory</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/IAIK/SLUBStick">SLUBStick technique</a> from Graz University of Technology, which allowed to:

      <li>Determine the number of objects in the active slab using a timing side channel</li>
      <li>Then, place the client and server <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects in different slabs, landing one at the end of its slab and the other at the start of the next slab</li>
    </ul>

<p>I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.</p>

<p>I decided not to search victim objects inside the <code>kmalloc-96</code> slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with <code>kconfig</code> options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y</code>, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data</li>
  <li><code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y</code>. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.</p>

<p>The first victim object I decided to try was <code>struct cred</code>. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim <code>cred</code>, because slabs for the vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects overlap the <code>cred</code> object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_cred2.png" width="80%"></center>


<p>Unfortunately, <code>struct cred</code> reallocated at the place of the freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the UAF happened on the first <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, the kernel would hang in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>, because <code>cred</code> has a non-null <code>uid</code> value at the place of <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code>.</li>
  <li>If the UAF happened on the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, writing controlled data to <code>virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc</code> would corrupt the <code>cred.request_key_auth</code> pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>cred</code> object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was <code>msg_msg</code>. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2021/02/09/CVE-2021-26708.html">"Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel"</a>).</p>

<p>It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.</p>

<p>I chose a 96-byte <code>msg_msg</code> because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this <code>msg_msg</code> and <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim <code>msg_msg</code> object. The following diagram shows what happens with the <code>msg_msg</code> object allocated at the place of the freed <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_msg_msg.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>The <code>msg_msg.m_list.prev</code> is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when <code>msg_msg</code> is created (see <code>CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON</code>) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when <code>msg_msg</code> <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.5/source/ipc/msg.c#L941">is inserted</a> into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code>. That makes the <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> function hang while executing <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>.</p>

<p>To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize <code>msg_msg.m_list.prev</code> after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing <code>msg_msg</code> in the message queue and eventually found the solution.</p>

<h2 id="msg_msg-spray-allowing-m_list-field-corruption-novel-technique">msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target <code>msg_msg</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>The message queue size is <code>MSGMNB=16384</code> bytes.</li>
      <li>I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the <code>msgrcv()</code> syscall.</li>

<p>Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of <code>msg_msg</code> using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted <code>m_list</code> pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> hanging in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_msg_msg2.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>To implement the UAF write into an <code>msg_msg</code> object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> into <code>msg_msg</code>. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects live in one of 16 <code>kmalloc-rnd-?-96</code> slab caches enabled by <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES</code>. The <code>msg_msg</code> objects live in a dedicated <code>msg_msg-96</code> slab cache enabled by <code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS</code>.</p>

<p>To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!</p>

<p>Back in 2017, I created a pet project for my students called <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill">kernel-hack-drill</a>. It provides a test environment for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel exploits. I remembered it and decided to use <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> to develop the exploit primitives for CVE-2024-50264.</p>

<p><code>kernel-hack-drill</code> is an open-source project published under the <code>GPL-3.0</code> license. It contains the following parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_mod.c</code> is a small Linux kernel module that provides the <code>/proc/drill_act</code> file as a simple interface to userspace. This module contains vulnerabilities that you can control and experiment with.</li>
  <li><code>drill.h</code> is a header file describing the <code>drill_mod.ko</code> interface:

  <li><code>drill_test.c</code> is a userspace test for <code>drill_mod.ko</code> that provides the examples of using <code>/proc/drill_act</code>. This test doesn't provoke memory corruptions in <code>drill_mod.ko</code> and it passes if <code>CONFIG_KASAN=y</code>.</li>
  <li><code>README.md</code> includes a detailed step-by-step setup guide on how to use <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> (kudos to the contributors!).</li>

<p>Fun fact: when I chose the name <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> for this project, I used the word <code>drill</code> to mean <code>training</code> or <code>workout</code> for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:</p>

<p>The <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> project is a bit similar to <a href="https://github.com/hacktivesec/KRWX">KRWX</a>, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_callback.c</code>: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed <code>drill_item_t</code> structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code> to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c</code>: an improved version of <code>drill_uaf_callback.c</code> that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pte.c</code>: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed <code>drill_item_t</code>. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li><code>drill_uaf_w_pud.c</code>: an improved version of <code>__drill_uaf_w_pte.c__</code> that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I revisited <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-cross-cache-attack-using-kernel-hack-drill">Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill</h2>

<p>My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.</p>

<p>I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>. You can see <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c">the full code in the repository</a>, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend <a href="https://xairy.io/about">Andrey Konovalov</a>'s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hYzxsWeNcE">SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers</a>.</p>

<p>To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from <code>/sys/kernel/slab</code>. The slab caches that hold <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> (80 bytes) or <code>drill_item_t</code> (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (<code>cpu_partial=120</code>) and 42 objects in each slab (<code>objs_per_slab=42</code>).</p>

<p>The cross-cache attack algorithm:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.</li>
  <li>Allocate <code>objs_per_slab * cpu_partial</code> objects. This creates the <code>cpu_partial</code> number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.</li>
  <li>Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.</li>
  <li>Create a new active slab again: allocate <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects. This step is <strong>very important</strong> for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.</li>
  <li>Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free <code>(objs_per_slab * 2 - 1)</code> of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.</li>
  <li>Fill up the partial list: free one of each <code>objs_per_slab</code> objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.</li>
  <li>Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target <code>msg_msg</code> objects. As a result, one <code>msg_msg</code> is allocated where the vulnerable object (<code>drill_item_t</code> in my case) used to be.</li>
  <li>Exploit the UAF! Overwrite <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> to read kernel memory out of bounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.</p>

<p>Let's examine the <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c">attack</a> in <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c</code>. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:</p>

<p>In <code>__put_partials()</code> I print the address of the slab that returns to the page allocator when <code>discard_slab()</code> runs. In <code>alloc_msg()</code> I print the kernel address of each newly allocated <code>msg_msg</code> object.</p>

<p>When the cross-cache attack succeeds, the slab that held <code>drill_item_t</code> objects is handed back to the page allocator and then reused for <code>msg_msg</code> objects. Running the PoC exploit <code>drill_uaf_w_msg_msg</code> makes this visible, as we observe:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the kernel log:
    <div><pre><code>[   32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)

  <li>Then in stdout:

[!] obtain dangling reference from use-after-free bug
[+] done, uaf_n: 5123
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>Then in GDB (using with <a href="https://github.com/bata24/gef">bata24/gef</a>):
    <div><pre><code>gef&gt; slab-contains 0xffff88800c960660

  </li>
  <li>Finally, in the kernel log:
    <div><pre><code>[   36.778165] drill: free item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660)

...

</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We see the <code>drill_item_t</code> object <code>0xffff88800c960660</code> in slab <code>0xffffea0000325800</code> reallocated as <code>msg_msg</code>, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.</p>

<p>After experimenting with <code>kernel-hack-drill</code> on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES</code> and <code>CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS</code> block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/slab_hardening.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>It seems that, without a mitigation such as <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230915105933.495735-15-matteorizzo@google.com/">SLAB_VIRTUAL</a>, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.</p>

<h2 id="adapting-the-cross-cache-attack-to-cve-2024-50264">Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264</h2>

<p>As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object (<strong>Limitation #1</strong>). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the <a href="https://github.com/IAIK/SLUBStick">SLUBStick</a> timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What if I hit the <code>connect()</code> syscall with a signal <strong>almost immediately</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, I used <strong>one more race condition</strong> to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable <code>connect()</code> syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.</li>
  <li>Then I verified the early race condition:
    <ol>
      <li>The <code>connect()</code> syscall must return "Interrupted system call"</li>
      <li>Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> for the server vsock. This bypassed <strong>Limitation #1</strong> (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable <code>connect()</code> a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> was unlocked!</p>

<p>Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in <strong>Limitation #2</strong>. My race condition "speedrun" also eased <strong>Limitation #5</strong>: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (8 seconds).</p>

<p>To address <strong>Limitation #4</strong> (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering <code>connect()</code>, I called <code>listen()</code> on the vulnerable vsock. If <code>listen()</code> ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to <code>TCP_LISTEN</code>, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.</p>

<p>At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li><del>The vulnerable <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.</del></li>
  <li><del>Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.</del></li>
  <li><strong>The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after <code>kfree()</code>, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.</strong></li>
  <li><del>A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.</del></li>
  <li><del>Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (eight seconds).</del></li>
  <li><strong>The kworker hangs in <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is not zero.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.</p>

<h2 id="oh-so-slow-the-cross-cache-attack-shows-up-late-to-the-party">Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party</h2>

<p>As noted in <strong>Limitation #3</strong>, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after <code>kfree()</code> for the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> and never reaches the <code>msg_msg</code>.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_and_cross_cache.jpeg" width="50%"></center>


<p>I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/racing-against-clock-hitting-tiny.html">Racing against the clock</a>. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.</p>

<p>The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a <code>timerfd</code> watched by a huge pile of <code>epoll</code> instances. Here is the short recipe (see <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/03/racing-against-clock-hitting-tiny.html">Jann's article</a> for full detail):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Call <code>timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0)</code>.</li>
  <li>Create 8 forks.</li>
  <li>In each fork, call <code>dup()</code> for the <code>timerfd</code> 100 times.</li>
  <li>In each fork, call <code>epoll_create()</code> 500 times.</li>
  <li>For every <code>epoll</code> instance, use <code>epoll_ctl()</code> to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each <code>epoll</code> instance now monitors all available <code>timerfd</code> copies.</li>
  <li>Finally, arm the <code>timerfd</code> so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:
    <div><pre><code><span>timerfd_settime</span><span>(</span><span>timerfd</span><span>,</span> <span>TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>retard_tmo</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.</p>

<p>I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code>, <code>epoll_ctl()</code> fails. From <code>man 7 epoll</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, <code>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</code> is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 <code>epoll</code> instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 <code>epoll</code> watches.</p>

<p>That was just enough to beat <strong>Limitation #3</strong>, and I finally got <code>msg_msg</code> data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed <code>msg_msg.m_ts</code> from 48 bytes to 8192 (<code>MSGMAX</code>). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the <code>msgrcv()</code> syscall.</p>

<h2 id="sorting-the-loot">Sorting the loot</h2>

<p>The corrupted <code>msg_msg</code> allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address <code>0xffffffff8233cfa0</code> [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the <code>socket_file_ops()</code> kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of <code>struct file</code>, because the <code>file</code> kernel object also contains the <code>f_cred</code> pointer [2], which leaked as well.</p>

<p>Here's how I examined the memory leaked by <code>msg_msg</code> at <code>0xffff88800e75d600</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 &lt;socket_file_ops&gt;,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,
  private_data = 0xffff88800ee66d80,
  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to <code>struct cred</code>, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.</p>

<h2 id="in-search-of-arbitrary-address-writing-primitive">In search of arbitrary address writing primitive</h2>

<p>The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Looked through dozens of kernel objects,</li>
  <li>Read many kernel exploit write-ups,</li>
  <li>Tried <a href="https://kernelctf-dash.storage.googleapis.com/processed/v6.1.111/index.html#!heap/*/msg_msg/64..128">Kernel Exploitation Dashboard</a> by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.</li>
</ul>

<p>One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250226150503/https://yanglingxi1993.github.io/dirty_pagetable/dirty_pagetable.html">well described</a> by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.</p>

<p>I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.</li>
  <li>Using the KASLR infoleak from my <code>msg_msg</code> out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on <code>X86_64</code> with <code>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE</code> and <code>CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY</code> enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel <code>_text</code>.</p>

<p>VM run #1:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef&gt; v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -&gt; Phys: 0x57400000
</code></pre></div>

<p>VM run #2:</p>
<div><pre><code>gef&gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef&gt; v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -&gt; Phys: 0x18600000
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VM run #1: <code>0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000</code></li>
  <li>VM run #2: <code>0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because <code>0xffffffff41000000</code> is not equal to <code>0xffffffff69200000</code>, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.</p>

<p>Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on <code>pipe_buffer</code>.</p>

<p>When a pipe is created with the <code>pipe()</code> system call, the kernel allocates an array of <code>pipe_buffer</code> structures. Each <code>pipe_buffer</code> item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/pipe_buffer.png" width="50%"></center>


<p>This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a <code>pipe_buffer</code> array the same size as <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> by changing the capacity of the pipe: <code>fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2)</code>. The kernel changes the array size to <code>2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes</code>, exactly matching the <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> size.</p>

<p>In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code>, just as in Max Kellermann's original <a href="https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/">Dirty Pipe attack</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer0.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with <code>pipe_buffer</code> in my <code>kernel-hack-drill</code>.</p>

<h2 id="experimenting-with-the-dirty-pipe-attack">Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack</h2>

<p>First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in <code>kernel-hack-drill</code>; the PoC exploit <code>drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c</code> is in the <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kernel-hack-drill/blob/e3a105cde99912c89c2c1470a29101eb0d9c2d56/drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c">repository</a>. It:</p>
<ol>
  <li>performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held <code>drill_item_t</code> objects as a slab for <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects</li>
  <li>exploits the UAF write to <code>drill_item_t</code>; the attacker-controlled bytes written to <code>drill_item_t</code> at offset 24, modify <code>pipe_buffer.flags</code></li>
  <li>implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!</li>
</ol>

<p>To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining <strong>Limitation #6</strong>: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if <code>virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock</code> is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing <code>splice()</code> from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:</p>
<div><pre><code>	<span>loff_t</span> <span>file_offset</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
	<span>ssize_t</span> <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

	<span>/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */</span>
	<span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>splice</span><span>(</span><span>temp_file_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>file_offset</span><span>,</span> <span>pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
		<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice"</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>!=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
		<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice short"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In that case, the <code>pipe_buffer.offset</code> field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer2.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the <code>pipe_buffer.ops</code> function pointer by four zero bytes of <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code>. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving <code>pipe_buffer</code> ☹️:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer3.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>This brought me to the following line of reasoning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working <code>pipe_buffer</code> with an unchanged <code>ops</code> pointer value.</li>
  <li>Preserving <code>0xffffffff</code> in the most significant bytes of the <code>pipe_buffer.ops</code> function pointer requires that same value in <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code>.</li>
  <li>Setting <code>peer_fwd_cnt</code> in <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> means sending data through the vsock.</li>
  <li>Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful <code>connect()</code>.</li>
  <li>However, a successful <code>connect()</code> on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alas!</p>

<h2 id="pipe-buffer-entertainment">Pipe buffer entertainment</h2>

<p>So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What if I create a pipe with capacity <code>PAGE_SIZE * 4</code> forcing the kernel to allocate four <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects in <code>kmalloc-192</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects in one <code>kmalloc-192</code> slab are allocated at the place of two <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects in two <code>kmalloc-96</code> slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer7.png" width="90%"></center>


<p>Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.</p>

<p>To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> <strong>#1</strong>, I used two tricks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Performed a <code>splice()</code> from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the <code>offset</code> field of the first <code>pipe_buffer</code> at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.</li>
  <li>Discarded that first <code>pipe_buffer</code> <strong>before triggering the UAF</strong>, leaving its <code>offset</code> field untouched:
    <div><pre><code> <span>/* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */</span>
 <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>splice</span><span>(</span><span>pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>temp_pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice"</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] splice short"</span><span>);</span>

 <span>/*
  * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer.
  * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer,
  * that will not crash the kernel. Cool!
  */</span>
 <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>temp_pipe_fd</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>pipe_data_to_read</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>/* 1 spliced byte */</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] pipe read 1"</span><span>);</span>
 <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>bytes</span> <span>!=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
 	<span>err_exit</span><span>(</span><span>"[-] pipe read 1 short"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
    <p>After this sequence of <code>splice()</code> and <code>read()</code>, the first <code>pipe_buffer</code> becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its <code>ops</code> pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to exploit the UAF on <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code> <strong>#2</strong> to overwrite the fourth <code>pipe_buffer</code>. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, I called the same <code>splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0)</code> two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects, leaving their <code>flags</code> at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any <code>PIPE_BUF_FLAG_*</code> bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second <code>virtio_vsock_sock</code>, the <code>spin_lock_bh()</code> in <code>virtio_transport_space_update()</code> will not hang.</p>

<p>These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the <code>page</code> pointer of the fourth <code>pipe_buffer</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf_write_pipe_buffer6.png" width="90%"></center>


<p><code>kernel-hack-drill</code> let me experiment with <code>pipe_buffer</code> objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.</p>

<h2 id="aarw-and-kaslrs-last-revenge">AARW and KASLR's last revenge</h2>

<p>In a <code>pipe_buffer</code>, the <code>page</code> pointer holds the address of a <code>struct page</code> inside the virtual memory map (<code>vmemmap</code>). <code>vmemmap</code> is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.15.5/source/Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst">mentioned</a> in <code>Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>____________________________________________________________|___________________________________________________________

</code></pre></div>

<p>Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in <strong>Limitation #5</strong>, so I had to choose the target in <code>vmemmap</code> carefully.</p>

<p>My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel <code>_text</code> and therefore couldn't determine its location inside <code>vmemmap</code>.</p>

<p>That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against <code>struct cred</code> in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of <code>cred</code> using my <code>msg_msg</code> out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like <code>0xffff888003b7ad00</code>, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding <code>struct page</code> in <code>vmemmap</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr &amp; 0x3ffffffflu) &gt;&gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
</span><span>uaf_val</span> <span>=</span> <span>PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET</span><span>(</span><span>cred_addr</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The idea behind it is simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>addr &amp; 0x3ffffffflu</code> gives the offset of the <code>struct cred</code> from the <code>page_offset_base</code>.</li>
  <li>Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing <code>struct cred</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of <code>struct page</code>) gives the offset of the corresponding <code>struct page</code> in the <code>vmemmap</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, <code>ZONE_NORMAL</code> containing kernel allocations usually starts at address <code>0x100000000</code>. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed <code>struct page</code>, we should add <code>(0x100000000 &gt;&gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ</code>.</p>

<p>Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the <code>struct cred</code>. Why I needed only four lower bytes of <code>pipe_buffer.page</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My UAF write to <code>peer_buf_alloc</code> performed partial overwriting of the first half of the <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.</li>
  <li><code>x86_64</code> is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.</li>
</ul>

<p>But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the <code>vmemmap_base</code> address, and the four lower bytes of the <code>struct page</code> pointers carried <strong>two random bits</strong>. Ouch!</p>

<p>However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after <code>VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT</code> (8 sec).</p>

<center><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/bruteforce4.jpg" width="60%"></center>


<p>I found that probing different values of <code>pipe_buffer.page</code> from userspace works perfectly well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns <code>Bad address</code>.</li>
  <li>In case of success, reading from the pipe gives <code>struct cred</code> contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:</p>

<p>There are more ways to store energy than just using batteries. Some are using fire bricks, particularly for process heat for industries that rely on high heat in manufacturing. Others propose an arrangement of <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/19/gravity-energy-storage-mine-shafts-romania/">massive concrete blocks</a> that move up and down like the weights of a giant grandfather clock, converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back again. In Finland, two intrepid engineers began experimenting with a sand battery a few years ago.</p>
<p>As we reported when the first <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/05/sand-battery-trials-begin-in-finland/">prototype</a> was unveiled three years ago, the idea of a sand battery began with two Finnish engineers, Markku Ylönen and Tommi Eronen. The concept is simplicity itself. Make a really big pile of sand. Heat it with excess renewable electricity to around 500°C (932°F), then use that heat later to heat homes, factories, even swimming pools. They say the sand can stay hot for 3 months or more. The pair have founded Polar Night Energy, which constructed a prototype consisting of 100 tons of sand inside what looks like a silo in the town of Kankaanpää.</p>
<p>Many Americans are unfamiliar with the concept of district heating, but it is widely used in other counties, especially in Scandinavia where keeping schools, municipal buildings, arenas, factories, and homes warm in winter is a challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loval.com/en/about-us/news/loviisan-lampo">Loviisan Lämpö</a> is a Finnish district heating company that supplies district heating to customers in Loviisa, Pukkila, Pornainen, and Pyhtää. It has collaborated with Polar Night on a new sand battery — one that is much larger than the prototype — which began operating in the city of Pornainen in southern Finland this month, where it is expected to reduce carbon emissions from district heating by 70 percent.</p>
<p>Previously, the majority of heat needed for the system came from burning oil, but that has now been completely eliminated. The system will continue to burn wood chips to supplement the sand battery. Wood chips are at least carbon neutral, although not an ideal solution since it takes years for trees to grow but only minutes for the chips to burn.</p>
<p>At the commissioning ceremony for the new battery, Mikko Paajanen, CEO of Loviisan Lämpö, said, “A couple of years ago, we started considering how to take district heating in Pornainen to the next level. It would have been easy to simply replace the old wood chip power plant with a new one of the same kind, but that didn’t align with our goals. We evaluated every possible alternative, and the Sand Battery proved to be the best option.”</p>
<p>The battery is a 42 foot tall, 50 foot wide steel cylinder filled with 2,000 tons of crushed stone. According to <em><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91393820/in-finland-this-giant-battery-is-helping-heat-apartments-and-offices-using-sand">Fast Company</a></em>, when extra renewable electricity is available, the system uses it to heat up the crushed stone, where it is stored until needed. Then the heat from the battery travels to other buildings through a system of pipes filled with hot water. Each building has its own equipment to distribute the heat to radiators, floor heaters, or other heating devices.</p>
<p>“We have already learnt that our system has even more potential than we initially calculated. It’s been a positive surprise,” said Ylönen after the prototype was placed in service. “Whenever there’s a high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly.” The need to use energy more wisely was driven home for Finns after Russia stopped providing electricity, methane, and oil to Finland when it voted to join NATO. Finland and Russia share a common border.</p>
<h3>Sand Battery Is Simple &amp; Efficient</h3>
<figure id="attachment_359222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359222"><img decoding="async" src="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery.jpg" alt="sand battery" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery.jpg 1200w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery-400x300.jpg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery-800x600.jpg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06-91393820-finnish-sand-battery-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359222">Credit: Polar Night</figcaption></figure>
<p>The sand battery is simplicity itself. “We just heat air and [circulate it] through sand,” says Liisa Naskali, COO of Polar Night Energy. But materials other than sand can be used. The new battery actually uses crushed soapstone chips from a local fireplace manufacturer. Sand, or other material crushed into sand-size particles, has the ability to store heat for weeks. Unlike some other batteries, the system doesn’t rely on chemicals, doesn’t degrade, and won’t catch on fire. In operation, the sand battery has demonstrated a round trip efficiency of 90 percent.</p>
<p>Inside the steel tank, a heat exchanger and a closed loop system are used to circulate the heat. Software runs heaters when electricity prices are low. So far this summer, the district heating operator has paid only about 10 percent of the average price of electricity because heating the system only occurred at optimal times. That helps make the technology cost competitive, although the initial installation cost is fairly high.</p>
<p>Polar Night is now in talks with other district heating companies and factory owners with a need for high temperature process heat. For the company, the project in Pornainen is a critical proof point. “This is really important for us because now we can show that this really works,” a spokesperson for Polar Night said.</p>
<h3>Investment Opportunities</h3>
<p>Polar Night and its partners see a <a href="https://polarnightenergy.com/news/worlds-largest-sand-battery-inaugurated/">bright financial future</a> for sand batteries because&nbsp;they can participate in electricity reserve markets, reduce dependence on single energy sources in heat production, and serve as an excellent example of sector integration between electricity and heat.</p>
<p>“For us, the sand battery is a great commercial investment, but we also wanted to boldly support an innovative solution that benefits customers, the municipality, and the entire electricity market. This is a concrete example of a cost efficient and sustainable investment. If it works here, it will work anywhere,” said Sauli Antila, the investment director at CapMan Infra, the corporate owner of Loviisan Lämpö.</p>
<p>The profitability of the sand battery is based on charging it according to electricity prices and Fingrid’s reserve markets. Its large storage capacity enables balancing the electricity grid and optimizing consumption over several days or even weeks. The reserve market operations and optimization of the Pornainen Sand Battery are managed by the software unit division of Elisa Industriq.</p>
<p>“The Pornainen plant can be adjusted quickly and precisely, and it also has a remarkably long energy buffer, making it well suited for reserve market optimization. Our AI solution automatically identifies the best times to charge and discharge the Sand Battery and allocates flexibility capacity to the reserve products that need it most. Continuous optimization makes it a genuinely profitable investment,” explained Jukka-Pekka Salmenkaita, vice president of AI and special projects at Elisa Industriq.</p>
<p>Polar Night has a clear vision for the future. Construction of an electricity production pilot will begin in the coming weeks in Valkeakoski, Finland, and the company is in active negotiations for several large-scale thermal storage projects in district heating, hot air, and process steam production. “Industrial applications are particularly promising, especially where heat above 100°C is required, something electric boilers and heat pumps cannot provide,” said Polar Night COO Liisa Naskali.</p>
<p>This technology is never going to replace grid-scale battery storage, but could be useful in many situations where battery storage is not. A comment on the YouTube video below complained, “Not a word about return on investment in the presentation. That means it’ll never pay off. They just wasted taxpayers’ money to stroke their own egos.” MAGAlomaniacs are everywhere these days.</p>

and in 2025 switched to a different accountant.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>CI &amp; Website</td>
<td>$14,986.73</td>
<td>Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part
due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were
one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others
are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions on.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Taxes</td>
<td>$13,089.07</td>
<td>Although ZSF is a tax-exempt organization, employees are still required
to pay income tax.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Travel</td>
<td>$6,955.61</td>
<td>In a 2024 meeting, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBIB3hY2z-gKLGQyvAO3vtWJzoiS6fVLC5XRF4owPn0/edit?usp=sharing">the board decided</a>
that the previous year's travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
and retained the same budget of $15,000. In 2024, ZSF spent $6,956
of those allocated funds, increasing Zig's presence in <a href="https://softwareyoucan.love/">Italy</a> and <a href="https://zigtoberfest.de/">Germany</a>.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sponsorships</td>
<td>$5,846.24</td>
<td>The Zig project is mostly comprised of in-house code, however,
it also relies on third party projects. Today, every Zig
installation includes some source files or ported code from
<a href="http://musl.libc.org/">musl libc</a>,
<a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">mingw-w64</a>, and others.
ZSF donates money to these projects as a way to say thanks, give back to the ecosystem,
and increase the sustainability of Zig's dependencies.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bank Fees</td>
<td>$782.23</td>
<td>This is a tiny slice of the pie, but every time ZSF
wires money, there is a transaction fee. Our contractors graciously bill
infrequently when possible to help reduce this cost.</td>
