<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Support <em>nullness markers</em> on Java types to indicate that a type rejects or
deliberately allows nulls.
This is a <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">preview language feature</a>.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Enhance Java's reference types to let programmers express whether <code>null</code>
references are expected as values of the type</p></li>
<li><p>Support conversions between types with different nullness properties,
accompanied by warnings about possibly-mishandled <code>null</code> values</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibibly interoperate with traditional Java code that makes no assertions
about the <code>null</code> compatibility of its types, and support gradual adoption of
these new features without introducing source or binary incompatibilities</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that variables with types that reject <code>null</code> are initialized before
they are first read</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce types that reject <code>null</code> at run time, even when classes are compiled
separately</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the metadata and integrity guarantees necessary for run-time
optimizations (such as the flattening of <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">value objects</a>) to rely
on types that claim to exclude <code>null</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It is not a goal to automatically re-interpret existing code—use of these
features should be optional and explicitly opted in to (future work will
explore mechanisms to request a bulk opt-in without needing to change
individual types)</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a goal to require programs to explicitly account for all <code>null</code>
values that might occur; unaccounted-for <code>null</code> values may cause
compile-time warnings, but not compile-time errors</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a goal to make any changes to the primitive types, such as
adding support for a nullable <code>int</code> type</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a goal (at this time) to apply the language enhancements to the
standard libraries</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In a Java program, a variable of type <code>String</code> may hold either a reference to a
<code>String</code> object or the special value <code>null</code>. In some cases, the author
intends that the variable will always hold a reference to a <code>String</code> object;
in other cases, the author expects <code>null</code> as a meaningful value. Unfortunately,
there is no way to formally express in the language which of these alternatives
is intended, leading to confusion and bugs.</p>

<p>For example, programs often make a blanket assumption that no <code>null</code> values will
be present. But it takes extra care to state this expectation in Javadoc
specifications and to reliably enforce it in implementation code. If extra care
isn't taken, and someone fails to follow the assumed protocol, then <code>null</code>
values may end up flowing freely through implementation code, eventually
triggering an exception at some point far removed from the bug.</p>

<p>This situation can be greatly improved by giving developers tools to assert, as
part of a type, that either (1) <code>null</code> values are not supported and will be
rejected, or (2) <code>null</code> values are expected and should be properly accounted
for.</p>

<p>By default, the language can't reasonably assume either of these
interpretations. It needs developers to explicitly indicate their intent.</p>

<p>Given a clear expression of intent, the language could then introduce both
compile-time feedback and run-time checks to help developers detect
unexpected nulls earlier.</p>

<p>In the Valhalla project, a variable of a <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/401" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">value class type</a> can
be optimized with a flattened representation of its values. But this flattened
representation may need extra bits to encode <code>null</code>, negatively impacting memory
footprint and sometimes making it impossible to optimize the storage at all.
If the developer could exclude <code>null</code> from the domain of the variable, a
<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8316779" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">better encoding</a> could be achieved.</p>

<p>In the Amber project, the nullness of a pattern match candidate may influence
whether a <code>switch</code> should be considered exhaustive, and the nullness of a type
pattern may influence whether the pattern matches <code>null</code>. It would be useful for
developers to be able to control these behaviors.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The features described below are preview features, enabled with the
<code>--enable-preview</code> compile-time and runtime flags.</p>

<h3>Nullness properties and markers</h3>

<p>A reference type may optionally express <em>nullness</em>—whether <code>null</code> is intended
to be included in the value set of the type.</p>

<p>In Java syntax, a <em>nullness marker</em> is used to indicate this property.</p>

<p>The type <code>Foo!</code> is <em>null-restricted</em>: the value set excludes <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>The type <code>Foo?</code> is <em>nullable</em>: the value set deliberately includes <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>By default, the nullness of the type <code>Foo</code> is <em>unspecified</em>: a <code>null</code> may occur,
but we don't know whether its presence is deliberate.</p>



<p>The nullness of a type is an intrinsic part of the type—in other words, <code>Foo?</code>
and <code>Foo</code> are <em>different types</em>, because they have different nullness.
However, as outlined later, most language rules are defined in a way that
either ignores nullness or helpfully adapts (perhaps with a warning) between
types with different nullness.</p>

<p>Array types and their array component types may both have nullness markers.
<code>Foo?[]!</code> is a null-restricted array type, whose components are of nullable type
<code>Foo</code>. Null markers for multi-dimensional arrays may occur after each bracket
pair, and by convention are interpreted outermost to innermost, from left to
right.</p>

<p>Parameterized types and their type arguments may similarly both have nullness
markers. <code>Predicate!&lt;Foo?&gt;</code> is a null-restricted <code>Predicate</code> with nullable type
<code>Foo</code> as a type argument. The interpretation of type arguments is described in
more detail later.</p>

<p>In this JEP, nullness markers are explicit: to express a null-restricted or
nullable type, the <code>!</code> or <code>?</code> symbol must appear in source. In the future, it
may be useful, for example, for a programmer to somehow express that every
type in a class or compilation unit is to be interpreted as null-restricted,
unless a <code>?</code> symbol is present. The details of any such a feature will be
explored separately.</p>

<h3>Field and array initialization</h3>

<p>Most variables in Java must be initialized with a value of the
variable's type before they can be used. Local variables are checked
for <em>definite assignment</em> before they can be referenced; method parameters get
initial values from a method invocation expression; pattern variables are bound
in the process of pattern matching; etc.</p>

<p>Traditionally, fields and array components get special treatment: because they
can be accessed by multiple program components immediately upon creation of a
class or object, they are automatically initialized "at birth" with a <em>default
value</em>, which programmers will typically overwrite in the course of program
execution.</p>

<p>The default value of a reference type is <code>null</code>. But this is an unsuitable
initial value for a null-restricted field or array component—if someone reads
the variable before it has been written, they will observe a value that is not
of the variable's type.</p>

<p>Thus, fields and arrays with null-restricted types behave differently than other
fields and arrays: they must always be initialized by the program before they
can be read. This is enforced as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A null-restricted instance field without an initializer must be definitely
assigned before the (explicit or implicit) <code>super(...)</code> call in each of the
class's constructors. The <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8325803" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flexible Constructor Bodies JEP</a>
allows the necessary initialization code to be written at the start of a
constructor. In this <em>early construction context</em>, the initialization logic is
not allowed to refer to <code>this</code> or risk any attempts to read the uninitialized
field.</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
private String! name;

public Person(String name) {
  this.name = name;
  super();
}
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If a null-restricted instance field <em>has</em> an initializer, the initializer is
executed at the start of each constructor, before the <code>super(...)</code> call.
(Constructors that call <code>this(...)</code> are a special case and, as usual, do not
execute initializers at all.) Again, this means that the initialization logic
of the field occurs in an <em>early construction context</em> and may not refer to
<code>this</code> or risk any reads of the uninitialized field.</p></li>
<li><p>A null-restricted static field must be definitely assigned by the end of all
static initializers and initializer blocks of the class. Note, however, that
this rule does not prevent some other class from trying to read the field
during the class initialization process; in that case, a run time check
detects the early read attempt and throws an exception.</p>

<p>In the following example, the initialization code of field <code>Foo.s</code> has a
circular dependency. Traditionally, the circular reference to <code>Foo.s</code> would
produce the default value of <code>s</code>, <code>null</code>; with a null-restricted field type,
that is impossible and so an exception is thrown alerting the developer to
the bug.</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
public String! s = Bar.getString();
}

class Bar {
static String! getString() {
    return Foo.s; // may throw an exception
}
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>An array with a null-restricted component type must provide an initializer for
each component in the array creation expression. This can be achieved by
explicitly listing each initial value in an array initializer, or by using
a new shorthand form (syntax TBD).</p>

<pre><code>String![] labels;<br>
labels = new String![]{ "x", "y", "z" };
labels = new String!<span>[100]</span>{ "" }; // strawman syntax
labels = new String!<span>[100]</span>{ i -&gt; "x"+i }; // strawman syntax</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h3>Expression nullness and conversions</h3>

<p>As part of type checking, the Java compiler is responsible for determining the
nullness of every expression.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The nullness of a variable reference is given by the referenced variable's
declaration (but TBD whether the Java compiler will further observe that, due
to previous uses of the variable, a <code>null</code> is known not to be present).</p></li>
<li><p>The nullness of a method invocation is given by the referenced method's return
type.</p></li>
<li><p>The type of a cast expression is explicit in the cast (but, again, TBD whether
the Java compiler takes other information into account).</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>null</code> literal is nullable (of course).</p></li>
<li><p>Most other reference-typed expressions are null-restricted. These include
literals, string concatenations, <code>this</code>, class instance and array creations,
method references, and lambda expressions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A <em>nullness conversion</em> allows an expression with one kind of nullness to be
treated as having a different nullness. Nullness conversions are permitted
in all assignment, invocation, and casting contexts.</p>

<p>The following are <em>widening nullness conversions</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Foo!</code> to <code>Foo?</code></li>
<li><code>Foo!</code> to unspecified <code>Foo</code></li>
<li><code>Foo?</code> to unspecified <code>Foo</code></li>
<li>unspecified <code>Foo</code> to <code>Foo?</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And these are <em>narrowing nullness conversions</em>:
- <code>Foo?</code> to <code>Foo!</code>
- unspecified <code>Foo</code> to <code>Foo!</code></p>

<p>Narrowing nullness conversions are analogous to unboxing conversions: the
compiler performs them automatically, while at run time they impose a dynamic
check, possibly causing a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, the boxing and unboxing conversions can now be simplified: boxing
converts <code>int</code> to <code>Integer!</code>, potentially followed by a widening nullness
conversion to <code>Integer</code>; unboxing converts <code>Integer!</code> to <code>int</code>, possibly
preceded by a narrowing nullness conversion from <code>Integer</code> to <code>Integer!</code>.</p>

<p>It is a compile-time error to attempt to directly convert a <code>null</code> literal to a
null-restricted type.</p>

<h3>Run-time null checking</h3>

<p>At run time, if a <code>null</code> value undergoes a narrowing nullness conversion to a
null-restricted type, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.</p>

<pre><code>String? id(String! arg) { return arg; }

String s = null;
Object! o1 = s; // NPE
Object o2 = id(s); // NPE
Object o3 = (String!) s; // NPE</code></pre>

<p>Some narrowing nullness conversions are not apparent in the source code, but
occur implicitly as part of run time execution. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An array that was allocated with a null-restricted component type may be given
a less specific type in the source code, but will still reject <code>null</code> values
during the usual <em>array store check</em>. The failed conversion will prompt an
<code>ArrayStoreException</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similary, a field that was not null-restricted at compile time but was later
separately compiled to be null-restricted will reject <code>null</code> values during a
new <em>field store check</em>. The failed conversion will prompt a
<code>FieldStoreException</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When one method overrides another, the argument to an invocation of the
superclass method undergoes conversion to the parameter's invocation type,
<em>followed by</em> conversion to the type of the overriding method's parameter.
As discussed below, the nullness of these two parameter types may not be the
same.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the return value of a method undergoes conversion to the declared
method return type, <em>followed by</em> conversion to the invocation's expected
return type.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Nullness of type variables</h3>

<p>Like other types, a type-variable type (that is, a <em>use</em> of a type variable) may
express nullness. <code>T!</code> is a null-restricted type, and <code>T?</code> is a nullable type.</p>



<p>Null-restricted and nullable type variable types (<code>T!</code> and <code>T?</code>) assert a
specific nullness within the generic code. This may be appropriate if the
generic code directly interacts with <code>null</code>. <!--Parametric nullness (<code class="prettyprint" >T*</code>), on the
other hand, leaves nullness to the use site; often, the generic code does
nothing with values of the type variable type except store them or pass them on
to non-generic code.--></p>

<pre><code>class Box&lt;T&gt; {
    boolean set;
    T? val; // nullable field

    public Box() { set = false; }
    public void set(T val) { this.val = val; set = true; }

    public T? getOrNull() { // nullable result
        return set ? val : null;
    }

    public T! getNonNull(T! alt) { // null-restricted result
        return (set &amp;&amp; val != null) ? (T!) val : alt;
    }
}</code></pre>







<p>Types used as type arguments may express nullness; null markers on type-variable
types override whatever nullness was asserted by the type argument.</p>

<pre><code>Box&lt;String!&gt; b1 = new Box&lt;String!&gt;();
b1.getOrNull(); // nullable result

Box&lt;String?&gt; b2 = new Box&lt;String?&gt;();
b2.set(null);
b2.getNonNull(""); // null-restricted result</code></pre>

<p>Of course, null restrictions cannot be enforced within the erased implementation
of a generic API. But the usual implicit casts that occur at the boundaries of
generic APIs will enforce null-restricted type arguments at run time.</p>



<h3>Type arguments and bounds</h3>

<p>As illustrated above, type arguments may express nullness, which influences the
substituted nullness of the API wherever parametric type variables occur.</p>

<p>For interoperability, nullness in type arguments is not strongly enforced, and
<em>unchecked nullness conversions</em> allow modifications to the nullness of type
arguments. For example, <code>Predicate&lt;String!&gt;</code> can be converted to
<code>Predicate&lt;String&gt;</code> or <code>Predicate&lt;String?&gt;</code>. These conversions may cause
warnings (see "Compiler warnings", below).</p>

<p>Similarly, unchecked nullness conversions allow modifications to the nullness of
array component types. TBD under what conditions these conversions are checked
at run time.</p>

<p>A type variable declaration or wildcard may have nullness markers on its bounds.
A type may satisfy the bounds via nullness conversion, though, so again these
nullness markers are not strongly enforced, but may cause warnings.</p>

<h3>Method overriding and type argument inference</h3>

<p>Nullness is ignored when determining whether two methods have the same
signature. One method may override another even if the nullness of their
parameters and returns do not match.</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    String? lookup(String! arg) { ... }
}

class B extends A {
    String lookup(String arg) { ... }
}</code></pre>

<p>Such mismatches will be common as different APIs adopt nullness markers
independently.</p>

<p>Formally, two methods are considered to have the <em>same signature</em> if each
parameter type and type parameter bound can be converted to the other via
nullness and unchecked conversions.</p>

<p>Similarly, the return type of an overriding method must be convertible to the
overridden return type via a widening reference conversion, possibly followed by
nullness and unchecked conversions.</p>

<p>If a method is generic, any parametric uses of its type parameters in the method
signature will influence the inferred nullness of type arguments. Nullness does
not influence method applicability and cannot cause type argument inference to
fail, but it can influence the nullness inferred for the method's return type.
(Details of the inference algorithm TBD.)</p>

<h3>Compiler warnings</h3>

<p>As described above, making a type null-restricted may cause new compile-time
errors if a field or array of the type is left uninitialized, or if an
attempt is made to convert a <code>null</code> literal to the type. It may also be a
compile-time error to compare a <code>null</code> literal to an expression with a
null-restricted type.</p>

<p>In other situations, nullness analysis is supplementary and does not cause
compile-time errors. However, <code>javac</code> will provide warnings to help programmers
avoid runtime errors. IDEs and other analysis tools are encouraged to do the
same. Possible sources of warnings include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Narrowing nullness conversions, especially from <code>?</code> types</p></li>
<li><p><code>?</code>-typed <!--or <code class="prettyprint" >*</code>-typed--> expressions used in member accesses or other null-hostile
operations</p></li>
<li><p>Type arguments whose nullness is inconsistent with their bounds</p></li>
<li><p>Method parameters or returns with nullness that doesn't match an overridden
method</p></li>
<li><p>Unchecked conversions that change the nullness of a type</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Compilation &amp; class file representation</h3>

<p>Most uses of null markers are erased in <code>class</code> files, with the accompanying
run-time conversions being expressed directly in bytecode.</p>

<p><code>Signature</code> attributes have an updated grammar to allow <code>!</code> and <code>?</code> <!-- and <code class="prettyprint" >*</code>--> in
types, as appropriate. Nullness is not encoded in method and
field <em>descriptors</em>.</p>

<p>However, to prevent pollution of fields, a new <code>NullRestricted</code> attribute allows
a field to indicate that it does not allow <code>null</code> values. This has the following
effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The field must also be marked <code>ACC_STRICT</code>, which indicates that it must be
"strictly-initialized". The verifier ensures that all strictly-initialized
instance fields have been assigned to at the point that a constructor makes
a <code>super(...)</code> call.</p></li>
<li><p>All attempts to write to the field check for a <code>null</code> value and, if found,
throw a <code>FieldStoreException</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Null-restricted array creation is not supported by the <code>anewarray</code> instruction,
and must be accomplished with a call to the reflection API (see below). All
attempts to write to a null-restricted array component reject <code>null</code> values
during the usual array store check.</p>

<h3>Core reflection</h3>

<p>There are no <code>Foo!.class</code> or <code>Foo?.class</code> literals, and no associated instances
of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. These types are derived from a class declaration, but
do not represent distinct classes. (Compare <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>However, a new <code>RuntimeType</code> API describes the set of types that are enforced
by array and field store checks at run time, including a null-restricted
variant of every class and interface type. (This is a superset of
the <em>linkage types</em>, which can appear in descriptors and are represented by
the <code>Class</code> API.)</p>

<p>The <code>Field</code> API supports querying a field's <code>RuntimeType</code>, which may not be
the same as its <code>getType</code> result.</p>

<p>The <code>Array</code> API supports variations of <code>newInstance</code> that allow a component type
to be expressed with a <code>RuntimeType</code>. These variations also allow the caller to
provide initial values for the array components, and will reject attempts to
create null-restricted arrays without initial values. Another new method
reflects the <code>RuntimeType</code> of an array's components.</p>

<h3>Supplementary changes</h3>

<p>Traditional deserialization is not compatible with null-restricted fields and
arrays. A separate JEP will provide a new mechanism to support serialization
without exposing uninitialized null-restricted fields and arrays.</p>

<p>Documentation generated by <code>javadoc</code> will include nullness markers.</p>

<p>The <code>java.lang.reflect.Type</code> and <code>javax.lang.model</code> APIs will encode nullness in
their representation of types.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>A variety of development tools in the Java ecosystem have implemented their own
compile-time tracking of nulls. These tools don't change the Java language and
so naturally have some limitations, particularly in the syntax they can use
(annotations) and the behavior they can affect (compile-time checks).</p>

<p>Other programming languages track nullness in their type systems. Many are
null-restricted by default. Many also consider it an error to assign to a
null-restricted type without an explicit null check. In the case of Java,
it's important that the feature be optional, and be something that
programmers can incrementally make use of without a monolithic migration
effort.</p>

<p>Runtime enforcement of nullness can be implemented with explicit checks or calls
to the <code>Objects.requireNonNull</code> standard API. But consistently applying these
checks is tedious, necessitates additional documentation work, and makes
programs harder to read. There's no way to apply these checks directly to
variable storage, particularly fields and arrays.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8325803" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)</a> allows
constructors to execute statements before a <code>super(...)</code> call and allows
assignments to instance fields in this context. These changes facilitate the
initialization requirements of null-restricted fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8316779" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Null-Restricted Value Class Types (Preview)</a> will optimize
the encodings of null-restricted, value-class-typed fields and arrays, and
may allow some value classes to declare their own default values.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/402" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">JEP 402: Enhanced Primitive Boxing (Preview)</a> will track nullness as
it makes wider use of implicit boxing conversions in the language.</p></li>
<li><p>JVM class and method specialization (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/218" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">JEP 218</a>, with revisions) will
allow generic classes and methods to reify and enforce the nullness of
(at least some of) their type arguments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other possible future enhancements building on this JEP may include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Applying nullness markers to certain parts of the standard APIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing the JVM to provide a concise, minimal-footprint way to express a
null check in bytecode.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing the JVM to provide stronger low-level enforcement of null-restricted
method parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing a mechanism in the language to assert that all types in a certain
context are implicitly null-restricted, without requiring the programmer to
use explicit <code>!</code> symbols.</p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

          

          

          <p>Recently at <em>Internet Archive</em> a “glitch” (<a href="https://archive.org/post/2435138/archives-removed-my-account-and-deleted-all-my-uploaded-files">their choice of word</a>) deleted a great many accounts, including my account that had been at <a href="https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman">https://archive.org/details/@gingerbeardman</a> since 2015.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, they are not reaching out to affected users but rather waiting for them to create new accounts and silently relinking their old uploads <em>only if the new account has same email as the old account</em>. Otherwise, all profile metadata, favourites, lists, reviews, posts, collections, web archives, and the original username are not being relinked. For me that’s a decade of data…gone.</p>

<p>The main impact of this massive data loss, that happened around mid-July, is that there are now dead links to old profiles and various old pages all across the internet, plus the additional impact of lost data that is not being recovered. It’s a real blow to the broader preservation effort to know that <em>the one place where data is supposed to be safe forever has had a massive data loss</em> and the organisation responsible are not taking proactive steps to address the issue fully.</p>

<p>The extent of the data loss and how many accounts were affected is currently unknown. And because they’re not really talking about it, it’s quite difficult to find any concrete information as to the extent or cause of the data loss. You can find <a href="https://archive.org/iathreads/forum-display.php?forum=general">more info at the <em>Internet Archive</em> forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetarchive/s/YFihAFXzE8">the /r/internetarchive subreddit</a>, or your choice of social media where <em>Internet Archive</em> have a presence (Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=login%20to%3Ainternetarchive&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">ref1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=account%20to%3Ainternetarchive&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">ref2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="support-up-to-a-point">Support, up to a point</h2>

<p>My support experience with <em>Internet Archive</em> was frustrating and ultimately futile. They did not adequately address my queries and requests. Instead they made changes to my account that I did not request, and in the end were pretty clear that they were not going to help me any further. This is such a disappointing stance to take with users who are simply trying to recover their data as a result of loss caused by <em>Internet Archive</em> itself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud is giving Y Combinator startups access to a dedicated, subsidized cluster of Nvidia graphics processing units and Google tensor processing units to build AI models. It’s part of Google Cloud’s effort to cozy up with promising early-stage AI startups, in hopes some of them will evolve into massive, compute-hungry businesses.</p>

<p>“We want to surround them with a lot of love and warmth early in their life cycle so they get familiarized with building and working on the Google Cloud Platform,” said general manager for Google Cloud’s startups and AI business, James Lee, in an interview with TechCrunch. “As they stick around, we grow as they grow, and we become a partner of theirs throughout their life cycle.”</p>

	
	


<p>Specifically, Google will provide a dedicated cluster with priority access for YC’s Summer 2024 startups, along with $350,000 in cloud credits over two years for each participating startup. The idea is that a future unicorn will fall in love with building on Google Cloud. Five percent of Y Combinator startups over the last 18 years have become unicorns with billion-dollar-plus valuations, YC group partner Diana Hu tells TechCrunch, so it’s a decent bet for Google to make on this partnership.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of excitement that the next generation of startups will probably not just unicorn, but decacorn, and they’re getting built as we speak,” said Hu. “Cloud providers are still catching up in terms of how to price them, but they do know if you catch them early on, you’re going to ride the wave with them.”</p>

<p>On the flip side, Y Combinator says it can attract more AI startups to apply by offering generous compute resources alongside its investment and guidance. For early-stage AI startups, Hu says one of the most common issues she hears is that startups are compute-restrained. Large enterprises are able to strike multi-year, massive deals with cloud providers for GPU access, but small startups are often left out to dry. She says partnerships like these go a long way, especially when you have a dedicated cluster — that’s particularly important for training AI models.</p>

<p>“For GPU and AI workloads, they’re more like high performance computing workloads in batches. You don’t need the server running all the time, but you need a lot of them in a spiky workload,” said Hu. “So we have a dedicated cluster that YC companies can just use.”</p>

<p>As part of the partnership, Google will also offer YC startups $12,000 in Enhanced Support credits and a free year of Google Workspace Business Plus. YC startups can also connect with Google’s internal AI experts through monthly office hours.</p>


<p>Startup accelerators and venture capital firms are offering GPU clusters more and more these days. Andreessen Horowitz reportedly has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-is-building-a-stash-of-more-than-20-000-gpus-to-win-ai-deals?rc=dp0mql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a stash of 20,000 GPUs</a> to attract AI startups. Google Cloud and Y Combinator would not reveal the exact number in this deal, but Hu says it’s sufficient for YC’s foundation model companies to train models on.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cscglobal.com/cscglobal/home/">Clown Services Company</a> is a company used by companies like CrowdStrike to submit bogus takedowns and commit cyberbullying.</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/csc-logo-full.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>It seems as though CrowdStrike is not exactly a fan of this site, understandable… it is a parody site after all…</p>
<p>Don’t worry though! They will definitely solve all their problems by sending a baseless takedown notice to CloudFlare! (sarcasm)</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/clowdstrike-resp1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, I don’t really care about their feelings, and how upset this site makes them, or how much they cry at night knowing that there are people out in the world making fun of CrowdStrike for causing the worst IT outage in the world (so far!).
Stranding millions of airlines passengers, and causing <em>billions</em> of dollars worth of damage…</p>

<p>Of course, I did not want to piss off CloudFlare either, and I’m most definitely not trying to put CloudFlare in the middle on this… so I told CloudFlare that I will take the site off of CloudFlare; however, it is staying on the internet…</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/abuse-resp1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is unfortunately <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/what-really-does-and-doesnt-work-fair-use-dmca">well known</a> that the DMCA is used by corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice system is also hillariously ineffective. The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/512/">DMCA</a> requires service providers to “act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material;” yet, it gives those same “service providers” <em>14 days</em> to restore access in the event of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing more than to have a lawsuit “win” against CrowdStrike. That would be absolutely <em>amazing</em> for marketing! Especially given the timing of such events…</p>
<p>Additionally, using the Digital Millenium <em>Copyright</em> Act to attempt to takedown a parody site for <em>Trademark Infringement</em> is absolutely hillarious.</p>
<p>There are several ways that <em>anyone</em> is allowed to use a trademark belonging to “others.” This is considered “Fair Use.” Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc. Corporate cyberbullies don’t like that anyone else has rights. Again, I don’t care, because the only thing that matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily…</strong> Parody is a well recognized “right” for “fair use”</p>

<p>Seeing as how this site is an <em>obvious</em> parody, that any “reasonable person” would be able to cleary identify <strong>AND</strong> there is no commercial use, no product being sold, no money being made in any way, shape, or form…</p>
<p>You can go straight to hell CrowdStrike. This is fair use. Fuck your feelings. Now… <a href="https://clownstrike.lol/">Return to Clownin’</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">xdg-override</h2><a id="user-content-xdg-override" aria-label="Permalink: xdg-override" href="#xdg-override"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Override <code>xdg-open</code> behavior. Because the way it already works is not confusing enough.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is <code>xdg-open</code> and what <code>xdg-override</code> does?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-xdg-open-and-what-xdg-override-does" aria-label="Permalink: What is xdg-open and what xdg-override does?" href="#what-is-xdg-open-and-what-xdg-override-does"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>xdg-open</code> is a GNU/Linux application that "opens" files and URLs in user's preferred application:</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, open <code>avatar.png</code> in the default image viewer</p>

<p dir="auto">Or open <code>https://freedesktop.org</code> URL in the default browser</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ xdg-open &quot;https://freedesktop.org&quot;"><pre><code>~ ❯ xdg-open "https://freedesktop.org"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Most application on GNU/Linux by convention delegate to <code>xdg-open</code> when they need to open a file or a URL. This ensures consistent behavior between applications and desktop environments: URLs are always opened in our preferred browser, images are always opened in the same preferred viewer.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are situations when this consistent behavior is not desired: for example, if we need to override default browser just for one application and only temporarily. This is where <code>xdg-override</code> helps: it replaces <code>xdg-open</code> with itself to alter the behavior without changing system settings.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if our default browser is Firefox, and we want Chromium to be our default browser in Slack messanger, we can launch Slack like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ xdg-override --match &quot;^https?://&quot; chromium slack"><pre><code>~ ❯ xdg-override --match "^https?://" chromium slack
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h2><a id="user-content-how-does-it-work" aria-label="Permalink: How does it work?" href="#how-does-it-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Two words: <code>PATH</code> manipulation.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can read the explanation of how <code>xdg-override</code> works and about my motivation in my blog post <a href="https://127001.me/post/change-browser-in-slack/" rel="nofollow">How do you change browser in Slack anyway?</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation and running</h2><a id="user-content-installation-and-running" aria-label="Permalink: Installation and running" href="#installation-and-running"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you use Nix, you can install <code>xdg-override</code> from the flake, or you can try it without installation like this</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="~ ❯ nix run github:koiuo/xdg-override -- --match &quot;^https://&quot; chromium slack"><pre><code>~ ❯ nix run github:koiuo/xdg-override -- --match "^https://" chromium slack
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For everyone else, place the script anywhere you wish and execute it from there. It does not require any configs, and it only creates some temporary files under <code>/tmp</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>gitopper [OPTION]...</code> <code>-c</code> <strong>CONFIG</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Description</h2><a id="user-content-description" aria-label="Permalink: Description" href="#description"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper is GitOps for non-Kubernetes folks it watches a remote git repo, pulls changes and HUP the
server (service) process.</p>
<p dir="auto">A sparse (but with full history) git checkout will be done, so each service will only see the files
it will actually need. Several bind mounts are then setup to give the service access to the file(s)
in Git. If the target directories don't exist, they will be created, with the current user - if
specified.</p>
<p dir="auto">This tool does little more than just pull the repo, but the little it brings to the table allows for
a GitOps workflow without resorting to Kubernetes like environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Git repository that you are using to provision the services must have at least one
(sub)directory for each service.</p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper will install packages if told to do so. It will not upgrade or downgrade them, assuming
there is a better way of doing those.</p>
<p dir="auto">The remote interface of gitopper uses SSH keys for authentication, this hopefully helps to fit in,
in a sysadmin organisation.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following features are implemented:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Metrics</em>: are included see below, they export a Git hash, so a rollout can be tracked.</li>
<li><em>Diff detection</em>: possible using the metrics or gitopperctl.</li>
<li><em>Out of band rollbacks</em>: use gitopperctl to bypass the normal Git workflow.</li>
<li><em>No client side processing</em>: files are used as they are in the Git repo.</li>
<li><em>Canarying</em>: give a service a different branch to check out.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The options are:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-h, --hosts strings</strong>
:  hosts (comma separated) to impersonate, local hostname is always added</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-c, --config string</strong>
:  config file to read</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-s, --ssh string</strong>
:  ssh address to listen on (default ":2222")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-m, --metric string</strong>
:  http metrics address to listen on (default ":9222")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-d, --debug</strong>
:  enable debug logging</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-r, --restart</strong>
:   send SIGHUP to ourselves when config changes</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-o, --root</strong>
:  require root permission, setting to false can aid in debugging (default true)</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-t, --duration duration</strong>
:  default duration between pulls (default 5m0s)</p>
<p dir="auto">For bootstrapping gitopper itself the following options are available:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-U, --upstream string</strong>
:  use this git repo to clone and to bootstrap from</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-D, --directory string</strong>
:  directory to sparse checkout (default "gitopper")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-B, --branch string</strong>
:   check out in this branch (default "main")</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-M, --mount string</strong>
:   check out into this directory, -c is relative to this directory</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>-P, --pull</strong>
:   pull (update) the git repo to the newest version before starting</p>

<p dir="auto">And things should work then. I.e. in /etc/prometheus you should see the content of the
<em>miekg/gitopper-config</em> repository. Note that the prometheus package is installed, because <code>package</code>
is mentioned in the config file.</p>
<p dir="auto">The checked out git repo in /tmp/prometheus should <em>only</em> contain the prometheus directory thanks to
the sparse checkout. Changes made to any other subdirectory in that repo do not trigger a prometheus
reload.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then with gitopperctl(8) you can query the server:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="./gitopperctl -i <path-to-your-key> list service @localhost

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Services</h2><a id="user-content-services" aria-label="Permalink: Services" href="#services"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A service can be in 5 states: OK, FREEZE, ROLLBACK (which is a FREEZE to a previous commit) and
BROKEN/DIFF.</p>
<p dir="auto">These state are not carried over when gitopper crashes/stops (maybe we want this to be persistent,
would be nice to have this state in the git repo somehow?).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>OK</code>: everything is running and we're tracking upstream.</li>
<li><code>FREEZE</code>: everything is running, but we're not tracking upstream.</li>
<li><code>ROLLBACK</code>: everything is running, but we're not tracking upstream <em>and</em> we're pinned to an older
commit. This state is quickly followed by FREEZE if we were successful rolling back, otherwise
BROKEN (systemd error)  of DIFF (git error)</li>
<li><code>BROKEN</code>: something with the service is broken, we're still tracking upstream. I.e. systemd error.</li>
<li><code>DIFF</code>: the git repository can't be reconciled with upstream. I.e. git error.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">ROLLBACK is a transient state and quickly moves to FREEZE, unless something goes wrong then it
becomes BROKEN, or DIFF depending on what goes wrong (systemd, or git respectively).</p>

<p dir="auto">Note that <code>machine</code> above should match either the machine name ($HOSTNAME) or any of the values you
give on the <code>-h</code> flag. This allows you to create services that run everywhere, by defining a service
that have name (say) "localhost" and then deploying gitopper with <code>-h localhost</code> on every machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Options for each service:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>machine</code>: the machine where this service should be active. By default <code>gitopper</code> will know the
current hostname, but multiple aliases may be given to it via the <code>-h</code> flag.</li>
<li><code>service</code>: what systemd unit file is used to call <code>action</code> on. If service contains an <code>@</code> a
service template unit is assumed and gitopper will then run <code>systemctl enable &lt;service&gt;</code> to enable
the service template.</li>
<li><code>action</code>: action to use when calling <code>systemctl &lt;service&gt;</code>. If empty no systemd command will be
issued when the repo changes.</li>
<li><code>branch</code>: what branch to use in the checked out repo. Note different branches that use the <em>same</em>
repository on disk, will error on startup.</li>
<li><code>package</code>: what package to install for this service. If empty, no package will be installed.</li>
<li><code>user</code>: what user should the git repository belong to.</li>
<li><code>dirs</code>: describe the mapping between directories and files in the repository and on the local
disk. <code>local</code> is the <em>on disk</em> name, and <code>link</code> is the <em>relative</em> path of the directory or file in
the git repo. If a single file is used, <code>file</code> should be set to true.</li>

<p dir="auto">Moving to a new user, will break git pull, with an error like 'dubious ownership of repository'. If
you want a different owner for a service, it's best to change the mount as well so you get a new
repo. Gitopper is currently not smart enough to detect this and fix things on the fly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Interface</h2><a id="user-content-interface" aria-label="Permalink: Interface" href="#interface"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper opens two ports: 9222 for metrics and 2222 for the rest-protocol-over-SSH. For any
interaction with gitopper over this port your key must be configured for it.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following services are implemented:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>List all defined machines.</li>
<li>List services run on the machine.</li>
<li>List a specific service.</li>
<li>Freeze a service to the current git commit.</li>
<li>Unfreeze a service, i.e. to let it pull again.</li>
<li>Rollback a service to a specific commit.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For each of these gitopperctl(8) will execute a "command" and will parse the returned JSON into a nice
table.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Metrics</h2><a id="user-content-metrics" aria-label="Permalink: Metrics" href="#metrics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following metrics are exported:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>gitopper_service_state{"service"} &lt;state&gt;</li>
<li>gitopper_service_change_time_seconds{"service"} &lt;epoch&gt;</li>
<li>gitopper_machine_git_errors_total - total number of errors when running git.</li>
<li>gitopper_machine_git_ops_total - total number of git runs.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exit Code</h2><a id="user-content-exit-code" aria-label="Permalink: Exit Code" href="#exit-code"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Gitopper has following exit codes:</p>
<p dir="auto">0 - normal exit
2 - SIGHUP seen (signal to systemd to restart us)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bootstrapping</h2><a id="user-content-bootstrapping" aria-label="Permalink: Bootstrapping" href="#bootstrapping"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple of options that allow gitopper to bootstrap itself <em>and</em> make gitopper to be
managed by gitopper. Basically those options allow you to specify a service on the command line.
Gitopper will check out the repo and then proceed to read the config <em>in that repo</em> and setup

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23385652/pat-gelsinger-intel-chips-act-ohio-manufacturing-chip-shortage">long, long road to recovery</a>, and over 15,000 workers will no longer be coming along for the ride. The chipmaker <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1704/intel-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results">just announced</a> it’s downsizing its workforce by over 15 percent as part of a new $10 billion cost savings plan for 2025, which will mean a headcount reduction of greater than 15,000 roles, Intel tells <em>The Verge</em>. The company currently employs over 125,000 workers, so layoffs could be as many as 19,000 people.</p><p>Intel will reduce its R&amp;D and marketing spend by billions each year through 2026; it will reduce capital expenditures by more than 20 percent this year; it will restructure to “stop non-essential work,” and it’ll review “all active projects and equipment” to make sure it’s not spending too much.</p><p>“This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read,” reads part of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/actions-accelerate-our-progress.html#gs.cgovp0">a memo</a> from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to staff, which you can also read in full at the bottom of this post.</p><div><p>“We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work...”</p></div><p>The company just reported a loss of $1.6 billion for Q2 2024, substantially more than the $437 million it lost last quarter. “Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones,” admitted Gelsinger in the company’s press release. “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI,” he writes in his employee memo. </p><p>Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down just 1 percent year over year, and it’s not like all of Intel’s businesses are failing. While Intel has absolutely been losing money on its chipmaking Foundry business as it invests in new factories and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119454/intels-chipmaking-business-7-billion-loss">to the tune of $7 billion in operating losses in 2023</a> and another $2.8 billion this quarter, the company’s products themselves aren’t unprofitable. </p><p>Almost all the losses this quarter and last quarter came from Foundry, while its sales continue to stay relatively stable and its PC and server businesses stay profitable. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195376/pc-industry-growth-wasnt-a-fluke">The PC sales slump ended</a> earlier this year.) The company is also set to receive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106596/intel-is-set-to-receive-up-to-8-5-billion-of-chips-act-funding">up to $8.5 billion in US government funding</a> from the CHIPS Act.</p><p>But investors didn’t seem happy that the company kept itself on a knife’s edge: over the past two years, before this quarterly loss, it had continued to swing between losses and profits overall, for just $1.1 billion in cumulative between Q2 2022 and Q1 2024. “Intel is now the worst-performing tech stock in the S&amp;P 500 this year,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/26/intel-dominated-us-chip-industry-now-struggling-to-stay-relevant.html">CNBC wrote in April</a>. </p><p>From a tech leadership perspective, Intel’s not yet a big player in AI server chips like Nvidia (maybe not even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209938/amd-q2-2024-earnings-datacenter-ai-revenue">a notable small one like AMD</a>), its relatively recent entry into graphics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23650611/intel-raja-koduri-gpus-amd-nvidia-apple-leave-ai-startup">has yet to impress</a>, and it had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">overhaul its flagship laptop chips significantly</a> to address the existential threat of Arm chips from the likes of Qualcomm and Apple, which can offer more battery life than Intel. Like competitors, the company now partially relies on TSMC, not just its own foundries, to help produce some of its most advanced chips.</p><p>Microsoft recently followed Apple’s lead in ditching Intel chips for its latest slate of consumer hardware, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185462/microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition-review">the Surface Laptop</a> and Surface Pro, and launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160486/microsoft-copilot-plus-ai-arm-chips-pc-surface-event">its Copilot Plus PC initiative</a> exclusively with Qualcomm, without waiting for Intel (or AMD)’s new flagship laptop chips to join them. Intel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">currently dealing with two generations of potentially defective desktop CPUs</a>, though the company currently believes it can mitigate the issue with a software update and doesn’t currently plan recalls.</p><p>On the company’s earnings call today, Intel CFO David Zinsner just suggested that the company’s next flagship AI laptop chip, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">Lunar Lake</a>, won’t be enough by itself to turn things around. </p><p>While he says “the AI PC is a big winner for the company,” and Intel plans to “ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand,” he also described Lunar Lake as a “narrow targeted product” that relies on “external wafers” (read: manufactured by TSMC, not Intel). Intel also needs to buy the memory it’s including on each chip, as Lunar Lake laptops <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24169115/intel-lunar-lake-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">don’t have separate memory sticks</a>. </p><p>Those are reasons why Lunar Lake will only modestly improve the company’s situation in 2025, he says. </p><p>“The good news is the follow-on product, Panther Lake, is internally sourced on [Intel’s own process] 18A and has a much-improved cost structure,” says Zinsner. Lunar Lake is coming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209778/intel-lunar-lake-launch-core-ultra-september-3rd">as soon as this September</a>. Panther Lake will start ramping in the second half of 2025, but the “huge volume benefits” of that chip won’t come until 2026, says Gelsinger. </p><p>On server chips, Gelsinger says Intel is “having to fight to win sockets” away from AI chipmakers but that Intel’s own Granite Rapids Xeon server processors are looking “very positive.  </p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Intel plans to reduce spend by billions each year.

Here’s how it’ll begin.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div></div><p>Intel previously had a big round of layoffs in October 2022, when it also announced it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/27/23427403/intel-q3-2022-layoffs-billions-cost-reductions">would cut between $8 billion and $10 billion in costs every year</a> through 2025. But the company didn’t shrink all that much as a result. While headcount dipped roughly 5 percent in 2023 (from 131,900 employees to 124,800 employees), Intel hired its way back to 130,700 employees as of March 30th, 2024, its financial records show.</p><p>Intel says it’ll complete the majority of the layoffs it’s announcing today by the end of 2024, and spokesperson Penelope Bruce confirms that they are new layoffs — the 4 percent dip from 130,700 employees in March to 125,300 employees in June is not included in the total.</p><p>Gelsinger writes that Intel will offer a “companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees” and let employees broadly apply for voluntary layoffs starting next week — not every employee departure will come as a painful surprise.</p><p>Intel says it’s now restructuring, suspending its dividend, and spending less, period, but will “maintain its core investments to execute its strategy and build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. and around the world.”</p><p>Here’s the full memo from Gelsinger:</p><div><blockquote><p>Team,</p><p>We have moved our All Company Meeting to today, following our earnings call, as we are&nbsp;<a href="https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2024/corporate/2Q-24-earnings-release-89T32a86.pdf">announcing significant actions to reduce our costs</a>. We plan to deliver $10 billion in cost savings in 2025, and this includes reducing our head count by roughly 15,000 roles, or 15% of our workforce. The majority of these actions will be completed by the end of this year.</p><p>This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history. When we meet in a few hours, I’ll talk about why we’re doing this and what you can expect in the coming weeks. In advance of that, I wanted to preview some of what’s on my mind.</p><p>Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected – and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.</p><p>These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come.</p><p>Next week, we’ll announce a companywide enhanced retirement offering for eligible employees and broadly offer an application program for voluntary departures. I believe that&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we implement these changes is just as important as the changes themselves, and we will adhere to Intel values throughout this process.</p><p><strong>Why Now?</strong></p><p>Since introducing our new operating model, we have taken a clean-sheet view of the business and assessed ourselves against benchmarks for high-performing foundries, fabless product companies and corporate functions. This work made it clear our cost structure is not competitive.</p><p>For example, our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then. There are a lot of reasons for this, but it’s not a sustainable path forward.</p><p>Beyond our costs, we need to change the way we operate – something many of you shared as part of our Employee Experience Survey. There’s too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there’s too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.</p><p><strong>Key Priorities</strong></p><p>The actions we are taking will make Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company. Let me highlight our areas of focus:</p><p><strong>Reducing Operational Costs:</strong>&nbsp;We will drive companywide operational and cost efficiencies, including the cost savings and head count reductions mentioned above.</p><p><strong>Simplifying Our Portfolio:</strong>&nbsp;We will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses. Each business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.</p><p><strong>Eliminating Complexity:</strong>&nbsp;We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work, and foster a culture of greater ownership and accountability. For example, we will consolidate Customer Success into the Sales, Marketing and Communications Group to streamline our go-to-market motions.</p><p><strong>Reducing Capital and Other Costs:</strong>&nbsp;With the completion of our historic five-nodes-in-four-years roadmap clearly in sight, we will review all active projects and equipment so we begin to shift our focus toward capital efficiency and more normalized spending levels. This will reduce our 2024 capital expenditures by more than 20%, and we plan to reduce our non-variable cost of goods sold by roughly $1 billion in 2025.</p><p><strong>Suspending Our Dividend:</strong>&nbsp;We will suspend our stock dividend beginning next quarter to prioritize investments in the business and drive more sustained profitability.</p><p><strong>Maintaining Growth Investments:</strong>&nbsp;Our IDM2.0 strategy is unchanged. Having fought hard to reestablish our innovation engine, we will maintain the key investments in our process technology and core product leadership.</p><p><strong>The Future</strong></p><p>I have no illusions that the path in front of us will be easy. You shouldn’t either. This is a tough day for all of us and there will be more tough days ahead. But as difficult as all of this is, we are making the changes necessary to build on our progress and usher in a new era of growth.</p><p>When we began this journey, we set our sights high, knowing that Intel is a place where big ideas are born and the power of what’s possible triumphs over the status quo. After all, our mission is to create world-changing technologies that improve the lives of every person on the planet. And at our best, we have exemplified these ideals more than any company in the world.</p><p>To live up to this mission, we must continue to drive our IDM 2.0 strategy, which remains the same: re-establish process technology leadership; invest in at-scale, globally resilient supply chain by expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and EU; become a world-class, leading-edge foundry for internal and external customers; rebuild product portfolio leadership; and deliver AI Everywhere.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have rebuilt a sustainable innovation engine that is largely in place and on track. It’s now time to focus on building the sustainable financial engine needed to drive our performance. We must improve our execution, adapt to new market realities and operate as a more agile company. That’s the spirit of the actions we are taking – knowing that the choices we make today, as difficult as they are, will strengthen our ability to serve our customers and grow our business for years to come.</p><p>As we take these next steps in our journey, let’s not forget that there has never been a greater need for what we do. The world will increasingly run on silicon – and the world needs a healthy and vibrant Intel. That’s why the work we are doing is so consequential. Not only are we remaking a great company, but we are also creating technology and manufacturing capabilities that will reshape the world for decades to come. And this is something we should never lose sight of as we push forward in pursuit of our goals.</p><p>We’ll talk more in a few hours. Please come with your questions so we can have an open and honest discussion about what comes next.</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, August 1st: </strong>Added more details from the earnings call about Intel’s expectations for its upcoming Lunar Lake and Panther Lake chips.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Intel Corporation today reported second-quarter 2024 financial results.

</p>
<p>
“Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones. Second-half trends are more challenging than we previously expected, and we are leveraging our new operating model to take decisive actions that will improve operating and capital efficiencies while accelerating our IDM 2.0 transformation,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “These actions, combined with the launch of Intel 18A next year to regain process technology leadership, will strengthen our position in the market, improve our profitability and create shareholder value.”

</p>
<p>
“Second-quarter results were impacted by gross margin headwinds from the accelerated ramp of our AI PC product, higher than typical charges related to non-core businesses and the impact from unused capacity,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “By implementing our spending reductions, we are taking proactive steps to improve our profits and strengthen our balance sheet. We expect these actions to meaningfully improve liquidity and reduce our debt balance while enabling us to make the right investments to drive long-term value for shareholders.”

</p>
<p>
As Intel nears the completion of rebuilding a sustainable engine of process technology leadership, it announced a series of initiatives to create a sustainable financial engine that accelerates profitable growth, enables further operational efficiency and agility, and creates capacity for ongoing strategic investment in technology and manufacturing leadership. These initiatives follow the establishment of separate financial reporting for Intel Products and Intel Foundry, which provides a "clean sheet" view of the business and has uncovered significant opportunities to drive meaningful operational and cost efficiencies. The actions include structural and operating realignment across the company, headcount reductions, and operating expense and capital expenditure reductions of more than $10 billion in 2025 compared to previous estimates. As a result of these actions, Intel aims to achieve clear line of sight toward a sustainable business model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support the company’s long-term strategy.

</p>
<p>
The plan will enable the next phase of the company’s multiyear transformation strategy, and is focused on four key priorities:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reducing Operating Expenses:</b> The company will streamline its operations and meaningfully cut spending and headcount, reducing non-GAAP R&amp;D and marketing, general and administrative (MG&amp;A) to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and approximately $17.5 billion in 2025, with further reductions expected in 2026. Intel expects to reduce headcount by greater than 15% with the majority completed by the end of 2024.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reducing Capital Expenditures: </b>With the end of its historic five-nodes-in-four-years journey firmly in sight, Intel is now shifting its focus toward capital efficiency and investment levels aligned to market requirements. This will reduce gross capital expenditures* in 2024 by more than 20% from prior projections, bringing gross capital expenditures in 2024 to between $25 billion and $27 billion. Intel expects net capital spending* in 2024 of between $11 billion and $13 billion. In 2025, the company is targeting gross capital expenditures between $20 billion and $23 billion and net capital spending between $12 billion and $14 billion.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reducing Cost of Sales:</b> The company expects to generate $1 billion in savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Product mix will continue to be a headwind next year, contributing to modest YoY improvements to 2025's gross margin.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Maintaining Core Investments to Execute Strategy:</b> The company continues to advance its long-term innovation and path to leadership across process technology and products, and the increased efficiency from its actions is expected to further support its execution. In addition, Intel continues to sustain investments to build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain in the United States and around the world.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Intel is taking the added step of suspending the dividend starting in the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute its strategy. The company reiterates its long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels.

<span>Business Unit Summary</span>

</p>
<p>
Intel previously announced the implementation of an internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024 and created a foundry relationship between its Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI and NEX) and its Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services (formerly IFS)). The foundry operating model is a key component of the company's strategy and is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. The company also previously announced its intent to operate Altera<sup>® </sup>as a standalone business beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in DCAI's segment results. As a result of these changes, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors its operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.

<b>Intel Products Highlights</b>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>CCG:</b> Intel continues to define and drive the AI PC category, shipping more than 15 million AI PCs since December 2023, far more than all of Intel's competitors combined, and on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year-end. Lunar Lake, the company’s next-generation AI CPU, achieved production release in July 2024, ahead of schedule, with shipments starting in the third quarter. Lunar Lake will power over 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>DCAI:</b> More than 130 million Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> processors power data centers around the world today, and at Computex Intel introduced its next-generation Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>® </sup>6 processor with Efficient-cores (E-cores), code-named Sierra Forest, marking the company’s first Intel 3 server product architected for high-density, scale-out workloads. Intel expects Intel<sup>®</sup> Xeon<sup>®</sup> 6 processors with Performance-cores (P-cores), code-named Granite Rapids, to begin shipping in the third quarter of 2024. The Intel<sup>®</sup> Gaudi<sup>®</sup> 3 AI accelerator is also on track to launch in the third quarter and is expected to deliver roughly two-times the performance per dollar on both inference and training versus the leading competitor.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>NEX:</b> Intel announced an array of AI-optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions, including the Intel AI network interface card and foundry chiplets that will launch next year. New infrastructure processing unit (IPU) adaptors for the enterprise are now broadly available and supported by Dell Technologies, Red Hat and others. IPUs will play an increasingly important role in Intel’s accelerator portfolio, which the company expects will help drive AI data center growth and profitability in 2025 and beyond. Additionally, Intel and others announced the creation of the Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low-latency communication for scale-up AI systems communication in data centers.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Intel Foundry Highlights</b>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Intel is nearing the completion of its promised five-nodes-in-four-years strategy, with Intel 18A on track to be manufacturing-ready by the end of this year and production wafer start volumes in the first half of 2025. In July 2024, Intel released to foundry customers the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A. The company’s first two Intel 18A products, Panther Lake for client — the first microprocessor to use RibbonFet, PowerVia and advanced packaging — and Clearwater Forest for servers, are on track to launch in 2025.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Ansys, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys announced the availability of reference flows for Intel’s embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMIB) advanced packaging technology, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. The companies also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs.

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
During the quarter, Intel named industry veteran Kevin O'Buckley to lead Foundry Services. The company also recently appointed Dr. Naga Chandrasekaran to lead Intel Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain. Their leadership will support Intel’s continued development of the first systems foundry for the AI era.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Other Highlights</b>

</p>
<p>
Intel announced its second Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP) agreement, the formation of a joint venture with Apollo related to Intel’s Fab 34 in Ireland. SCIP is an element of Intel’s Smart Capital strategy, a funding approach designed to create financial flexibility to accelerate the company’s strategy, including investing in its global manufacturing operations, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

</p>
<p>
<span>Q3 2024 Dividend</span>

</p>
<p>
The company announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable Sept. 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Aug. 7, 2024.

Intel Corporation
<br>Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

</p>
<p>
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. Some of these non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.

</p>
<p>
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance.

</p>
<p>
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Acquisition-related adjustments

</p>

</td>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&amp;A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.

</p>



</td>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.

<p>
We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.

Restructuring charges are costs associated with a restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, and costs associated with restructuring activity. Q2 2024 includes a charge arising out of the R2 litigation.

We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance.

<br>Supplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Actuals to Non-GAAP Actuals

</p>
<p>
Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the reconciliations from US GAAP to Non-GAAP actuals should be carefully evaluated. Please refer to "Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures" in this document for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable US GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information for investors.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="ltr"><p>Hi all,</p><p>Starting September 1, Austin Clements will be taking over as the tech lead of Go: both the Go team at Google and the overall Go project. Austin is currently the tech lead for what we sometimes call the “Go core”, which encompasses compiler toolchain, runtime, and releases. Cherry Mui will be stepping up to lead those areas. </p><p>I am not leaving the Go project, but I think the time is right for a change.</p><p>It’s important to remember that tech lead—like any position of leadership—is a service role, not an honorary title. I have been leading the Go project for over 12 years, serving all of you, and trying to create the right conditions for all of you to do your best work. Large projects like Go absolutely benefit from stable leadership, but they can also benefit from leadership changes. New leaders bring new strengths and fresh perspectives. For Go, I think 12+ years of one leader is enough stability; it’s time for someone new to serve in this role. In particular, I don’t believe that the “BDFL” (benevolent dictator for life) model is healthy for a person or a project. It doesn’t create space for new leaders. It’s a single point of failure. It doesn’t give the project room to grow. I think Python benefited greatly from Guido stepping down in 2018 and letting other people lead, and I’ve had in the back of my mind for many years that we should have a Go leadership change eventually. </p><p>If you haven’t worked on the compiler toolchain or runtime, you may not know Austin or Cherry well. Austin has been working on Go at Google since 2014, Cherry since 2016. Their judgment is superb and their knowledge of Go and the systems it runs on both broad and deep. When I have general design questions or need to better understand details of the compiler, linker, or runtime, I turn to them. I’m very excited that we have such great new leaders available for this change. I have full confidence in Austin and Cherry stepping up, as well as in Roland Shoemaker continuing to lead Go security and Rob Findley and Hana Kim continuing to lead Go tools and IDE support.</p><p>I am going to consciously step back from decision making and create space for Austin and the others to step forward, but I am not disappearing. I will still be available to talk about Go designs, review CLs, answer obscure history questions, and generally help and support you all in whatever way I can. I will still file issues and send CLs from time to time, I have been working on a few potential new standard libraries, I will still advocate for Go across the industry, and I will be speaking about Go at GoLab in Italy in November.</p><p>I will be shifting my focus to work more on <a href="https://go.dev/s/oscar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://go.dev/s/oscar&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1722634203969000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1H045asWQfKOgIGaqYQI8A">Gaby and Oscar</a>, trying to make useful contributions in the Go issue tracker to help all of you work more productively. I am hopeful that work on Oscar will uncover ways to help open source maintainers that will be adopted by other projects, just like some of Go’s best ideas have been adopted by other projects. At the highest level, my goals for Oscar are to build something useful, learn something new, and chart a path for other projects. These are the same broad goals I’ve always had for our work on Go, so in that sense Oscar feels like a natural continuation.</p><p>I am incredibly proud of the work we have all accomplished together, and I am confident in the leaders both on the Go team at Google and in the Go community. You are all doing remarkable work, and I know you will continue to do that.</p><p>The exact details of this transition are yet to be decided. Part of the point of this mail is to ensure that we can discuss those details publicly. Austin and I are both committed to making the change seem like a non-event except for the Go project becoming stronger and better. Again, I’m not leaving Go and will still be around and participating as an individual contributor.</p><p>Please always feel free to continue to reach out whenever you need anything. And my thanks and congratulations to Austin and Cherry for stepping into their new roles.</p></div></div>]]></description>

	<li paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{170}" paraid="6549620">Proofpoint does not attribute this activity to a tracked TA, but research is ongoing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3 aria-level="3" paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{176}" paraid="849584846" role="heading">Overview&nbsp;</h3>

<p paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{182}" paraid="878739094">Proofpoint is tracking a cluster of cybercriminal threat activity leveraging Cloudflare Tunnels to deliver malware. Specifically, the activity abuses the TryCloudflare feature that allows an attacker to create a one-time tunnel without creating an account. Tunnels are a way to remotely access data and resources that are not on the local network, like using a virtual private network (VPN) or secure shell (SSH) protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{204}" paraid="1961165670">First observed in February 2024, the cluster increased activity in May through July, with most campaigns leading to Xworm, a remote access trojan (RAT), in recent months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{216}" paraid="281045025">In most campaigns, messages contain a URL or attachment leading to an internet shortcut (.URL) file. When executed, it establishes a connection to an external file share, typically via WebDAV, to download an LNK or VBS file. When executed, the LNK/VBS executes a BAT or CMD file that downloads a Python installer package and a series of Python scripts leading to malware installation. In some cases, file staging leverages the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">search-ms</a> protocol handler to retrieve the LNK from a WebDAV share. Typically in campaigns, a benign PDF is displayed to the user to appear legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{2}" paraid="1037406766">In June and July, nearly all observed campaigns delivered Xworm, but previous campaigns also delivered AsyncRAT, VenomRAT, GuLoader, and Remcos. Some campaigns will lead to multiple different malware payloads, with each unique Python script leading to the installation of a different malware.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{2}" paraid="1037406766"><img alt="Malware observed in related campaigns leveraging “trycloudflare” tunnels.&nbsp;&nbsp;" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f3a3c810-f10a-4baf-903e-25d54e40ad68" height="687" src="https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202024-07-25%20at%2011.56.08%E2%80%AFAM_0.png" width="929" loading="lazy"></p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{65}" paraid="1402929524">Campaign message volumes range from hundreds to tens of thousands of messages impacting dozens to thousands of organizations globally. In addition to English, researchers observed French, Spanish, and German language lures. Xworm, AsyncRAT, and VenomRAT campaigns are often higher volume than campaigns delivering Remcos or GuLoader. Lure themes vary, but typically include business-relevant topics like invoices, document requests, package deliveries, and taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{99}" paraid="568078709">While the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the campaigns remain consistent, the threat actor does appear to modify different parts of the attack chain to increase sophistication and defense evasion. For example, initial campaigns used little to no obfuscation in their helper scripts. The scripts often included detailed comments about the functionality of the code. However, this changed in June when the threat actors began to incorporate obfuscation in their code.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{29}" paraid="344042252">Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed in campaigns, Proofpoint assesses they can be attributed to one cluster of related activity.

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{43}" paraid="1838028986">The use of Cloudflare tunnels provide the threat actors a way to use temporary infrastructure to scale their operations providing flexibility to build and take down instances in a timely manner. This makes it harder for defenders and traditional security measures such as relying on static blocklists. Temporary Cloudflare instances allow attackers a low-cost method to stage attacks with helper scripts, with limited exposure for detection and takedown efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{79}" paraid="1849682704">Attackers’ use of Python scripts for malware delivery is notable. Packaging Python libraries and an executable installer alongside the Python scripts ensures the malware can be downloaded and run on hosts that did not previously have Python installed. Organizations should restrict the use of Python if it is not required for individuals’ job functions. This is not the first-time researchers have observed software packages delivered alongside malware files. In recent months Proofpoint has observed campaigns delivering Java-based malware that bundle a JAR and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) inside a ZIP to ensure the correct software is installed before executing the downloader or dropper.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{151}" paraid="579202293">The attack chain requires significant victim interaction in order to detonate the final payload, including clicking on the malicious link, double clicking on multiple files such as the LNK or VBS files, and unzipping compressed scripts. This gives the recipient multiple opportunities to identify suspicious activity and disrupt the attack chain before successful execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{171}" paraid="331722508">Threat actors are increasingly using WebDAV and Server Message Block (SMB) for payload staging and delivery as the cybercriminal ecosystem continues to experiment with different TTPs.

<p><b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is a small artist collective. Together, we explore the planned failability of modern technology at the bounds of the hyper-connected world. We research and test low-tech solutions and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future.</p>

<p>We live and work aboard a ship called <a href="https://100r.co/site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Sailing around the Pacific Ocean made us realize how fragile the modern computing stack was. Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>Over the years we have received the occasional request for internship, while we appreciate the interest, our small operating budget, erratic work schedule, and intermittent internet connection makes this too difficult. </p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/rabbits.polaroid.jpg" title="the rabbits" alt="A dithered scan of two polaroid photos taken by our friend Brady featuring the rabbits rek and dev, both wearing very comfy sweaters" loading="lazy">

<h2 id="story"><a href="https://100r.co/site/story.html">story</a></h2><p>Back in 2016, when first operating on a sailboat, we experienced frequent failures with both software &amp; hardware, largely due to our small <a href="https://100r.co/site/energy.html">energy</a> storage and lack of reliable connectivity. The solution was to create tools that would be better suited to the limits of our new situation. The objective was to replace the bloated, closed-source or subscription software that we were using to do creative work, such as Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton. We were somewhat familiar with web technologies, so we decided to build our programs on this new up and coming framework called Electron.</p>

<p>While solving some of our issues, Electron was rapidly increasing in size and despite it being open-source, soon joined the rest of the software that we wanted to do away with. Our focus shifted toward reducing our energy use, and to ensure reliability we began removing dependencies.</p>

<p>To transition toward our new goals, we developed offline web versions as temporary stand-ins while researching ways to build more resilient software. We eventually ported our tools to C, but while we had achieved ideal energy usage, portability was still an issue, so we kept looking. We learnt <a href="https://100r.co/site/6502_assembly.html">6502 Assembly</a>, seeing players run our games as NES roms on all these different platforms gave us an idea.</p>

<p>In 2021, we began designing a small virtual machine with a focus on implementability; meaning that moving forward, the applications themselves will no longer need to be ported. Instead, to make any one program available on a new platform, the emulator would be the only code needing to be modified, which is explicitly designed to be easily implemented.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. <a href="https://100r.co/site/uxn.html">Uxn</a> may solve our cross-platform issues, while being extremely light. It took us a long while to get here, we hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions [16.05.21].</p>

<h2 id="why_a_boat"><a href="https://100r.co/site/why_a_boat.html">why a boat</a></h2><img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/pino_03.png" loading="lazy">

<p>From 2012 to 2014, we lived in Japan. Rek was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a software company. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: <a href="https://100r.co/site/hiversaires.html">Hiversaires</a> &amp; <a href="https://100r.co/site/oquonie.html">Oquonie</a>. Originally from Québec, we were traveling back and forth between Canada and Japan often. We wanted to exit the wasteful loop of acquiring the necessities of life each time our lives were uprooted.</p>

<p>We had heard of people living on sailboats but neither of us had even stepped foot on one, nevertheless, we soon found ourselves watching the videos of <a href="https://youtu.be/Aub3MkFxpHE">David Wellsford</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek">Teresa Carey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA">Nike Steiger</a>, and became obsessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity.</p>

<p>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montréal and moved west to British Columbia, where we purchased <a href="https://100r.co/site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Our curiosity soon led us to make our first trip out to sea, which <i>escalated</i> into a circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Our life at sea changed how we work, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">how we think</a>. We've always made art, and always will, but now we are working on ways to keep doing that sustainably, which translates to making lean and open software that are backward-compatible.</p>

<q>A boat, for all its complexity, is in fact a version of simplicity, but of a satisfyingly complex kind. - Adam Nicolson</q>

<p>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see <a href="https://100r.co/site/tools_ecosystem.html">tools ecosystem</a> for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the <a href="https://100r.co/site/north_pacific_ocean.html">North Pacific Ocean</a>(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).</p>

We'd like to thank the following people: <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismyclone" target="_blank">Josh Auget</a> for the x250Thinkpad, <a href="https://twitter.com/johneternal" target="_blank">John Eternal</a> for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co/" target="_blank">Brian Crabtree</a> for the Pinebook, and <a href="https://lloydwilliams.co/" target="_blank">Lloyd Williams</a> for the MacbookAir 2013 11".</p>

<p><b>Main work stations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Rek: Macbook Air 2013 running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a><br><i>2023.11.18.  Uppercase replacement to fix broken keyboard</i>.</li>
	<li>Dev: x250Thinkpad running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Current issues:</b></p>

<p>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).</p>
<p><b>2023.11.18.</b> The Macbook Pro 2010 has a faulty bottom ram slot. The good news is that both ram modules still work, but we can now only use one(we can upgrade the working one for larger capacity).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> We are always looking for backup used laptops, if you can help us on that front, let us know at <b>rabbits ౷ 100r · co</b>.</p>

<p><b>Other work stations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>MacbookPro 2010 running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> <br><i>(changed battery, for the third time, bit too power demanding to use at anchor)</i></li>
	<li>ChromeBook running ChromeOS<br><i>(working, low-power, but doesn't permit the use of Uxn tools, can barely run Gimp)</i></li>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/wiki.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><b>Wiki</b>. In April 2021, this website was converted into a wiki. This type of website is a kind of archive and mirror of everything that we have done, and that we have learnt. It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go.</p>

<p>Rek is the steward of this wiki, and authors most of its write-ups and articles(unless stated otherwise). Devine proofreads Rek's writing, and appends to the documentation of our projects regularly. You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">.zip</a>.</p>

<p>In all that is shared on the many pages populating this wiki, we reserve the right to be wrong, and to change our minds. We are always learning, and deepening our view and understanding of any one thing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/knowledge/wiki.jpg" alt="a drawing of a book laying in grass with the title reading wiki, 100r" loading="lazy">

<p><b>Videos</b>. Between 2016 and 2020, we filmed our travels. We filmed regularly, but kept many experiences to ourselves, wishing to be present during worthwhile moments instead of hiding behind a lens. At the end of each month, we would watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. We planned the monthly <a href="https://100r.co/site/videos.html">videos</a> ahead, and we would gather footage based on what we needed. While one was busy recording the narration, the other would write music. We had our respective tasks when it came time to edit, but both of us took part in the filming.</p>

<p>In rough weather, we prioritize our own safety above all, and so we rarely had footage of rough seas.</p>

<p>What we use to film and edit our <a href="https://100r.co/site/videos.html">videos</a>:</p>

We're defining what “AI co-pilots” truly mean in marketing for small brands. This is a team that's helped brands grow for 20+ years and had several exits before. Not random founders. Not a random problem. Not randomly playing around with "gen ai." In fact, gen AI is only part of what we do.</p><p>Who Are We Looking For?</p><p>An entrepreneurial Lead AI Engineer to help us innovate and scale our asset generation across images, video, and HTML generation.

Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

15+ years hands-on engineering experience and CTO / Head of Engineering leadership experience. Highly empathetic individual, concerned with UX and DX alike.</p><p>At this stage of my career I'm more interested in interesting problems rather than role / title. Big on social impact w/ my most recent roles being in EdTech. Am interested in technically challenging work too, but I do a bit of reverse engineering and open source development in my free time, so slight preference towards providing social value.</p><p>Github gives a good idea of my breadth with projects I built ranging from reverse engineered firmware flashing software for Samsung phones to IDEs that bolt static type checking onto Lua. There's more typical stuff like React libraries, tooling and contributions to React, auth libraries (Supabase) etc. If there's a bug blocking my team anywhere in our stack, I'll contribute a fix myself. Plenty of experience building engineering teams/departments, hiring, defining and implementing process and setting up green field projects (CI/CD, tooling etc.)</p></div></td></tr>

  Email: stephan dot fassmann at gmail</p><p>You need a Technical Writer. You have developers that have trained extensively to talk to computers often in multiple languages. And it is hard enough to write documentation for other developers. Asking them to create documentation talking to users, system administrators, DevOps and management are even more dialects because they speak in their own jargon, and it costs a lot of their very expensive time. 
I know technology, hardware, software, firmware and more. In tech, medical, aerospace, automotive and IT industries. I can do the translating for developers so they can concentrate on making the hard stuff. 
I also know user experience (UX) I can guide you to make better user interfaces and keep you from making those mistakes that cripple many products.</p></div></td></tr>

Over the last years I've built and scaled shops from 0 to 7 figures in print on demand businesses while highly automating the processes needed for that.

I've lead and build small teams to focus on different tasks along the whole supply chain.</p><p>After several years in my current job I'm looking at what I've built there and am missing the hype of starting on a plain field.

Technologies: (Vanilla) HTML/CSS/JS</p><p>Résumé/CV: Nothing relevant.</p><p>GED, some college (web design &amp; dev), and have been programming as a hobby for 18 years. I'm most comfortable with JS, but am liking CSS3 the more I use flex and grid. I learned to read documentation from the Java and Android docs, so I love well-written detailed language documentation like on Mozilla Dev Network. I use/used Travis-CI, AppVeyor, and now GH Actions for CI/CD including testing, building and publishing artifacts to GitHub Releases (if any), code coverage (nyc or c8 for Node/JS, kcov for Bash) with `codecov` for reporting, and automated code reviews by `Codacy` (if the language/project is supported).</p><p>My projects are largely experimentation for the sake of exploring and expanding my limitations, and low or zero dependencies unless there's something too complex to "reinvent the wheel". Currently I'm working on a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS editor-only VSCode clone. My most notable project yet is an Electron Linux/Mac/Win Steam client settings manager GUI app. It could modify most settings, included backup/restore with a minimal data snapshot (to remove useless/sensitive info), and had two automated workarounds for common issues. First, using a hidden-in-plain-sight feature to temporarily skip an update for an app (since removed); and B, cancel an app update after it started. My Mac died and then Valve/Steam began major updates to the client shortly after I released this, so it had a short life.</p><p>Other dumb ideas include a Bash list-based prompt and small automated test framework when I only had a phone (Android &lt; 10 + UserLAnd + Ubuntu = &lt;3), and helping add the beginning of cross-architecture builds to `kcov` using qemu and binfmt-misc around that time; a HTML/CSS/JS Mastermind-like solving tool for an event in a game I used to play; two attempts to build a hybrid web/Android Java Git app (first was zero deps so obviously went awful, second would use JGit but the code viewer evolved into the VSCode clone); some minor Payday 2 Lua mod bug reports/fixes and one update to a mod; multiple attempts at an ultra fast Mocha-inspired vanilla JS test framework; and more.</p><p>Email: l3l_aze, yahoo

Full Stack Engineer here, <i>hello</i>.</p><p>I’m a bit of a generalist with a knack for creating new answers to hard problems. One of my strengths is immersing myself with the objective and delivering refreshingly functional solutions.</p><p>My breadth of skills are best suited for joining a company in its startup phase: I have a foundation in Computer Science, with experience in finding product market fit, growth hacking, and navigating deliverables based on user research data.</p><p>Accessibility, APIs, Bitcoin, data visualization, and payment protocols are some of my deeper specialties.</p><p>Straight away on your team, I can build real-time data visualizations, dashboards, animated SVGs, and ensure that any web apps are accessible, device-adaptive, and fast-loading. Once settled in, I’ll do UI Engineering, Backend Engineering, and the pieces in-between and the parts in the cloud:</p><p>From inputs in the interface to updates to the database.
Data feed, data speed and data storage to user feels, user needs and user secrets.  Milestone sprints, project launches, outage recoveries, retooling and code reviewing. Full cycle app development.</p><p>Startup experience and FAANG experience. 20+ years as a web dev.</p><p>Extra stoked to grow in a role working with Payments, Security, or Python.</p><p>I believe in the power of the mastermind effect, where two minds in harmony equals 3, or 10.

---</p><p>About: I'm a sales engineering team leader in the technology industry. I have over 10+ years' experience leading global teams of sales engineers and program managers. My superpower is that I can win the trust and respect of both engineering teams and of customers, acting as a bridge between technical and non-technical worlds. I find that this relieves pressure on engineering teams and makes product teams' lives much easier! I've been in this space for over a decade, most recently at a FAANG, but I'm now seeking new opportunities 
where I can leverage my strengths combining sales and technology. I've worked in Taiwan, the UK, EU, and North America and am happy to get on a plane to meet customers wherever they are. I'm a firm believer in continuing learning, and that your past does not define your future, so, if you are working on some interesting new technology not in the list above, I'd love to hear about it!</p></div></td></tr>

Howdy! I'm a senior frontend software engineer that enjoys building intuitive and compelling product experiences. I tend to prefer working at smaller startups where I can wear multiple hats. I enjoy working on all ends of the product pipeline, in fact at my last job I was frequently involved in pitching feature ideas, creating UI designs in Figma, and running user interviews after the feature shipped. In my past two positions I've been a primary author or lead maintainer of internal component libraries created in conjunction with talented design teams, lowering the bar to success for fullstack teams. I don't shy away from the backend, I just feel less opinionated about the backend as I do the frontend. That being said I tend to get involved in anything that meaningfully contributes to user experience, including devops.</p><p>Looking for a position where I can contribute to or head technical leadership, more of an individual contributor than a manager. Ideally would love to collaborate with designers or at least contribute product designs from time to time.</p><p>I'm best reached via email, looking forward to hearing from you!</p></div></td></tr>

I chose to build it without any libraries (barring a couple CRT functions), which began as a learning exercise, and has taught me the value of simplicity.</p><p>In more recent history I've been working on a metaprogramming system for C.

I have ~8.5 years of experience as a security consultant and I would prefer to do more defensive/blue team work, but I'm fine doing offensive work or more consulting again. I'd also prefer to manage people because I enjoy it and I think I'm pretty good at it, but I don't mind being a pure IC.</p><p>While I am interested in being hired, I'm also very interested if anyone has constructive feedback for me about why they wouldn't hire me (no need to be gentle). I've only applied to a handful of jobs so far, and none have given me interviews or feedback, so I'm not sure why I don't appear appealing for roles I think I'm more than qualified for like Senior Security Engineer (Manager).</p></div></td></tr>

My postdoc is unique as I operate like a contractor. I work with faculty from various disciplines across campus, applying my skill set to diverse and varied problems. My current work involves more machine learning and applied LLMs with my prior work being molecular modeling focused. I'm adept with Python and Bash, working with both sparse and large datasets, as well as working with an HPC environment. On the side I've hosted server infrastructure for open source projects utilizing bare-metal servers, VPS, and AWS. I also host my own infrastructure as a hobby, from the hardware to the nameservers.</p><p>I'm a strong communicator, having collaborated across disciplines and presented work for both technical and non-technical audiences. Having worked at a startup before I’m comfortable wearing many hats (and enjoy the variety). I'm self-motivated and love to dig into new complex problems and learn new tools.</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, I'm Dan, a DevOps engineer with 10+ years of experience in automating systems to make life easy for other engineers. Whether you need a managed Kubernetes cluster from scratch to replace on-prem hardware, or help administering and improve your existing infra, I'm comfortable at every level of the stack. SOC2 compliance, DevSecOps, legacy systems - there are few DevOps challenges I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing in my career.</p><p>Currently, I'm seeking remote opportunities where I can use my extensive knowledge of cloud platforms and systems administration to improve security and developer experience, reduce cloud expenses, and keep systems online and running smoothly. If that's what you're looking for, don't hesitate to reach out :)</p></div></td></tr>

Ideally, I'd find a job doing ML engineering on text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-audio or related models - recently I've built a text-to-image model that is trained with unlabeled images alone, using CLIP for the link between captions and images[1]. I'm interested in ML engineering in other domains as well, and my last job was building a new cryptocurrency, so I have skills there too.</p><p>Here's my blurb about the model I built:</p><p>Recently, I've built a text-to-image model that is trained without any text labels, using unlabeled images and CLIP for the link between captions and images. This has never been done or even investigated before. Results are promising so far. I think this work is the best representation of what I'm capable of. In the process, I gathered a dataset of 33 million images for training data, including removing redundant images, deduplicating, and taking stills from any videos. I ported a VQGAN implementation from PyTorch to JAX, built an efficient preprocessing pipeline, built transformer models in JAX, and designed and trained baseline models and more sophisticated ones. To support the approach I eventually settled on, I designed and implemented an efficient algorithm to sample unit vectors from a finite set, conditioned on the vectors being inside a spherical cap. For that I needed to write a Python library in Rust to help with constructing the space partitioning data structure used for sampling. The sampling algorithm gets used to generate training examples and the model learns to sample images conditioned on the image's CLIP embedding being within an arbitrary spherical cap.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to-train-a-text-to-image-model-without-any-text.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.echonolan.net/posts/2024-03-09-is-it-possible-to...</a></p></div></td></tr>
