    </div><p>MYC is the shapeless protein responsible for making the majority of human cancer cases worse. UC Riverside researchers have found a way to rein it in, offering hope for a new era of treatments.</p>


										      
																																	<p>In <a href="https://phys.org/tags/healthy+cells/" rel="tag">healthy cells</a>, MYC helps guide the process of transcription, in which <a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+information/" rel="tag">genetic information</a> is converted from DNA into RNA and, eventually, into proteins. "Normally, MYC's activity is strictly controlled. In <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag">cancer cells</a>, it becomes hyper active, and is not regulated properly," said UCR associate professor of chemistry Min Xue.</p>
<p>"MYC is less like food for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cancer/" rel="tag">cancer</a> cells and more like a steroid that promotes cancer's rapid growth," Xue said. "That is why MYC is a culprit in 75% of all human cancer cases."</p>
<p>At the outset of this project the UCR research team believed that if they could dampen MYC's hyperactivity, they could open a window in which the cancer could be controlled.</p>
<p>However, finding a way to control MYC was challenging because unlike most other proteins, MYC has no structure. "It's basically a glob of randomness," Xue said. "Conventional <a href="https://phys.org/tags/drug+discovery/" rel="tag">drug discovery</a> pipelines rely on well-defined structures, and this does not exist for MYC."</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c09615">paper</a> in the <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i>, on which Xue is the senior author, describes a peptide compound that binds to MYC and suppresses its activity.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>In 2018, the researchers noticed that changing the rigidity and shape of a peptide improves its ability to interact with structureless protein targets such as MYC.</p>
<p>"Peptides can assume a variety of forms, shapes, and positions," Xue said. "Once you bend and connect them to form rings, they cannot adopt other possible forms, so they then have a low level of randomness. This helps with the binding."</p>
<p>In the paper, the team describes a new peptide that binds directly to MYC with what is called sub-micro-molar affinity, which is getting closer to the strength of an antibody. In other words, it is a very strong and specific interaction.</p>
<p>"We improved the binding performance of this peptide over previous versions by two orders of magnitude," Xue said. "This makes it closer to our drug development goals."</p>
<p>Currently, the researchers are using lipid nanoparticles to deliver the peptide into cells. These are small spheres made of fatty molecules, and they are not ideal for use as a drug. Going forward, the researchers are developing chemistry that improves the lead peptide's ability to get inside cells.</p>
<p>Once the peptide is in the cell, it will bind to MYC, changing MYC's physical properties and preventing it from performing transcription activities.</p>
<p>Xue's laboratory at UC Riverside develops molecular tools to better understand biology and uses that knowledge to perform drug discovery. He has long been interested in the chemistry of chaotic processes, which attracted him to the challenge of taming MYC.</p>
<p>"MYC represents chaos, basically, because it lacks structure. That, and its direct impact on so many types of cancer make it one of the holy grails of cancer <a href="https://phys.org/tags/drug/" rel="tag">drug</a> development," Xue said. "We are very excited that it is now within our grasp."</p>

  <p dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">My hot take: Google does not have one single visionary leader. Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed. 

Google has not launched one single successful executive-driven thing in years. Sometimes, VPs try to decree "we need a new chat app or AI-first demo for I/O!" There's a boondoggle slog, and in the end, the thing is half-baked and roundly derided. If it doesn't get 100 million users in six months, they give up and shut it down. It's like that joke algorithm I learned about in college -- BogoSort. In each iteration of the algorithm, you reorder everything randomly and if the elements happen to land in order, you are done. 

Some of Google's executives are competent referees. I couldn't name which, but I feel like I've seen it done in my 8+ years. They point in a direction, their subordinates swarm the area, try a bunch of stuff, and sometimes something sticks and is cool. 

Right now, all of these boring, glassy-eyed leaders are trying to point in a vague direction (AI) while at the same time killing their golden goose. Given that they have no real vision of their own, they really need their subordinates to come up with cool stuff for them. And at the same time, there have been rolling layoffs for the past 6-12 months throughout the company, including engineering, sales, support, UX, product, data science, SRE, everything. Just randomly firing people, torching institutional knowledge, and blowing up perfectly functional teams. 

Maybe it's not random. But they refuse to describe their reasons except as "we are excited to focus our resources on our highest priorities," so it might as well be random. I think they don't know what the priorities are. Not durably. They are waiting for their subordinates to propose concrete stuff in the direction they are waving their arms. Meanwhile, all of the mid-level leaders are scrambling to protect their teams (and themselves) by guessing what their VPs might find appealing. If you are a leader and you guess wrong, you and your team get cut.

There is a pervasive sense of nihilism that has taken hold. "Well, I guess I will just do the job until they fire me." A lot of people have golden handcuffs situations and aren't going to walk away from the salary, but nobody works late anymore. The buildings are half empty at 4:30. I know a lot of people, myself included, who used to happily do extra work evenings and weekends to get the demo done or just out of boredom.&nbsp;That's gone. 

Google really was a magical place, not very long ago. And for some reason, executives are cashing out their human capital at the very moment it seems to me like they really need it. Who can be dawn-of-a-new-era-of-humanity creative in this environment of fear? It's really sad. I have no way to align myself with any unspoken VP strategy or do good enough work to save myself if my whole team is cut. So I guess I will just hang around and do my job until Google no longer wants me.</p>

<p>One of the established and most popular programming languages is the C programming language. It is relatively easy to learn, and highly practical.</p>
<p>Maybe surprisingly, the C programming language keeps evolving, slowly and carefully. If you have GCC 23 or LLVM (Clang) 16, you already have a compiler with some of the features from the latest standard (C23).</p>

<ol>
<li>The first part of the code contains some preprocessor directives, which are instructions for the compiler to process the source code before compiling it. The <tt>#if</tt> directive checks a condition at compile time and includes the following code only if the condition is true. The <tt>__has_include</tt> macro is a feature of C++17 adopted by C23 that checks if a header file exists and can be included. In this instance, it is not useful because we know that <tt>stdio.h</tt> is present, but in other instances, this can prove useful to determine what headers are available.</li>
<li>The next part of the code defines two functions with attributes, which are annotations that provide additional information to the compiler about the behavior or usage of a function, variable, type, etc.
<ul>
<li>The [[deprecated]] attribute is a feature of C++14 adopted by C23 that marks a function as obsolete and discourages its use. The compiler will issue a warning if the function is called or referenced.</li>
<li>The [[nodiscard]] attribute is a feature of C++17 adopted by C23 that indicates that the return value of a function should not be ignored or discarded. The compiler will issue a warning if the function is called from a discarded-value expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the function f is deprecated and does nothing, while the function g returns the input value plus one and should not be ignored. The first two lines of the main function call the functions f and g and trigger the warnings.</p></li>
<li>The third line of the main function declares a variable x with the auto keyword, which is a feature of C++11 that lets the compiler deduce the type of the variable from its initializer. In this case, the initializer is a binary literal, which is a feature of C++14 and adopted by C23 that allows writing integer constants in binary notation using the prefix 0b. The value of x is 0b1111, which is equivalent to 15 in decimal.</li>
<li>The fourth line declares another variable y with the typeof operator that returns the type of an expression. In this case, the expression is x, so the type of y is the same as the type of x. The initializer of y is a digit separator, which is a feature of C++14 adopted by C23 that allows inserting single quotes between digits in numeric literals to improve readability. The value of y is 1’000’000, which is equivalent to 1000000 in decimal.</li>
<li>The seventh line declares a constant variable N with the constexpr keyword, which is a feature of C++11 adopted by C23 that indicates that the value of the variable can be evaluated at compile time. The value of N is 10. Previously, one would often use a macro to define a compile-time constant (e.g., <tt>#define N 10</tt>).</li>
<li>The eighth line uses the static_assert keyword, which is a feature of C++11 adopted by C23 that performs a compile-time assertion check. The keyword takes a boolean expression and an optional string message as arguments. If the expression is false, the compiler will emit an error and stop the compilation, displaying the message. If the expression is true, the compiler will do nothing. In this case, the expression is N == 10, which is true, so the compilation continues.</li>
<li>The ninth line declares an array of N booleans named a. An array is a collection of elements of the same type that are stored in contiguous memory locations. The size of the array must be a constant expression, which is why N is declared with constexpr. We also use the keywords true and false which become standard in C23.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more features in C23, but it will take some time for compilers and system librairies to catch up.</p>
<p>My thoughts so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The introduction of consexpr in C will probably help reduce the dependency on macros, which is a good idea generally. Macros work well in C, but when a bug is introduced, it can be difficult get meaningful error messages. It does not happen too often, but in large code bases, it can be a problem.</li>
<li>I personally rarely use auto and typeof in other languages, so I don’t expect to use them very much in C. In some specific cases, it can greatly simply one’s code, however. It is likely going to help reduce the reliance on macros.</li>
<li>The idea behind static_assert is great. You run a check that has no impact on the performance of the software, and may even help it. It is cheap and it can catch nasty bugs. It is not new to C, but adopting the C++ syntax is a good idea.</li>
<li>The <tt>__has_include</tt> feature can simplify supporting diverse compilers. It is good idea.</li>
</ul>

<pre>In a recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and
benefits of including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system.  To
summarize, the cost is that it would double our build times.  imp
suggested adding an additional step after buildworld for stuff that
requires an external toolchain.  That would ease the build time pain.
The benefit is that some tools would become easier to write, or even
become possible.  Here is a list of actual and potential Rust projects
that could benefit from being in-tree.  If anybody else has items to
add, I suggest moving this into the project wiki:

Stuff that could only be written in Rust if it were in base
===========================================================

* ctl-exporter (I started this, but discovered that the CTL stats API is
  unstable, so it can't live in ports.  Instead, I had to do it in C).

* fusefs tests.  Absolutely impossible to do in C.  I considered Rust, but went
  with C++ so they could live in base.  They are too closely coupled to
  fusefs(5) to live out-of-tree.

  contemplated a rewrite myself, but I don't want to do it in C.

Stuff that can live in ports, but would be nicer in base
========================================================

* gstat-rs <a href="https://crates.io/crates/gstat">https://crates.io/crates/gstat</a>

* geom-exporter (I've started this, but haven't published it)

* nfs-exporter <a href="https://crates.io/crates/freebsd-nfs-exporter">https://crates.io/crates/freebsd-nfs-exporter</a>

* virtiofsd-rs .  Nobody has yet tried to port it to FreeBSD.  But if the
  connection to bhyve(8) is too intimate, it might be hard to do in ports.
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd">https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd</a>

* jail-exporter <a href="https://crates.io/crates/jail_exporter">https://crates.io/crates/jail_exporter</a>

* Various jail managers have been attempted in Rust.  I think these are fine in
  ports, but others like Goran Mekic have opined that they should be moved to
  base instead.

* musikid's pjdfstest rewrite.  I think it would be great to start using this
  to test the base system's file systems.  If the tests themselves lived in
  base, they would be easier to sync with file system development.
  <a href="https://github.com/musikid/pjdfstest">https://github.com/musikid/pjdfstest</a>

* pf-rs.  I suspect that the API isn't very stable.
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pf-rs">https://crates.io/crates/pf-rs</a>

* benchpmc.  The pmc counter names changes between releases.
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/benchpmc">https://crates.io/crates/benchpmc</a>

FreeBSD-related applications that are just fine in ports
=========================================================

* fsx-rs.  Unlike pjdfstest, this only tests datapath APIs.  Those are usually
  more stable than control path APIs, so I think there's little to be gained by
  moving this into base. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fsx">https://crates.io/crates/fsx</a>

* ztop.  It uses ZFS's kstats sysctl interface, which is pretty stable.

   <p>When he was still the president of the United States, Barack Obama joked about having another job on the side: salesman in chief.</p>   <p>"I'm expecting a gold watch from Boeing at the end of my presidency, because I know that I'm on the list of top salesmen at Boeing," Obama deadpanned in 2013.</p>   <p>Boeing is no ordinary company. It's a pillar of the U.S. economy, both as a military contractor and in civil aviation. It claims to be the country's largest exporter.</p>   <p>But the longstanding special relationship between the U.S. government and Boeing has come under growing scrutiny, particularly after two crashes involving Boeing's 737 Max 8 plane, in 2018 and 2019. Those tragedies prompted significant changes, with a new CEO at Boeing and revamped oversight rules at the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>   
   <p>Now the latest safety incident involving a Boeing jet, the 737 Max 9, is raising difficult questions about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224998393/boeing-737-max-9-downfall-documentary">whether that response went far enough</a>.</p>

   <p>Investigators are still trying to determine why a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines jet in midair earlier this month. Federal regulators have grounded 171 Max 9 planes with similar configurations, while launching a review of Boeing's manufacturing and production lines.</p>   <p>The head of the FAA says it's time to reexamine the longtime practice of delegating some of the agency's oversight responsibilities to Boeing employees, raising the possibility of moving some of those duties to a third party.</p>   <p>That would be a remarkable shift in how the federal government regulates a company that is an icon of American industry and innovation.</p>   <h3>The U.S. helps Boeing sell planes overseas</h3>   <p>Boeing's importance to the economy extends far beyond the more than 140,000 people that it employs directly. The company also supports a network of suppliers and contractors that reaches across the country.</p>   <p>"Small businesses are up and down the supply chain," Obama said <a href="https://youtu.be/v7vn3VdqsIk?si=3ews34EDez3npV1o&amp;t=6700">at the same meeting</a> of the President's Export Council where he joked about earning a gold watch from Boeing. "And when we sell a bunch of airplanes, a lot of small businesses and medium-sized businesses are benefiting from that as well."</p>   
   <p>Obama isn't the only president to act as a cheerleader for Boeing.</p>   <p>"God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing," then-President Donald Trump said during a 2017 visit to a plant in South Carolina where the company builds its 787 Dreamliner.</p>   <p>When it comes to civil aviation, Boeing has no rivals based in the U.S. Its primary competitor, Airbus, is headquartered in Europe, though it does build some planes here.</p>   <div id="res1225478476">

   <p>Still, U.S. leaders are willing to put a finger on the scale in Boeing's favor.</p>   <p>The federal government has an official credit agency, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, that extends financing for overseas buyers. It's sometimes described as "Boeing's bank," because the company is such a big beneficiary.</p>   <p>The U.S. government is, in a literal sense, helping Boeing sell planes overseas — and these days, that largely means the 737 Max series. It is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/29/718394234/boeing-ceo-defends-737-max-jets-against-angry-shareholders">the company's best-selling plane</a>, with thousands of pending orders, and is seen as crucial to Boeing's financial future.</p>   <p>None of this is supposed to affect how regulators at the FAA treat the company. But in the real world, Boeing wields a lot of power and influence in Washington.</p>   <p>"Boeing evidently does think it's too big to fail," Jim Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said in a recent interview.</p>   <p>"It's not complicated. In Washington, D.C., as everyone knows, there is a great deal of influence exercised through fundraising to members of Congress," Hall said. "There's a great coziness or familiarity between all of the parties. And so, who's the bad cop?"</p>   <h3>737 Max 8 crashes reveal systemic problems</h3>   <div id="res1225535281">

   <p>Ties between the U.S. government and Boeing came under intense criticism after the 2018 and 2019 crashes involving the company's 737 Max 8 planes. A total of 346 people were killed.</p>   
   <p>After the first crash, of a Lion Air jet in Indonesia, Boeing maintained that the pilots were mostly to blame. Five months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane went down under very similar circumstances.</p>   <p>Regulators in many other countries immediately moved to ground the Boeing Max 8. But the Federal Aviation Administration waited several days, making it one of the last agencies to take that step.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1225468929" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>When congressional investigators started digging into what caused the crashes, they found <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/16/913426448/congressional-inquiry-faults-boeing-and-faa-failures-for-deadly-737-max-plane-cr">a range of problems at Boeing</a> — both with the design of the Max 8's flight control systems, and with pilot training — and they found insufficient oversight by the FAA.</p>   <p>At a dramatic hearing in October 2019, family members held up photographs of the crash victims while Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg testified.</p>   <p>"We can and must do better. We've been challenged and changed by these accidents," Muilenburg told members of Congress.</p>   <p>One of the parents in the hearing room that day was Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Stumo was killed in the second crash. Milleron confronted Boeing's CEO after the hearing.</p>   <p>"I asked him to resign, because I said that he made decisions which killed people, and then he refused to acknowledge it," she told NPR's <em>Morning Edition </em>in an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/30/774646279/victims-family-responds-to-boeing-ceos-testimony">interview at the time</a>.</p>   <p>"Our daughter got on the plane completely trusting," Milleron said. "And she never dreamed that there would be any problem with the plane itself, and there was a huge problem."</p>   <p>Muilenburg was pushed out of his job just a few months later.</p>   <div id="res1225535583">

   <h3>"A case study of the complete and total failure of self-regulation"</h3>   <p>Congressional hearings on the design and certification of the 737 Max 8 also brought to light some <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/09/795123158/boeing-employees-mocked-faa-in-internal-messages-before-737-max-disasters">troubling internal emails</a> from Boeing employees, who mocked their colleagues as well as regulators at the FAA.</p>   <p>"This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys," one employee wrote.</p>   
   <p>Another Boeing employee wrote that a presentation for regulators was "like dogs watching TV," because the regulators didn't understand what they were seeing.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1225479190" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Investigators learned that Boeing had hidden key details about the 737 Max 8's flight control systems from regulators before they signed off on the plane's design.</p>   <p>They also found that FAA regulators had determined after the first crash that the Max 8 was likely to have the same problem again, but did not make those calculations public at the time.</p>   <p>That brought harsh criticism from safety advocates and Democrats on Capitol Hill.</p>   <p>"We must reexamine the current system that allowed for a much too cozy relationship between regulators and companies, including Boeing," then-Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., said at a hearing in 2020.</p>   <p>"This continues to be a case study of the complete and total failure of self-regulation," Udall said. "And I think this will go down as one of the big mistakes in history in this area."</p>   <h3><strong>A long history of delegating oversight to industry </strong></h3>   <p>The FAA has delegated some of its oversight authority to manufacturers since the 1950s. But regulators have come to rely more and more on Boeing over time, as its planes have gotten more complex and supply chains have grown longer.</p>   <p>This pattern accelerated in the early 2000s, says Peter Robison, an investigative reporter for Bloomberg News and the author of <em>Flying Blind: The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing</em>.</p>   <p>Regulators at the FAA were pushed by the bosses to hand off more work to Boeing, Robison says — partly because they trusted that Boeing engineers knew the planes best and partly because it was cheaper for the FAA.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1225470911" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"What I traced was a distortion in the relationship where the regulator came to feel almost that it worked for Boeing," Robison told NPR's <em>Here and Now</em> <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/01/09/boeing-737-max-9-culture">earlier this month</a>. "The managers worked very closely with Boeing to speed production of planes. And the managers at the FAA really came to treat Boeing as its customer rather than the flying public as the people it was serving."</p>   <p>At the same time, Robison says, the corporate culture at Boeing was changing too, becoming more focused on profit and less on quality.</p>   
   <h3><strong>Max 8 crashes prompt sweeping changes </strong></h3>   <p>After the Max 8 tragedies, Congress passed bipartisan legislation aimed at preventing the company or the FAA from repeating the mistakes that led to the deadly crashes. The FAA made changes that were supposed to tighten up how its authority is delegated.</p>   <p>A new CEO took over at Boeing, pledging to restore the company's commitment to quality and safety.</p>   <p>After nearly two years, regulators cleared the Max 8 to begin flying again, and Boeing began trying to rebuild its reputation with airlines and the flying public.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1225481110" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Then came Jan. 5, 2024, when a panel known as a door plug blew off a Boeing jet — this time a 737 Max 9 — at 16,000 feet, raising troubling questions for the company and the FAA once again.</p>   <p>There are several key differences between the Alaska Airlines incident and the Max 8 crashes.</p>   <p>No one was killed or seriously injured last month, although NTSB investigators said the incident could have been much worse had it had occurred at a higher altitude. And while the cause of the latest incident is still under investigation, it appears to be a problem in the manufacturing process, not a design flaw.</p>   <p>Still, Boeing's critics see a troubling similarity between the events. The company once again appears to be putting the bottom line ahead of safety, they say, by rushing planes off the factory floor at the rate of more than one per day.</p>   <p>This time, however, Boeing has moved quickly to own up to its mistake.</p>   <p>"This event can never happen again," CEO Dave Calhoun said at an all-hands meeting last week at a factory near Seattle. He told employees: "We're gonna approach this — No. 1 — acknowledging our mistake. We are gonna approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way."</p>   <p>The reaction of the FAA has been different, too. This time, regulators moved quickly to ground all 737 Max 9 jets with door plugs. And they seem to be in no rush to recertify those planes to fly again.</p>   
   <h3><strong>Another look at how oversight is delegated</strong></h3>   <p>The FAA says it's now considering even bigger changes to the way it regulates Boeing.</p>   <p>"It is time to reexamine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks," FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/12/1224444590/boeing-faa-737-max-9-alaska-airlines-door-plug">said last week</a>. "The grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1225469145" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Regulators say they will consider whether to move quality oversight and inspections to an independent third party.</p>   <p>That would be a major shift in the relationship between the FAA and Boeing — one that some safety advocates say is long overdue.</p>   <p>"This is a very smart move by the FAA," said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and the author of the book <em>Why Planes Crash</em>. "The drive for profitability may just be overriding this ability to have an independent delegation within the organization."</p>   <p>It's a difficult moment for the FAA and Whitaker, who took over as administrator <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206607841/senate-committee-michael-whitaker-faa-administrator">just a few months ago</a>. FAA safety inspectors cannot inspect every bolt on every plane that leaves the Boeing factory. But business as usual at the agency no longer seems like a good option either.</p>   <p>What's at stake is how the FAA regulates one of the biggest companies in the aviation industry — and in the entire U.S. economy.</p>

</div><p>NASA has re-established contact with its tiny helicopter on Mars, the US space agency said Saturday, after an unexpected outage prompted fears that the hard-working craft had finally met its end.</p>


		    <!-- Phys.org - News - AMP -->
		

                    <p>Ingenuity, a drone about 1.6 feet (0.5 meters) tall, arrived on Mars in 2021 aboard the rover Perseverance and became the first motorized craft to fly autonomously on another planet.</p>
<p>Data from the helicopter are transmitted via Perseverance back to Earth, but communications were suddenly lost during a test flight on Thursday, Ingenuity's 72nd lift-off on Mars.</p>
<p>"Good news today," NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, late Saturday.</p>
<p>The agency said that contact had finally been made with the helicopter by commanding Perseverance to "perform long-duration listening sessions for Ingenuity's signal."</p>
<p>"The team is reviewing the new data to better understand the unexpected comms dropout during Flight 72," it added.</p>
<p>NASA previously said that Ingenuity had attained an altitude of 40 feet (12 meters) on Flight 72, which was a "quick pop-up vertical flight to check out the helicopter's systems, following an unplanned early landing during its previous flight."</p>
<p>But during its descent, "communications between the helicopter and rover terminated early, prior to touchdown," the agency said.</p>
<p>JPL had noted on Friday that Perseverance was temporarily "out of line-of-sight with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection."</p>
<p>In a response to a post on X asking if Ingenuity would be able to fly again, JPL said Saturday that "the team needs to assess the new data before that can be determined."</p>
<p>NASA has lost contact with the helicopter before, including for an agonizing two months last year.</p>
<p>The mini rotorcraft, which weighs just four pounds (1.8 kilograms), has far exceeded its original goal of undertaking five flights over 30 days on the red planet.</p>
<p>In all, it has covered just over 10 miles (17 kilometers) and reached altitudes of up to 79 feet (24 meters).</p>
<p>Its longevity has proved remarkable, particularly considering that it must survive glacially cold Martian nights, kept warm by the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+panels/" rel="tag">solar panels</a> that recharge its batteries during daylight hours.</p>
<p>Working with Perseverance, it has acted as an aerial scout to assist its wheeled companion in searching for possible signs of ancient microbial life.</p>

        <div id="article-hfix">
            <div id="article-hstick-inner">
                                <p>Google has finally admitted that it tracks your search history, activities, the websites you visit and the services they use even in Incognito mode. Following the search engine's agreement to settle a $5 billion USD privacy lawsuit that accused it of tracking users illegally in incognito mode, it has now updated the disclaimer to reflect the transparency. In its Canary version (Early-access version which allows users and developers to test new features and updates before they are rolled out for everyone), Google now states that data will still be collected even in Incognito mode.</p>
<p>The normal disclaimer which you can see in Incognito mode at the moment is- "Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won’t see your activity. However, downloads, bookmarks and reading list items will be saved." However, in the Canary version, the disclaimer reads, "Others who use this device won’t see your activity, so you can browse more privately. This won’t change how data is collected by websites you visit and the services they use, including Google. Downloads, bookmarks and reading list items will be saved."</p>
<h2><span>Why Does It Make A Difference?</span></h2>
<p>Speculations of the search engine tracking users in the incognito mode were always there but Google never confirmed that it continues to track users despite them being in incognito mode. However, now, after putting up this disclaimer, it has clarified that indeed does track your activities. Notably, this does not mean that Google is now starting to track your activities and was not doing so before. It means that they were doing that earlier as well but now they have admitted to it finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users must be cautious about using Google even in incognito mode as it is not just the search engine that tracks you but the websites also do. Are you one of the people who used to open the incognito mode to book flight tickets so that you could avoid surge prices? You might encounter that surge now as both Google as well as the ticket-selling website will be tracking your activity.</p>

What can humans learn from them?</p></div></header></div><div><p>Angler Stuart Black has caught a lot of fish in his days, but when he landed his first buffalofish in <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/arizona" target="_blank">Arizona</a>’s Apache Lake in 2019, he had a hunch something was special about it.</p><p>“I didn’t even know why at the time,” he says. At 13 pounds, it wasn’t even that big—he’s caught bigger.</p><p>Turns out, his intuition was right. Scientists recently confirmed that the majority of the buffalofish swimming around this remote desert lake in eastern Arizona are older than a hundred.</p><p>The discovery builds on other recent research that has upended beliefs about the little-studied buffalofish, a genus of five <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/freshwater-fish" target="_blank">freshwater fish</a> species native to North America.</p><p>Just a few years ago, scientists thought that these fish, which come in an array of colors from chestnut brown to bluish, only lived into their mid-20s. However, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0452-0" target="_blank">2019 study</a> revealed that <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/oldest-freshwater-fish-discovered-radiocarbon-dating" target="_blank">bigmouth buffalofish could live up to 112 years old</a>, making it the oldest known freshwater teleost, a group of about 12,000 ray-finned fish species found worldwide. Then in January, researchers <a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjfas-2022-0122" target="_blank">announced the discovery of a 127-year-old bigmouth</a> in Saskatchewan, Canada.</p><p>Now, the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44328-8" target="_blank">published recently in <i>Scientific Reports</i></a><i>,</i> confirmed that two more buffalofish species—the smallmouth buffalo and the black buffalo—can live more than a hundred years, making it the only known genus of animal besides the marine rockfish, <i>Sebastes,&nbsp;</i>that has three centenarian species.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>This is not to say that other animals can’t achieve remarkably long life spans. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/greenland-sharks-animals-science-age" target="_blank">Greenland sharks have the greatest longevity of any living vertebrate</a>, reaching at least 250 years old.</p><p>What’s more, research has revealed that buffalofish continue to live their best lives into their upper 80s and 90s, with better stress response and immune function relative to younger individuals. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/flamingo-albatross-longevity-clam" target="_blank"><i>(See six of the world’s longest-lived animals.)</i></a></p><p>“The one takeaway is that buffalofishes do not conform to preconceived notions,” says study leader <a href="https://scse.d.umn.edu/faculty-staff/alec-lackmann" target="_blank">Alec Lackmann</a>, a fish expert at the University of Minnesota. “They defy expectations.”</p><h2><b>Desert discovery</b></h2><p>For the Arizona study, a few dozen anglers, including Black, caught 222 buffalofish at Apache Lake from July 2018 to July 2023. Twenty three were humanely euthanized and donated to the research team, who estimated the fishes’ ages by removing and analyzing tiny ear stones called otoliths. These calcium carbonate structures, which allow fish to hear and sense vibrations in the water, form a new layer each year that can be read somewhat like tree rings.</p><p>The otolith analysis revealed that about 90 percent of Apache Lake’s buffalofishes were more than 85 years old. Researchers aged individuals of all three species studied there—smallmouth buffalo, bigmouth buffalo, and black buffalo—past a hundred years old.</p><p>For the other 199 fish, the anglers used a technique called catch-photo-release, in which they reeled in fish with tiny barbed or no-barbed hooks that avoid hurting the animal. All were photographed, and 129 were weighed before releasing them back into the lake. Researchers estimated live fishes’ ages by studying orange and black spots in the anglers’ photographs.</p><p>“Several species of large riverine fishes like sturgeon and alligator gar are known to live more than 50 years,” says Nathan Farnau, curator of fishes and invertebrates at the <a href="http://www.georgiaaquarium.org/" target="_blank">Georgia Aquarium</a> in Atlanta, who wasn’t involved in the study.</p><p>“But it’s always really exciting when researchers can find physical evidence of fish that are more than a hundred years old."</p><h2><b>Hardy non-natives</b></h2><p>What makes these findings even more remarkable, Lackmann says, is that these fish aren’t even native to the state. About 400 of them arrived to Arizona by rail in 1918 as part of a U.S. Bureau of Fisheries plan to establish a commercial fishery in Roosevelt Lake, a dammed reservoir on the Salt River. Apache Lake, part of the same river system, was later established and some of the fish eventually migrated there by swimming downstream.</p><p>The bigmouth buffalo’s native range spans from southern Saskatchewan down into Texas and Louisiana, with smallmouth and black buffalo sharing similar ranges that also include parts of Ontario, New Mexico, and Mexico. The fish in Apache Lake likely came from a hatchery in Iowa, Lackmann says.</p><p>He adds that the new findings indicate that some of the original stockfish still live in the Salt River system. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/110609-coelacanths-long-lived-fish-science-animals" target="_blank"><i>(Read about coelacanths, an ancient fish that can reach a hundred years.)</i></a></p><p>“It's like a rugged desert environment in that reservoir, yet they still are able to persist across a century,” Lackmann says. “Just imagine taking a wild animal and putting it in a novel habitat like that. If anything, you would expect they wouldn't live as long.”</p><h2><b>Fountain of youth?</b></h2><p>Buffalofish can go decades between successful reproductions because they require very specific environmental conditions—most of which are still unknown—to procreate. That’s why the fish evolved to live so long: It’s an evolutionary adaptation to account for long periods without breeding, according to Lackmann.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, where buffalofish can go up to 50 years without producing offspring, the fish only attempt to spawn within a narrow range of water-level fluctuations that may rarely occur.</p><p>Lackmann says further studies into buffalofish longevity could provide insight into how vertebrates, including humans, can live longer. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/aging-cure-longevity-science-technology-feature" target="_blank"><i>(Read: “Can aging be cured? Scientists are giving it a try.”)</i></a></p><p>“One of the major outstanding questions about the buffalofishes is how they do it in terms of their amazing longevity. What is their fountain of youth?”</p><p>One strategy may be understanding why older buffalofish are less stressed and have stronger immunity than younger fish, which was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88626-5" target="_blank">confirmed in a 2021 study on bigmouth buffalofish</a>.</p><p>Older individuals could fight off bacteria better than younger animals. Not only that, the elderly fish had a lower ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood, an indication of lower stress levels.</p><p>“They are still advancing into prime condition at a century old, which is astonishing,” Lackmann says.</p><p>Meanwhile, conservation is a priority, he says. Buffalofish are a prized sportfish in the upper Midwest, and while their numbers are declining, harvest is virtually unregulated—including in Arizona.</p><p>“Right now, you can go to Apache Lake, catch a buffalofish, and just take it home,” Black says. “So for me, getting them protected now is probably the most important thing.”</p></div></article></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span>We live in undeniably ugly times.</span> Architecture, industrial design, cinematography, probiotic soda branding — many of the defining features of the visual field aren’t sending their best. Despite more advanced manufacturing and design technologies than have existed in human history, our built environment tends overwhelmingly toward the insubstantial, the flat, and the gray, punctuated here and there by the occasional childish squiggle. This drab sublime unites flat-pack furniture and home electronics, municipal infrastructure and commercial graphic design: an ocean of stuff so homogenous and underthought that the world it has inundated can feel like a digital rendering — of a slightly duller, worse world.</span></p><p><span>If the Situationists drifted through Paris looking to get defamiliarized, today a scholar of the new ugliness can conduct their research in any contemporary American city — or upzoned American Main Street, or exurban American parking lot, or, if they’re really desperate, on the empty avenues of Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Our own walk begins across the street from our apartment, where, following the recent demolition of a perfectly serviceable hundred-year-old building, a monument to ugliness has recently besieged the block. Our new neighbor is a classic 5-over-1: retail on the ground floor, topped with several stories of apartments one wouldn’t want to be able to afford. The words <span>THE JOSH</span> have been appended to the canopy above the main entrance in a passionless font.</span></p><p><span>We spent the summer certain that the caution tape–yellow panels on The Josh’s south side were insulation, to be eventually supplanted by an actual facade. Alas, in its finished form The Josh really is yellow, and also burgundy, gray, and brown. Each of these colors corresponds to a different material — plastic, concrete, rolled-on brick, an obscure wood-like substance — and the overall effect is of an overactive spreadsheet. Trims, surfaces, and patterns compete for attention with shifty black windows, but there’s nothing bedazzling or flamboyant about all this chaos. Somehow the building’s plane feels flatter than it is, despite the profusion of arbitrary outcroppings and angular balconies. The lineage isn’t Bauhaus so much as a sketch of the Bauhaus that’s been xeroxed half a dozen times.</span></p><p><span>The Josh is aging rapidly for a 5-month-old. There are gaps between the panels, which have a taped-on look to them, and cracks in the concrete. Rust has bloomed on surfaces one would typically imagine to be rustproof. Every time it rains, The Josh gets conspicuously . . . wet. Attempts have been made to classify structures like this one and the ethos behind their appearance: SimCityist, McCentury Modern, fast-casual architecture. We prefer cardboard modernism, in part because The Josh looks like it might turn to pulp at the first sign of a hundred-year flood.</span></p><p><span>Writing a century ago, H. L. Mencken bemoaned America’s “libido for the ugly.” There exists, he wrote, a “love of ugliness for its own sake, the lust to make the world intolerable. Its habitat is the United States.” However mystical and psychosexual his era’s intolerability might have felt in its origins, by the 1940s the explanations were more prosaic. With the wartime rationing of steel and sudden dearth of skilled labor, concrete structural systems quickly gained appeal — as did buildings that could be made piecemeal in a factory, put on a trailer, and nailed together anywhere in the country. And as the postwar baby boom took hold, such buildings were soon in high demand, fulfilling modernism’s wildest dreams of standardization with little of the glamour. A few Levittowns later, the promise of salvation-by-mass-production would come to seem elusive: new manufacturing techniques were transforming both the buildings and the builders building them. In </span><i><span>Prisoners of the American Dream</span></i><span>, Mike Davis describes how, in the 1970s, “the adoption of new building technologies involving extensive use of prefabricated structures, like precast concrete, eroded the boundaries of traditional skills and introduced a larger semi-skilled component into the labor force.” If it’s cheaper to assemble concrete panels than to hire bricklayers, cityscapes will eventually contain fewer bricks.</span></p><p><span>A construction industry with newly decadent profit margins was ready to spring into action in the 1990s, when — after a violent, decades-long process of urban renewal and white flight — real estate developers, brokers, and local politicians started luring predominantly white homeowners and renters back to the cities they’d abandoned. By the 2000s, infill housing began to crop up in American cities that had for decades been defined by their plentiful surface parking. These residential developments were ugly, but not yet inescapable. Like the fresh-faced presidential candidate with whom it’s hard not to associate them (did every wood-and-concrete complex feature a knockoff Shepard Fairey mural, or have we been blinded by the mists of memory?), the buildings spoke to an upwardly mobile, progressive, even post-racial demographic that didn’t share its parents’ all-consuming fear of city life. Then came the ultimate stop-work order: the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p><blockquote><p>The ruling class seized cities and chose to turn them into . . . this?

But low interest rates worked in developers’ favor, and what had begun as an archipelago of scattered development had coalesced, by the end of the Obama years, into a visual monoculture. At the global scale, supply chains narrowed the range of building materials to a generic minimum (hence The Josh’s pileup of imitation teak accents and synthetic stucco antiflourishes). At the local level, increasingly stringent design standards imposed by ever-more-cumbersome community approval processes compelled developers to copy designs that had already been rubber-stamped elsewhere (hence that same fake teak and stucco in identical boxy buildings across the country). The environment this concatenation of forces has produced is at once totalizing and meek — an architecture embarrassed by its barely architected-ness, a building style that cuts corners and then covers them with rainscreen cladding. For all the air these buildings have sucked up in the overstated conflict between YIMBYs (who recognize that new housing is ultimately better than no housing) and NIMBYs (who don’t), the unmistakable fact of cardboard modernism is that its buildings are less ambitious, less humane, and uglier than anyone deserves.</span></p><p><span>They’re also really gray. The Josh’s steel railings are gray, and its plastic window sashes are a slightly clashing shade of gray. Inside, the floors are made of gray TimberCore, and the walls are painted an abject post-beige that interior designers call greige but is in fact just gray. Gray suffuses life beyond architecture: television, corporate logos, product packaging, clothes for babies, direct-to-consumer toothbrushes. What incentives — material, libidinal, or otherwise — could possibly account for all this gray? In 2020, a study by London’s Science Museum Group’s Digital Lab used image processing to analyze photographs of consumer objects manufactured between 1800 and the present. They found that things have become less colorful over time, converging on a spectrum between steel and charcoal, as though consumers want their gadgets to resemble the raw materials of the industries that produce them. If </span><i><span>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit </span></i><span>once offered a warning about conformity, he is now an inspiration, although the outfit has gotten an upgrade. Today he is </span><i><span>The Man in the Gray Bonobos</span></i><span>,</span> <span>or </span><i><span>The Man in the</span></i> <i><span>Gray Buck Mason Crew Neck</span></i><span>, or </span><i><span>The Man in the Gray Mack Weldon Sweatpants</span></i><span> — all delivered via gray Amazon van. The imagined color of life under communism, gray has revealed itself to be the actual hue of globalized capital. “The distinct national colors of the imperialist map of the world have merged and blended in the imperial global rainbow,” wrote Hardt and Negri. What color does a blended rainbow produce? Greige, evidently.</span></p><hr><p><span><span>A lot of ugliness</span> accretes privately, in the form of household goods, which can make it hard to see — except on the first of the month. Today’s perma-class of renters moves more frequently than ever before (inevitably to smaller apartments), and on moving day the sidewalks are transformed into a rich bazaar of objects significant for ugliness studies. We stroll past discarded pottery from wild sip ’n’ spin nights; heaps of shrunken fast fashion from Shein; dead Strategist-approved houseplants; broken Wirecutter-approved humidifiers; an ergonomic gaming chair; endless Ikea BILLYs, MALMs, LACKs, SKUBBs, BARENs, SLOGGs, JUNQQs, and FGHSKISs. Perhaps this shelf is salvageable — ? No, just another mass of peeling veneer and squishy particleboard. On one stoop sits a package from a direct-to-consumer eyewear company, and we briefly fantasize about a pair of glasses that would illuminate, </span><i><span>They Live</span></i><span>–style, the precise number of children involved in manufacturing each of these trashed items, or maybe the acreage of Eastern European old-growth trees.</span></p><p><span>It occurs to us, strolling past a pair of broken BuzzFeed Shopping–approved AirPods, that the new ugliness has beset us from both above and below. Many of the aesthetic qualities pioneered by low-interest-rate-era construction — genericism, non-ornamentation, shoddy reproducibility — have trickled down into other realms, even as other principles, unleashed concurrently by Apple’s slick industrial-design hegemon, have trickled up. In the middle, all that is solid melts into sameness, such that smart home devices resemble the buildings they surveil, which in turn look like the computers on which they were algorithmically engineered, which resemble the desks on which they sit, which, like the sofas at the coworking space around the corner, put the </span><i><span>mid</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>fake midcentury modern</span></i><span>. And all of it is bound by the commandment of planned obsolescence, which decays buildings even as it turns phones into bricks.</span></p><p><span>Beyond the sidewalk, the street — which is mostly for cars, key technology of the 20th-century assault on the city. Barthes wrote that the 1955 Citroën DS marked a welcome shift in the appearance in cars toward the “homely,” meaning that they’d begun to carry the comfortable livability of kitchens and household equipment. Today’s automobiles, far from being “the supreme creation of an era,” are homely in the other sense of the word. A contemporary mythologist could sort them into either hamsters or monoliths. Hamster cars (the Honda Fit, the Toyota Prius) are undoubtedly ugly, but in a virtuous way. The monolith cars (the Cadillac Escalade, the Infiniti QX80) possess a militaristic cast, as if to get to Costco one must first stop off at the local black site.<sup id="rf1-34098"><a href="#fn1-34098" title="See also the increasing dominance of cars with opaque and foreboding matte paint jobs, described by the newsletter Blackbird Spyplane as “putty-lookin’ ass whips.”">1</a></sup> <span>No brand has embraced the ethos more than Tesla, with its tanklike Cybertruck. Even Musk’s more domesticated offerings feel like they’re in the surveillance business: sitting inside a Tesla is not unlike sitting inside a smartphone, while also staring at a giant smartphone.</span></span></p><blockquote><p>Shittiness is a big tent — and the tent is falling apart.</p> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=Shittiness+is+a+big+tent%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Aand+the+tent+is+falling+apart.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Shittiness+is+a+big+tent%E2%80%8A%E2%80%94%E2%80%8Aand+the+tent+is+falling+apart.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098">Tweet</a></blockquote><p><span>Dodging huge grilles we walk on, pulled by ugliness toward a gentrified retail strip. Here the violence of the new ugliness comes more fully into focus. The ruling class seized cities and chose to turn them into . . . this? To our right is a place that sells wiggly candles. Past that is a boutique liquor store whose chalkboard sign proclaims, in cheerleader handwriting, that the time is Wine O’Clock, and past that is a Bank of America. Across the street, a row of fast-casual chains, whose names and visual identities insist on modesty and anonymity: Just Salad, Just Food For Dogs, Blank Street Coffee. (This raft of normcore brands finds its opposite in the ghost kitchens down the block, which all for some reason are called things like Fuck Your Little Bitch Burrito.) Up ahead is an axe throwing “experience,” and another Bank of America.</span></p><p><span>Who asked for all of this? Numerous critics — self-hating and otherwise — have argued that the mallification of the American city is the fault of the same millennials for whom all the new construction was built, who couldn’t quite bear to abandon the creature comforts of home even as they reurbanized. The story goes that millennials lived, laughed, and loved their way into an unprecedentedly insipid environment, turning once-gritty cities into Instagram-friendly dispensaries of baroque ice cream cones that call back, madeleine-style, to the enfolding warmth of their suburban childhoods. But the contemporary built environment is not the millennials’ legacy; it is their inheritance. They didn’t ask for cardboard modernism — they simply capitulate to its infantilizing aesthetic paradigm because there is no alternative. Or if there is an alternative, it’s between an $8 ice cream cone or an $11 ice cream cone (or a $49 ticket to the Museum of Ice Cream).</span></p><p><span>Our ugliness tour is leading us toward the $11 ice cream cone zone. On the waterfront, the spatial logic of The Josh persists, only at four times the cost per square foot. There is less random yellow, the concrete is glossier, and the view through the precarious glass is a little more ennobling. Too bad about the build quality. One paradox of the new ugliness is that it flattens the distinction between the rich, the very rich, the superrich, and the merely fortunate by ripping them all off in turn. These days housing at the most elite strata sucks nearly as much as the simply bourgeois kind. According to a parade of entertaining </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i><span> stories, residents of the toothpick-like towers on Manhattan’s Billionaires’ Row complain of elevator breakdowns, “catastrophic” flooding from poor plumbing, and “metal partitions [that] groan as buildings sway” in the wind.

Black, sinister, efficient. The logo like devil’s horns. The invisible umlaut. In the place of cuteness, Uber offered a fantasy of minimalist sadism, with the user holding the whip.”">2</a></sup> But at least as far as branding goes, OMNY is no uglier than other offenders. Our train car is covered in ads, all curiously alike despite marketing a staggering variety of superfluous stuff. How did workplace management systems, body-positive nutritional supplements, bean-forward meal kits, woman-owned sex toys, and woman-owned day-trading services all converge on the same three fonts? Everywhere we look there are little pool noodle–shaped squiggles, and where the squiggles end, there is muted flash photography that makes even otherworldly models look matter-of-fact. With the exception of the food delivery apps, which flaunt their violent takeover of the city in a meaningless word salad designed for shouting about salad —<span> WHEN YOU’RE SO HANGRY, YOU’D TRASH TALK ANY SLOW WALKER BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR BEC</span>, goes one GrubHub ad — the advertising all seems sheepish about being caught in the act of selling something.</span></p><p><span>But no single ad is as emblematically ugly as the digital screens that have appeared across the city’s train cars since 2017. Public transit has pivoted to video, and the function of its new giant iPads mystifies: their purpose is neither civic nor fully commercial. Instead, they’re given over to a bewildering set of images for the TikTokified city, the worst of which belong to a marketing campaign called “Moments in Food.” We watch, a little nauseated, as the Moments loop by: video tutorials for Homemade Pesto Hack, Homemade Chipotle Chicken Cutlet Hack, Homemade Three-Ingredient Oven-Free Blondie Hack. Why are there no measurements? Would this even seem edible, in the distinctly non-subwaylike atmosphere of an actual kitchen? Like The Josh’s synthetic not-quite-surfaces, it all seems gesturally foodlike, a step removed from the real thing. Above us, pesto glistens.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of moments in food, it’s lunchtime. Exiting the train, we pass a food hall, where, again, the theoretical possibility of endless variety manifests as lackluster sameness. Dozens of restaurants’ satellite stalls all feature the same signage, the same subway tile backdrop, the same impression of having been shrunk to diorama size and turned into IP. We turn instead to the outdoor dining sheds. After sprouting with uncharacteristic speed in the first chaotic spring of the pandemic, the sheds have performed a sort of guerilla Haussmannization of the city — in a good way, clawing back public space from cars. The ugliness they’ve introduced to the built environment diverges, happily, from the usual kind. Unruly and old-school, the sheds have pissed off deranged community boards and their mouthpieces in the media. “The shanty outside Dumpling Man on St. Marks is unspeakably hideous,” declared a recent </span><i><span>New York</span></i><span> article, “its colorless wood fragments hammered together so arbitrarily that you would rather eat in a pile of Lincoln Logs.” Yeah — just the way we like it!</span></p><p><span>Around the corner is a movie theater, one of those places where they bring snacks or cocktails right to your seat. Filmmaking today is supposed to be more powerful than it’s ever been, capable of representing everything everywhere all at once. As the world offscreen recedes into sameness, movies can and should look great — but onscreen there is more ugly sameness. The thing we wander into is at first indistinguishable from any other blockbuster of the late green-screen era: only after Ryan Reynolds cocks his signature “terror gun” do we recognize this as </span><i><span>Army Soldier II</span></i><span>,</span> <span>a digitally shot Netflix-financed production based on a TV show based on a comic book. Can a movie be a remake of itself? This is the depleted vibe </span><i><span>Army Soldier II</span></i><span> and its ilk are giving off. The easy recourse to postproduction — “we’ll fix it in post” — has resulted in a mise-en-scène so underlit as to be literally invisible. Despite its $275 million budget, the movie looks like it was filmed underwater in a polluted lake. The action scenes are nearly monochromatic, the color palette ranging from Tentative Black to what looks like Apple’s proprietary Space Gray. Lighting isn’t a lost art, but subsumed in all that murk, we’re having trouble finding it.</span></p><blockquote><p>Our neighbor to the right tells us she was hit by a Tesla while e-biking to Roosevelt Island to deliver a single unicorn latte.</p> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=Our+neighbor+to+the+right+tells+us+she+was+hit+by+a+Tesla+while+e-biking+to+Roosevelt+Island+to+deliver+a+single+unicorn+latte.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Our+neighbor+to+the+right+tells+us+she+was+hit+by+a+Tesla+while+e-biking+to+Roosevelt+Island+to+deliver+a+single+unicorn+latte.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D34098">Tweet</a></blockquote><p><span>Two and a half hours in, </span><i><span>Army Soldier II </span></i><span>suddenly becomes a comedy, with Reynolds vamping his way through long, flat takes designed to accommodate his “riffs.” Now everything is </span><i><span>over</span></i><span>lit, as if the gaffers were only available for the second half of the shoot.</span></p><p><span>Such bad lighting</span><span> — and such large portions! We exit the movie theater to a bright realization: our films are exactly as overlit as our reality. As our environment has become blander, it has also become more legible — too legible. That’s a shame, because many products of the new ugliness could benefit from a little chiaroscuroed ambiguity: if the world has to fill itself up with smart teapots, app-operated vacuum cleaners, and creepily huge menswear, we’d prefer it all to be shrouded in darkness. For thousands of years, this was the principle of illumination that triumphed over all others. Louis XIV’s Versailles and Louis the Tavern Owner’s tavern had this in common: the recognition that some details are worth keeping hidden. But now blinding illumination is the default condition of every apartment, office, pharmacy, laundromat, print shop, sandwich shop, train station, airport, grocery store, UPS Store, tattoo parlor, bank, and this vape shop we’ve just walked into.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Surveying a suite of candy-colored bongs, we reflect on the primacy of LEDs. (One of the bongs is bedecked with LEDs.) The shift to cold lighting in recent years was borne of urgent environmental necessity, and we accept that climate change requires concessions. We’re prepared to make those: we will eat crickets and endorse, if necessary, the blockage of the waterfront park around the corner by a giant seawall. We will even help build the seawall! Change is inevitable. But LEDs can appear in many colors, as demonstrated by our new light-up bong. So why this atomic, lobotomizing white?</span></p><p><span>Outdoors, the situation is depressingly similar. After New York replaced the sodium-vapor lights in the city’s 250,000 streetlamps with shiny new LEDs in 2017, the experience of walking through the city at night transformed, almost . . . overnight. Forgiving, romantic, shadowy orange gave way to cold, all-seeing bluish white. Again environmental concerns necessitate this scale of change, and again we wonder why, when it comes to its light bulbs, New York has chosen to back the blue. Inertia, disinterest, thoughtlessness, yes, but also the promise of increased police vigilance. Still, what is most striking about New York’s ominous glow-up is the sense that the city has been estranged from itself: the hyperprecise shadows of every leaf and every branch set against every brick wall deliver a Hollywood unreality. New York after hours now looks less like it did in Scorsese’s </span><i><span>After Hours </span></i><span>and more like an excessive set-bound ’60s production. The new ugliness is defined in part by an abandonment of function </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>form: buildings afraid to look like buildings, cars that look like renderings, restaurants that look like the apps that control them. New York City is a city increasingly in quotation marks, a detailed facsimile of a place.</span></p><p><span>Gah! Blinded by the intense glare of an LED streetlamp, we bump right into said streetlamp. Fortunately there’s an urgent care across the street, still open in the dwindling dusk. We’re no doctor — at least not until they start giving out PhDs in walking around — but we can tell that our knee is bleeding. If anything is broken, the CityMD’s MD will take care of it. We stumble inside, into the intersection of exploitative private insurance and inadequate public options. Here, like everywhere else, a clash of patterns and surfaces — gray tile, gray bricks, greige wood paneling — enfolds us in a numbing palliative aura. We try to check in at the front, but the iPad doesn’t react to the tap of our index finger. Are we a ghost? Is this the afterlife? The lighting is giving gates of heaven, but as with the supertall buildings and their elevators that never work, our problem is technical: the iPad is frozen. Another one is wheeled out and we make our way through a questionnaire. Allergic reactions? None. History of medical litigation? Huh, weird.</span></p><p><span>Our estimated wait time is three and a half hours, which gives us ample opportunity to reflect on our surroundings. Is there a more contemporary urban form than the urgent care facility? How did the entire world come to look like this nonplace, flimsy and artificial and built unsuccessfully to stave off emergency? Above our heads, the original </span><i><span>Army Soldier</span></i><span> plays on a flatscreen, Ryan Reynolds’s leaden features motion-smoothed into alarming definition. Our phone buzzes with a push notification from Zillow: a 0.5-bedroom studio is now available for $4,775 a month in the sub-basement of The Josh. We examine our fellow patients, because nobody else is. The bleeding young man to our left looks to have been the victim of an axe throw gone very wrong. Our neighbor to the right tells us she was hit by a Tesla while e-biking to Roosevelt Island to deliver a single unicorn latte. We overhear someone behind us describe a harrowing food poisoning incident involving a Homemade Chipotle Chicken Cutlet Hack.</span></p><p><span>In the end we pay $75 for a Band-Aid, two Advils, a Blank Street Coffee gift card, and a branded pen we have no plans to return. After a long day of digital encounters we’re asked to sign a paper receipt, and we click the pen. It looks like a pen and works the way a pen ought to work. Our eyes fill with tears at this satisfying tactile experience. Maybe it’s just the bruising.</span></p><ol><li id="fn1-34098"><p>See also the increasing dominance of cars with opaque and foreboding matte paint jobs, described by the newsletter Blackbird Spyplane as “putty-lookin’ ass whips.”&nbsp;<a href="#rf1-34098" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn2-34098"><p>Along with Molly Fischer’s 2020 study of the “millennial aesthetic” in <em>New York</em>, Jesse Barron’s 2016 essay in Real Life remains an authoritative critique of neoliberal startup semiotics, from Uber to Seamless. “In 2012, Uber stood alone.

conservative garbage collector can
be used as a garbage collecting
replacement for C <tt>malloc</tt> or C++ <tt>new</tt>.
It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would,
without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful.
The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines
that it can no longer be otherwise accessed.
A simple example of such a use is given
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/simple_example.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
The collector is also used by a number of programming language
implementations that either use C as intermediate code, want
to facilitate easier interoperation with C libraries, or
just prefer the simple collector interface.
For a more detailed description of the interface, see
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gcinterface.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
Alternatively, the garbage collector  may be used as
a <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/leak.html">leak detector</a>
for C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.
</p><p>
The arguments for and against conservative garbage collection
in C and C++ are briefly
discussed in
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/issues.html">issues.html</a>.  The beginnings of
a frequently-asked-questions list are <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/faq.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
Empirically, this collector works with most unmodified C programs,
simply by replacing
<tt>malloc</tt> with <tt>GC_malloc</tt> calls,
replacing <tt>realloc</tt> with <tt>GC_realloc</tt> calls, and removing
free calls.  Exceptions are discussed
in <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/issues.html">issues.html</a>. 
</p><h2><a name="where">Where to get the collector</a></h2>
<p>
Many versions are available in the
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gc_source">
<tt>gc_source</tt></a> subdirectory.
Currently a recent stable version is
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gc_source/gc-8.2.4.tar.gz"><tt>gc-8.2.4.tar.gz</tt></a>.
Note that this uses the new version numbering scheme
and may occasionally require a separate <tt>libatomic_ops</tt> download (see below).
</p><p>
If that fails, try the latest explicitly numbered version
in <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gc_source">
<tt>gc_source</tt></a>.
Later versions may contain additional features, platform support,
or bug fixes, but are likely to be less well tested.
</p><p>
Version 7.3 and later require that you download a corresponding
version of libatomic_ops, which should be available
in <a href="https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/wiki/Download">
<tt>https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/wiki/Download</tt></a>.
The current (stable) version is also available as
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gc_source/libatomic_ops-7.8.0.tar.gz">
<tt>gc_source/libatomic_ops-7.8.0.tar.gz</tt></a>.
You will need to place that in a <tt>libatomic_ops</tt>
subdirectory.
</p><p>
Previously it was best to use corresponding versions of gc
and libatomic_ops, but for recent versions, it should be OK to
mix and match them.
</p><p>
Starting with 8.0, libatomic_ops is only required if the compiler does
not understand gcc's C atomic intrinsics.
</p><p>
The development version of the GC source code now resides on github,
along with the downloadable packages.
The GC tree itself is at
<a href="https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/"><tt>https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/</tt></a>.
The <tt>libatomic_ops</tt> tree required by the GC is at
<a href="https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/"><tt>https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/</tt></a>.
</p><p>
To build a working version of the collector, you will need to do
something like the following, where <tt>D</tt> is the absolute
path to an installation directory:
</p><pre>cd D
git clone https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops
git clone https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc
ln -s  D/libatomic_ops D/bdwgc/libatomic_ops
cd bdwgc
autoreconf -vif
automake --add-missing
./configure
make
</pre>
This will require that you have C and C++ toolchains, <tt>git</tt>,
<tt>automake</tt>, <tt>autoconf</tt>, and <tt>libtool</tt> already
installed.
<p>
Historical versions of the source can still be found
on the SourceForge site (project "bdwgc")
<a href="http://bdwgc.cvs.sourceforge.net/bdwgc/">here</a>.

<b>IT IS PROVIDED AS IS,
WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK</b>.
</p><h2><a name="platforms">Platforms</a></h2>
The collector is not completely portable, but the distribution
includes ports to most standard PC and UNIX/Linux platforms.
The collector should work on Linux, *BSD, recent Windows versions,
MacOS X, HP/UX, Solaris,
Tru64, Irix and a few other operating systems.
Some ports are more polished than others.
There are <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/porting.html">instructions</a> for porting the collector
to a new platform.
<p>
Irix pthreads, Linux threads, Win32 threads, Solaris threads
(old style and pthreads),
HP/UX 11 pthreads, Tru64 pthreads, and MacOS X threads are supported
in recent versions.
</p><h3>Separately distributed ports</h3>
For MacOS 9/Classic use, Patrick Beard's latest port were once available from
<tt>http://homepage.mac.com/pcbeard/gc/</tt>.
<p>
Several Linux and BSD versions provide prepacked versions of the collector.
The Debian port can be found at
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgc-dev">
https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgc-dev</a>.
</p><h2><a name="multiprocessors">Scalable multiprocessor versions</a></h2>
Kenjiro Taura, Toshio Endo, and Akinori Yonezawa developed a parallel collector
based on this one.  It was once available from <tt>http://www.yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gc/</tt>
Their collector takes advantage of multiple processors
during a collection.  Starting with collector version 6.0alpha1
we also do this, though with more modest processor scalability goals.
Our approach is discussed briefly in
<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/scale.html"><tt>scale.html</tt></a>.
<h2><a name="details">Some Collector Details</a></h2>
The collector uses a <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/complexity.html">mark-sweep</a> algorithm.
It provides incremental and generational
collection under operating systems which provide the right kind of
virtual memory support.  (Currently this includes SunOS[45], IRIX,
OSF/1, Linux, and Windows, with varying restrictions.)
It allows <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/finalization.html"><i>finalization</i></a> code
to be invoked when an object is collected.
It can take advantage of type information to locate pointers if such
information is provided, but it is usually used without such information.
ee the README and
<tt>gc.h</tt> files in the distribution for more details.
<p>
For an overview of the implementation, see <a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gcdescr.html">here</a>.
</p><p>
The garbage collector distribution includes a C string
(<a href="https://hboehm.info/gc/gc_source/cordh.txt"><i>cord</i></a>) package that provides
for fast concatenation and substring operations on long strings.
A simple curses- and win32-based editor that represents the entire file
as a cord is included as a
sample application.
</p><p>
Performance of the nonincremental collector is typically competitive
with malloc/free implementations.  Both space and time overhead are
likely to be only slightly higher
for programs written for malloc/free
(see Detlefs, Dosser and Zorn's
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/techreports/zorn/CU-CS-665-93.ps.Z">Memory Allocation Costs in Large C and C++ Programs</a>.)
For programs allocating primarily very small objects, the collector
may be faster; for programs allocating primarily large objects it will
be slower.  If the collector is used in a multithreaded environment
and configured for thread-local allocation, it may in some cases
significantly outperform malloc/free allocation in time.
</p><p>
We also expect that in many cases any additional overhead
will be more than compensated for by decreased copying etc.
if programs are written
and tuned for garbage collection.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you don’t know who Mark Dawson is, he’s a self-published author who has 203,722 ratings on Goodreads. He says himself that his books have had over 6 million downloads (including both paid and free promotional copies). He runs the Self Publishing Formula course and podcast, he talks at the 20BooksTo50K conference in Vegas, and he’s part of a new initiative called Fuse Publishing. He’s a pretty big deal in self-publishing, so what he does reflects on self-publishing as a whole.</p>

<p>I was wondering how this guy published so many books in so little time and I found my answer: he stole a lot of his material.</p>

<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “… the smell of the cleaning fluid that had been used on its metallic parts, the cold touch of the aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket. He felt the chill of the fibreglass stock against his cheek.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy] “We pass the iron girder skeleton of a building that never seems to get finished”</li>
<li>[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson] “Milton passed the iron girder skeleton of a building”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy] “little shops, outlets for cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs, and heroin—which in Juarez are called picaderos, usually marked by a shoe tied to a nearby telegraph wire”</li>
<li>[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson] “Milton knew about Juarez […] Illicit outlets—picaderos—were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires, and their shifty proprietors sold whatever illicit substance you needed to get high”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>An older version of Saint Death said “Illicit outlets––picaderos––were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires and their shifty proprietors sold cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs and heroin. The legitimate marketplace at Cerrajeros was busy with custom, a broad sweep of unwanted bric-a-brac for sale: discarded furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator fridges.” but he changed it. So it was even more plagiarized before. You can look it up in Google and it’ll show up, though it leads to a weird scam site which will try to convince you that you have a virus on your computer but I still think that counts as proof as I’m assuming the scam site simply copied an older version of his book verbatim before he sent out an update through Kindle to cover up his more blatant plagiarism.</li>
<li>This also matches up to another passage from Amexica: “… lines the streets in overload quantities: sixties furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator cookers and Osterizer blenders…” So Mark changed sixties furniture to discarded furniture and Kelvinator cookers to Kelvinator fridges. Nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I found all this in an hour or two, just looking at a few of his books, and only looking at the first few pages which were available for free in the Kindle sample and typing suspicious sentences into Google. He’s probably plagiarized a lot more and hidden it with after-the-fact edits and rearranging words in a way that’s harder to check using a search engine.</p>

<p>Basic rule: read through one of his books and type any phrase that seems either interesting and profound or technical about matters he’s not familiar with like guns into Google in quotes. You’ll probably find that he took it from somewhere else.</p>

<p>“Harlequins of youth much in evidence?” Never heard that sentence before. Oh, he didn’t write it.</p>

<p>“Fur-trimmed Afghans?” What are those? Oh, he probably doesn’t know either. Because he didn’t write it.</p>

<p>“Misty slopes of the massif” “Mil-dot-rich reticle” “iron girder skeleton of a building” etc.</p>

<p>For original prose you get clunky purple prose like “the sun glared down, a myriad of shafts that lanced into his eyes.” I mean, a myriad of shafts sounds like you’re talking about golf clubs or genitals. I would HOPE neither of those are lancing you in the eye.</p>

<p>It seems unfair that he’s reportedly sold 6 million books and is so involved in these groups while heavily plagiarizing when books like <em>How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life</em> get cancelled entirely for plagiarism. But maybe in self-publishing things just work differently. But I feel like an author who sells 6 million books should be held to a higher standard whether they’re self-published or not.</p>

<p>(If this was not the right sub to post something like this, then I apologize and I'll take it down. I just thought more people should know about this because it seems like most of his fans have no idea he plagiarizes.)</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>EDIT: A previous of this version incorrectly stated that Mark Dawson wrote 20 books in 2 years. This was based on a cursory look of his Wikipedia page, where it seems to suggest he published 20 books (meaning both novels and novellas) from 2013 to 2015. However, it has been brought to my attention that many people took 'book' to mean full-length novel, not novella, and that a lot of these books had either been written previously and were just now being published, or had listed co-authors. So 20 novels and novellas with his name on them were published between 2013 and 2015 according to his Wikipedia bibliography, but that doesn't mean he necessarily wrote 20 books in 2 years. Apologies for any misinformation.</p>

<p>Hopefully after that blunder I still have some credibility.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I’ve now reached out to Vox, Forbes, the New York Times, the Guardian, and CBS News with tips.</p>

<p>Some people were also telling me to reach out to various YouTubers and internet personalities to see if they were interested in tweeting about it or investigating it further, but many of them have their Twitter DMs closed and only have brand emails for emailing about sponsorships and such which are only read by a third party. So if you would like to see them talk about this and you know better ways to contact them, feel free to send it their way.</p>

<p>But for now I’m going to focus less on getting the word out and more on finding new examples of plagiarism within Mark Dawson’s other books.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: It seems I've found another source of inspiration.</p>

<ul>
<li>“tree allees, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, boxwood parterres” [<a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html</a>]</li>
<li>“tree allées, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, and boxwood parterres” [The Driver by Mark Dawson (62% of sample on Kindle)]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look up even the shortened form “tree allées, expansive lawns” only the article and The Driver appear. Doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. The website is copyrighted for 2013, while The Driver came out in January 4, 2014, according to Goodreads. Mark does noticeably fix the spelling of allées though, so that’s nice.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: He really likes the Morgan Estate apparently.</p>

<ul>
<li>“A majestic wrought iron gate brought in from a Southern plantation” [<a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/</a>] (again copyrighted for 2013)</li>
<li>“a majestic wrought-iron gate that looked like it belonged on a Southern plantation” [The Driver by Mark Dawson (60% of sample)]</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>[A quote by Stephen Thomas Erlewine which is available from many sources including the All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music from 2001, page 396; notably, this is also the bio for the band on iHeart] “Suede kick-started the Brit pop revolution of the '90s, bringing English indie pop/rock music away from the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions of Madchester, and reinstating such conventions of British pop as mystique and the three-minute single.”</li>
<li>[The Driver by Mark Dawson, 2014, 69% of sample (nice)] “He liked the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions from the Madchester era and the sharp, clean three-minute singles that had evolved out of it. Suede and Sleeper and Blur.”</li>
</ul>

<p>“Swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions” is a pretty generic phrase though, don’t you think? Could definitely just be a coincidence.</p>

<p>EDIT 6:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Page 169 of Mayfair Magazine October 2013] “oak parquetry floor, inlaid with ebony wood, with a gilded fireplace from a palazzo near Florence, Italy, no less.”</li>
<li>[77% of sample of The Driver, published in 2014] “oak parquetry floor inlaid with ebony, a gilded fireplace that belonged in a palazzo as the focal point of the wall”</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ <a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html</a> ] (2013) “The upper silk fabric walls that blend with the original wainscoting painted by Dutch painter Van Amstel set the unique intimately warm tone of this office that includes a private powder room and a large wood burning fireplace.”</li>
<li>[79% of sample of The Driver from 2014] “Silk fabric walls blended with painted wainscoting. There was a private powder room and a large wood-burning fireplace.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, it may seem like it’s not plagiarism, but think about the elements of the sentence. The word order is the same: silk fabric walls, then wainscoting, then the powder room, then the fireplace. And the powder room is specifically private, and the fireplace is specifically large and fire-burning, and the walls specifically blend with the wainscoting. Though the sentences look different, the structure and verbiage is pretty much identical. It doesn’t even seem like Mark read this once and recalled it from memory. It seems like he wrote the first quote down word for word, then looked for a way to edit it so it might not show up on an automated plagiarism checker.</p>

<p>There’s also another similarity with I, Sniper and Tarantula. They both contain this phrase: “in a steady two-hand grip, trigger finger indexed above the trigger guard.” Both halves of that phrase seem somewhat commonplace, but the combined phrase is unique to those two.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people were saying “That’s just how snipers operate,” and I agree that technical jargon and actions are going to be described similarly in different works. There aren’t that many ways to say someone shot a gun or slammed a door shut. But the larger context is the similarity of both scenes overall:</p>

<p>In I, Sniper, (1 through 5 are in the span of three paragraphs):</p>

<ol>
<li>The protagonist Bob settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, and sees the world through the the mil-dot-rich reticle)</li>
<li>He diddles with the focus ring until it declares the world pristine and hard-edged at five to eight hundred yards</li>
<li>He uses a Leica laser</li>
<li>He pulls out a Kestral 4000 weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)</li>
<li>He runs the data through his Palm Pilot, dials them into the scope of his rifle, then adjusts for windage</li>
<li>Then a few paragraphs later, he is alone in the world of scope, home in the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, his finger on the trigger</li>
</ol>

<p>In Tarantula, (1 through 5 are in the span of two paragraphs):</p>

<ol>
<li>A character called Tarantula settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, stares into it and sees the trees and vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle)</li>
<li>He makes a minute adjustment to the focus ring until the last remnant of blur is gone</li>
<li>He uses his handheld laser</li>
<li>He takes out a small weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)</li>
<li>He notes the data in a small notebook and calculates the solutions and dials those calculations into his rifle, then adjusts for windage</li>
<li>Then a few paragraphs later, he shuts out everything except for the scope, concentrating on the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, and… an aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket? Definitely sounds like something a real gun buff would write...</li>
</ol>

<p>Also he seems to have taken information from a gun website basically verbatim:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ <a href="https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/">https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/</a> ] “The folding bipod is mounted onto upper rails (above the barrel), and the adjustable horizontal front grip is mounted on the lower rails (under the barrel). The rifle features fully adjustable buttstock and cheekpiece. […] The barrel is protected by ventilated aluminum handguard and is fitted with muzzle brake (very useful when firing full-power magnum loads).”</li>
<li>[Tarantula, 43% of sample] “The folding bipod was mounted onto upper rails above the barrel and the adjustable horizontal front grip was mounted on the lower rails, under the barrel. The rifle had an adjustable stock and cheekpiece. The barrel was protected by a ventilated aluminium hand guard and was fitted with a muzzle brake, useful when firing full-power magnum loads like this.”</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, is this what we’re calling research these days? Just dumping an encyclopedia article into your novel with minimal editing?</p>

<p>EDIT 8:</p>

<p>Fixed the part where I said he had sold 6 million books. Someone in the comments said the 6 million figure is for downloads which includes freebies, so the actual sales figure may be a bit different. His latest John Milton book which isn't out yet says "Five Million Copies Sold" on the cover, though that might just be for the John Milton series specifically. His site says, "6 million books downloaded worldwide," not sold. Though his Twitter bio says "over 6m copies sold worldwide," so it could be that his website just hasn't been updated as recently. I'm just going to be safe and say "over 6 million downloads."</p>

<p>Also, somebody noticed that in his newer books, Mark is using a new tactic:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Never Let Me Down Again, 89% sample] "He opened Wikipedia and skimmed the details. It was a small resort on the coast with the locals relying on tourism to help them make their way. It was set on the edge of the Firth of Lorn, the bay reaching out in a horseshoe shape and shielded by the island of Kerrera and, beyond that, the larger Isle of Mull"</li>
<li>[Wikipedia article on Oban] "Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay forms a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull."</li>
</ul>

<p>All you have to do is have your character read Wikipedia in-universe so that you automatically cite your sources. Pretty good strategy, I must say. (This definitely isn't the most offensive of the evidence, I just found it funny that he just has his characters reading Wikipedia on their phones now.)</p>

<p>EDIT 9:</p>

<p>It looks like Mark Dawson has removed the Kindle version of Tarantula from Amazon, leaving only the Audible version up. He notably also did this with his novel The Black Mile, which some reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have accused of being extremely similar to LA Confidential.</p>

<p>I probably won't be updating this post too much, as I am pretty busy in my personal life, but I encourage people to share the information with newspapers and literary influencers and the like, and I'd also like to point out some common errors I see in articles being written on Substack and Medium:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mark Dawson did not write 20 books in 2 years. (I take full responsibility for this one. Despite correcting this claim in my post, the thumbnail for this post still says it on other platforms, forever reminding me of my mistake. Ugh). Also, generally I'd say don't mention prolificness at all. It makes other prolific authors feel like you're insulting their craft.</li>
<li>Mark Dawson does not run 20BooksTo50K. Michael Anderle started it, and Craig Martelle runs it. Mark Dawson has talked at their Vegas conference as a guest speaker, but that seems to be the extent of his involvement. Generally, don't mention 20BooksTo50K at all other than to say that he's a pretty well-connected, popular author who gets invited to guest speak at conferences. The group has a lot of fans who will defend it, and obviously saying he runs it when he doesn't isn't great for your case.</li>
<li>No conspiracy theories about ChatGPT. He wrote these books 10 years ago.</li>
<li>And obviously, no insulting self-publishing as a whole, or saying that any author who finds success is a sellout. For some reason, I see a lot of people doing this. When you write about a popular self-published author, you're going to attract people who are interested in the self-publishing space. Those people are not going to want to be told that most bestselling self-published books are worthless trash. That should be obvious.</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you'd like to help spread the story, please try not to repeat any of the misinformation listed above. It weakens our case and makes it easy for someone to dismiss an entire article based on a singular factual mistake.</p>

That one </span><code>rsync</code><span> that uses the correct SSH client binary on the other side and that preserves timestamps and permission – also in there. The ugly bastard of a command that combined </span><code>git grep</code><span> with </span><code>find</code><span> and 8 ugly incantations of AWK chained together – locked in there too. The test command I ran yesterday is as reachable as the one command with 12 </span><code>&amp;&amp;</code><span> in it that I ran 3 years ago, all thanks to a long shell history file.</span></p><p><span>Truly: </span><code>~/.zsh_history</code><span> is one of the most important files on my machine. I make use of it tens of times every day, whenever I hit </span><code>Ctrl-r</code><span>. If I wasn’t such a doofus it would contain even more than 26278 commands, because I’ve been keeping a long shell history for nearly a decade. But since I </span><em>am</em><span> such a doofus, I forgot to back it up (or deleted the backup too early) a few times and hence the </span><code>~/.zsh_history</code><span> on the machine I’m typing this only contains 1034 commands.</span></p><p>Someone might say: “well, if the command was that important, why don’t you save it to a script?” And to that I say: look, man, if I knew in advance which command would turn out to be important, then we wouldn’t be here, because I’d already have ascended to the astral realm.</p><p><span>Also: why </span><em>would</em><span> I record it in a script if I can just configure my shell to keep track of all of those commands for me? It’s cheap, it’s fast, there’s essentially no downsides to it: the largest </span><code>~/.zsh_history</code><span> I have is 2MB and I can fuzzy-search through it in </span><em>milliseconds</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>                </span><strong>***</strong></p><p>So, to repeat: your shell – ZSH, Bash, Fish, or others – can record every command you execute in it and I’m begging you to make sure it is configured to do that.</p><p><span>Make sure it keeps track of </span><em>a lot</em><span> of commands. So many commands that when you put the number in your rc-file you think: that’s ridiculous, why would I need to record that many commands? Double that number.

HISTSIZE=50000
SAVEHIST=50000

# Immediately append to history file:
setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY

# Record timestamp in history:
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY

# Expire duplicate entries first when trimming history:
setopt HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST

# Dont record an entry that was just recorded again:

# Delete old recorded entry if new entry is a duplicate:
setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS

# Do not display a line previously found:

# Dont record an entry starting with a space:
setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE

# Dont write duplicate entries in the history file:
setopt HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS

# Share history between all sessions:
setopt SHARE_HISTORY

# Execute commands using history (e.g.: using !$) immediatel:
unsetopt HIST_VERIFY
</code></code></pre><p><span>That was combined with </span><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" rel="">fzf</a><span> to fuzzy-search through the history on </span><code>ctrl-r</code><span>.</span></p><p>Configure your shell roughly like that and there you are: living the good shell life.</p><p><span>Or you can use </span><a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin" rel="">Atuin</a><span>, which I’ve been trying out for the last few weeks and have come to love. It’s a drop-in enhancement of your shell’s history functionality and not only gives you everything I described above – incredibly long shell history and fuzzy-search through it – but also syncing and backup (yup, need that) of shell history across multiple machines, filtering commands by machine, working-directory-specific history and probably 13 other things I forgot. It’s </span><em>very</em><span> nice. Highly recommend it.</span></p><p>Whatever you use: make sure your shell history is recorded, make sure your shell history can grow ridiculously long, and get a fuzzy-search for it.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

		<span><p>There is a large and growing divide in terms of who gets to work from home. Research on job postings found that remote work is far more common for higher paid roles, for roles that require more experience, for full-time work, and for roles that require more education. Managers should be aware of this divide, as it has the potential to create toxic dynamics within teams and to sap morale.</p>

								<p>Remote work has exploded since the pandemic struck, and employees like it. In speaking to hundreds of managers about this development, one concern crops up again and again: The shift to remote work is highly unequal. Front-line staff with modest paychecks rarely enjoy the benefits of working from home. Instead, they commute every workday to engage customers and coworkers, operate machinery, and look after facilities. In contrast, highly paid professionals and managers often work from home two or three days a week — saving time, money, and aggravation. Business leaders rightly worry that this divide could hurt morale among front-line staff, undermine perceived fairness, and create new rifts in the workforce.</p>

<h4>Jeff Thompson</h4>

<p>The collision of objects underlies most game experiences and user-interfaces. Baseball bats collide with balls, zombies bump into walls, and Mario lands on platforms and stomps turtles. Even something as simple as clicking a button (a rectangle) with your mouse (a point) is a collision.</p>

<p>This book explains the algorithms behind those collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines so you can implement them into your own projects.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> This site has been getting lots of visits which is awesome. I've made some changes so it will look better on mobile devices, make navigation easier, and tried to look over everything for mistakes. If you have any problems or suggestions, please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues">post an issue on the project repository</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Ready to get started? Skip ahead to the <a href="https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php">Table of Contents...</a></p>
<!-- <a href="table_of_contents.php"><p class="nextPage">Skip ahead to the Table of Contents</p></a> -->

<h2>WHAT'S COVERED HERE?</h2>
<p>This book covers collisions between points, circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and triangles. These examples are meant to be as readable and easily understood as possible. There are definitely faster, more efficient ways to detect these collisions, but this book is intended to be friendly and teach the principles with minimal math.</p>

<p>Each section include a description of the collision algorithm and an interactive example built using <code>processing.js</code>. You can <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection">view the source code for all the examples (and this book!) on GitHub.</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE!</strong> If you're on a mobile device, the examples might not work super well for you. They are designed for mouse input, so if you're getting frustrated or your finger is in the way, try the site on a computer.</p>

<h2>WHAT'S NOT?</h2>
<p>As with any book, there's a lot more useful material than could be covered here. Things that aren't discussed are mostly left out because the math gets too complicated. Three-dimensional space isn't touched on. Ellipses, which seem like they should be pretty easy, are actually very difficult.</p>

<p>If there's a specific collision not covered that would be helpful, please please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues"> submit an issue with a request</a> or, better yet, submit a working example that you've built!</p>

<h2>ISSUES?</h2>
<p>If you find code that doesn't run correctly, an algorithm that isn't explained quite right, or a typo, please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues">report them at this project's GitHub repository</a>. Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>OK, let's write some code! Click the link at the bottom the page, or the arrows at the top, to move to the next chapter. The <code>Collision Detection</code> link at the top will take you back to the <a href="https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php">Table of Contents</a>.</p>
