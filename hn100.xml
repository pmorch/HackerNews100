                    <p>A new molecule developed by Stanford Medicine researchers (turquoise and yellow) tethers two proteins (purple and red) that together switch on self-destruction genes in cancer cells.<br>
<i>Ella Maru Studio</i></p>
                </div></div>
<div id="main_content">
    <p>Our bodies divest themselves of 60 billion cells every day through a natural process of cell culling and turnover called apoptosis.</p>
<p>These cells — mainly blood and gut cells — are all replaced with new ones, but the way our bodies rid themselves of material could have profound implications for cancer therapies in a new approach developed by Stanford Medicine researchers.</p>
<p>They aim to use this natural method of cell death to trick cancer cells into disposing of themselves. Their method accomplishes this by artificially bringing together two proteins in such a way that the new compound switches on a set of cell death genes, ultimately driving tumor cells to turn on themselves. The researchers describe their <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl5361?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">latest such compound</a> in a paper published Oct. 4 in <i>Science</i>.</p>
<p>The idea came to <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/gerald-crabtree">Gerald Crabtree</a>, MD, a professor of development biology, during a pandemic stroll through the forests of Kings Mountain, west of Palo Alto, California. As he walked, Crabtree, a longtime cancer biologist, was thinking about major milestones in biology.</p>
<p>One of the milestones he pondered was the 1970s-era discovery that cells trigger their own deaths for the greater good of the organism. Apoptosis turns out to be critical for many biological processes, including proper development of all organs and the fine-tuning of our immune systems. That system retains pathogen-recognizing cells but kills off self-recognizing ones, thus preventing autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>“It occurred to me, Well gee, this is the way we want to treat cancer,” said Crabtree, a co-senior author on the study who is the David Korn, MD, Professor in Pathology. “We essentially want to have the same kind of specificity that can eliminate 60 billion cells with no bystanders, so no cell is killed that is not the proper object of the killing mechanism.”</p>


</div>

<div id="main_text">
    <p>Traditional treatments for cancer — namely chemotherapy and radiation — often kill large numbers of healthy cells alongside the cancerous ones. To harness cells’ natural and highly specific self-destruction abilities, the team developed a kind of molecular glue that sticks together two proteins that normally would have nothing to do with one another.</p>
<h3>Flipping the cancer script</h3>
<p>One of these proteins, BCL6, when mutated, drives the blood cancer known as diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma. This kind of cancer-driving protein is also referred to as an oncogene. In lymphoma, the mutated BCL6 sits on DNA near apoptosis-promoting genes and keeps them switched off, helping the cancer cells retain their signature immortality.</p>
<p>The researchers developed a molecule that tethers BCL6 to a protein known as CDK9, which acts as an enzyme that catalyzes gene activation, in this case, switching on the set of apoptosis genes that BCL6 normally keeps off.</p>
<p>“The idea is, Can you turn a cancer dependency into a cancer-killing signal?” asked <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/nathanael-gray">Nathanael Gray</a>, PhD, co-senior author with Crabtree, the Krishnan-Shah Family Professor and a chemical and systems biology professor. “You take something that the cancer is addicted to for its survival and you flip the script and make that be the very thing that kills it.”</p>
<p>This approach — switching something on that is off in cancer cells — stands in contrast to many other kinds of targeted cancer therapies that inhibit specific drivers of cancer, switching off something that is normally on.</p>
<p>“Since oncogenes were discovered, people have been trying to shut them down in cancer,” said Roman Sarott, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford Medicine and co-first author on the study. “Instead, we’re trying to use them to turn signaling on that, we hope, will prove beneficial for treatment.”</p>

</div>

<div id="main_text_0">
    <p>When the team tested the molecule in diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma cells in the lab, they found that it indeed killed the cancer cells with high potency. They also tested the molecule in healthy mice and found no obvious toxic side effects, even though the molecule killed off a specific category of of the animals’ healthy B cells, a kind of immune cell, which also depend on BCL6. They’re now testing the compound in mice with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to gauge its ability to kill cancer in a living animal.</p>
<p>Because the technique relies on the cells’ natural supply of BCL6 and CDK9 proteins, it seems to be very specific for the lymphoma cells — the BCL6 protein is found only in this kind of lymphoma cell and in one specific kind of B cell. The researchers tested the molecule in 859 different kinds of cancer cells in the lab; the chimeric compound killed only diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma cells.</p>
<p>And because BCL6 normally acts on 13 different apoptosis-promoting genes, the researchers hope their strategy will avoid the treatment resistance that seems so common in cancer. Cancer is often able to rapidly adapt to therapies that target only one of the disease’s weak spots, and some of these therapies may stop cancer from growing without killing the cells entirely. The research team hopes that by blasting the cells with multiple different cell death signals at once, the cancer will not be able to survive long enough to evolve resistance, although this idea remains to be tested.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of cell death by committee,” said Sai Gourisankar, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar and co-first author on the study. “And once a cancer cell is dead, that’s a terminal state.”</p>
<p>Crabtree and Gray, both members of the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/cancer.html">Stanford Cancer Institute</a>, are co-founders of a biotech startup, Shenandoah Therapeutics, that aims to further test this molecule and a similar, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06348-2">previously developed molecule</a> in hopes of gathering enough pre-clinical data to support launching clinical trials of the compounds. They also plan to build similar molecules that could target other cancer-driving proteins, including the oncogene Ras, which is a driver of several different kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>The study was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Institutes of Health (grants CA276167, CA163915, MH126720-01 and 5F31HD103339-03), the Mary Kay Foundation, the Schweitzer Family Fund, the SPARK Translational Research Program at Stanford University and Bio-X at Stanford University.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinboone.me/img/tux_win.png"></p>
<p>The Internet is full of rants about systemd, and I don’t want this
post to be another one. Many of the complaints people make about it
don’t stand up to much scrutiny, even the technical ones; and many
complaints are not even technical. My particular interest in Linux is
primarily for embedded applications; and there, I suggest, systemd is
creating a potential (technical) problem. In this article I will try to
articulate what the problem is; but I have no solution to offer.</p>
<h2 id="recapping-the-last-ten-years">Recapping the last ten years</h2>
<p>systemd is a set of integrated applications concerned with system
management. It replaces not only the traditional <code>init</code>
process that brings up long-lived processes, but also much of the other
system infrastructure: user session management, device management,
logging, timing, and an increasing number of other functions.</p>
<p>The majority of Linux users are uninterested in the pros and cons of
systemd. A small number are violently opposed to it, and a small number
are violently opposed to those who are opposed to it. Nevertheless, most
mainstream Linux distributions have adopted it after a shorter (Fedora)
or longer (Debian) period of argument.</p>
<p>I think there’s little argument that the main target for systemd is a
general-purpose computer, with a modern, integrated graphical desktop
(Gnome, KDE). systemd does well in systems like this because it can
handle process initialization on demand and in parallel. This
potentially makes boot times faster, and keeps resource usage down,
because it isn’t necessary to start a lot of services that are used only
occasionally. I don’t think these advantages are the main reasons for
systemd’s widespread adoption (see below), but they’re certainly
important.</p>
<h2 id="embedded-linux-the-problem">Embedded Linux: the problem</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, what makes systemd good for general-purpose desktop
applications potentially makes it unsatisfactory for embedded Linux
systems. As an illustration, I’ll show some memory figures from the
Raspberry Pi 3B that’s currently on my workbench. The board is running
the DietPi Linux distribution – probably the best fully-maintained Pi
distribution, if you want a minimal system. Although DietPi uses systemd
(it has little alternative, as I’ll explain later) it doesn’t
necessarily use the full set of components. In fact, a minimal
installation of DietPi, for console operation, installs only the systemd
service manager (the ‘init’ process), the log daemon, and the
<code>udev</code> daemon.</p>
<p>This is the resource usage, as reported by <code>top</code>, for the
systemd init process (alone) on the Raspberry Pi 3B.</p>
<pre><code>    PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM
      1 root      20   0  168144  11404   8592 S   0.0   0.3</code></pre>
<p>systemd init is not a particularly greedy user of memory by
contemporary standards – its virtual address space is 168Mb, but only
~8Mb is currently mapped to RAM. That’s about 0.3% of the Pi 3’s 4Gb of
RAM. But here’s the same figures for SystemV <code>init</code>, on
exactly the same hardware:</p>
<pre><code>  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM
    1 root      20   0    2744   1532   1436 S   0.0   0.2</code></pre>
<p>It’s <em>much</em> smaller. Just to be clear – I got the systemd
implementation and the SystemV init implementation from the same Debian
ARM binary repository. I haven’t used fiddly compiler optimizations or
anything like that, to bias the resource usage figures.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the systemd logging daemon,
<code>systemd-journald</code>.</p>
<pre><code>  PID USER     PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
    147 root   20   0   41508   7744   6652 S   0.0   0.2   0:12.05 systemd-jour+</code></pre>
<p>Again, it’s a small, but noticeable, user of the 4Gb RAM. And, for
comparison, these are the figures from my own <a href="https://github.com/kevinboone/syslogd-lite">syslogd-lite</a>,
which I wrote specifically for embedded applications.</p>
<pre><code> PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
  117 root     20   0    1976     72      0 S   0.0   0.0   0:00.00 syslogd</code></pre>
<p>Note that the memory and CPU usage of this logging daemon are both
essentially zero. This is an unfair comparison, in a way, because I
wrote syslogd-lite specifically to minimize resource usage, and it has
few features. But it shows that it’s plausible to write utilities
that<br>
target embedded systems specifically, and sometimes it’s necessary.
systemd does not do this, and was never intended to. Running a
general-purpose software set like systemd on minimal, embedded hardware
can’t be expected to be effective.</p>
<p>With care, though, a minimal installation of systemd <em>does</em>
run on a low-resource ARM board like the Pi 3. In fact, it will run on a
board with 1Gb RAM, perhaps even lower. But, as the RAM decreases, the
proportion of it occupied by systemd increases.</p>
<p>What’s less obvious is the effect on boot time of the use of systemd
init. Proponents of systemd argue – correctly, I think – that it
decreases boot time in the kinds of system for which it was designed.
But on my Pi 3 it increases boot time quite noticeably. That is, the
systemd ‘init’ process takes an extra half-second or so to start,
compared to SystemV init. Half a second isn’t much, but in an embedded
application I actually care about boot time. I couldn’t care less on my
desktop computers, because they spend most of their lives suspended. I
rarely actually reboot them.</p>
<p>The extra start-up time of the init process is the result, I guess,
of the additional size and complexity of the systemd executable. It’s
about 200kB in size itself, and dynamically links 26 other libraries.
SystemV init, on the same hardware, is 40kB, and links only the standard
C library. The additional complexity of systemd is not wasted: it’s
needed for the additional functionality that systemd offers, in its
intended environment. But this functionality is mostly not needed in an
embedded application, so the additional complexity of systemd is a cost
without a benefit.</p>
<p>I’ve found that most of the services that systemd replaces have an
alternative that is smaller, and faster to start, in an embedded
environment. Unfortunately, some of these services don’t <em>have</em>
an alternative any more.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>I’m not obliged to run systemd on my Raspberry Pi systems and, in
fact, usually I do not. I build my own Linux installation, using
binaries that I cherry-pick from the Debian repositories, and code I
write myself. Most of the binaries work without systemd. Some complain
about not finding systemd, but work anyway. Some things don’t work
without systemd: the Gnome display manager, for example, as it is built
for the standard Raspberry Pi, won’t work. It can be made to work, but
you have to build it from source. How long it will continue to work,
even if built from source, is open to question. But I’m not going to be
running Gnome on an embedded Linux board, so I don’t see this as a
problem for my applications.</p>
<p>The more fundamental problem is that <em>the people who most like
systemd are distribution managers</em>. Sure, there are administrators
who like it, and defend it vigorously; but most end users and
administrators don’t really care. But for the maintainers of mainstream
Linux distributions, systemd is like Christmas. systemd works reasonably
well for a whole range of usage scenarios and, best of all, it all comes
in one bundle. So a distribution manager doesn’t have to maintain,
integrate, and support a whole bunch of system utilities from different
sources – systemd provides everything in one huge build.</p>
<p>There are just a few Linux distributions that don’t use systemd, and
they are not widely used. Maintaining them is difficult, with just a
handful of volunteers. All the large, commercial Linux providers have
moved to systemd.</p>
<p>Only Gentoo and its derivatives (so far as I know) make systemd
optional, with fully-supported alternatives. And even Gentoo can’t be
made 100% free of systemd – not in practice.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-even-practical-to-avoid-systemd-any-more">Is it even
practical to avoid systemd any more?</h2>
<p>Take, for example, the <code>udev</code> daemon. This service
monitors the kernel, and makes configuration changes when devices are
added and removed. It’s not an essential part of Linux, but it removes
the need for a whole heap of manual configuration.</p>
<p><em>At the time of writing there is no fully-featured
<code>udev</code> implementation outside of systemd</em>. The original
<code>udev</code> code was absorbed into the systemd project about ten
years ago. The Gentoo alternative <code>eudev</code> is no longer fully
maintained. At present, if your Linux distribution requires
<code>udev</code>, you’re forced to use the version from systemd. This
version can be used without the rest of systemd, but it nevertheless
does systemd operations. In particular, it tries to communicate with
systemd over DBus. This communication (so far) fails gracefully if
systemd is not present, but it’s not clear how long this will continue
to be the case.</p>
<p>systemd is a tightly-coupled set of services. I don’t think a design
goal of the systemd maintainers is to make its components modular.
<code>udev</code> doesn’t need to talk to systemd but, clearly, there’s
some benefit to its doing so in a systemd installation. I understand
that there was a kind of ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ between the systemd
maintainers and the Gentoo maintainers, to keep <code>udev</code>
independent of the rest of systemd. I think we can see that this
agreement has broken down a little already; I suspect it will break down
more, if the systemd folks think that tighter integration will make
systemd work better.</p>
<p>Many parts of systemd continue – for now – to have non-systemd
alternatives. For example, systemd has a clock synchronizer
<code>systemd_systemtimed</code>. The systemd maintainers are perfectly
honest that this software lacks features that exist in alternatives like
Chrony and OpenNTPD, and it’s less accurate. <code>systemd_timed</code>
is included because it’s fast to start, and satisfactory for
applications where exact time synchronization is not critical.</p>
<p>At present, Chrony remains widely used, even in some distributions
(like Fedora) that use systemd. But with systemd becoming ubiquitous,
what motivation will there be to maintain non-systemd alternatives?
These alternatives could fall into disrepair, even though some are
superior to the systemd utilities – and even the systemd maintainers
admit this.</p>
<p>Similarly, systemd has a DHCP client. It isn’t the only DHCP client
that is available, but my concern is that one day it might be. In my
tests, I’ve found that the systemd components are larger, and slower to
start, than the traditional alternatives (where they still exist).
Again, this isn’t a criticism of systemd itself – I’m testing them in an
environment they were not designed for.</p>
<h2 id="so-where-does-that-leave-embedded-linux">So where does that
leave embedded Linux?</h2>
<p>I’ve found that many systemd components are less effective in an
embedded environment than the traditional alternatives. I’ve shown some
illustrative examples in this article, but I really don’t think there’s
much controversy here: this simply isn’t the environment that systemd
was designed for. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to find a
mainstream Linux distribution that doesn’t use systemd – even Raspberry
Pi distributions use it. As systemd absorbs more functionality into
itself, there’s going to be little motivation to maintain alternatives.
After all, if everybody uses systemd, what motivation is there to
support anything else? My concern is that we’re moving towards a future
where Linux is inconceivable without systemd. That will be a problem for
those environments where systemd really doesn’t shine.</p>
<p>I wish I knew the solution to this problem. There’s no point
complaining about systemd, because distribution maintainers have grown
to like it too much. And, in any event, well-reasoned, technical
concerns are drowned out by all the ranting and conspiracy theories. All
we can do – if we care – is to continue to use and support Linux
distributions that don’t insist on systemd, and stand ready to develop
or maintain alternatives to those bits of Linux that it absorbs.</p>

            <guid>42036303</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 21:42:03 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/redis-postgresql/">https://spin.atomicobject.com/redis-postgresql/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42036303">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

					<p>There’s a tried-and-true architecture that I’ve seen many times for supporting your web services and applications:</p>
<ul id="condensed">
<li>PostgreSQL for data storage</li>
<li>Redis for coordinating background job queues (and some limited atomic operations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Redis is fantastic, but what if I told you that its most common use cases for this stack could actually be achieved using only PostgreSQL?</p>
<h2 id="use-case-1-job-queuing">Use Case 1: Job Queuing</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common use of Redis I’ve seen is to coordinate dispatching of jobs from your web service to a pool of background workers. The concept is that you’d like to record the desire for some background job to be performed (perhaps with some input data) and to ensure that only one of your many background workers will pick it up. Redis helps with this because it provides a rich set of atomic operations for its data structures.</p>
<p>But since the introduction of version 9.5, PostgreSQL has a&nbsp;<code>SKIP LOCKED</code>&nbsp;option for the&nbsp;<code>SELECT ... FOR ...</code>statement (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE">here’s the documentation</a>). When this option is specified, PostgreSQL will just ignore any rows that would require waiting for a lock to be released.</p>
<p>Consider this example from the perspective of a background worker:</p>
<pre><code>
BEGIN;

WITH job AS (
  SELECT
    id
  FROM
    jobs
  WHERE
    status = 'pending'
  LIMIT 1
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
)
UPDATE
  jobs
SET
  status = 'running'
WHERE
  jobs.id = job.id
RETURNING
  jobs.*;
  
COMMIT;
</code></pre>

<p>By specifying&nbsp;<code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>, a row-level lock is implicitly acquired for any rows returned from the&nbsp;<code>SELECT</code>. Further, because you specified&nbsp;<code>SKIP LOCKED</code>, there’s no chance of this statement blocking on another transaction. If there’s another job ready to be processed, it will be returned. There’s no concern about multiple workers running this command receiving the same row because of the row-level lock.</p>
<p>The biggest caveat for this technique is that, if you have a large number of workers trying to pull off this queue and a large number of jobs feeding them, they may spend some time stepping through jobs and trying to acquire a lock. In practice, most of the apps I’ve worked on have fewer than a dozen background workers, and the cost is not likely to be significant.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-2-application-locks">Use Case 2: Application Locks</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that you have a synchronization routine with a third-party service, and you only want one instance of it running for any given user across all server processes. This is another common application I’ve seen for Redis: distributed locking.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL can achieve this as well using its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">advisory locks</a>. Advisory locks allow you to leverage the same locking engine PostgreSQL uses internally for your own application-defined purposes.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-3-pub-sub">Use Case 3: Pub/Sub</h2>
<p>I saved the coolest example for last: pushing events to your active clients. For example, say you need to notify a user that they have a new message available to read. Or perhaps you’d like to stream data to the client as it becomes available. Typically, web sockets are the transport layer for these events while Redis serves as the Pub/Sub engine.</p>
<p>However, since version 9, PostgreSQL also provides this functionality via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-listen.html"><code>LISTEN</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-notify.html"><code>NOTIFY</code></a>&nbsp;statements. Any PostgreSQL client can subscribe (<code>LISTEN</code>) to a particular message channel, which is just an arbitrary string. When any other client sends a message (<code>NOTIFY</code>) on that channel, all other subscribed clients will be notified. Optionally, a small message can be attached.</p>
<p>If you happen to be using Rails and ActionCable, using PostgreSQL is even supported out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="taking-full-advantage-of-postgresql">Taking Full Advantage of PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>Redis fundamentally fills a different niche than PostgreSQL and excels at things PostgreSQL doesn’t aspire to. Examples include caching data with TTLs and storing and manipulating ephemeral data.</p>
<p>However, PostgreSQL has a lot more capabilities than you may expect when you approach it from the perspective of just another SQL database or some mysterious entity that lives behind your ORM.</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that the things you’re using Redis for may actually be good tasks for PostgreSQL as well. It may be a worthy tradeoff to skip Redis and save on the operational costs and development complexity of relying on multiple data services.</p>

<p dir="auto">AI agents have been evaluated in isolation or within small groups, where interactions remain limited in scope and complexity. Large-scale simulations involving many autonomous agents—reflecting the full spectrum of civilizational processes—have yet to be explored. Here, we demonstrate how 10 – 1000+ AI agents behave and progress within agent societies. We first introduce the PIANO (Parallel Information Aggregation via Neu- ral Orchestration) architecture, which enables agents to interact with humans and other agents in real-time while maintaining coherence across multiple output streams. We then evaluate agent performance in large- scale simulations using civilizational benchmarks inspired by human history. These simulations, set within a Minecraft environment, reveal that agents are capable of meaningful progress—autonomously developing specialized roles, adhering to and changing collective rules, and engaging in cultural and religious transmis- sion. These preliminary results show that agents can achieve significant milestones towards AI civilizations, opening new avenues for large-scale societal simulations, agentic organizational intelligence, and integrating AI into human civilizations.</p>

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <div>
              <p>
                  pg_flo leverages PostgreSQL's logical replication system to
                  capture and stream data changes. It uses NATS as a message
                  broker to decouple reading from the WAL through the replicator

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Touchscreens Are Out, and Tactile Controls Are Back"><p>Tactile controls are back in vogue. Apple added two new buttons to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-introduces-iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>iPhone 16</u></a>, home appliances like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/handson-with-ultrahaptics-invisible-touchable-controls" target="_blank">stoves</a> and washing machines are returning to knobs, and several car manufacturers are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/buttons-are-back-at-porsche-as-we-see-the-2024-cayenne-interior/" target="_blank">reintroducing</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/hallelujah-hyundai-vows-to-resist-modern-trend-for-all-digital-cabins-and-keep-using" target="_blank">buttons</a> and dials to dashboards and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/vw-brings-back-steering-wheel-buttons-after-many-customers-complain" target="_blank">steering wheels</a>. </p><p>With this “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/touch-screens-are-over-even-apple-is-bringing-back-buttons-86fb9ea8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">re-buttonization</a>,” as <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>describes it, demand for <a href="https://mediaschool.indiana.edu/people/profile.html?p=raplotni" target="_blank">Rachel Plotnick</a>’s expertise has grown. Plotnick, an associate professor of Cinema and Media Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington, is the leading expert on buttons and how people interact with them. She studies the relationship between technology and society with a focus on everyday or overlooked technologies, and wrote the 2018 book <em>Power Button: A History of Pleasure, Panic, and the Politics of Pushing</em>. Now, companies are reaching out to her to help improve their tactile controls.</p><ul><li><a href="#research">Researching the history of buttons</a></li><li><a href="#renaissance">The renaissance of physical controls</a></li><li><a href="#companies">Working with companies on “re-buttoning”</a></li></ul><p id="research"><strong>You wrote <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262551953/power-button/" target="_blank">a book</a> a few years ago about the history of buttons. What inspired that book?</strong></p><p><strong>Rachel Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>Around 2009, I noticed there was a lot of discourse in the news about the death of the button. This was a couple years after the first iPhone had come out, and a lot of people were saying that, as touchscreens were becoming more popular, eventually we weren’t going to have any more physical buttons to push. This started to happen across a range of devices <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/microsoft-kinect-hand-gesture-control" target="_blank">like the Microsoft Kinect</a>, and after films like Minority Report had come out in the early 2000s, everyone thought we were moving to this kind of gesture or speech interface. I was fascinated by this idea that an entire interface could die, and that led me down this big wormhole, to try to understand how we came to be a society that pushed buttons everywhere we went. </p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="Portrait of Rachel Plotnick smiling outdoors." data-rm-shortcode-id="0046944df6813b298576239d6085ebba" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-rachel-plotnick-smiling-outdoors.jpg?id=54089372&amp;width=980" height="2374" id="b2bb6" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-rachel-plotnick-smiling-outdoors.jpg?id=54089372&amp;width=980" width="3166"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Rachel Plotnick studies the ways we use everyday technologies and how they shape our relationships with each other and the world.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Rachel Plotnick</small></p><p>The more that I looked around, the more that I saw not only were we pressing digital buttons on social media and to order things from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>, but also to start our coffee makers and go up and down in elevators and operate our televisions. The pervasiveness of the button as a technology pitted against this idea of buttons disappearing seemed like such an interesting dichotomy to me. And so I wanted to understand an origin story, if I could come up with it, of where buttons came from.</p><p><strong>What did you find in your research?</strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>One of the biggest observations I made was that a lot of fears and fantasies around pushing buttons were the same 100 years ago as they are today. I expected to see this society that wildly transformed and used buttons in such a different way, but I saw these persistent anxieties over time about control and who gets to push the button, and also these pleasures around button pushing that we can use for advertising and to make technology simpler. That pendulum swing between fantasy and fear, pleasure and panic, and how those themes persisted over more than a century was what really interested me. I liked seeing the connections between the past and the present.</p><p><a href="#menu">[Back to top]</a></p><p id="renaissance"><strong>We’ve experienced the rise of touchscreens, but now we might be seeing another shift—a renaissance in buttons and physical controls. What’s prompting the trend?</strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>There was this kind of touchscreen mania, where all of a sudden everything became a touchscreen. Your <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-dot-display-hyundai-mobis" target="_blank">car was a touchscreen</a>, your refrigerator was a touchscreen. Over time, people became somewhat fatigued with that. That’s not to say touchscreens aren’t a really useful interface, I think they are. But on the other hand, people seem to have a hunger for physical buttons, both because you don’t always have to look at them—you can feel your way around for them when you don’t want to directly pay attention to them—but also because they offer a greater range of tactility and feedback. </p><p>If you look at gamers playing video games, they want to push a lot of buttons on those controls. And if you look at DJs and digital musicians, they have endless amounts of buttons and joysticks and dials to make music. There seems to be this kind of richness of the tactile experience that’s afforded by pushing buttons. They’re not perfect for every situation, but I think increasingly, we’re realizing the merit that the interface offers.</p><p><strong>What else is motivating the re-buttoning of consumer devices?</strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>Maybe <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/zoom-fatigue" target="_blank">screen fatigue</a>. We spend all our days and nights on these devices, scrolling or constantly flipping through pages and videos, and there’s something tiring about that. The button may be a way to almost de-technologize our everyday existence, to a certain extent. That’s not to say buttons don’t work with screens very nicely—they’re often partners. But in a way, it’s taking away the priority of vision as a sense, and recognizing that a screen isn’t always the best way to interact with something. </p><p>When I’m driving, it’s actually unsafe for my car to be operated in that way. It’s hard to generalize and say, buttons are always easy and good, and touchscreens are difficult and bad, or vice versa. Buttons tend to offer you a really limited range of possibilities in terms of what you can do. Maybe that simplicity of limiting our field of choices offers more safety in certain situations.</p><p><strong>It also seems like there’s an accessibility issue when prioritizing vision in device interfaces, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>The blind community had to fight for years to make touchscreens more accessible. It’s always been funny to me that we call them touchscreens. We think about them as a touch modality, but a touchscreen prioritizes the visual. Over the last few years, we’re seeing Alexa and Siri and a lot of these other voice activated systems that are making things a little bit more auditory as a way to deal with that. But the touch screen is oriented around visuality.</p><p><strong>It sounds like, in general, having multiple interface options is the best way to move forward—not that touchscreens are going to become completely passé, just like the button never actually died. </strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>I think that’s accurate. We see paradigm shifts over time with technologies, but for the most part, we often recycle old ideas. It’s striking that if we look at the 1800s, people were sending messages via telegraph about what the future would look like if we all had this dashboard of buttons at our command where we could communicate with anyone and shop for anything. And that’s essentially what our smartphones became. We still have this dashboard menu approach. I think it means carefully considering what the right interface is for each situation. </p><p><a href="#menu">[Back to top]</a></p><p id="companies"><strong>Several companies have reached out to you to learn from your expertise. What do they want to know?</strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong> I think there is a hunger out there from companies designing buttons or consumer technologies to try to understand the history of how we used to do things, how we might bring that to bear on the present, and what the future looks like with these interfaces. I’ve had a number of interesting discussions with companies, including one that manufactures push button interfaces. I had a conversation with them about <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/medical-devices">medical devices</a> like CT machines and X-ray machines, trying to imagine the easiest way to push a button in that situation, to save people time and improve the patient encounter. </p><p>I’ve also talked to people about what will make someone use a defibrillator or not. Even though it’s really simple to go up to these automatic machines, if you see someone going into cardiac arrest in a mall or out on the street, a lot of people are terrified to actually push the button that would get this machine started. We had a really fascinating discussion about why someone wouldn’t push a button, and what would it take to get them to feel okay about doing that. </p><p>In all of these cases, these are design questions, but they’re also social and cultural questions. I like the idea that people who are in the humanities studying these things from a long term perspective can also speak to engineers trying to build these devices.</p><p><strong>So these companies also want to know about the history of buttons? </strong></p><p><strong>Plotnick:</strong><strong></strong>I’ve had some fascinating conversations around history. We all want to learn what mistakes not to make and what worked well in the past. There’s often this narrative of progress, that things are only getting better with technology over time. But if we look at these lessons, I think we can see that sometimes things were simpler or better in a past moment, and sometimes they were harder. Often with new technologies, we think we’re completely reinventing the wheel. But maybe these concepts existed a long time ago, and we haven’t paid attention to that. There’s a lot to be learned from the past. </p><p><a href="#menu">[Back to top]</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1703715719472_17380"><p>It’s late, and the campfire is burning low. My fellow content creator <a href="https://www.zackproser.com/">Zack Proser</a> and I are sitting on a log, chowing down on s’mores and enjoying a few spine-chilling tales of terror about my horrible career.</p>
<p>Well, not that horrible: I now make a living from at least two of my favourite activities, <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books">writing</a> and <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/courses">mentoring</a>. No luck so far getting people to pay me to tinker with their vintage Land Rovers, or to sit in a comfy chair eating chocolates and watching classic <em>Doctor Who</em>, but hope springs eternal.</p>
<p>Last time, we talked about how I made the leap from salaried server-monkey to starting my own company. Independence is great, but it turns out that when you quit your job, you also stop getting the regular paychecks (why does no one ever tell you these things?)</p>
<p>Money, like oxygen, is one of those things that you don’t really appreciate until you suddenly don’t have enough of it. Some of the biggest challenges for the newly independent developer or creator, indeed, revolve around money: how to get people to give it to you, how much to ask for, and how to be <em>worth</em> what you’re asking. Let’s get into that. Over to Zack.</p>
<p><strong>In our last chat, John, you froze my blood with a horror story about what happened when you unwisely took on a fixed-price contract. From what you said, it doesn’t sound as though a deal like that is good for either you or the client?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not. A fixed-price deal sets up the wrong incentive structure. It’s in the client’s interest to agree the lowest price possible, and then to squeeze the consultant for every drop of juice they can get. So that sucks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s in the consultant’s interest to do the quickest and cheapest work necessary to get the client to sign off on the job. After that, they have zero incentive to fix any problems that arise. It’s just bad news all round.</p>
<p><strong>So what would you recommend instead?</strong></p>
<p>When someone asks for a fixed price, I’ll explain to them why that’s not in either of our interests, and suggest that instead they pay me a fair hourly rate for what I do. And, so they know what they’re in for, I’ll give them a careful and realistic estimate of how many hours it’ll take to deliver what they’ve asked for. That gives them the cost control they need, but doesn’t <em>commit</em> them to the whole sum right away.</p>
<p>Once we’ve agreed the terms, I can get started, and I have a strong incentive to deliver value for them right away. If they like the work I’m doing, and they want more, I’ll happily provide it: it pays me to do so! On the other hand, if after the first day or two they think “This guy’s no good,” they can just pay me off and wave goodbye: they’re not locked in for the long term to a vendor choice they’re already regretting.</p>
<p>At the end of the job, if they want further changes or enhancements, they can have them, but not for free. I’ll estimate them, and then they can decide whether or not it’s worth the extra cost. That prevents a nasty case of “just one more thing” syndrome.</p>
<p>One reason some companies don’t like to pay for consulting work by the hour is that they think it’ll incentivise the consultant to goof off. You know, take it slowly, invent problems and delays, anything to rack up a few extra hours. Sure, unscrupulous consultants will do that, but then it’s on the client to pick that up and get rid of them. It’s not a successful long-term strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve heard it wisely said that there are two kinds of consultants: poachers and farmers. The poacher wants to make a quick kill and get clean away. The farmer, on the other hand, is in the game for the long haul. She shears the sheep closely, but gently, and nurtures it. She feeds it, cares for it, keeps it warm in the winter, and tends it when it’s sick. That way, it’ll be around for her to shear again next year.</p>
<p><strong>Flattering analogy.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, but I’ve worked on farms: you’ll never find a deeper love than a farmer has for her sheep. They’re literally her livelihood: if they do well, she does well. Sure, she might see a quick profit if she slaughtered them all this year, but then there’s no <em>next</em> year. Instead, she looks after the sheep, and they’ll look after her.</p>
<p>Similarly, as a consultant you <em>could</em> strike fast, extract as much money from the client for as little work as possible, and then ride like hell for the hills. There’ll always be more unsuspecting clients for you to predate upon, won’t there?</p>
<p>It seems tempting, but actually, it doesn’t work. Hunting for new clients all the time is difficult and expensive, and often it doesn’t work out: you put time and effort into meetings, proposals, and estimates, and half the time it just doesn’t go anywhere. Much better not to lose the old client in the first place.</p>
<p>Also, sooner or later, the word about you will get around. One way or the other. So you should be the consultant that <em>you’d</em> want to hire.</p>
<p>Repeat business is the best business, because marketing is hard. After a while, you won’t <em>need</em> to market your services. People will start coming to <em>you</em>. At that point you know you’re doing something right.</p>
<p><strong>I see the value of charging by the hour, but one thing I struggle with personally is knowing <em>what</em> to charge. Do you have any advice?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s difficult. The best advice <em>I</em> ever got on this was “Think of a number, then double it.” If you don’t feel a little embarrassed when you tell them the rate, that probably means you’re coming in too low. If you always get a yes, then you’re <em>definitely</em> coming in too low.</p>
<p>The tendency is always to under-price yourself. Partly because you’re modest and self-effacing (that’s one of the reasons we all love you), but also because you want the business. That’s another big mistake I made starting out. I thought “Well, I don’t really <em>know</em> very much. I’ll charge a low rate to reflect that.”</p>
<p>Here’s a weird fact: businesses actually <em>like</em> paying a lot for consultants. It’s called the <a href="https://vinepair.com/articles/chivas-regal-effect/">Chivas Regal effect</a>. You know, if people see a cheap bottle of whisky, they’ll assume (rightly) that it’s horrible. But if it costs sixty bucks a bottle, they’ll assume it must be a quality product. Otherwise, how on earth could the manufacturer justify charging that much for it?</p>
<p><strong>And the whisky actually tastes better <em>because</em> it costs a lot.</strong></p>
<p>It sure does. Cheers!</p>
<p>Imagine a manager has some problem they can’t fix. What’s their response? Hire a consultant. A cheap consultant? Absolutely not. Only bad managers have cheaply-solved problems.</p>
<p>The more they spend, the greater the kudos they’ll get from upstairs, and the bigger their budget will be next year. After all, the division with the most expensive problems must be the most important one in the company.</p>
<p>And everyone can relax and feel good knowing that the problem’s being taken care of by the highest-priced consultancy firm available.</p>
<p><strong>Wait, what?</strong></p>
<p>I’m serious. When you’re on trial for murder, do you want to hire the cheapest lawyer in the phone book? I don’t think so. You go to the <em>super</em> expensive lawyer, the one that defends Tom Cruise against whatever the latest weird and concerning allegations might be.</p>
<p>Okay, someone else, not Tom Cruise: I don’t want to hear from his lawyers. But that’s my point.</p>
<p><strong>So it’s about being reassuringly expensive.</strong></p>
<p>It really is. You have to <em>actually</em> be good at what you’re doing too, of course, or the whole scheme falls apart. What the client’s money really buys, though, is that delightful feeling of making the thing <em>somebody else’s problem</em>. You know, we’ve turned it all over to a top-tier expert, and now we just don’t have to think about it anymore. The more that person charges, the more reassured the client feels.</p>
<p>It’s better for you, too, because when they’re paying you a lot of money, they put a lot of value on your advice. By contrast, the less they’re paying, the less they’re inclined to listen to you. You need them to listen to you, and that’s why you need to charge top dollar.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/3T37iVY">“Secrets of Consulting”</a>, which is the first book everybody should read on this subject, the incredibly wise Jerry Weinberg says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Make sure they pay you enough so they’ll do what you say.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>That’s genius, but… how do you work out how much that should be?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a good way to get to the right number: every time a client accepts your price, make it a little bit higher the next time around. When people start complaining, or turning you down, you know you’re getting into the ballpark. When your acceptance rate falls to about fifty percent, then you’re probably there.</p>
<p>And don’t forget, the more clients you work with, the more <em>you</em> learn. The more you’ve learned, the better a consultant you are, and the more you can charge. So your price should steadily increase over time (but make sure it’s always in line with your value).</p>
<p><strong>What if they want to negotiate?</strong></p>
<p>You can negotiate on everything else, but don’t negotiate on price. Would you go to the cheapest dentist? Would you haggle with your brain surgeon from the operating table? I hope not. Some things just aren’t worth cheaping out on. Clients will still try, but you should politely decline.</p>
<p>Clients who want a discount always turn out to be the worst clients, if you cave in to them. By offering you less, they’re really saying “We don’t think you’re worth what you’re asking.” You don’t want to work for someone who sees you that way.</p>
<p>Plus, people who ask for discounts are habitual cheapskates. They think they’re smarter than everybody else: only suckers pay sticker price. They think you’re trying to take <em>them</em> for a sucker.</p>
<p>If you accept their lowball offer, now they know they’ve got you on the hook. They’ll try to screw you in every other way, too: asking for extra things here and there, demanding shorter deadlines, out-of-hours support, every little deal-sweetener they can think of.</p>
<p>Unless you really can’t survive without that client, don’t take them on. Jerry Weinberg also says “If you need the money, don’t take the job.”</p>
<p><strong>That’s great advice. I’m putting “Secrets of Consulting” on my reading list! What else?</strong></p>
<p>One common problem is that the client doesn’t know anything about the subject area: if they did, they wouldn’t need you. So they also don’t know what constitutes a fair price for the work. When they hear your rate, it may sound too high, and you won’t get the deal.</p>
<p>But that’s okay. You just dodged a bullet, because you don’t actually want a client who doesn’t understand the value of what you do. That’ll never be a profitable engagement, in any sense of the word.</p>
<p>Once someone got in touch with me and, when I quoted my rate, they said “Gosh, that’s so much more than we were expecting. We’d like to hire you, but there’s a guy in Eastern Europe who says he’ll do it for like 20% of that.” I said fine. Absolutely, go with the cheap guy. If he can do the same quality work as me for a fifth of what I charge, I told them, then it’s positively their fiduciary <em>duty</em> to hire him, which they did.</p>
<p>A few months later they came back to me and said, “Now we understand why he was so cheap. Are <em>you</em> still available, by any chance?” And of course I was… at the rate I originally quoted.</p>
<p><strong>Business Jack does not play gentle.</strong></p>
<p>That ended up being a long and very rewarding engagement, and they were super happy with my work. Partly because it <em>was</em> good, if I say so myself, but also because they’d seen something of the cheaper alternative. They’d learned the value of what I do, and I learned that it’s okay not to let yourself be beat down on price.</p>
<p>Things can still go squirrely even after you’ve landed the gig, too. You know, you give the client the benefit of your expertise, and they say something like “Thanks very much, but that won’t work for us. We’re going to do XYZ instead, because money / politics / reasons.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to get upset in that situation, and start arguing with them or berating them. What kind of idiots pay for an expensive consultant and then ignore what they say? The commonest kind, it turns out.</p>
<p>The fact is that they may just not be ready to <em>hear</em> what you’re saying. Sometimes they need a little time to think about it, and sometimes they need to learn what happens if they do it the other way. In fact, I’ve gone so far as to formulate what I call Bitfield’s First Law of Consulting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sometimes the client needs to feel the pain of not taking your advice, before they’re ready to take your advice.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s amazing how effective that can be. When they <em>do</em> come back to you, it’s often with a greatly increased respect for what you say next. “He said we’d crash and burn if we did X, and he was right! This guy really knows what he’s talking about. Let’s listen to him in a rapt, respectful silence.”</p>
<p><strong>I’m doing just that. Shall we take another natural break, and return for a final bite of your wisdom s’more later on?</strong></p>
<p>Sure thing. We’ll talk about how my consulting career ended up taking me somewhere quite unexpected, but that turned out to be exactly where I needed to be. See you next time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since the outset of Matrix, our aim has always been to provide a protocol that lets you build open, decentralised,
secure communication apps which outperform the mainstream centralised alternatives.  It’s been a twisty journey - first
focusing on making Matrix work at all (back in 2014), and then getting it out of beta with Matrix 1.0 in 2019, and now
focusing on making Matrix fast, usable and mainstream-ready with Matrix 2.0.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pendulum of decentralisation continues to accelerate in our direction. Our friends at Bluesky have shown
that it’s possible to build decentralised social apps which are mainstream friendly enough for
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/31/bluesky-tops-app-charts-and-sees-all-time-highs-after-brazil-bans-x/">Presidents</a> to
recommend them; Elon continues to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/x-elon-musk-bans-blocking">destroy Twitter</a> and showcase
the importance of decentralisation to everyone, and even Meta is dabbling in decentralised social media (and
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2024/09/whatsapp-dma/">decentralised communication</a>!)</p>
<p>So, where does Matrix sit in all this? Well, in order to make the transition to mainstream, we’ve been beavering away to
implement four main pillars in Matrix 2.0:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instant login, instant launch, and instant sync (aka Simplified Sliding Sync, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4186">MSC4186</a>)</li>
<li>Next Generation Auth (aka Native OIDC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">MSC3861</a>)</li>
<li>Native Matrix Encrypted Multiparty VoIP/Video (aka MatrixRTC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4143">MSC4143</a>)</li>
<li>Invisible Encryption (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153">MSC4153</a> &amp; friends).</li>
</ol>
<p>Between these, we believe that Matrix can now be used to build apps which genuinely outperform the mainstream
alternatives - and what’s more, <strong>these MSCs now all have implementations you can use today.</strong>  The MSCs themselves are
not all finalised and ready for merge (but are getting close), and when they pass FCP (Final Comment Period) to merge
into the spec, we will formally bump the spec release to version 2.0.</p>
<p>We actually declared Matrix 2.0 as ready for action back at The Matrix Conference last month, and now that the
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2024/10/29/matrixconf/">videos have been published</a> you can watch the launch right here:</p>

<youtube-player video-id="ZiRYdqkzjDU"></youtube-player>

<p>Since the conference talk things have already moved on a bit, though, and we’ve landed a bunch of tweaks to address
teething issues - and so here’s the current state of action:</p>
<h3 id="1-simplified-sliding-sync">1. Simplified Sliding Sync</h3>
<p>Simplified Sliding Sync is the final version of Sliding Sync - the API which provides instant login, launch &amp; sync in
Matrix 2.0.  To say that the API has been through a lot of iterations is an understatement, but we’re finally there
with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4186">MSC4186</a>, which simplifies the original Sliding
Sync API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a>) by removing the concept of a
server-determined room list ordering entirely, and instead lets the client sort the roomlist as needed (while letting
the client paginate in the roomlist incrementally, to ensure instant responsivity, no matter how large your room list
is).</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Sliding Sync is now implemented natively in Synapse as of 1.114</strong>, and so there is no longer any need to
run a Sliding Sync Proxy in order to use the API.  In fact, the Sliding Sync Proxy is being deprecated and the old
Sliding Sync code will be removed from matrix-rust-sdk in the nearish future. Unfortunately we don’t have bandwidth
to maintain both the native implementation Synapse as well as the proxy shim - and the proxy inevitably has suffered
from a lot of limitations (e.g. having to do a full v2 initial sync for new logins, slowing them down to v2
performance - as well as duplicating storage between Synapse and the proxy).  There’ll be a dedicated deprecation
blog post for the proxy and pre-simplified Sliding Sync shortly.  Meanwhile, work is well underway for native Sliding
Sync support in <a href="https://conduit.rs/">conduit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit">conduwuit</a> and
<a href="https://gitlab.computer.surgery/matrix/grapevine">grapevine</a> - conduwuit guesses “next few weeks” for native Simplified
Sync Support to land. Dendrite is unfortunately still not funded, so will happen on a best effort basis.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, native Simplified Sliding Sync in Synapse is spectacular - outperforming the proxy throughout,
and making the old sync v2 API look positively prehistoric.  Gone are the days of waiting for your app to sync, even if
you’ve been offline for weeks/months; gone are the days of waiting minutes to login, and gone are the days of staring
at a spinner as your app launches.  It really is a new era - and having been hyping it since the first demo at FOSDEM
2023, I promise we won’t bang on about sliding sync any more after this; it’s finally here and landed and we can move
on and enjoy it!  For more details, see Ivan’s talk from The Matrix Conference:</p>

<h3 id="2-next-generation-auth">2. Next Generation Auth</h3>
<p>Next Generation Auth is what we’re calling the migration to using industry standard OpenID Connect as the authentication
API in Matrix 2.0, moving on from the custom auth API that Matrix has historically used.  We’re calling this Next Gen
Auth because we were seeing a lot of folks incorrectly assuming that adopting OpenID Connect for auth meant we would
somehow be encouraging 3rd party social login or single-sign-on - which is <strong>not</strong> the case.</p>
<p>Next Gen Auth is simply swapping out Matrix’s old custom auth APIs with equivalents which are defined by the OpenID
Foundation; after all, Matrix is a communication protocol, not an authentication protocol. In return, we get much more
mature and secure authentication APIs - and access to the whole OpenID Identity Provider ecosystem, including support
for Two Factor Auth and Multi-Factor Auth, hardware authentication tokens, passkeys, and device-based login flows
(aka QR Login).  We also stop both Matrix clients and servers having to implement the sprawling legacy Matrix
authentication API surface - ensuring that users only ever hand their account password to their auth server, rather
than having to trust their clients to handle it securely, which in turn plays much nicer with password managers
(who only have to remember how to auth with your auth server, rather than a myriad different clients).  It also lets
you share authentication between apps if you want; gives us access_token refresh (at last!) to avoid long-lived
access_tokens hanging around; and in future will also support OIDC scopes so you can limit the access particular
clients get to your account.</p>
<p>In short, Next Gen Auth is transformative, and the initial implementation at
<a href="https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service">matrix-authentication-service</a> (MAS) is ready for admins
to deploy and use (and in future will be available embedded in Synapse too).  Unfortunately it is <strong>not yet live on
matrix.org</strong> (given we have to migrate tens of millions of accounts, complete with all the social login complexities)
but we’re hoping to get it there in the coming months.</p>
<p>Probably one of the clearest immediate benefits of Next Gen Auth is the ability to do a full login <strong>including setting
up all your end-to-end-encryption</strong> simply by scanning a QR code on an existing client, courtesy of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4108">MSC4108</a> and OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grants.  In
other words, you don’t have to specify a server, or your username, or account password, or your recovery key - you just
scan a QR code and you’re in.  The very latest Element X releases on iOS &amp; Android have this implemented and enabled by
default, and so if you’re on a server which has deployed MAS, you can go to “link new device” in Element Web/Desktop to
show a QR code to instantly log in.</p>
<p>For more info on all things Next Gen Auth, see Quentin’s talk from The Matrix Conference:</p>

<youtube-player video-id="wOW8keNafdE"></youtube-player>
<h3 id="3-native-matrix-group-voip-video-matrixrtc">3. Native Matrix Group VoIP/Video: MatrixRTC</h3>
<p>Next we have MatrixRTC: end-to-end-encrypted group voice and video conferencing over Matrix. Historically, group VoIP in
Matrix has relied on third party conferencing systems (Jitsi, and before that FreeSWITCH) - providing no support for
Matrix’s end-to-end encryption, or indeed Matrix’s user identities, decentralisation or decentralised access control.</p>
<p>With MatrixRTC this changes: <strong>we now have a standard way to establish large-scale end-to-end-encrypted group video
calls via Matrix</strong>, leveraging all the benefits of Matrix’s end-to-end-encryption infrastructure, user identity, room
permissions, etc.  It also supports different media stacks to actually handle the media conferencing - today, the main
implementation uses the <a href="https://docs.livekit.io/reference/internals/livekit-sfu/">LiveKit SFU</a>, but there’s also an
experimental full-mesh WebRTC implementation.</p>
<p>Element Call has been the driving app behind MatrixRTC, and as of today is now enabled in the release versions of both
Element Web/Desktop and Element X to provide native MatrixRTC calling embedded in the apps: if you hit the video call
button you will now have the option to spin up a MatrixRTC call via Element Call rather than via Jitsi or Legacy 1:1
calling, and if the room is end-to-end-encrypted, all the conference will be too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile - MatrixRTC isn’t just Element Call: Famedly showed off experimental interop with FluffyChat at
<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2876-matrixrtc-the-future-of-matrix-calls/">FOSDEM</a> back in
Feb, and Element showed off experimental interop with <a href="https://youtu.be/EPJM_lSmDpg?t=426">BigBlueButton</a> in August.
Given more and more conferencing tools are converging on LiveKit as a best-in-class SFU, it’s an amazing opportunity to
use Matrix and MatrixRTC to power the end-to-end-encryption and decentralisation and get standardised voip/video interop
from the outset.</p>
<p>For more info, see Timo’s talk from The Matrix Conference:</p>

<youtube-player video-id="OXPuYbfiXDQ"></youtube-player>

<p>That said, there are a few caveats right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not have interoperability between legacy Matrix 1:1 voice/video calling and MatrixRTC (and it’s not clear
if/when we will get to it) - but Matrix 2.0 clients like Element X exclusively use MatrixRTC for VoIP/video,
including for 1:1 calls.  This is in order to only maintain one VoIP stack, and so that you get multidevice and
multiuser support for free, even in 1:1s.  As a result, we’re in the process of figuring out how to warn legacy
callers that MatrixRTC-only clients won’t be able to answer their calls (e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4220">MSC4220</a>) - this hasn’t shipped yet.</li>
<li>iOS 18 broke CallKit + WebRTC, so Element X iOS has had to disable fancy OS-natively-integrated MatrixRTC calling;
and has a support issue open with Apple to try to solve this.</li>
<li>We’ve had some fun teething issues thanks to the volume of signalling in MatrixRTC exposing some sync bugs - these
are almost solved, but probably mean MatrixRTC should still be considered beta for a few more days until the fixes
land.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-invisible-encryption">4. Invisible Encryption</h3>
<p>The final pillar of Matrix 2.0 is Invisible Encryption - <strong>making Matrix’s end-to-end encryption as seamless and
invisible as the centralised alternatives</strong> (Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage and friends).  This does <em>not</em> mean reducing
security in any way - just the opposite, in fact. It means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring that Unable To Decrypt (UTD) bugs never happen.  Huge amounts of work has gone into this over the course of
the year, especially via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement-crypto">complement-crypto</a> as a comprehensive
end-to-end-test suite for both matrix-rust-sdk and matrix-js-sdk based Matrix clients.  We are finally at the point
where UTDs are so rare that most people simply never see them, and any reports get jumped on (and complement-crypto
tests get written) whenever they emerge.  Anecdotally, I now get way more “waiting for message…” errors on WhatsApp
than I do on Matrix, these days!  For more details on the Hunt For UTDs, see Kegan’s talk from The Matrix Conference:</li>
</ol>

<youtube-player video-id="FHzh2Y7BABQ"></youtube-player>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>We are excluding non-cross-signed devices from Matrix (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153">MSC4153</a>).
The fact that Matrix ever supported the idea of users enabling encryption on a device without proving that they are
the valid owner by signing it (by verifying it with another device, or providing their recovery key/passphrase) is a
nasty hangover from back before we introduced cross-signing.  Nowadays, the fact that non-cross-signed devices exist
acts to reduce security and complicate UX and implementations with big scary red warnings whenever an unverified
device joins a conversation.  Instead, once MSC4153 lands, we’re going to simply exclude unverified devices
entirely - not encrypt to them, and not decrypt from them.  We can then get rid of all the confusing warnings
associated with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re also solving the confusing “grey shield” warnings: “the authenticity of this message cannot be confirmed on this
device” and similar.  These are avoidable warnings caused by message keys which can no longer be tracked back to the
original sender - e.g. if they’re restored from backup, or if the original sending device has been deleted.  We’re
fixing these with authenticated backup (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4048">MSC4048</a>) and
including device keys on Olm events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4147">MSC4147</a>)
respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we’re moving to Trust On First Use (TOFU). This means that even if you didn’t explicitly verify another user,
you still get warned if their identity changes (unlike previously, when it was ignored).  An initial implementation
just <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4068">landed in matrix-rust-sdk</a> a few weeks ago, and so
appropriate warnings at the application level should <a href="https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/3457">arrive shortly</a> -
matching the equivalent Signal or WhatsApp “this user’s identity has changed” warnings, albeit not yet synced between
devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can probably tell, Invisible Encryption is something of a moving target; for instance, the scope could extend to
cover all scenarios where users might expect messages to be decryptable (e.g. Dehydrated Devices: the ability to
decrypt messages sent to you when you are not logged in anywhere - or Sharing Keys when new users join a room/space).
However, the 4 points above are the main ones, and they are in the process of landing right now.</p>
<p>The end result is already an immeasurable improvement in the reliability and robustness of Matrix’s encryption - and
once the remaining pieces land, the user experience of a Matrix client should be that the encryption is almost entirely
invisible to the user - unless something bad is happening; much like TLS.</p>
<p>Valere &amp; Patrick’s talk on Invisible Crypto from The Matrix Conference would get embedded here, but unfortunately the
audio was mangled - we’ll rerecord it and publish it shortly. In the meantime, you can find their slides 
<a href="https://2024.matrix.org/documents/talk_slides/LAB%20Green%202024-09-20%20Valere%20Fedronic%20Patrick%20Maier%20Invisible%20Crypto.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>Well, first of all we’re going to stop announcing Matrix 2.0 - it’s finally here (modulo the spec release)!</p>
<p>There’s obviously a bit of follow-up still to be done though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting MAS live on matrix.org</li>
<li>Gracefully handling the lack of interop between legacy Matrix calls and MatrixRTC</li>
<li>Landing the various remaining components of Invisible Crypto</li>
<li>Broadening the implementation base for these APIs, and rolling it out across the ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond Matrix 2.0, though, there’s a large pile of other areas which need attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving state resolution.  We’re currently investigating a set of issues where the merge resolution algorithm has
misbehaved, and are planning a new room version to address it - watch this space for updates.</li>
<li>Trust and Safety.  Abuse is increasing concern, and moderation and trust &amp; safety tooling work has ended up fragmented
and balkanised.  The Governing Board is putting together a cross-ecosystem working group to try to address this -
again, watch this space for updates.</li>
<li>All the business-as-usual MSCs which have stacked up - Custom Emoji, Extensible Profiles, Custom Presence, etc.</li>
<li>It’d also be good to finally realise the full performance advantages of faster room joins…</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, in the longer term - what might Matrix 3.0 bring?  Honestly, at this point, it’s an open question.  Could it
be landing major Trust &amp; Safety changes in order to radically empower users to avoid and mitigate abuse?  Could it be
switching to MLS (or Decentralised MLS) for encryption?  Could it be the glorious return of P2P Matrix (if it was
funded)?  Could it even be figuring out if/how to converge with (or layer on top of) MIMI or other federation
protocols?  Answers on a postcard to <a href="http://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> please!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p><strong>If ever there was a time to exhort your friends to give Matrix another go - this is it.</strong></p>
<p>Matrix 2.0 has been a long time coming, and we need to get the word out that the step change forwards has finally
arrived, and that apps built on Matrix 2.0 can seriously outperform the mainstream alternatives.  Ideally, this could
be Matrix’s “Firefox moment” - when from the ashes of old open source code, a new generation appears which can punch
its weight against the proprietary incumbents.</p>
<p>Right now the only Matrix 2.0 client is Element X (and Element Web/Desktop if you enable the experimental Simplified
Sliding Sync implementation in labs on develop/nightly builds) - see <a href="https://element.io/blog">element.io/blog</a> for full
details - but we expect to see at least matrix-rust-sdk and matrix-js-sdk based clients using the new APIs as a matter
of course in the coming months, and then hopefully everyone else too.</p>
<p>So: if you run a Matrix server, please consider
<a href="https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/">deploying MAS</a> to enable next-gen auth
(<a href="https://sspaeth.de/2024/08/tldr-matrix-nextcloud-setup/">Sebastien Spaeth’s blog</a> also has a good indie tutorial) -
and add <a href="https://github.com/element-hq/element-call">Element Call</a> to give MatrixRTC a try. Over the coming months we
should see more support in more Matrix distributions, until hopefully we will all be living in a Matrix 2.0 world!</p>
<p>Huge thanks are due to everyone who has helped design, build, and iterate on Matrix 2.0, and to everyone who has kept
the faith as we’ve put it all together. A special thanks also to BWI who helped fund much of Element’s work on this for
the benefit of Matrix as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want Matrix to prevail - <em>please</em> join the Foundation and support the project financially.  We urgently
need organisational members, especially after the costs of running The Matrix Conference, and particularly if your
organisation is commercially dependent on Matrix, you simply <em>must</em> become a member.  While it’s very flattering that
Matrix gets treated as a commons these days, without financial support the underlying Matrix project will die and your
project will fail.  Whereas if everyone building on Matrix supported us, we would be moving way faster and with fewer
constraints - so please get involved at <a href="https://matrix.org/support">matrix.org/support</a> and help.</p>
<p>Thanks for flying Matrix!</p>
