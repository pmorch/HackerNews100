<p>Apple <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/">bent the knee</a> for months, leaving many commentators to ask why. But the reasons are not mysterious: Apple <em>wants</em> things that only the government can provide, things that will defend and extend its power to extract rents, rather than innovate. Namely, selective exemption from tariffs and an end to the spectre of pro-competition regulation that might bring real browser choice in the US, the EU, and around the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/apples-antitrust-playbook/">Over the past few weeks,</a> Tim Apple got a lot what he paid for,<sup><a href="#fn-bonus-treats-1" id="fnref-bonus-treats-1">1</a></sup> with the full weight of the US foreign and industrial policy apparatus <a href="https://on.ft.com/4h8bcXt">threatening the EU over <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> enforcement.</a> This has been part of a full-court press from Cupertino. Apple <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250925-apple-asks-eu-to-scrap-landmark-digital-competition-law">simultaneously threatened the EU</a> while rolling out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damiengeradin_can-small-tech-survive-the-digital-markets-activity-7376973488991137792-M_kG">fresh astroturf for pliant regulators to recline on.</a> This is loud, coordinated, and calculated. But calculated to achieve <em>what</em>? Why is the <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> such a threat to Apple?</p>
<p>Interoperability.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> holds the power to unlock true, safe, interoperability via the web. It's core terms <em>require</em> that Apple facilitate real browser engine choice, and <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-at-the-eu-parliament-dma-working-group/#browser-engines-and-the-dma">Apple is all but refusing,</a> playing games to prevent powerful and safe iOS browsers and the powerful web applications they facilitate. Web applications <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/the-web-is-the-app-store/">that can challenge the App Store.</a></p>
<p>Unlike tariffs, which present a threat to short-term profits through higher costs and suppression of upgrades in the near term, interoperability is a larger and more insidious boogeyman for Apple. It could change <em>everything</em>.</p>
<h2 id="who's-afraid-of-the-big-bad-web%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#who's-afraid-of-the-big-bad-web%3F">Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Web?</a></h2>
<p>Apple's profits are less and less attributable to innovation as <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/14629/apple-services-revenue/?srsltid=AfmBOooHzmlC-KPd9ujiOzEs1lHlaFUDUIsOEC8ODn32ops-5dUK73s_">“services” revenue swells Cupertino's coffers out of all proportion to iPhone sales volume.</a> “Services” is code for rent extraction from captive users and developers. If they could acquire and make safe apps outside the App Store, Apple wouldn't be able to take 30% from an outlandishly large fraction of the digital ecosystem's wealthiest players.</p>
<p>Apple understands browser choice is a threat to its <em>rentier</em> model. The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> holds the potential for developers to finally access the safe, open, and interoperable web technologies that power most desktop computing today. This is a <em>particular</em> threat to Apple, because its class-leading hardware is perfectly suited to running web applications. This helps to explain why Apple simultaneously demands control over all browser technology on iOS while <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">delaying</a>, <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/history-of-safari-show-stoppers/">constantly breaking</a> foundational <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/web-push-ios-one-year/">web APIs</a>, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/cupertinos-comforting-myths/">gaslighting developers about Apple's unwillingness to solve pressing problems.</a></p>
<p>Keeping capable, stable, high-quality browsers away from iOS is necessary to maintain the App Store's monopoly on the features every app needs. Keeping other software distribution mechanisms from offering those features at a lower price is a hard requirement for Cupertino's extractive business model. The web (in particular, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/"><abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr></a>) present a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Unlike alternative app stores that let developers decouple distributing proprietary apps from Apple's App Store, <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> free developers from building for each OS at all, allowing them to deliver apps though a zero-cost cost platform that builds on standardised APIs. For small developers, this is transformative, and it's why late-stage Apple cannot abide laws that create commercial fairness and enable safe, secure, pro-user alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="dots-unconnected" tabindex="-1"><a href="#dots-unconnected">Dots Unconnected</a></h2>
<p>This is what Apple is mortgaging its brand (or, if you prefer, soul) to prevent: a world where users have a real choice in browsers.</p>
<p>Horrors.</p>
<p>Apple is loaning its monopoly on iOS software to <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">yet another</a> authoritarian regime without a fight, painting a stark contrast: when profits are on the line, Cupertino will gaslight democratic regulators and defy pro-user laws with all the $1600/hr lawyers Harvard can graduate. And when it needs a transactional authoritarian's help to make that happen, temporarily<sup><a href="#fn-it-hopes-2" id="fnref-it-hopes-2">2</a></sup> loaning out Apple's godlike power over iOS devices to censor clearly protected speech isn't too much to ask. Struggle for thee, but not for me.</p>
<p>The kicker is that the only alternative for affected users and developers is Apple's web apps implementation; the same platform Cupertino serially knee-caps to deflect competition with its high-tax offerings.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say the tech press is letting democracy down by failing to connect the dots. Why is Apple capitulating? Because Apple <em>wants things</em> from the government. What are those things? We should be deep into that debate, but our <em>reportage</em> and editorial classes cannot seem to grasp that A precedes B. The obvious answers are also the right ones: selective protection from tariffs, defanged prosecution by the DOJ, and an umbrella from the EU's democratic, pro-competition regulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism">The Verge tiptoed <em>ever so close</em> to getting it,</a> quoting <a href="https://wileyhodges.substack.com/p/my-email-to-tim-cook?r=qlwt">letters that former Apple executives sent the company:</a><sup><a href="#fn-servile-frames-3" id="fnref-servile-frames-3">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to believe that Apple were unequivocally ‘the good guys,’” Hodges writes. “I passionately advocated for people to understand Apple as being on the side of its users above all else. I now feel like I must question that.”</p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism" taget="_blank">— Wiley Hodges,<br>"The Verge"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>This is a clue; a lead that a more thoughtful press and tech commentariat could use to evaluate the frames the parties deploy to their own benefit.</p>
<h2 id="%22who-should-rule%3F%22" tabindex="-1"><a href="#%22who-should-rule%3F%22"><em>"Who should rule?"</em></a></h2>
<p>The tech press is failing to grasp the moral stakes of API access. Again and again they flunk at connecting boring questions of who can write and distribute programs that use particular capabilities of phones to urgent issues of power over publication and control of devices. By declining to join these threads, they allow the unearned and increasingly indefensible power of mobile OS vendors to proliferate. The urgent question is how that power can be attenuated, or as Poppper put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must ask whether…we should not prepare for the worst leaders, and hope for the best. But this leads to a new approach to the problem of politics, for it forces us to replace the question: <strong>"Who should rule?"</strong> by the new question: <strong>"How can we so organize political institutions that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage?"</strong></p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.59272/page/n135/mode/1up" taget="_blank">— Karl Popper,<br>"The Open Society and Its Enemies"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>But the tech press does not ask these questions.</p>
<p>Instead of questioning why Apple's OS is so fundamentally insecure that an App Store is necessary, they accept the ever-false idea that iOS has been relatively secure <em>because</em> of the App Store.</p>
<p>Instead of confronting Apple with the reality that it used the App Store to hand out privacy-invading APIs in undisciplined ways to unscrupulous actors, it congratulates Cupertino on the next episode of our <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/08/apple-vs-fb-kayfabe/">nightly kayfabe.</a> The links between Apple's monopoly on sensitive APIs and the growth of monopolies in adjacent sectors are rarely, if ever, questioned. Far too often, the tech press accepts the narrative structure of Apple's marketing, satisfying pangs of journalistic conscience with largely ineffectual discussions about specific features that will not upset the power balance.</p>
<p>Nowhere, e.g., in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism">The Verge's coverage of these letters</a> is there a discussion about alternatives to the App Store. Only a few outlets ever press Apple on its suppression of web apps, including failure to add <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> install banners and essential capabilities. It's not an <em>Apple vs. Google</em> horse-race story, and so discussion of power distribution doesn't get coverage.</p>
<p>Settling for occasionally embarrassing Apple into partially reversing its most visibly egregious actions is ethically and morally stunted. Accepting the frame of <em>"who should rule?"</em> that Cupertino reflexively deploys is toxic to any hope of worthwhile technology because it creates and celebrates the idea of kings, leaving us supine relative to the mega-corps in our phones.</p>
<p>This is, in a word, childish.</p>
<p>Adults understand that things are complicated, that even the best intentioned folks get things wrong, or can go astray in larger ways. We build institutions and technologies to protect ourselves and those we love from the worst impacts of those events, and those institutions <em>always</em> model struggles over power and authority. And if we are lucky enough to build well, we build balanced systems that attenuate any attempts at over authoritarianism.</p>
<p>In other words, the exact opposite of Apple's infantilising and authoritarian world view.</p>
<p>Instead of debating which wealthy vassals might be more virtuous than the current rulers, we should instead focus on attenuating the power of these monarchical, centralising actors. The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> is doing this, creating the conditions for interoperability, and through interoperability, competition. Apple know it, and <em>that's</em> why they're willing to pawn their own dignity, along with the rights of fellow Americans, to snuff out the threat.</p>
<p>These are not minor points. Apple has <em>power</em>, and that power comes from its effective monopoly on the APIs that make applications possible on the most important computing platform of our adult lives.</p>
<p>Protecting this power has become an end unto itself, curdling the pro-social narratives Apple takes pains to identify itself with. Any reporter that bothers to do <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/balancing-security-and-fair-competition/">what a scrappy band of web developers have done</a> — to actually <em>read</em> the self-contradictory tosh Apple flings at regulators and legislators around the world — would have been better prepared for this moment. They would be able to pattern match; to see that twisting words to defend the indefensible isn't somehow alien to Apple. It's not even unusual.</p>
<p>But The Verge, 404, and even Wired are declining to connect the dots. If our luminaries can't or won't dig in, what hope do less thoughtful publications with wider audiences have?</p>
<p>Apple's power and profits have made it an enemy of democracy and civic rights at home and abroad. A mealy-mouthed tech press that cannot see or say the obvious is worse than useless; it is an ally in Apple's attempts to obfuscate.</p>
<p>The most important story about smartphones for at least the past decade has been <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">Cupertino's suppression of the web,</a> because that is a true threat to the App Store, and Apple's power flows from <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/apples-crimes-against-the-internet-community/#apple's-unique-monopoly">the monopolies</a> it braids together. As Cory Doctorow observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple's story – the story of all centralized, authoritarian technology – is that you have to trade freedom for security. If you want technology that Just Works(TM), you need to give up on the idea of being able to override the manufacturer's decisions. It's always prix-fixe, never a la carte.</p>
<p>This is a kind of vulgar Thatcherism, a high-tech version of her maxim that "there is no alternative." Decomposing the iPhone into its constituent parts – thoughtful, well-tested technology; total control by a single vendor – is posed as a logical impossibility, like a demand for water that's not wet</p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/28/works-well/#fails-well" taget="_blank">— Cory Doctorow,<br>"Plenty of room at the bottom (of the tech stack)"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<h2 id="the-price-of-high-modernism-is-dignity" tabindex="-1"><a href="#the-price-of-high-modernism-is-dignity">The Price of High Modernism is Dignity</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">Doctorow's piece</a> on these outrages is a must-read, as it does what so many in the tech press fail to attempt: connecting patterns of behaviour over time and geography to make sense of Apple's capitulation. It also burrows into the rot at the heart of the App Store: the claim that anybody should have as much power as Apple has arrogated to itself.</p>
<p>We can see clearly now that this micro-authoritarian structure is easily swayed by macro-authoritarians, and bends easily to those demands. As James C. Scott <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/csunstei/moreisless.html">discusses</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that many of the most tragic episodes of state development in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries originate in a particularly pernicious combination of three elements. The first is the aspiration to the administrative ordering of nature and society, an aspiration that we have already seen at work in scientific forestry, but one raised to a far more comprehensive and ambitious level. “High modernism” seems an appropriate term for this aspiration. As a faith, it was shared by many across a wide spectrum of political ideologies. Its main carriers and exponents were the avant-garde among engineers, planners, technocrats, high-level administrators, architects, scientists, and visionaries.</p>
<p>If one were to imagine a pantheon or Hall of Fame of high-modernist figures, it would almost certainly include such names as Henri Comte de Saint-Simon, Le Corbusier, Walther Rathenau, Robert McNamara, Robert Moses, Jean Monnet, the Shah of Iran, David Lilienthal, Vladimir I. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Julius Nyerere. They envisioned a sweeping, rational engineering of all aspects of social life in order to improve the human condition.</p>
<p><span>        — James C. Scott,<br>"Seeing Like A State"      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>This is also Apple's vision for the iPhone; an unshakeable belief in its own rightness and transformative power for good. Never mind all the folks that get hurt along the way, it is good <em>because Apple does it</em>. There is no claim more central to the mythos of Apple's marketing wing, and no deception more empowering to abusers of power.<sup><a href="#fn-self-deception-4" id="fnref-self-deception-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Apple claims to stand for open societies, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does"><abbr title="the Purpose Of the System Is What It Does">POSIWID</abbr></a> shows that to be a lie. It is not just corrupted, but itself has become corrupting; a corrosive influence on the day-to-day activities and right necessary to engage in democracy and the rule-of-law.</p>
<p>Apple's Le Corbusierian addiction to control has not pushed it into an alliance with those resisting oppression, but into open revolt against efforts that would make the iPhone an asset for citizens exercising their legitimate rights to aid the powerless. It scuttles and undermines open technologies that would aid dissidents. It bends the knee to tyranny <em>because</em> unchecked power helps Cupertino stave off competition, preserving (it thinks) a space for its own messianic vision of technology to lift others out of perdition.</p>
<p>If the consequences were not so dire, it would be tragically funny.</p>
<p>Let's hope our tech press find their nerve, and a copy of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691210841/the-open-society-and-its-enemies?srsltid=AfmBOopVprr3l-dLq6nmTTkWDK_rxxVEMN3_FgaZa5135_Qjfrp4UpgY"><em>“The Open Society and Its Enemies,"</em></a> before we lose the ability to laugh.</p>
<h2 id="endnote%3A-let's-talk-about-google" tabindex="-1"><a href="#endnote%3A-let's-talk-about-google">Endnote: Let's Talk About Google</a></h2>
<p>I spent a dozen and change years at Google, and my greatest disappointment in leadership over those years was the way the founders coddled the Android team's similarly authoritarian vision.</p>
<p>For the price of a prominent search box on every phone,<sup><a href="#fn-green-thumb-power-5" id="fnref-green-thumb-power-5">5</a></sup> the senior leadership (including Sundar) were willing to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/in-court-filing-google-concedes-the-open-web-is-in-rapid-decline/">sow the seeds of the web's obsolescence,</a> handing untold power to Andy Rubin's team of Java zealots. It was no secret that they sought to displace the web as the primary way for users to experience computing, substituting proprietary APIs for open platforms along the way.</p>
<p>With the growth of Android, Play grew in influence, thanks growing revenue and a need to cover for Android's original sins,<sup><a href="#fn-rotten-to-the-roots-6" id="fnref-rotten-to-the-roots-6">6</a></sup> leading to a series of subtler, but no less effective, tactics that dovetailed with Apple's suppression of the web on iOS. The <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/trusted-web-activities">back doors</a> and <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">exotic hoops</a> developers must jump through to gain distribution for interoperable apps remains a scandal.</p>
<p>But more than talking about Google and what it has done, we should talk about how we <em>talk about</em> Google. In specific, how the lofty goals of its Search origins were undercut by those anti-social, anti-user failures in Android and Play.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that Google is <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/google-must-share-the-ability-to-install-web-apps-in-android/">playing disingenuous games</a> around providing access to competitors regarding web apps on Android, while simultaneously pushing to expand its control over app distribution. The Play team covet what Apple have, and far from exhibiting any self-awareness of their own culpability, are <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal">content to discredit</a> whatever brand reputation Google may have left so long as it can expand its ability to tax software.</p>
<p>And nobody can claim that power is <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/following-apple-google-pulls-ice-spotting-app-red-dot-from-play-store/">being used for good.</a></p>
<p>Google is not creating moral distance between itself and Apple, or seeking to help developers build <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> to steer around the easily-censored channels it markets, and totally coincidentally, taxes.<sup><a href="#fn-knock-off-objectionability-7" id="fnref-knock-off-objectionability-7">7</a></sup> Google is Apple's collaborator in capitulation. A dark moral void, trotting out the same, tired tactic of hiding behind Apple's skirt whenever questions about the centralising and authoritarian tendencies of App Store monopolies crop up. For 15 years, Android has been content to pen 1-pagers for knock-off versions of whatever Apple shipped last year, including authoritarian-friendly acquiescence.</p>
<p>Play is now the primary software acquisition channel for most users around the world, and that should cause our tech press to <em>intensify</em> scrutiny of these actions, but that's not how Silicon Valley's wealth-pilled technorati think, talk, or write. The Bay Area's moral universe extends the wall of the privilege bubble, and we don't talk about the consequences of enshittified, trickle-down tech, or even bother to look hard at it. That would require using Android and…like…ew.</p>
<p>Far from brave truth-telling, the tech press we have today treats the tech the other half (ok, 80%) use as a curio; a destination to gawp at on safari, rather than a geography whose residents are just as worthy of dignity and respect as any other. And that's how Google is getting away with shocking acts of despicable cowardice, but with a fraction of the negative coverage.</p>
<p>And that's a scandal, too.</p>

  <ol><li id="fn-bonus-treats-1"><p>Does anyone doubt that Tim Apple's wishlist didn't also include a slap-on-the-wrist conclusion to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets"><em>US vs. Apple</em></a>?</p>
<p>And can anyone safely claim that, under an administration as nakedly corrupt as Donald Trump's, Apple couldn't buy off the DOJ? And what might the going rate for such policy pliability be?</p>

<li id="fn-servile-frames-3"><p>I don't know Wiley Hodges, but the tone of <a href="https://wileyhodges.substack.com/p/my-email-to-tim-cook?r=qlwt">his letter</a> is everything I expect from Apple employees attempting to convince their (now ex-)bosses of anything: over-the-top praise combined with overt appeals to the brand as the thing of value. At times it verges on hagiography. Again, this is how I understand Apple to discuss Apple to Apple, not just the outside world. I have no doubt that this sort of sickly sweet presentation is absolutely necessary for even moderate criticism to be legible when directed up the chain. Autocracies are not given to debate, and Apple is nothing if not autocratic.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/175654914">follow-up post is more open and honest,</a> and that's commendable. You quickly grasp that he's struggling with some level of deprogramming now that he's on the outside and can only extend the benefit of the doubt towards FruitCo as far as the available evidence allows. Like the rest of us, he's discovering that Apple is demanding far more trust than its actions can justify. He's rightly disappointed that Apple isn't living up to the implications <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">of its stated ideals,</a> and that the stated justifications seem uncomfortably <em>ad hoc</em>, if not self-serving.</p>
<p>This discomfort stems from the difference between principle and PR.</p>
<p>Principles construct tests with which we must wrestle. Marketing creates frames that cast one party as an unambiguous hero. I've often joked that Apple is a marketing firm with an engineering side gig, and this is never more obvious than in the stark differences between <em>communicated</em> choices and <em>revealed</em> outcomes.</p>
<p>No large western company exerts deeper control over its image, prying deep into the personal lives of its employees in domineering ways to protect its own image from (often legitimate) critique that might undermine the message of the day. Every Apple employeed not named "Tim" submits to an authoritarian regime all day, every day. It's no wonder that the demands of power come so easily to the firm. All of this is done to maintain the control that allows Marketing to cast Apple's image in a light that makes it the obvious answer to <em>"who should rule?"</em></p>
<p>But as we know, that question is itself the problem.</p>
<p>Reading these posts, I really feel for the guy, and wish him luck in convincing Apple to change course. If (as seems likely) it does not, I would encourage him to re-read that same <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">Human Rights Policy</a> again and then ask: "<em>is this document a statement of principle or is it marketing?</em>" <a href="#fnref-servile-frames-3">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-self-deception-4"><p>The cultish belief that <em>"it is good because we do it"</em> is first and foremost a self-deception. It's so much easier to project confidence in this preposterous proposition when the messenger themselves is a convert.</p>
<p>The belief that <em>"we should rule"</em> is only possible to sustain among thoughtful people once the question <em>"who should rule?"</em> is deeply engrained. No wonder, then, that the firm works so dang hard to market its singular virtue to the internal, captive audience. <a href="#fnref-self-deception-4">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-green-thumb-power-5"><p>Control over search entry points is the purest commercial analogue in Android to green/blue messages on iOS. Both work to dig moats around commodity services, erecting barriers to switching away from the OS's provider, and both have been fantastically successful in tamping down competition. <a href="#fnref-green-thumb-power-5">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-rotten-to-the-roots-6"><p>It will never cease to be a scandal that Android's singular success metric in the Andy Rubin years was “activations.” The idea that more handsets running Android was success is a direct parallel to Zuckerberg-brain fantasies about “connection” is somehow an unalloyed good.</p>
<p>These are facially infantile metrics, but Google management allowed it to continue well past the sell-by date, with predictably horrendous consequences for user privacy and security. Play, and specifically the hot-potato of "GMS Core" (a.k.a., "Play Services") were tasked with covering for the perenially out of date OSes running on client devices. That situation is scarcely better today. At last check, the ecosystem remains desperately fragemented, with huge numbers of users on outdated and fundamentally insecure releases. Google has gone so far as to remove these statistics from it's public documentation site to avoid the press asking uncomfortable qeustions. Insecurity in service of growth is Android's most lasting legacy.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Andy Rubin saw the web as a threat to his growth ambitions, working to undermine it as a competitor at every step. Some day the full story of how <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> came to be will be told, but suffice to say, Android's rabid accolytes within the company did everything they could to prevent them, and when that was no longer possible, to slow their spread. <a href="#fnref-rotten-to-the-roots-6">⇐</a></p>

<li id="fn-knock-off-objectionability-7"><p>Don't worry, though, Play doesn't tax developers <em>as</em> much as Apple. So Google are the good guys. Right?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli spyware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NSO Group</a> has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz&nbsp;told TechCrunch on Friday that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>Confirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1jgvmitgx#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calcalist reported</a> Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,” said Hershowitz. “The company’s headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is publishing the responses as there was no agreement made.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2023, <a href="http://theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/nso-group-spyware-pegasus-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Guardian reported</a> that Simonds and an associate, through their investment firm, were exploring making a bid to take control of NSO. The deal never materialized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO’s co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie’s involvement with the spyware maker will end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Researchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, <a href="https://github.com/GranittHQ/data-pegasus-victims/blob/main/data-pegasus-victims.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have for years documented dozens of cases</a> where NSO’s government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/27/spyware-diplomats-us-pegasus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was caught in 2021</a> targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the U.S. Commerce Department banned</a> American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/20/nso-group-pegasus-trump-eo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tried to get off the U.S. government’s blocklist,</a> as recently as May 2025, with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the help of a lobbying firm</a> tied to the Trump administration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO’s spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities.&nbsp;This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO’s ownership has exchanged hands before. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally founded by Niv Karmi,&nbsp;Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie,&nbsp;NSO Group was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/12/01/this-spy-tool-can-find-you-with-just-a-telephone-number-and-25-countries-own-it-warn-researchers/?sh=7d4b92b6331e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a> by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-plugin-id="text-block">
          <p>In advance of President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to South Korea later this month—where he is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time since 2019—China announced that it has expanded its restrictions on rare earth and permanent magnet exports. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce’s <a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html">Announcement No. 61 of 2025</a> implements the strictest rare earth and permanent magnet export controls to date. The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting U.S. efforts to bolster its industrial base.</p><p><strong>Q1: What is new about today’s rare earth and permanent magnet export restrictions?</strong></p><p><strong>A1:</strong> The new export controls mark the first time China has applied the foreign direct product rule (FDPR)—a mechanism introduced in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-is-fdpr-why-is-us-using-it-cripple-chinas-tech-sector-2022-10-07/">1959</a> and long used by Washington to restrict <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2334d3d9-d744-4d1f-94cc-e328968b41ce">semiconductor exports</a> to China. The FDPR enables the United States to regulate the sale of foreign-made products if they incorporate U.S. technology, software, or equipment, even when produced by non-U.S. companies abroad. In effect, if U.S. technology appears anywhere in the supply chain, Washington can assert jurisdiction.</p><p>Under the measures announced today, foreign firms will now be required to obtain Chinese government approval to export magnets that contain even trace amounts of Chinese-origin rare earth materials—or that were produced using Chinese mining, processing, or magnet-making technologies. The new licensing framework will apply to foreign-produced rare earth magnets and select semiconductor materials that contain at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/china-rare-earth-exports.html">0.1 percent</a> heavy rare earth elements sourced from China.</p><p>Given China’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c4b2c5d9-c82f-401e-b763-bc9581019cb7">dominance</a> in the sector—accounting for roughly 70 percent of rare earth mining, 90 percent of separation and processing, and 93 percent of magnet manufacturing—these developments will have major national security implications.</p><p><strong>Q2: What do the new restrictions mean for the defense and semiconductor industries?</strong></p><p><strong>A2</strong>: Rare earths are crucial for various <a href="https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/#:~:text=The%20F%2D35%2C%20for%20instance,class%20submarine%20needs%209%2C200%20pounds.">defense technologies</a>, including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. The United States is already struggling to keep pace in the production of these systems. Meanwhile, China is rapidly scaling up its munitions manufacturing capacity and acquiring advanced weapons platforms and equipment at a rate estimated to be <a href="https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/">five to six times faster</a> than that of the United States.</p><p>The newly announced restrictions represent China’s most consequential measures to date targeting the defense sector. Under the new rules, starting December 1, 2025, companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries—including those of the United States—will be largely denied export licenses. The Ministry of Commerce also made clear that any requests to use rare earths for military purposes will be automatically rejected. In effect, the policy seeks to prevent direct or indirect contributions of Chinese-origin rare earths or related technologies to foreign defense supply chains.</p><p>Even before these latest measures, the U.S. defense industrial base <a href="https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/">faced significant challenges</a> and had limited production capacity and limited ability to rapidly scale to meet rising defense technology needs. The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions">capability gap</a> and allowing China to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the United States at a time when tension is rising in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>Additionally, export license applications for rare earth materials used in highly advanced technologies, including sub-14-nanometer semiconductors, next-generation memory chips, semiconductor manufacturing or testing equipment, will now be subject to case-by-case review by Chinese authorities. Companies will likely need to provide detailed documentation on end users, technical specifications, and intended applications before any export is authorized. The individualized review process gives Chinese authorities significant discretion to delay, deny, or condition exports, effectively introducing a new layer of strategic control over the global supply of rare earth inputs critical to advanced computing and defense technologies.</p><p><strong>Q3: How is China tightening control over the outflow of its skills and technologies?</strong></p><p><strong>A3:</strong> Under the new measures, Chinese nationals are barred from engaging in or providing support for overseas projects involving rare earth exploration, extraction, processing, or magnet manufacturing unless they first obtain explicit authorization from Chinese authorities. By tightening control over the movement of expertise, China aims to prevent the outflow of proprietary technologies and know-how that have made it the global leader in rare earth mining and magnet production. These restrictions build on the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means">rare earth processing technology export ban</a> in December 2023.</p><p><strong>Q4: Why are the new export restrictions likely a negotiation tactic?</strong></p><p><strong>A4: </strong>In its <a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html">announcement</a>, the Ministry of Commerce stated that China remains open to enhancing communication and cooperation with other countries through both multilateral and bilateral export control dialogues. The ministry emphasized that such dialogue seeks to promote compliant trade while protecting the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.</p><p><strong>Q5: How do these restrictions build on China’s earlier rare earth export controls?</strong></p><p><strong>A5: </strong>The new measures mark a sharp escalation in Beijing’s long-running strategy to weaponize its dominance in rare earths. China&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means">announced&nbsp;</a>a ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies on&nbsp;December 21, 2023. On April 4, 2025, the Ministry of Commerce <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions">introduced</a> export restrictions on seven rare earth elements in retaliation for President Trump’s new tariffs on Chinese goods.</p><p>Subsequent diplomacy offered only a temporary reprieve. During the May 11 <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access">talks</a> in Switzerland, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, which included removing U.S. companies from China’s trade blacklist and restoring their access to rare earth supplies. Yet stability proved short-lived: U.S. manufacturers soon began shutting down production amid ongoing shortages, as China delayed the issuance of export licenses despite not formally abandoning the deal. Tensions flared again when President Trump accused Beijing of backtracking on its commitments. Ultimately, on June 11, 2025, following two days of negotiations in London attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, both sides <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access">reached</a> a new trade framework—but the episode underscored how Beijing’s rare earth policy has evolved into a potent instrument of economic and geopolitical leverage.</p><p><strong>Q6: What is the United States doing to build its rare earth and permanent magnet capabilities to reduce China’s leverage?</strong></p><p><strong>A6:</strong> Noveon Magnetics&nbsp;is currently the only manufacturer of rare earth magnets in the United States. This week, Noveon Magnetics and Lynas Rare Earths announced a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic partnership focused on building a scalable, domestic supply chain for rare earth permanent magnets in the United States.</p><p>In July 2025, as part of a landmark agreement, the Department of Defense (recently renamed the Department of War) invested $400 million in equity into MP Materials, making the U.S. government the company’s largest shareholder. The deal also includes a 10-year price floor commitment of $110 per kilogram for MP Materials’ NdPr (neodymium-praseodymium) products, designed to protect the commercial viability of the company amidst low prices stemming from Chinese overproduction. Additionally, the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) has extended a $150 million loan to expand MP Materials’ Mountain Pass, California, facility, adding heavy rare earth separation capabilities to strengthen domestic processing capacity. MP Materials has also announced plans to build its second U.S. magnet manufacturing facility, known as the “10X Facility.” The Department of War has entered into a 10-year offtake agreement for 100 percent of the facility’s magnet output. It will take time to ramp up these capabilities. Until then, China retains a significant amount of leverage over supply chains crucial for national and economic security.</p><p><em>Gracelin Baskaran is director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</em></p>

<h2 id="23---primetime-release">23 - Primetime Release</h2>

<p>Hey there! Welcome back!</p>

<p>This last year has been a whirlwind to say the least, but we have remained dedicated to bringing
an updated LineageOS based on Android 16 to the masses!</p>

<p>We’ve been hard at work rebasing all of our changes and features since Android 16’s release in June.
Android 16’s first release mainly contained iterative improvements and some UI/UX refinements, but
due to our previous efforts adapting to Google’s UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14,
we were able to rebase onto Android 16’s code-base faster than anticipated. Yes you read that right:
We’re early this year!</p>

<p>Other components have complicated our release and security patching efforts, but we’ll get to that
shortly.</p>

<h3 id="googles-patch-cadence-and-lineageos-going-forward">Google’s Patch Cadence, and LineageOS Going Forward</h3>

<h4 id="firstly-what-even-is-an-asb-or-a-qpr">Firstly, what even is an ASB? Or a QPR?</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ASB (Android Security Bulletin)</strong> – Google’s monthly roundup of newly fixed security
vulnerabilities across the Android ecosystem. Distributed as a list of patches and security branch
updates for older but still supported Android versions, with the current version tagged monthly.
These updates let projects like ours and OEMs stay aligned with Google’s security baseline.</li>
  <li><strong>QPR (Quarterly Platform Release)</strong> – Mid-cycle updates to a given Android version, landing every
few months. QPRs bring not just security fixes but also bug fixes, performance improvements, and
feature changes (like Material 3 Expressive in 16 QPR1).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="okay-why-are-you-telling-me-this">Okay, why are you telling me this?</h4>

<p>You’ll notice we are choosing to release LineageOS 23.0, and not 23.1. That’s because it’s based on
Android 16’s initial release (what we’ll call QPR0), even though QPR1 has already rolled out to
Pixels. The catch? Google never pushed QPR1’s source to AOSP. They’ve said it’ll come “in the coming
weeks” (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-source-code-delay-3596650/">source</a>),
but right now only contracted partners have access. And to answer the immediate question, the
likelihood that any custom ROM will ever be a contracted Google partner is near 0.</p>

<p>On top of that, Google’s handling of ASBs has shifted (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-risk-based-security-updates-3597466/">source</a>). July was empty for the first time since the
program began, August had a single patch, and September omitted patches for several listed
vulnerabilities, with fixes shared privately to partners under embargo. The result is that AOSP
security updates are no longer released in full on a monthly basis. Instead, only vulnerabilities deemed “high risk” (i.e. actively exploited in the wild)
will be published by Google in the monthly ASBs, and even then, the underlying patches are often not
made public immediately.</p>

<p>On a quarterly cadence, Google now issues larger security bulletins that include patches for
vulnerabilities originally discovered in prior months. These quarterly bulletins coincide with QPRs
(Quarterly Platform Releases), which bundles those security fixes together with feature updates,
but have so far not been pushed to AOSP at the time of release.</p>

<p>This is why you’ve seen the LineageOS 22.2 security patch level remain reflective of August well into September.</p>

<p>In short: this cadence is now the norm, and we need to adapt.</p>

<h4 id="and-i-heard-that-google-stopped-pushing-pixel-source">And I heard that Google stopped pushing Pixel source?</h4>

<p>Yes, Google has pulled back here too. Pixel kernels are now only offered as history-stripped
tarballs, available privately on request, with no device trees, HALs, or configs. Thanks to
projects like <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a>, Pixels will likely remain well supported, but they’re
no longer guaranteed “day one” devices for LineageOS. Pixel devices are now effectively no easier to
support than any other OEM’s devices.</p>

<p>In short, this just makes things harder, not impossible.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-this-affect-lineageos-and-me">How does this affect LineageOS? And me?</h4>

<p>It means we adapt. Instead of waiting indefinitely for QPR1’s source, we’re shipping 23.0 now on
“QPR0”, with the publicly available ASB patches applied, and we’ll only attest to a security patch
level once we have access to all of its fixes. When QPR1 (and future QPRs) eventually land in AOSP,
we’ll merge or rebase as appropriate.</p>

<p>This does mean some features (like Material 3 Expressive) aren’t here yet. But it ensures users
get timely builds, the most complete security fixes we can legally access, and a clear path forward
without being stuck in limbo.</p>

<p>This will likely be the expected norm for Android 17 and beyond, so expect more <code>.0</code> releases in the
future!</p>

<h4 id="tldr"><strong>TL;DR</strong>:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Google no longer pushes monthly tags and patches to AOSP; and most fixes/security patches are now
pushed quarterly, if at all.</li>
  <li>Security patch levels may occasionally lag: we only increment them once all patches are public.</li>
  <li>LineageOS 23.0 is based on Android 16 “QPR0” because QPR1’s source isn’t public yet.
    <ul>
      <li>Because of this some headline features (like Material 3 Expressive) will come later, once
sources drop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pixel support continues, but with reduced source access, they’re no longer guaranteed, let alone
on day one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="legacy-devices">Legacy Devices</h3>

<p>The bad news extends a bit further here, though it’s less surprising than the earlier sections.</p>

<p>Google’s increased reliance on newer
<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf"><strong>eBPF</strong></a> features has made supporting
devices with older Linux kernels increasingly difficult. Android 16 “QPR0” “requires Linux 5.4 and
above, and at the time of writing, the necessary features have only been properly backported as far
back as <code>4.14</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, LineageOS 22.2 still supports many devices running <code>4.4</code> and <code>4.9</code>. As of
now, no complete backports of the required features exist for these kernels. The silver lining is
that, unlike the massive device loss we saw moving off LineageOS 18.1, these versions <em>could</em> be
salvaged if someone were to take on the work of adapting the backports. If you do succeed, please
reach out to devrel(at)lineageos.org, we’d be happy to review it!</p>

<p>We’re currently targeting only shipping kernels that have 1:1 eBPF backports to make them feature
equivalent to Linux 5.4 from here on out to avoid compatibility issues.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-good-stuff">Back to the Good Stuff!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Security patches from September 2024 to August 2025 have been merged to LineageOS 20 through 23.0.</li>
  <li>SeedVault and Etar have both been updated to their newest respective upstream version, with
multiple fixes having been sent back to the relevant upstream repos!</li>
  <li>WebView has been updated to Chromium 140.0.7339.51.</li>
  <li>Contributor demon000 (Cosmin Tanislav) has started work on an awesome set of tools to assist
maintainers in device bringups from scratch! They’re still in-progress, but are staged to make a
lot of our efforts significantly easier and more streamlined - so stay tuned! Maybe a rare
non-yearly blog post? ;)</li>
  <li>Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has extended support for various VirtIO configurations
(QEMU/crosvm/UTM/libvirt, etc.) targets! Though these aren’t supported officially, there is an
awesome, comprehensive guide for building and utilizing these targets on
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>. There is even a newer one allowing you to run
LineageOS in a UTM virtual machine on an
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/utm-vm-on-apple-silicon-mac">Apple Silicon Mac</a>!</li>
  <li>Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has added support for <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/cuttlefish">Cuttlefish</a> targets!</li>
  <li>Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has extended support for devices booting Android on the mainline Linux
kernel! This will allow us to in theory boot LineageOS on almost all devices supported by the
Linux kernel. It’s in early phases, but very promising, with several successful device ports
already available on the LineageOS GitHub organization! Check the search term “mainline” on the
organization’s search bar.</li>
  <li>LineageOS is now nearly <code>Android.mk</code> free! Google
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/make-to-soong">announced their move</a> from <code>make</code> to
<code>soong</code> many years ago, pushing developers to migrate from Android.mk to Android.bp, and has
started blocking Android.mk in many locations of the source tree.
    <ul>
      <li>While converting these is a seemingly simple task - in practice it involved countless hours of
converting conditional checks, regression testing, and thousands of individual patches. As of
this writing, LineageOS introduces less than 10 Android.mk files at a platform level,
and many of these are in the process of being converted. In short - we’re ready for when Google
kills support for Android.mk.</li>
      <li>0xCAFEBABE also created a build target for converting from
<a href="https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_build/+/442552">mk to bp</a>, a WIP feature to
assist developers in migrating to soong!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Both the Charging Control, and Fast Charge Control features have received many updates and
improvements.</li>
  <li>A new set of ringtones and alarms from Plasma Mobile have been included.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="application-updates">Application Updates</h3>

<p>LineageOS isn’t just about the OS itself: our suite of core apps continues to evolve as well. This
cycle brings some major improvements:</p>

<h4 id="aperture-camera">Aperture (Camera)</h4>

<p>Our camera app, Aperture, has been rewritten from the ground up. The rewrite makes the app much
easier to maintain, while also bringing new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for JPEG Ultra HDR, RAW, and simultaneous RAW+JPEG capture.</li>
  <li>A redesigned notification island with dynamic colors, and new indicators (JPEG Ultra HDR, RAW,
battery, thermal throttling).</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep your system updated (or keep updating the app if you’re using the app standalone), since we
plan to introduce more features and improvements over time (believe it or not, nowadays the only
obstacle is Google’s CameraX library, <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/364825889">which has slowed down the development of certain components
which we use in Aperture</a>). We do have some plans
to overcome this though.</p>

<h4 id="twelve-music-player">Twelve (Music Player)</h4>

<p>Our music player, Twelve, didn’t need a full overhaul this year, but it did get some polish and
some new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added a “Play random songs” button for quicker library playback.</li>
  <li>Updated the Now Playing screen with playback statistics (for the nerds and audiophiles out
there).</li>
  <li>Added the ability to rescan the local media store, so newly added music shows up without
needing a reboot.</li>
  <li>Expanded Jellyfin integration, including suggestions, favorites, and better thumbnail
handling.</li>
  <li>Added MIDI playback support.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-app-again">New App, Again?</h3>

<p><img src="https://lineageos.org/images/2025-10-11/catapult.webp" alt="catapult"></p>

<p>We’re excited to debut Catapult, our brand-new custom launcher for Android TV. Catapult is built
with the same principles we bring to the rest of LineageOS: clean, simple, functional design, with
thoughtful user experience at its core.</p>

<p>Why build a new launcher? For years, Android TV and Google TV users have been stuck with preloaded
launchers that aggressively push advertising and recommendations users can’t control. Catapult
changes that. It strips away the clutter, gives you back your home screen, and lets you decide what
belongs front and center.</p>

<p>With Catapult, you get a fast, intuitive interface that focuses on <em>your</em> apps and <em>your</em> content:
no forced feeds, no “sponsored” rows, just a launcher that works the way you expect.</p>

<p>We’re also planning to add more features in the future, you’ll see them appear as you keep your
device up to date, stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="extended-qemu-based-virtual-machine-support">Extended QEMU-Based Virtual Machine Support</h3>

<p>LineageOS has long been a favorite for developers and tinkerers, and with 23.0 we’ve expanded
support for virtualized environments. Thanks to extended QEMU integration spearheaded by developer
0xCAFEBABE, it’s now easier than ever to run LineageOS in VMs for testing, debugging, or just
exploration. This means developers can spin up consistent environments on their desktops without
needing dedicated hardware, and testers can reproduce tricky issues with greater reliability.
Whether you’re validating patches or just curious to see how LineageOS runs under the hood, the
tooling is smoother and more accessible.</p>

<p>If interested, take a look on <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>. You can run
LineageOS via libvirt on Linux/Windows, and on an
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/utm-vm-on-apple-silicon-mac">Apple Silicon Mac</a> with UTM.</p>

<p>Additionally, LineageOS now supports <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/cuttlefish">Cuttlefish</a>
build configurations, which are similar to the  <code>emulator</code> family of targets, but has extra
emulated peripherals, so as to act more like a real device! You can view a list of all the differences
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/cuttlefish#cuttlefish_and_android_emulator">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mainline-kernel-support">Mainline Kernel Support</h3>

<p>Another big milestone in 23.0 is our improved support for devices running Linux mainline kernels.</p>

<p>While Android has historically relied on heavily modified vendor kernels, the ecosystem is shifting
toward mainline for long-term stability and maintainability.</p>

<p>With 23.0, developer 0xCAFEBABE has spearheaded an effort to extend compatibility for devices
capable of booting the mainline Linux kernel, and we’ve made it easier for maintainers to bring
their devices closer to upstream with inheritable common trees. The end result? For now, nothing,
but in the future, we will hopefully be able to boot Android on <em>almost any</em> device that is
supported by the mainline Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This effort should help keep devices alive well past the point where their proprietary components
stop working with newer Android releases.</p>

<p>See the following repos if interested! (<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_mainline">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_common">2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_qcom-common">3</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_mainline_configs">4</a>)</p>

<h3 id="careful-commonization">Careful Commonization</h3>

<p>Several of our developers have worked hard on SoC-specific common kernels to base on that can be
merged on a somewhat regular basis to pull in the latest features/security patches to save
maintainers additional effort.</p>

<p>Go check them out and consider basing your device kernels on them!</p>

<p>Supported SoCs right now are:</p>

<p>Moreover, many legacy devices require interpolating libraries that we colloquially refer to as
“shims” - these have long been device and maintainer managed, but this cycle we have decided to
commonize them to make the effort easier on everyone and not duplicate effort!</p>

<p>You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_lineage_compat">here</a> and
contribute shims that you think other devices may need or add additional components to additional
shims and compatibility layers provided via Gerrit!</p>

<h3 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h3>

<p>Overall, we feel that the 23.0 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 22.2 and is
ready for initial release.</p>

<p>We will allow new LineageOS 21 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we will no longer
allow newly submitted LineageOS 21 devices to ship.</p>

<p>LineageOS 23.0 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to
come as they meet the requirements specified by the
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md">Charter</a> and are
made ready for builds by their maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-to-lineageos-230">Upgrading to LineageOS 23.0</h3>

<p>To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> and then on “Upgrade to a higher version of LineageOS”.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole’ install guide for your
device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> by clicking on your device and then on “Installation”.</p>

<p>Please note that if you’re currently on an official build, you <em>DO NOT</em> need to wipe your device,
unless your device’s wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with
massive changes, such as a repartition.</p>

<h3 id="download-portal">Download portal</h3>

<p>While it has been in the making for quite a while and already released two years ago, it’s still
relevant to this blog post.
Our <a href="https://download.lineageos.org/">download portal</a> has been redesigned and gained a few
functional improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dark mode</li>
  <li>Downloads of additional images (shown for all devices but not used on all of them, read the
instructions to know which ones you need for your device’s installation!)</li>
  <li>Verifying downloaded files (see <a href="https://download.lineageos.org/verify">here</a>) - if you go with
any download not obtained from us, you can still verify it was originally signed by us and thus
untampered with</li>
</ul>

<p>A reminder: Follow the <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/">LineageOS Wiki</a> to the letter! If an image is
listed on the download portal that the wiki doesn’t ask you to use, ignore it! It is likely there
so the maintainer can point power-users at it if needed.</p>

<h3 id="wiki">Wiki</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/">LineageOS Wiki</a> has also been expanded over the years and now
offers, in addition to the known and tested instructions for all supported devices, some
improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The device overview allows filtering for various attributes you might be interested in a device
(please note that choosing a device only based on that list still does not guarantee any device
support beyond the point of when you chose it)</li>
  <li>The device overview now lists variants of a device and other known marketing names in a more
visible way, also allowing for different device information and instructions per variant to be
shown</li>
  <li>The installation instructions have been paginated, giving users less chance to skip a section
involuntarily</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to that we’d like to take this time to remind users to follow instructions on their
device’s respective <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">Wiki Page</a>
given the complexity introduced by AOSP changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic
Partitions, and most recently <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab">Virtual A/B</a>
found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions many of you are
used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps.
As of 16.0, maintainers have been expected to run through the full instructions and verify they
work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device’s specific
installation, update, and upgrade instructions.</p>

<h3 id="developers-developers-developers">Developers, Developers, Developers</h3>

<p>Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!</p>

<p>If you’re a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it’s easier than ever.
Just follow the instructions <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but
are no longer supported - seriously - even if it’s not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe
we can help you complete it.</p>

<p>After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you’ll receive some
feedback on your device submission; and if it’s up to par, you’ll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS’s official repositories.</p>

<p>Don’t have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots
of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/contributing-apps/">improve them</a>, or you can
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/contributing_wiki">contribute to the wiki</a> by adding
more useful information &amp; documentation.
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html">Gerrit</a> is always open for submissions! Once
you’ve contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we’ll
get you in the loop.</p>

<p>Also, if you sent a submission that didn’t get a response in the last few months, please follow up,
we’ve swapped providers again!</p>

<h3 id="generic-targets">Generic Targets</h3>

<p>We’ve talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.</p>

<p>Although we’ve had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to
developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we’ve documented how to use
them in conjunction with the Android
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html">Emulator/Android Studio</a>!</p>

<p>Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations,
and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google’s
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>.
We won’t be providing official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies
entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble’s requirements, but feel
free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!</p>

<p>Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy all later Android versions) diverged GSI and Emulator
targets. Emulator targets reside in <code>lineage_sdk_$arch</code>, while GSI targets reside in
<code>lineage_gsi_$arch</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, experimental targets now exist for QEMU-based virtual machine software (libvirt,
UTM, etc). Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?</p>

<p>If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate">our wiki</a> and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we’ll take
the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.</p>

<p>Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google’s October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions.</li>
<li>The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617).</li>
<li>Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Pixel phones are beloved for their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-pixel-features-explained-3217987/">many unique software features</a>, but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren’t sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/imported-google-pixel-phone-mistake-3562340/">import Pixel phones</a> from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi.</p><p>VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is the feature that routes voice calls over a 4G LTE connection, a crucial function now that carriers worldwide are phasing out their 2G and 3G networks. Without it, you might not be able to make phone calls at all on many modern networks. Similarly, VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi) handles <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wi-fi-calling-free-travel-3532728/">Wi-Fi calling</a>, routing calls over a Wi-Fi network instead of cellular — a handy feature when you’re in a building with poor signal.</p><p>In theory, any phone with the right hardware for a carrier’s cellular frequencies should be able to use VoLTE, and any capable phone with a supporting plan should get VoWiFi. The reality, however, is more complex. Many carriers only permit VoLTE and VoWiFi on devices they sell or have officially tested. This means that even if your imported Pixel has the necessary hardware, the carrier can still block these features, potentially preventing you from making voice calls entirely.</p><p>This issue plagued Pixel phone importers until Korean developer <a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho" target="_blank">Kyujin Cho</a> released a workaround in 2023. The developer’s app, “<a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch" target="_blank">Pixel IMS,</a>” enables VoLTE and VoWiFi on unsupported carriers by overriding the carrier check that Android normally performs. Normally, Android uses a signal from the carrier to decide whether to enable VoLTE for the device; the Pixel IMS app overrides this signal and forces it to always be enabled.</p><p>Overriding this check isn’t something just any app can do, as it’s part of Android’s privileged telephony framework. That’s why Pixel IMS cleverly leverages a loophole intended for testing purposes. Android allows the “shell” user — the same user that runs <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-adb-android-3260397/">ADB commands</a> — to override carrier configurations. To gain these elevated privileges, Pixel IMS uses Shizuku, an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-open-source-android-apps-3565444/">open source Android app</a> that lets other apps run processes as the shell user.</p><p>But loopholes don’t last forever, and after more than two and a half years, Google has seemingly closed this one. Following the recent <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/october-2025-pixel-update-3605572/">October 2025 Pixel update</a>, many users <a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch/issues/384" target="_blank">discovered</a> the “Pixel IMS” app was no longer functional, crashing when attempting to toggle VoLTE or VoWiFi. The crash log gives a clear reason: “<strong>overrideConfig cannot be invoked by shell</strong>.”</p><p>While not documented in the official changelog, Google appears to have quietly patched this particular exploit. According to a source, the company has designated this loophole as <strong>CVE-2025-48617</strong>, a high-severity privilege escalation vulnerability. Its absence from the October 2025 Android Security Bulletin is likely because it didn’t meet the “high risk” threshold for immediate inclusion under <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-risk-based-security-updates-3597466/">Google’s new Risk-Based Update System (RBUS)</a>. Google will probably include it in the next quarterly security bulletin, scheduled for December.</p><p>Fortunately for Pixel users, another developer has allegedly <a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch/issues/384#issuecomment-3384423112" target="_blank">found a new workaround</a>. While the new method isn’t as accessible — with the instructions being in Chinese and the APK distributed on the developer’s Telegram channel — it at least seems to work.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new method only enables VoLTE and not VoWiFi, so Pixel users in unsupported regions who need the latter feature will have to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/root-android-277350/">root their phones</a> for now. Rooting requires unlocking the bootloader, which <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-nano-bootloader-3605497/">breaks some Gemini-powered features</a> and complicates using Google Wallet. The only other alternative is to wait for Google to officially enable VoLTE in more markets — something the company <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phones-volte-gsma-3571825/">recently signaled it’s working on</a>.</p><div data-container-type="content"><p>Thank you for being part of our community.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><ul><li><p>MSI’s first paper, REFRAG, is about a new way to do RAG.</p></li><li><p><span>This slightly modified LLM converts most retrieved document chunks into compact, LLM-aligned </span><strong>chunk embeddings</strong><span> that the LLM can consume directly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A lightweight </span><strong>policy</strong><span> (trained with RL) decides which chunk embeddings should be </span><em>expanded</em><span> back into full tokens under a budget; the LLM runs normally on this mixed input.</span></p></li><li><p>The net effect is far less KV cache and attention cost, much faster first-byte latency and higher throughput, while preserving perplexity and task accuracy in benchmarks.</p></li></ul><p>Meta’s new Superintelligence labs made big headlines with its eyewatering salaries for researchers and leaders alike. Big name founders flocked to this new group, so when they published their first paper, we thought it was a good time to do a quick paper review. </p><p><span>This is the paper: </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092</a></p><p>Our first thought was that the paper was on a topic that we didn’t expect: RAG. If you’re building or investing in products that rely on RAG, you might be building things like AI agents, LLM-powered search, customer support, summarization, or vertical agents. </p><p>In these cases, your inference cost and latency are both massive drivers of your user experience and business model. A very intelligent model creates a better UX, but you run the risk of having CAC &gt; LTV. A fast response, measured by things like time-to-first token, may be attractive, but it will typically mean needing a bigger inference machine. All of these impact whether your AI application is economically viable.</p><p><span>This is precisely where Meta Superintelligence’s (MSI for short) first paper innovates. REFRAG promises </span><strong>30x faster responses </strong><span>(specifically, time to first token) for existing RAG stacks.</span></p><p>Why is this surprising?</p><p>Well, this was surprising because we were expecting that MSI will publish papers that address improvements in the “model layer”, focused on foundational model performance. These maybe experiments that push us beyond scaling training datasets and using more compute for reasoning. New architectures. New modalities. But RAG is a very real world, practical topic for something as significant as a new lab’s first paper.</p><p>Specifically, RAG is ‘different’ because enterprises and consumer apps have operational RAG pipelines with real revenue attached to them. Any improvements to cost/latency in these areas will lead to immediate ROI, also in a way where the benefits are very clear to application layer teams doing things with LLM, and less clear to foundational labs like MSI. </p><p>The ROI comes from a few places. If we zoom in, on the UX level, faster responses increase retention. Cutting time-to-first-token (TTFT) multiplies effective capacity. Software-level efficiency opens new headroom without buying new GPUs or re-architecting models.</p><p>In traditional RAG, you have a knowledge base, say a vector database of unstructured text in “documents”, and then you have a LLM that takes a user query, searches the knowledge base for relevant documents/chunks, and generates a response for the user. The main limitation here is the context window: LLMs can take a finite amount of information, up to millions of tokens as of the publishing of this article.</p><p><span>In Meta’s REFRAG, documents for retrieval are still chunked (~128-token pieces). But, after that, each chunk is encoded into a compact </span><em>chunk embedding</em><span> by a lightweight encoder, then projected into the LLM embedding space. These embeddings are </span><em>precomputable</em><span> and cached.</span></p><p><span>In the product, the user query is embedded and the system retrieves candidate chunks. Instead of sending every chunk’s full token stream to the LLM, the system feeds the LLM a </span><em>mixture</em><span> of: (a) projected chunk embeddings for most chunks, and (b) full token sequences for a few chunks that the policy picks to expand.</span></p><p>A small policy network, trained to maximize downstream generation quality under an expansion budget, looks at the chunk embeddings and picks which chunks to expand to tokens. This policy can be trained with an RL objective that rewards reduced perplexity on generation.</p><p>The LLM sees a short token sequence (expanded chunks + query) plus a number of single-vector placeholders (unexpanded chunks). LLM proceeds to generate text as normal.</p><p><span>In the paper, the core insight is stated to be using the policy network to compress less-relevant chunks in the RAG process, but to us, </span><strong>the core insight here is actually: if embeddings are generated by layers within the LLM, it makes no sense to convert them back to natural language, just for another LLM to compress those tokens back to embeddings.</strong></p><p>That is why the speedups come without collapsing accuracy.</p><p>Contrast two vectors of innovation in LLM land:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Model-level breakthroughs</strong><span> (new architectures, larger models, novel pretraining): high-risk, high-reward, long timelines, big capital.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Application/system-level efficiency</strong><span> (inference optimizations, retrieval tricks, orchestration): lower-risk, immediate ROI, directly monetizable.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>MSI publishing a RAG efficiency paper, in our opinion, signals a broader direction for them to go after problems with ROI </span><strong>today,</strong><span> where their research and infra expertise can move the needle.</span></p><p>For enterprises and product teams, this is a ripe candidate for production pilots. Evaluate TTFT, throughput, and cost-per-query before and after. The upside is immediate: more queries per GPU, lower infra spend, and better UX.</p><p>You can also mix-and-match stacks. REFRAG is orthogonal to better retrievers or rerankers, you can combine it with stronger rerankers to shrink the candidate set even more.</p><p>In the broader market, it’s an interesting paper during an even more interesting time in the vector DB space. Leading vector DB Pinecone is rumoured to be exploring a sale and there was a founder-operator CEO transition. </p><p><span>Fresh research from DeepMind, "On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval," highlights how some documents are always out of reach for RAG. Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures, called this proof that “</span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/pinecone-founder-edo-liberty-appoints-googler-ash-as-ceo#:~:text=Deedy%20Das%2C%20posting%20on%20X%2C" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">plain old BM25 from 1994 outperforms vector search on recall,</a><span>”</span></p><p>While we don’t have a working implementation of REFRAG yet, we can see/guess some limitations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Training &amp; engineering complexity.</strong><span> You must add an encoder + projection and train it so the LLM </span><em>understands</em><span> embeddings (reconstruction pretraining + SFT). The selective-policy is an RL problem: stable but adding development complexity.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Compression ceiling.</strong><span> Aggressive compression eventually degrades downstream quality. There’s a tradeoff between how small your embeddings are and how often you must expand.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Freshness.</strong><span> Precomputed chunk embeddings are great for static corpora. For frequently changing data you need pipelines to recompute embeddings or rely on hybrid strategies.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Use cases.</strong><span> Summaries are coarse; certain precision-critical tasks (legal reasoning, exact quoting, sensitive medical facts) need careful evaluation, you may need lower compression budgets there.</span></p></li></ul><p>A few closing thoughts.</p><p>This paper seems to say, “Why optimise token costs, when you can use a completely different kind of token?”</p><p>If LLMs can be embedding native on the READ side, can it also be embedding native on the WRITE side, thus accelerating agents 30x overall?</p><p>Cost per token for an embedding model is almost zero – have we just saved a ton of token prices by moving to a different architecture? What’s the catch?</p><p>REFRAG is a reminder that not all breakthroughs come from bigger models. Making RAG cheaper and faster at scale is a direct lever on product economics, and the industry will reward teams that operationalize these wins.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>I recently saw an </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/izaahSqv3oRRDu4mr?commentId=98A9ibWbcKACuhrh3" rel="">online suggestion</a><span> that to treat hard drug addiction, you could provide drugs publicly at government facilities, conditional on (inpatient) treatment afterward. The idea being that (extreme) drug addicts have very high time preference, and so will accept a hit now at any cost, even a cost that would forcibly break their habit soon after.</span></p><p>Instinctively, I doubt this would work for almost any addicts, as even the most far gone addicts are still human beings with human faculties who can behave strategically when they need to. But also, the suggestion is an example of analysis that thinks of the typical drug addict as, like, the sort of obviously crazy, addicted, and presumptively homeless person you sometimes see on the street.</p><p>In my experience, many addicts aren’t like that.</p><p>In the summer of my youth, I lived with two different opiate addicts. One was (and is) a close friend, and the other I liked but was mostly just a roommate. I won’t go into lots of detail since it feels icky to mine my friends’ lives for content, but I will say that I had lots and lots of roommates before moving in with my wife, and neither opiate addict was a particularly bad one. They washed their dishes, responded well to requests or criticisms of basic house behaviors, and weren’t nearly as responsible for the rat infestation as I was.</p><p>(Okay, fine. A pretty girl who had a pet rat heard we had a rat problem and brought some rat food to ostensibly… lure out the rat? I don’t even remember the pretext. Anyway we hooked up and the rat food ended up just kind of left out. In the open. For the rats. Ah, to be young.)</p><p>I was pretty tangential to the social scene my addicted friends were part of, but they had friends over sometimes and some of them were closer to the stereotype for people with a drug problem; one guy in particular would occasionally steal things (though never from our house, that I recall), and was generally quite stressful to be around. But I had no idea one of my addicted friends had a drug problem, even though I lived with him during pretty serious crisis in retrospect.</p><p>Nor do I think I’m especially oblivious! I sometimes perceive things like subtle intra-relationship needling that my wife misses among our friends, and in general I’m a bit of a people pleaser and try to remain attuned to social cues. If anything kept me from seeing my friends’ addictions, it was that doing heroin seemed so beyond the pale to me that it was hard to imagine anybody going down that road.</p><p>Even in the case of the roommate who did more obviously have a problem, it didn’t really feel like a crisis from the inside. He’d just sort of invite shady people over to hang out in his room, then fall asleep with them over. Yes, yes, obviously bad stuff was going on there in retrospect, but it wasn’t like he looked gaunt, or like there were any obvious physical signs of drug use anywhere. There were bad specific moments, like one time he passed out in front of the house, but that was fairly indistinguishable from stories about alcoholic acquaintances, rather than a sign of something as directly lethal as heroin addiction. I mostly learned how bad it was when that roommate, feeling bad about exposing us to such behavior, spontaneously evicted himself. Alas, his subsequent attempts to get clean failed, and he died a year or so later.</p><p>But even that guy - may he rest in peace, really a sweet person - was way more obvious than my closer friend, who played video games with me almost every day, had a girlfriend and job, and maintained a seemingly normal and functional life while risking his life regularly.</p><p>In fact, having seen opiate addiction really get its claws into a community from a wallflower’s point of view, the distribution seemed pretty bimodal. The most dysfunctional people tended to get hit, and a smattering of highly functional and friendly people tended to get hit, though you’d only learn that years later, or when they died. Of course, for all I know people in the middle got hit too, and I just never learned it.</p><p>I’m not sure I have one.</p><p>I see a lot of discourse about addiction, but, like most discourse, it mostly radiates out from major cities. Major cities are where lots of the wealth is, so they attract a lot of beggars, and therefore a lot of the least functional drug addicts. So successful people living in major cities probably have a mental template of “drug addict” that looks like a raving guy pushing a stolen shopping cart around, or something. And indeed, when I visit major cities I see many such people, and living in a minor city I see a few.</p><p>But drug addiction, and drug use more broadly, is way more complicated than that. It’s fine to want to address the “roving unstable beggars who do lots of petty crime” problem, insofar as that problem exists, without also wanting to help address the “lots of random 25-year-olds suddenly die out of nowhere” problem. But in fact both of these problems fall under the “drug addiction” umbrella, and you can’t make good policy around drug addiction writ large without keeping both in mind.</p><p>Also I guess I just want people to understand that not every heroin addict is either a death of despair or a person suffering from a cocktail of serious untreated mental disorders. In fact, about half the heroin addicts I knew have fully recovered. Maybe the most surprising thing is how the distribution of recovery overlaps with the entire distribution of mid-addiction stability. My friend is totally fine now, and so is the guy who stole stuff and caused lots of problems. Meanwhile, my other ex-roommate is dead, and so is the second-most-problem-causing addict I knew at the time. This stuff just kind of hits a seemingly-random subsection of entire communities, and of the people hit, about half don’t make it. I’m not sure what to do about that. But it’s probably not simple.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>- Photon, the graphical interface for QNX. Oriented more towards real time (widgets included gauges) but good enough to support two different web browsers. No delays. This was a real time operating system.</p><p>- MacOS 8. Not the Linux thing, but Copeland. This was a modernized version of the original MacOS, continuing the tradition of no command line. Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs.</p><p>- Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems.</p><p>- IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought "bus", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had "channels", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS.</p><p>- CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. 
IBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the "real machine" layer, and they're all hacks.</p><p>- The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind.</p><p>- Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC.</p><p>- XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.
Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly?</p><p>- Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required.

<div><p>Nice list. Some thoughts:</p><p>- I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place.</p><p>- I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as "serverless". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions.</p><p>- Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got "x86" and "ARM" and that's that for the next generation.</p><p>- XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45556271"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45556271" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45556271&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>&gt; but what would be the benefit of having more pages fail to render?</p><p>I think those benefits are quite similar to having more programs failing to run (due to static and strong typing, other static analysis, and/or elimination of undefined behavior, for instance), or more data failing to be read (due to integrity checks and simply strict parsing): as a user, you get documents closer to valid ones (at least in the rough format), if anything at all, and additionally that discourages developers from shipping a mess.

It does not support all Node-RED functionality but gives a good feel for using Node-RED and flow based programming.</p><p>The second project with which I am using Node-RED frontend is Erlang-Red[^3] which is Node-RED with an Erlang backend. Erlang is better suited to flow based programming than NodeJS, hence this attempt to demonstrate that!</p><p>Node-RED makes slightly different assumptions than Yahoo! Pipes - input ports being the biggest: all nodes in Node-RED have either zero or one input wires, nodes in Yahoo! Pipes had multiple input wires.</p><p>A good knowledge of jQuery is required but that makes it simpler to get into the frontend code - would be my argument ;) I am happy to answer questions related to Node-RED, email in bio.</p><p>[^1]: <a href="https://nodered.org/" rel="nofollow">https://nodered.org</a></p><p>[^2]: <a href="https://cdn.flowhub.org/" rel="nofollow">https://cdn.flowhub.org</a></p><p>[^3]: <a href="https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45556319"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45556319" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45556319&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I loved silverlight. Before I got a “serious” job, I was a summer intern at a small civil engineering  consultancy that had gradually moved into developing custom software that it sold mostly to local town/city/county governments in Arizona (mostly custom mapping applications; for example, imagine Google Maps but you can see an overlay of all the street signs your city owns and click on one to insert a note into some database that a worker needs to go repair it… stuff like that).</p><p>Lots of their stuff was delivered as Silverlight apps. It turns out that getting office workers to install a blessed plugin from Microsoft and navigate to a web page is much easier than distributing binaries that you have to install and keep up to date. And developing for it was pure pleasure; you got to use C# and Visual Studio, and a GUI interface builder, rather than the Byzantine HTML/JS/CSS ecosystem.</p><p>I get why it never took off, but in this niche of small-time custom software it was really way nicer than anything else that existed at the time.

<div><p>Developer Ryan Flaherty's "Via" project, a novel approach to streaming large games in real time.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wAn-4e5hQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wAn-4e5hQ</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWsNFVvblLw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWsNFVvblLw</a></p><p>Summary:</p><p>&gt;This presentation introduces Via, a virtual file system designed to address the challenges of large game downloads and storage. Unlike cloud gaming, which suffers from poor image quality, input latency, and high hosting costs, Via allows games to run locally while only downloading game data on demand. The setup process is demonstrated with Halo Infinite, showing a simple installation that involves signing into Steam and allocating storage space for Via's cache.</p><p>&gt;Via creates a virtual Steam library, presenting all owned games as installed, even though their data is not fully downloaded. When a game is launched, Via's virtual file system intercepts requests and downloads only the necessary game content as it's needed. This on-demand downloading is integrated with the game's existing streaming capabilities, leveraging features like level-of-detail and asset streaming. Performance metrics are displayed, showing download rates, server ping, and disk commit rates, illustrating how Via fetches data in real-time.</p><p>&gt;The system prioritizes caching frequently accessed data. After an initial download, subsequent play sessions benefit from the on-disk cache, significantly reducing or eliminating the need for network downloads. This means the actual size of a game becomes less relevant, as only a portion of it needs to be stored locally. While server locations are currently limited, the goal is to establish a global network to ensure low ping. The presentation concludes by highlighting Via's frictionless user experience, aiming for a setup so seamless that users are unaware of its presence. Via is currently in early access and free to use, with hopes of future distribution partnerships.</p><p>I'm amazed the video still has under 4,000 views.

<div><p>I could think of many examples, but I'll talk about the top four that I have in mind, that I'd like to see re-evaluated for today's times.</p><p>1.  When Windows Vista was being developed, there were plans to replace the file system with a database, allowing users to organize and search for files using database queries.  This was known as WinFS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS</a>).  I was looking forward to this in the mid-2000s.  Unfortunately Vista was famously delayed, and in an attempt to get Vista released, Microsoft pared back features, and one of these features was WinFS.  Instead of WinFS, we ended up getting improved file search capabilities.  It's unfortunate that there's been no proposals for database file systems for desktop operating systems since.</p><p>2.  OpenDoc (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc</a>) was an Apple technology from the mid-1990s that promoted component-based software.  Instead of large, monolithic applications such as Microsoft Excel and Adobe Photoshop, functionality would be offered in the form of components, and users and developers can combine these components to form larger solutions.  For example, as an alternative to Adobe Photoshop, there would be a component for the drawing canvas, and there would be separate components for each editing feature.  Components can be bought and sold on an open marketplace.  It reminds me of Unix pipes, but for GUIs.  There's a nice promotional video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJdjk2rq4E" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJdjk2rq4E</a>.</p><p>OpenDoc was a radically different paradigm for software development and distribution, and I think this was could have been an interesting contender against the dominance that Microsoft and Adobe enjoys in their markets.  OpenDoc actually did ship, and there were some products made using OpenDoc, most notably Apple's Cyberdog browser (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdog" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdog</a>).</p><p>Unfortunately, Apple was in dire straits in the mid-1990s.  Windows 95 was a formidable challenger to Mac OS, and cheaper x86 PCs were viable alternatives to Macintosh hardware.  Apple was an acquisition target; IBM and Apple almost merged, and there was also an attempt to merge Apple with Sun.  Additionally, the Macintosh platform depended on the availability of software products like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop, the very types of products that OpenDoc directly challenged.  When Apple purchased NeXT in December 1996, Steve Jobs returned to Apple, and all work on OpenDoc ended not too long afterward, leading to this now-famous exchange during WWDC 1997 between Steve Jobs and an upset developer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o</a>).</p><p>I don't believe that OpenDoc fits in with Apple's business strategy, even today, and while Microsoft offers component-based technologies that are similar to OpenDoc (OLE, COM, DCOM, ActiveX, .NET), the Windows ecosystem is still dominated by monolithic applications.</p><p>I think it would have been cool had the FOSS community pursued component-based software.  It would have been really cool to apt-get components from remote repositories and link them together, either using GUI tools, command-line tools, or programmatically to build custom solutions.  Instead, we ended up with large, monolithic applications like LibreOffice, Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, etc.</p><p>3.  I am particularly intrigued by Symbolics Genera (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)</a>), an operating system designed for Symbolics Lisp machines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics</a>).  In Genera, everything is a Lisp object.  The interface is an interesting hybrid of early GUIs and the command line.  To me, Genera could have been a very interesting substrate for building component-based software; in fact, it would have been far easier building OpenDoc on top of Common Lisp than on top of C or C++.  Sadly, Symbolics' fortunes soured after the AI winter of the late 1980s/early 1990s, and while Genera was ported to other platforms such as the DEC Alpha and later the x86-64 via the creation of a Lisp machine emulator, it's extremely difficult for people to obtain a legal copy, and it was never made open source.  The closest things to Genera we have are Xerox Interlisp, a competing operating system that was recently made open source, and open-source descendants of Smalltalk-80: Squeak, Pharo, and Cuis-Smalltalk.</p><p>4.  Apple's "interregnum" years between 1985 and 1996 were filled with many intriguing projects that were either never commercialized, were cancelled before release, or did not make a splash in the marketplace.  One of the most interesting projects during the era was Bauhaus, a Lisp operating system developed for the Newton platform.  Mikel Evins, a regular poster here, describes it here (<a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2021-07-12-reimagining-bauhaus/" rel="nofollow">https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2021-07-12-reimagining-ba...</a>).  It would have been really cool to have a mass-market Lisp operating system, especially if it had the same support for ubiquitous dynamic objects like Symbolic Genera.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45555578"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45555578" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45555578&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>their operator precedence system was one of my favourite pieces of language design. the tl;dr was that you could group operators into precedence sets, and an expression involving operators that all came from the same set would have that set's precedence rules applied, but if you had an expression involving mixed sets you needed to add the parentheses. crucially, they also supported operator overloading, and the same operator could be used in a different set as long as everything could be parsed unambiguously. (caveat, I never used the language, I just read about the operator design in the docs and it was very eye opening in the sense that every other language's operator precedence system suddenly felt crude and haphazard)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45555575"><td></td></tr><tr id="45553761"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45553761" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45553761&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Wine predates ReactOS.  It was basically a FOSS duplicate of Sun's WABI.</p><p>I wrote a bunch of software in Borland Delphi, which ran in Windows, Wine, and ReactOS with no problems. Well, except for ReactOS' lack of printing support.</p><p>As long as you stay within the ECMA or published Windows APIs, everything runs fine in Wine and ReactOS.  But Microsoft products are full of undocumented functions, as well as checks to see if they're running on real Windows.  That goes back to the Windows 3.1 days, when 3.1 developers regularly used OS/2 instead of DOS, and Microsoft started adding patches to fail under OS/2 and DR-DOS.  So all that has to be accounted for by Wine and ReactOS. A lot of third-party software uses undocumented functions as well, especially stuff written back during the days when computer magazines were a thing, and regularly published that kind of information. A lot of programmers found the lure of undocumented calls to be irresistible, and they wound up in all kinds of commercial applications where they really shouldn't have been.</p><p>In my experience anything that will load under Wine will run with no problems.  ReactOS has some stability problems, but then the developers specifically call it "alpha" software.  Despite that, I've put customers on ReactOS systems after verifying all their software ran on it.  It gets them off the Microsoft upgrade treadmill. Sometimes there are compatibility problems and I fall back to Wine on Linux.  Occasionally nothing will do but real Windows.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45554918"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45554918" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45554918&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>TOKYO - Japanese summers have lengthened by about three weeks over the 42 years from 1982 to 2023, a university research group said Saturday.</p>

<p>The Mie University group said that due to climate change, the number of days classified as summer has increased each year, while the length of winter has remained relatively unchanged, and the average durations of spring and fall have shortened.</p>

<p>The group cited "the rise in sea surface temperatures due to global warming" as the main factor, warning that "the trend toward longer summers and winters will intensify if warming continues."</p>

<p>The Japan Meteorological Agency defines summer as lasting from June to August, without specifying a temperature range.</p>

<p>The researchers included second-year master's student Mao Takikawa and Yoshihiro Tachibana, a professor of the university's Department of Environmental Science and Technology.</p>

<p>In their research, the group divided the area from Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido to the southernmost one of Kyushu, including surrounding ocean areas, into about 200 zones and used the agency's observation data to calculate the average annual maximum temperature over 42 years.</p>

<p>They defined a "summer benchmark" for each zone based on its temperature range, using the agency's data on annual highs and lows to determine which days qualified as summer days.</p>

<p>For example, if the highest temperature in an area was 20 C and the lowest was 0 C, the benchmark was 15 C -- one quarter down from the maximum -- with days above that level counted as summer.</p>

<p>They further analyzed 42 years of temperature data on an annual basis.</p>

<p>The group defined the first day of summer in a year as the date when the summer threshold was exceeded, and the ending date on the last day it was exceeded, with the number of days in between constituting the summer period.</p>

<p>Looking at the average across approximately 200 zones over the 42-year period, the start date of summer advanced by about 12.6 days, while the end date was delayed by about 8.8 days.</p>

<p>The summer period extended by approximately 21.4 days, the group said.</p>

<p>In 1982, the summer period lasted 92 days, from June 29 to Sept. 28. However, by 2023, it had lengthened to 121 days, running from June 11 to Oct. 9.</p>

<p>According to Tachibana, warm air flowing in from the Asian continent once cooled over the oceans surrounding the Japanese archipelago, causing temperatures to rise gradually from spring to summer. However, in recent years, rising sea surface temperatures have prevented this cooling, resulting in an earlier onset of summer.</p>

<p>Sea surface temperatures remain persistently high, making it difficult for temperatures to drop and delaying the end of summer, Tachibana said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, little change has been observed for the winter period. This is believed to be due to the continued influence of strong cold waves moving in from the continent.</p>

      <p>Messaging platform Discord has said the official ID photos of around 70,000 users have been stolen by hackers.</p><p>The app, which is popular with gamers and teenagers, said the hackers targeted a firm responsible for verifying the ages of its users. Discord said its own platform was not breached.</p>
<p>The stolen data could include personal information, partial credit card numbers and messages with Discord's customer service agents, the firm said.</p><p>No full credit card details, passwords or messages and activity beyond conversations with Discord customer support were leaked, it added.</p><p>Discord said it had revoked the third-party service's access and was continuing to investigate. It said all affected users have been contacted.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, we recommend impacted users stay alert when receiving messages or other communication that may seem suspicious," it said.</p><p>Until recently, a hack like this could not have happened, because companies had no need to process and collect proofs of age.</p>    <div data-component-name="sdc-article-related-stories">

<p>Now, so many governments are following the UK and introducing age verification for unsuitable or pornographic content that a company like Discord has to roll out age checks for a decent portion of its 200 million active users.</p><p>It's a bit like the way that shops have to check your age if you're buying alcohol - only because it's online, it comes with a lot of additional complications.</p>

<p>A shop, for instance, won't keep a copy of your passport once they've checked your age.</p><p>And it definitely won't keep it in a massive (yet strangely light) safe along with thousands of other passport photocopies, stored right by its front door, ready to be taken.</p><p>Online, it's surprisingly easy to do just that.</p><p><strong>Read more on Sky News:</strong><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/how-ai-is-driving-a-distortion-of-reality-when-it-comes-to-how-women-are-presented-online-13447270" target="_blank"><strong>AI 'distorting women online'</strong></a><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/do-we-need-digital-ids-in-the-uk-13438109" target="_blank"><strong>Pros and cons of digital IDs</strong></a><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tamed-algorithms-and-plummeting-pornography-views-impact-of-new-online-safety-rules-revealed-one-month-on-13416556" target="_blank"><strong>Impact of new online safety rules</strong></a></p>     <a href="https://news.sky.com/download-app" target="blank" data-tracking-label="ui-app-promo-download-link" data-type="" data-component-name="ui-app-promo" data-testid="app-promo">

<p>It's worth noting that the age verification system used by Discord wasn't hacked itself. That system asked people to take a photo of themselves, then used software to estimate their age. Once the check was complete, the image was immediately deleted.</p><p>The problem came with the appeals part of the process, which was supplied to Discord by a third party.</p><p>If someone thought that the age verification system had wrongly barred them from Discord they could send in a picture of their ID to prove their age. This collection of images was hacked. As a result, Discord says, more than 70,000 IDs are now in the possession of hackers.</p><p>(The hackers themselves claim that the number is much bigger - 2,185,151 photos. Discord says this is wrong and the hackers are simply trying to extort money. It's a messy situation.)</p>     
<p>There are ways to make age verification safer. Companies could stop storing photo ID, for instance (although then it would be impossible to know for sure if their checks were correct).</p><p>And advocates of ID cards will point out that a proper government ID could avoid the need to send pictures of your passport simply to prove your age. You'd use your digital ID instead, which would stay safely on your device.</p><p>But the best way to stop data being hacked is not to collect it in the first place.</p><p>We're at the start of a defining test - can governments actually police the internet? Or will the measures that are supposed to make us safer actually end up making us less secure?</p>

				I uploaded a photo on my phone to Microsoft's "OneDrive" file-hosting app — and there was a surprise waiting under <em>Privacy and Permissions.</em>  "OneDrive uses AI to recognize faces in your photos..."</p><p> 
And... </p><p> 
"You can only turn off this setting 3 times a year."</p><p> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G6tmCiS.png" alt="*" width="500"></p><p> 

If I moved the slidebar for that setting to the left (for "No"), it moved back to the right, and said "Something went wrong while updating this setting." (Apparently it's not one of those three times of the year.)</p><p> 

The feature is already rolling out to a limited number of users in a preview, a Microsoft publicist confirmed to Slashdot. (For the record, I don't remember signing up for this face-recognizing "preview".) But there's a link at the bottom of the screen for a "Microsoft Privacy Statement" that leads to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/group-photos-by-people-21065f48-c746-48ad-a98a-cbe4631631bc">a Microsoft support page</a>, which says instead that "This feature is coming soon and is yet to be released."  And in the next sentence it's been saying "Stay tuned for more updates"  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231109163626/https://support.microsoft.com/">for almost two years</a>...</p><p> 

A Microsoft publicist <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users#microsoft_spokesperson">agreed to answer Slashdot's questions</a>...</p></div>

		
			<p><span><p>  <a name="microsoft_spokesperson"> </a> <strong>Slashdot:</strong> What's the reason OneDrive tells users this setting can only be turned off 3 times a year?   (And are those any three times — or does that mean three specific days, like Christmas, New Year's Day, etc.)</p><p> 

[Microsoft's publicist chose not to answer this question.]</p><p> 

<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  If I move the slidebar to the left (for "No"), it moves back to the right, and says "Something went wrong while updating this setting."   So is it correct to say that there's no way for users to select  "No" now?</p><p> 

<strong>Microsoft:</strong> We haven't heard about the experience you are having with toggling, but our Microsoft contacts would like to investigate why this is happening for you. Can you share what type of device you are using, so we can put you in touch with the right team?</p><p> 
<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  Is this feature really still "coming soon"?   Can you give me more specific details on when "soon" will be?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong>  This feature is currently rolling out to limited users in a preview so we can learn and improve. We have nothing more to share at this time.</p><p> 

<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  I want to confirm something about how this feature is "yet to be released."  Does this mean that currently OneDrive is not (and has never) used AI to "recognize" faces in photos?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong>  Privacy is built into all Microsoft OneDrive experiences. Microsoft OneDrive services adhere to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a> and follow Microsoft's compliance with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy/european-data-boundary-eudb">Microsoft EU Data Boundary</a>.</p><p> 
<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  Some privacy advocates prefer "opt-in" features, but it looks like here OneDrive is planning a (limited) opt-out feature.  What is the reasoning for going with opt-out rather than opt-in?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft OneDrive inherits privacy features and settings from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, where applicable.</p><p> 

Slashdot also spoke to EFF security/privacy activist Thorin Klosowski, who expressed concerns. "Any feature related to privacy really should be opt-in and companies should provide clear documentation so its users can understand the risks and benefits to make that choice for themselves."</p><p> 

Microsoft's "three times a year" policy also seemed limiting to Klosowski.  "People should also be able to change those settings at-will whenever possible because we all encounter circumstances were we need to re-evaluate and possibly change our privacy settings."</p></span>

<p>I first started programming Java at IBM back in 1999 as a Pre-University Employee. If I remember correctly, we had Java 1.1.8 installed at that time, but were moving to Java 1.2 (“Java 2”), which was a massive release—I remember engineers at the time grumbling that the ever-present “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298118.Java_in_a_Nutshell">Java in a Nutshell</a>” book had grown to over 600 pages. I thought I’d take a look back at 26 years of Java releases and rate some of the language and core library changes (Java SE only) that have occurred over this time. It’s a very different language to what I started out with!</p>



<p>I can’t possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history">cover every feature of those releases</a>, as there are just way too many. So I’m just going to cherry-pick some that seemed significant at the time, or have been in retrospect. I’m not going to cover UI- or graphics-related stuff (Swing, Java2D etc), or VM/GC improvements. Just language changes and core libraries. And obviously this is highly subjective. Feel free to put your own opinions in the comments! The descriptions are brief and not intended as an introduction to the features in question: see the links from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history">Wikipedia page</a> for more background.</p>



<p>NB: later features are listed from when they were first introduced as a preview.</p>



<h2>Java 2 – 1998</h2>



<p><strong>The Collections Framework</strong>: before the collections framework, there was just raw arrays, Vector, and Hashtable. It gets the job done, but I don’t think anyone thinks the Java collections framework is particularly well designed. One of the biggest issues was a failure to distinguish between mutable and immutable collections, strange inconsistencies like why Iterator as a remove() method (but not, say, update or insert), and so on. Various improvements have been made over the years, and I do still use it in preference to pulling in a better alternative library, so it has shown the test of time in that respect. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 1.4 – 2002</h2>



<p><strong>The <code>assert</code> keyword: </strong>I remember being somewhat outraged at the time that they could introduce a new keyword! I’m personally quite fond of asserts as an easy way to check invariants without having to do complex refactoring to make things unit-testable, but that is not a popular approach. I can’t remember the last time I saw an assert in any production Java code. <strong>3/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Regular expressions:</strong> Did I really have to wait 3 years to use regex in Java? I don’t remember ever having any issues with the implementation they finally went for. The Matcher class is perhaps a little clunky, but gets the job done. Good, solid, essential functionality. <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>“New” I/O</strong> (NIO): Provided non-blocking I/O for the first time, but really just a horrible API (still inexplicably using 32-bit <em>signed</em> integers for file sizes, limiting files to 2GB, confusing interface). I still basically never use these interfaces except when I really need to. I learnt Tcl/Tk at the same time that I learnt Java, and Java’s I/O always just seemed extraordinarily baroque for no good reason. Has barely improved in 2 and a half decades. <strong>0/10</strong></p>



<p>Also notable in this release was the <strong>new crypto APIs</strong>: the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) added encryption and MAC support to the existing signatures and hashes, and we got JSSE for SSL. Useful functionality, dr<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peumD3MY8So">eadful error-prone APIs</a>. <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 5 – 2004</h2>



<p>Absolutely <em>loads</em> of changes in this release. This feels like the start of modern Java to me.</p>



<p><strong>Generics</strong>: as Go discovered on its attempt to speed-run Java’s mistakes all over again, if you don’t add generics from the start then you’ll have to retrofit them later, badly. I wouldn’t want to live without them, and the rapid and universal adoption of them shows what a success they’ve been. They certainly have complicated the language, and there are plenty of rough edges (type erasure, reflection, etc), but God I wouldn’t want to live without them. <strong>8/10</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Annotations:</strong> sometimes useful, sometimes overused. I know I’ve been guilty of abusing them in the past. At the time it felt like they were ushering a new age of custom static analysis, but that doesn’t really seem to be used much. Mostly just used to mark things as deprecated or when overriding a method. Meh. <strong>5/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Autoboxing:</strong> there was a time when, if you wanted to store an integer in a collection, you had to manually convert to and from the primitive int type and the Integer “boxed” class. Such conversion code was everywhere. Java 5 got rid of that, by getting the compiler to insert those conversions for you. Brevity, but no less inefficient. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Enums</strong>: I’d learned Haskell by this point, so I couldn’t see the point of introducing enums without going the whole hog and doing algebraic datatypes and pattern-matching. (Especially as Scala launched about this time). Decent feature, and a good implementation, but underwhelming. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Vararg methods:</strong> these have done quite a lot to reduce verbosity across the standard library. A nice small improvement that’s had a good quality of life enhancement. I still never really know when to put @SafeVarargs annotations on things though. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>The for-each loop:</strong> cracking, use it all the time. Still not a patch on Tcl’s foreach (which can loop over multiple collections at once), but still very good. Could be <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2012/06/03/pimp-my-java/">improved</a> and has been somewhat replaced by Streams. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Static imports:</strong> Again, a good simple change. I probably would have avoided adding * imports for statics, but it’s quite nice for DSLs. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Doug Lea’s java.util.concurrent etc</strong>: these felt really well designed. So well designed that everyone started using them in preference to the core collection classes, and they ended up back-porting a lot of the methods. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 7 – 2011</h2>



<p>After the big bang of Java 5, Java 6 was mostly performance and VM improvements, I believe, so we had to wait until 2011 for more new language features.</p>



<p><strong>Strings in switch:</strong> seems like a code smell to me. Never use this, and never see it used. <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Try-with-resources</strong>: made a huge difference in exception safety. Combined with the improvements in exception chaining (so root cause exceptions are not lost), this was a massive win. Still use it everywhere. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Diamond operator for type parameter inference:</strong> a good minor syntactic improvement to cut down the visual noise. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Binary literals and underscores in literals:</strong> again, minor syntactic sugar. Nice to have, rarely something I care about much. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Path and Filesystem APIs:</strong> I tend to use these over the older File APIs, but just because it feels like I should. I couldn’t really tell you if they are better or not. Still overly verbose. Still insanely hard to set file permissions in a cross-platform way. <strong>3/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 8 – 2014</h2>



<p><strong>Lambdas: </strong> somewhat controversial at the time. I was very in favour of them, but only use them sparingly these days, due to ugly stack traces and other drawbacks. Named method references provide most of the benefit without being anonymous. Deciding to exclude checked exceptions from the various standard functional interfaces was understandable, but also regularly a royal PITA. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Streams:</strong> Ah, streams. So much potential, but so frustrating in practice. I was hoping that Java would just do the obvious thing and put filter/map/reduce methods onto Collection and Map, but they went with this instead. The benefits of functional programming weren’t enough to carry the feature, I think, so they had to justify it by promising easy parallel computing. This scope creep enormously over-complicated the feature, makes it hard to debug issues, and yet I almost never see parallel streams being used. What I do still see quite regularly is resource leaks from people not realising that the stream returned from Files.lines() has to be close()d when you’re done—but doing so makes the code a lot uglier. Combine that with ugly hacks around callbacks that throw checked exceptions, the non-discoverable API (where are the static helper functions I need for this method again?), and the large impact on lots of very common code, and I have to say I think this was one of the largest blunders in modern Java. I blogged what I<a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2012/06/03/pimp-my-java/"> thought was a better approach</a> 2 years earlier, and I still think it would have been better. There was plenty of good research that <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/A+generic+collection+traversal+interface">different approaches were better</a>, since at least <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/Iteratee/#enumerator-stream">Oleg Kiselyov’s work in the early noughties</a>.  <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java Time:</strong> Much better than what came before, but I have barely had to use much of this API at all, so I’m not in a position to really judge how good this is. Despite knowing how complex time and dates are, I do have a nagging suspicion that surely it doesn’t all need to be <em>this</em> complex? <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 9 – 2017</h2>



<p><strong>Modules:</strong> I still don’t really know what the point of all this was. Enormous upheaval for minimal concrete benefit that I can discern. The general advice seems to be that modules are (should be) an internal detail of the JRE and best ignored in application code (apart from when they spuriously break things). Awful. <strong>-10/10</strong> (that’s minus 10!)</p>



<p><strong>jshell:</strong> cute! A REPL! Use it sometimes. Took them long enough. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 10 –&nbsp;2018</h2>



<p>The start of time-based releases, and a distinct ramp-up of features from here on, trying to keep up with the kids.</p>



<p><strong>Local type inference (“var”)</strong>:<strong> </strong>Some love this, some hate it. I’m definitely in the former camp. <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 11 – 2018</h2>



<p><strong>New HTTP Client</strong>: replaced the old URL.openStream() approach by creating something more like Apache HttpClient. It works for most purposes, but I do find the interface overly verbose. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p>This release also added <strong>TLS 1.3</strong> support, along with djb-suite crypto algorithms. Yay. <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 12 – 2019</h2>



<p><strong>Switch expressions</strong>: another nice mild quality-of-life improvement. Not world changing, but occasionally nice to have. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 13 – 2019</h2>



<p><strong>Text blocks:</strong> on the face of it, what’s not to like about multi-line strings? Well, apparently there’s a good reason that injection attacks remain high on the OWASP Top 10, as <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/355">the JEP introducing this feature</a> seemed intent on getting everyone writing SQL, HTML and JavaScript using string concatenation again. Nearly gave me a heart attack at the time, and still seems like a pointless feature. Text templates (later) are trying to fix this, but seem to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1bxck72/there_will_be_no_string_template_in_jdk_23/">currently in limbo</a>. <strong>3/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 14 – 2020</h2>



<p><strong>Pattern matching in <code>instanceof</code>:</strong> a little bit of syntactic sugar to avoid an explicit cast. But didn’t we all agree that using <code>instanceof</code> was a bad idea decades ago? I’m really not sure who was doing the cost/benefit analysis on these kinds of features. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Records:</strong> about bloody time! Love ‘em. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Better error messages for NullPointerExceptions:</strong> lovely. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 15 – 2020</h2>



<p><strong>Sealed classes:</strong> in principal I like these a lot. We’re slowly getting towards a weird implementation of algebraic datatypes. I haven’t used them very much yet so far. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>EdDSA signatures:</strong> again, a nice little improvement in the built-in cryptography. Came with a <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/">rather serious bug</a> though… <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 16 – 2021</h2>



<p><strong>Vector (SIMD) API: </strong>this will be great when it is finally done, but still baking several years later. <strong>?/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 17 – 2021</h2>



<p><strong>Pattern matching switch:</strong> another piece of the algebraic datatype puzzle. Seems somehow more acceptable than instanceof, despite being largely the same idea in a better form. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 18 – 2022</h2>



<p><strong>UTF-8 by default: </strong>Fixed a thousand encoding errors in one fell swoop. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 19 – 2022</h2>



<p><strong>Record patterns:</strong> an obvious extension, and I think we’re now pretty much there with ADTs? <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Virtual threads: </strong>being someone who never really got on with async/callback/promise/reactive stream-based programming in Java, I was really happy to see this feature. I haven’t really had much reason to use them in anger yet, so I don’t know how well they’ve been done. But I’m hopeful! <strong>?/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 21 – 2023</h2>



<p><strong>String templates: </strong>these are exactly what I asked for in <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2023/01/18/a-few-programming-language-features-id-like-to-see/">A few programming language features I’d like to&nbsp;see</a>, based on E’s quasi-literal syntax, and they fix the issues I had with text blocks. Unfortunately, the first design had some issues, and so they’ve gone back to the drawing board. Hopefully not for too long. I really wish they’d not released text blocks without this feature. <strong>10/10</strong> (if they ever arrive).</p>



<p><strong>Sequenced collections:</strong> a simple addition that adds a common super-type to all collections that have a defined “encounter order”: lists, deques, sorted sets, etc. It defines convenient getFirst() and getLast() methods and a way to iterate items in the defined order or in reverse order. This is a nice unification, and plugs what seems like an obvious gap in the collections types, if perhaps not the most pressing issue? <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Wildcards in patterns:</strong> adds the familiar syntax from Haskell and Prolog etc of using <code>_</code> as a non-capturing wildcard variable in patterns when you don’t care about the value of that part. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simplified console applications:</strong> Java finally makes simple programs simple for beginners, about a decade after universities stopped teaching Java to beginners… Snark aside, this is a welcome simplification. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p>This release also adds support for <strong><a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2021/01/22/hybrid-encryption-and-the-kem-dem-paradigm/">KEMs</a></strong>, although in the <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2021/02/16/when-a-kem-is-not-enough/">simplest possible form</a> only. Meh. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 22 –&nbsp;2024</h2>



<p>The only significant change in this release is the ability to have <strong>statements before a call to super() </strong>in a constructor. Fine. <strong>5/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 23 – 2024</h2>



<p><strong>Primitive types in patterns: </strong>plugs a gap in pattern matching. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Markdown javadoc comments:</strong> Does anyone really care about this? <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 24 – 2024</h2>



<p>The main feature here from my point of view as a crypto geek is the addition of <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> in the form of the newly standardised ML-KEM and ML-DSA algorithms, and support in TLS. </p>



<h2>Java 25 – 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Stable values:</strong> this is essentially support for lazily-initialised final variables. Lazy initialisation is often trickier than it should be in Java, so this is a welcome addition. Remembering <a href="https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/alice/manual/futures.html#lazy">Alice ML</a>, I wonder if there is some overlap between the proposed StableValue and a Future? <strong>7/10</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>PEM encoding of cryptographic objects</strong> is welcome from my point of view, but someone will need to tell me why this is not just <code>key/cert.getEncoded(“PEM”)</code>? Decoding support is useful though, as that’s a frequent reason I have to grab Bouncy Castle still. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<p>Well, that brings us pretty much up to date. What do you think? Agree, disagree? Are you a passionate defender of streams or Java modules? Have at it in the comments.</p>

							<p>After the <a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-assassinated/">murder</a> of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, many on the political right set out to <a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/16/the-perverse-incentives-for-snitch-tagging-teachers-who-criticized-charlie-kirk/?nab=0">punish</a> anyone making light of the tragedy, or even simply being insufficiently upset. In one of the more brazen examples, a Tennessee man was arrested, accused of threatening a school shooting, and held on a $2 million bond, for posting a somewhat uncivil meme on Facebook.</p> <p>Larry Bushart, a 61-year-old former police officer, <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2025/09/22/former-officer-accused-posting-threatening-meme-referencing-school-shooting-tn/">posted</a> the offending meme last month. In <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">response</a> to a Facebook post about an upcoming vigil for Kirk, Bushart shared an <a href="https://x.com/aaronterr1/status/1970272191884468241">image</a> of President Donald Trump with the quote, "We have to get over it," which Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-supporters-get-iowa-school-shooting-move-forward-rcna132610">said</a> in January 2024 after a shooting at Iowa's Perry High School. Text added to the image said, "This seems relevant today."</p> <p>Bushart did not elaborate, but the context seems clear: <em>Why should I care about this shooting, when the sitting president said I should "get over" this other shooting?</em></p> <p>The image was one of <a href="https://wopclive.linkedupradio.com/assets/images/2025/IMG_7383.webp">several</a> Bushart posted, and it was far from the most offensive. Still, it certainly feels crass; as people mourned a brutal public murder, Bushart snidely used the occasion to make a partisan political point. But it's certainly well within the bounds of average social media discourse, and you certainly wouldn't expect it to bring the attention of the local police.</p> <p>"Received a visit from Lexington PD regarding my posted memes," Bushart wrote in a September 21 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BAP29mMvt/">Facebook status</a>. <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">According to</a> Sheriff Nick Weems of nearby Perry County, "numerous…teachers, parents and students"&nbsp;somehow interpreted Bushart's meme—with its citation in fine print about a previous school shooting at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa—as a threat to carry out a similar shooting at nearby Perry County High School.</p> <p>According to the Perry County Sheriff's Office <a href="https://isoms.perrycountysheriff.net/portal/Jail?hours=0&amp;lname=B">website</a>, Bushart was arrested the following morning on a charge of Threats of Mass Violence on School Property and Activities—a class E <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-39/chapter-16/part-5/section-39-16-517/">felony</a> <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-40-criminal-procedure/tn-code-sect-40-35-111/">punishable</a> by between one and six years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine.

Even just to get out of jail ahead of trial, state law says Bushart would have to pay a bondsman at least $210,000.</p> <p>The Perry County Circuit Court <a href="https://perry.tncrtinfo.com/crCaseForm.aspx?id=ADDFC002-5567-44CA-B209-DA2909E6869F&amp;dsid=fd8e7548">website</a> indicates Bushart had a motion hearing scheduled for October 9, but when reached by phone Friday, a court clerk told <em>Reason</em> the hearing was "reset" for December 4.</p> <p>Bushart posted the Trump meme "to indicate or make the audience think it was referencing our Perry High School," Weems <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">told&nbsp;<em>The Tennesseean</em></a> in a statement. "Investigators believe Bushart was fully aware of the fear his post would cause and intentionally sought to create hysteria within the community." Weems <a href="https://wopclive.com/local-news/808311/sheriff-man-arrested-for-mass-violence-threats-following-facebook-post">also told</a> local radio station WOPC the meme "eluded [<em>sic</em>] to a hypothetical shooting at a place called Perry High School."</p> <p>This justification is downright laughable. In its entirety, the post consists of a direct quote of a statement by the then-former president about a newsworthy event, with text providing context, plus a four-word phrase added. Bushart didn't even create the meme: <em>The Tennesseean</em>'s Angele Latham noted it had been "posted numerous times across multiple social media platforms not connected to Bushart going back to 2024."</p> <p>"Quote the President of the United States, go to jail," Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, <a href="https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh/status/1976087431947649466">posted</a> on X.</p> <p>In context, it's clear Bushart meant to suggest that since Trump previously said people should "get over" a school shooting, then they shouldn't be expected to care about the murder of a conservative public figure. It's quite a stretch to suggest this constituted a threat to shoot up a high school. Yes, a nearby high school happened to have a similar name, but that was clearly a coincidence, and there is nothing to suggest Bushart intended to carry out violence against the local school.</p> <p>On social media, some have <a href="https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1976276224197730800">suggested</a> the meme in question was part of a larger pattern indicating Bushart posed a threat. But in his <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">statement</a> to <em>The Tennesseean</em>, Weems specifically singled out the Trump meme as the offender, saying while the other posts were "hate memes," they were "not against the law and would be recognized as free speech."</p> <p>Perhaps some teachers, parents, or students really did find Bushart's post threatening—though since it was a reply on a Facebook page for local news, it's not clear how many people even saw it. And even if people did see and interpret it as a threat of violence, that doesn't mean it meets the standard for a "true threat," in violation of the First Amendment.</p> <p>"True threats are not protected speech but not everything is a true threat," David Hudson, professor at Belmont University School of Law, tells <em>Reason</em>. "This seems to me to be heated rhetorical hyperbole, which is an incredibly important concept—or should be—in true threat-type cases."</p> <p>The U.S. Supreme Court created the true threat exception to the First Amendment in the 1969 decision <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/705/"><em>Watts v. United States</em></a>. Even then, Hudson adds, it made the point of distinguishing between true threats and "crude political hyperbole"—in that case, a protester's remark that if he were drafted into the Army, "the first man I want to get in my sights is" then-President Lyndon Johnson. The court agreed with the plaintiff that it was not a true threat but simply "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President."</p> <p>"Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution," Justice William O. Douglas wrote in a concurring opinion.</p> <p>Bushart's arrest would be humorous if it weren't so serious. He now faces a potential years-long prison sentence for reposting a Facebook meme that doesn't come anywhere close to qualifying as an exception to the First Amendment. Even if the case gets thrown out, he has already spent two weeks in jail and is set to spend two more months until his first hearing.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This course is intended to provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step understanding of how to engineer optimal prompts within Claude.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>After completing this course, you will be able to</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Master the basic structure of a good prompt</li>
<li>Recognize common failure modes and learn the '80/20' techniques to address them</li>

<p dir="auto">This course is structured to allow you many chances to practice writing and troubleshooting prompts yourself. The course is broken up into <strong>9 chapters with accompanying exercises</strong>, as well as an appendix of even more advanced methods. It is intended for you to <strong>work through the course in chapter order</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Each lesson has an "Example Playground" area</strong> at the bottom where you are free to experiment with the examples in the lesson and see for yourself how changing prompts can change Claude's responses.

          <p>Amazon Echo Show owners are reporting an uptick in advertisements on their smart displays.</p>
<p>The company's Echo Show smart displays have <a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q0000DYDLBvSQP/why-is-my-echo-show-suddenly-showing-ads-and-how-do-i-turn-them-off">previously shown</a> ads through the company's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21213736011">Shopping Lists</a> feature, as well as advertising for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/get-ready-for-alexa-skills-pop-up-ads-on-your-amazon-echo-show/">Alexa skills</a>.&nbsp;Additionally, Echo Shows may play audio ads when users listen to Amazon Music on Alexa.</p>
<p>However, reports on Reddit (examples <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0y0rw/ads_this_will_cause_me_to_unplug_all_show_devices/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nku3j6/ads_after_alarm/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nj0kxc/echo_show_wont_stop_advertising_amazon_plus/">here</a>) and from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/797672/amazon-echo-show-ads-alexa-plus">The Verge’s</a> Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, who owns more than one Echo Show, suggest that Amazon has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nuucj0/how_are_we_still_getting_ads_on_alexa/">increased the amount of ads</a> it shows on its smart displays' home screens. The Echo Show’s apparent increase in ads is pushing people to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0y0rw/ads_this_will_cause_me_to_unplug_all_show_devices/">stop</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nlzdbg/comment/nf92nhm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">using</a> or even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0o3an/question_im_returning_my_echo_show_because_it_has/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">return</a> their Echo Shows.</p>
<p>The smart displays have also started showing ads for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Alexa+</a>, the new generative AI version of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. Ads for the subscription-based Alexa+ are reportedly taking over Echo Show screens, even though the service is still in Early Access.</p>
<p>“This is getting ridiculous and I'm about to just toss the whole thing and move back to Google,” one Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nj0kxc/echo_show_wont_stop_advertising_amazon_plus/">said</a> of the “full-volume” ads for Alexa+ on their Echo Show.</p>
<p>The Verge’s Tuohy reported seeing ads on one (but not all) of her Echo Shows for the first time this week and said ads sometimes show when the display is set to show personal photos. She reported seeing ads for “elderberry herbal supplements, Quest sports chips, and tabletop picture frames."</p>
<p>Users are unable to disable the home screen ads. When reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica:</p>

      <h2>Social Medicine</h2>
      <p><strong>GNU Health as a social movement</strong>: GNU Health is a social project with technology behind. It’s about Social Medicine and delivering universal healthcare. It’s about social activism. One of the main reasons that led me to create GNU Health were the tremendous inequalities in access to healthcare. Over 20000 children die every day from preventable, social diseases. To name a few : malnutrition, contaminated water, child slavery, prostitution, war, malaria, HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, dengue and other neglected tropical diseases. These are causes and/or results of social diseases, conditions that have a higher impact and higher prevalence on the poor and the underprivileged.</p>

<p>Studying and getting a deeper understanding on the living conditions of people in rural areas and in urban ghettos around the world, reinforced my intention to write a system that included the socio-economic determinants of health and disease. Most of the time, health (and the lack of) is determined by the environment, and biology plays a lesser role. Proper nutrition, housing, sanitation, access to education and to primary healthcare are key for the dignity, development and health of the individual, family and society at large. I like to summarize it as <strong>“people before patients”</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing">https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45549434">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently shipped a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/9116">non-trivial Ghostty feature (unobtrusive macOS automatic updates)</a>
that was <em>largely</em> developed with AI.</p>
<p>I'm regularly asked to share non-trivial examples of how I use
AI and agentic coding tools and this felt like a golden opportunity to
walk through my process with a well-scoped, non-trivial, real-world,
shipping feature<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This post will share every single agentic coding session I had on the path
to shipping this feature, unedited and in full. Alongside it, I'll provide
some additional context about my process and reasoning. And yes, I'll also
share the token cost for those curious about that, too.</p>
<div><p><strong>Important: there is a lot of human coding, too.</strong> I almost always go in after an AI does work
and iterate myself for awhile, too. Rather than say that at every turn, I'm just saying it once
here. Therefore, you may see some discrepancies between what the AI produced and what ended up in
the final code. This is intentional and I believe good AI drivers are experts in their domains and
utilize AI as an assistant, not a replacement.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-feature">The Feature</h2>
<p>The finished feature this blog post is about is the macOS unobtrusive
update notification feature. This feature shows update status within the
terminal window without interrupting work by creating windows, grabbing
focus, etc.</p>

<p>Let's set the stage for what lead to this feature (pun intended, as you'll see shortly).
During a high-profile OpenAI keynote, a demo was rudely interrupted by
a Ghostty update prompt:</p>
<p><img alt="OpenAI Demo" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="726" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fopenai-demo.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fopenai-demo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fopenai-demo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>I wanted to ensure that never happened again<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. The path I decided to
take was to make update notifications <em>unobtrusive</em>. Instead of popping up
a window, the app would instead show a small, non-modal GUI element somewhere
that wouldn't interrupt the user.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pre-ai-planning">Pre-AI Planning</h2>
<p><del>So I pulled out my AI tooling.</del> <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> I began by coming up
with a rough plan of how I wanted this to work. Ghostty uses
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>, an extremely popular macOS update framework.
I poked around their docs and found that they support
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.github.io/documentation/api-reference/">custom UI through Obj-C protocols</a>.
You have to reimplement a ton of stuff from scratch, but it is possible.</p>
<p>Okay, so I had a rough idea of <em>backend</em>. For <em>frontend</em>, I wasn't really
sure (and it isn't my area of expertise). I had this really vague idea
that it should be a little button embedded in the title bar, and I know
macOS supports custom UI in the titlebar via
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/addtitlebaraccessoryviewcontroller(_:)">titlebar accessory controllers</a>,
but beyond that I didn't have much of a sense of how it should look or feel.</p>
<p>But that's enough to get started. AI is a very good prototyper, so even
knowing what you don't know is useful enough to get started. I had a strong
enough sense of the big picture.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-session-prototyping-the-ui">First Session: Prototyping the UI</h2>
<p>Here is my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-9fc3eb88-5aa2-45e4-8f6d-03697f53102d">first agentic coding session</a>,
with the starting prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to enable custom, unobtrusive update notifications and installs
by customizing SPUUserDriver. Let's start by planning the custom UI we'll
need. We'll ONLY work on UI. Create a plan for creating SwiftUI views that
can show the various states that are required by SPUUserDriver. I think the
best place for these to show up is in the macOS window titlebars on the
top-right. Create a plan to put it there. Consult the oracle.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p>Frequent question: "What is the oracle?" It is an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/news/oracle">Amp-specific read-only
subagent</a> that uses a slower, higher-cost model that is generally
better at thinking about things. I consult the oracle for all planning.</p></div>
<p>To start, I decided to prototype the UI first.</p>
<p>Notice here that I don't send the agent off to <em>build the full feature</em>.
There are a couple reasons for this. First and foremost, I still don't
even know what I want the UI/UX to be like, so I can't possibly coherently
expect an AI to do that for me amongst other changes. Second, smaller
chunks of work are easier to review, understand, and iterate on.</p>
<p>Another thing to notice is that I ask it to only create a plan and not
to write any code. Since this is a relatively vague request, it's important
that I review a plan before it goes off and does a ton of work (and
spends a ton of tokens doing it).</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Creating a comprehensive plan interactively with an agent is a really important
first-step for anything non-trivial. I usually also save it out (via the agent) to something like
<code>spec.md</code> and in future sessions I can say "Consult the @spec.md and work on <em>some task</em>".</p></div>
<p>The agent came up with an <em>agreeable enough</em> plan that I let it go ahead
and implement it. You can see the rest of my conversations as I iterate on
that.</p>
<p><strong>The UI it made was directionally very good.</strong> It had a <em>ton</em> of polish
issues (spacing, colors, etc.) but seeing the UI gave me the spark of
inspiration I needed to know what I wanted.</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> I very often use AI for inspiration. In this case, I ended up keeping a lot (not all) of
the UI code it made, but I will very often prompt an agent, throw away everything it did, and redo
it myself (manually!). I find the "zero to one" stage of creation very difficult and time
consuming and AI is excellent at being my muse.</p></div>
<h3 id="hitting-a-wall">Hitting a Wall</h3>
<p>You can see in chats 11 to 14 that we're entering the <em>slop zone</em>.
The code the agent created has a critical bug, and it's absolutely
failing to fix it. And I have no idea how to fix it, either.</p>
<p>I'll often make these few hail mary attempts to fix a bug. If the
agent can figure it out, I can study it and learn myself. If it doesn't,
it costs me very little. If the agent figures it out and I don't understand it,
I back it out. I'm not shipping code I don't understand.
While it's failing, I'm also tabbed out searching the issue and trying to
figure it out myself.</p>
<p>It's at this point that I know I need to step back, review what it did,
and come up with my own plans. It's time to educate myself and think
critically. AI is no longer the solution; it is a liability.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cleanup-sessions">Cleanup Sessions</h2>
<p>I spend the next few sessions guiding the agent to clean up the code.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-cad10729-a348-4dc6-9297-e1130a12f5da">second session</a>
focused on moving some methods around into better places I recognized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's move the pill background, foreground, and badge functions from
@macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateAccessoryView.swift to
@macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift and make them more
generic (background, foreground, badge)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-ae7a7144-6293-4bf6-af24-982b8ff09984">third session</a>
added documentation to the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the docs for @UpdateBadge.swift</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Adding documentation is a really important step because it helps reaffirm your own
understanding of the code as well as educate future agents that may read and modify this code. I
find agents do much better when they have both natural language descriptions as well as the code
itself.</p></div>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-af16fe85-bdc5-4fcb-b7e7-dbc425ca5da7">fourth session</a>
moves the view model to an app-global location, since the original
work put it in a window scope and update information is app scoped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move the update view model data to AppDelegate since the update information
will be app-global.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout these, I am usually dropping in and making minor manual
changes as well.</p>
<p>The cleanup step is really important. To cleanup effectively you have
to have a pretty good understanding of the code, so this forces me to
not blindly accept AI-written code. Subsequently, better organized and
documented code helps future agentic sessions perform better.</p>
<p>I sometimes tongue-in-cheek refer to this as the "anti-slop session".</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="facing-the-bug">Facing "The Bug"</h2>
<p>Time to get back to that bug that I found in that initial session.
I once again spent a few sessions trying to get the agent to figure this
out. I start vague, and slowly get more specific with how I'd approach it.</p>
<p>First, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-5b64618e-3884-4bf9-87cb-e041f755279f">vague session</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For standard, native tabs, the update accesory view is not visible.
It should remain visible in the titlebar of the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure. Then, I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-0230ecf6-4d77-48da-99e8-ffeb35d3163b">get more specific</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to update @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TerminalTabsTitlebarTahoe.swift
tab bar constraints to align the right edge of the tab bar with the left

<blockquote>
<p>What if we changed the @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TitlebarTabsTahoeTerminalWindow.swift

<p>Failure. One <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-47dbc7c1-796a-45b4-ba21-3385cc89411a">last attempt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "right accessory view" and layout of @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TitlebarTabsTahoeTerminalWindow.swift
is conflictig with the update accessory view setup in
@macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TerminalWindow.swift Can we
constrain the tab bar to always appear left of the update notice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure.</p>
<p>This whole time, I've also spent time trying to solve this myself through
manual research and human effort. My more specific prompts are based on
things I've learned through that process. But overall, it was clearly
not working.</p>
<p>I don't think I can figure this out on my own, so I decide to pivot.
I decided that for these problematic titlebar styles, let's put the update
notices in the bottom-right corner of the window overlaid on top of the
content view rather than in the titlebar.</p>
<p>I need to support this <em>anyways</em> because Ghostty has a configuration
to hide the titlebar entirely. So, even if I can solve the titlebar
styling issue later, I still need to support this other mode.</p>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-69675325-c5e3-497a-b692-0176744069e9">next session</a>
moves forward with this plan with a very specific prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augment the @macos/Sources/Features/Update system to also support an overlay
approach in @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/TerminalView.swift The update
notice should appear at the bottom of the window. It should go over the
text (so it doesn't resize the terminal view). All clicking behaviors
should otherwise be the same as the accessory view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did a really good job with this. I did a lot of manual polish after
(moving stuff around, renaming things, etc.) but the core work was solid.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the feature shortly after this session, showcasing
how the update notice appears in the bottom-right corner of the window
for certain titlebar styles or when the titlebar is hidden:</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="starting-the-backend">Starting the Backend</h2>
<p>The UI was feeling <em>good enough</em>. I had noted a bunch of polish issues
I wanted to tackle later but I wanted to move on to the backend work
primarily to see if I'd discover any unknown unknowns that threw a
wrench in my plans.</p>
<p>I manually created a file with a scaffold of incomplete functions and
various <code>TODO</code> comments. I then started
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-d812d8a2-b7af-47ca-a91b-5ce3a18068b2">a session to complete that work for me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complete the @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateDriver.swift Read the
Sparkle documentaiton as necessary to understand the functionality.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Protocols.html">https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Protocols.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> AI is very good at fill-in-the-blank or draw-the-rest-of-the-owl. My pattern here of
creating scaffolding with descriptive function names, parameters, todo comments, etc. is a really
common one for me and it works very well.</p></div>
<p>It actually did a <strong>really bad job here</strong> and I ended up throwing
all of this code away. The code it produced <em>worked</em>, but it was obviously
the wrong approach. It conflated a lot of different concerns and the
way it was storing state in the driver was clearly wrong.</p>
<p>When I studied what it did, I realized it was because the view model was
structured in a suboptimal way, so I switched gears into cleanup mode to
give AI (and humans, if I chose to write it myself) the better framework to
work with.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cleanup-again-big-time">Cleanup Again, Big Time</h2>
<p>Experience has taught me that the cleanliness of a UI frontend and business
logic backend is often dictated by the quality of the view model in between.
So I spent some time manually restructured the view model. This involved
switching to a tagged union rather than the struct with a bunch of
optionals. I renamed some types, moved stuff around.</p>
<p>I knew from experience that this small bit of manual work in the middle
would set the agents up for success in future sessions for both the
frontend and backend. After completing it, I continued with a marathon set of
cleanup sessions.</p>
<p>After doing the restructuring, the first thing I did was
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-29c43cfa-5b00-420d-9490-ce16cea29103">ask the agent to once again complete the owl</a>,
this time inspecting my changes and updating dependent code to the new
style and removing the old:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift to use the
new <code>UpdateState</code> exclusively. Rename <code>state2</code> to <code>state</code> (remove the old state).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-5c8f7208-fcad-4f62-a212-65c7c2d61346">asked it remove additional dead code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we can get rid of UpdateUIActions. They're not used anymore since
our UpdateState has callbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I broke the build myself cleaning up some things. I had a
meeting to hop onto so I decided to
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-214e0715-3fbb-42ee-9ad7-bc3ded364f36">let the agent fix it while I was busy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run the build and fix the errors</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> "I broke a bunch of things, please fix my mess." is another frequent use case I have for
agents. I'd say generally this fits within the same fill-in-the-blank pattern as before.</p></div>
<p>Later, I started doing some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-3ff3649d-4610-4bbe-8c2a-7875b03e9a5d">refactors on some of the views again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn each @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdatePopoverView.swift case into a
dedicated fileprivate Swift view that takes the typed value as its parameter
so that we can remove the guards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-0477a9aa-e1ff-4df0-bf16-eed5131b6c14">More cleanup</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change <code>iconName</code> in @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift to
be an optional, return nil for blank. Update usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>
<p>In my first UI session, I had the agent create some demo code so I could
see the UI in action without real update checks. But update flows have
a number of scenarios and up to this point I only tested the happy path.</p>
<p>In my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-a2faf4af-c67b-47a5-99d1-b1a0f957cafb">next session</a>
I extracted the simulation code into a dedicated file and asked the agent
to create more scenarios:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extract the update simulation code in @macos/Sources/App/macOS/AppDelegate.swift
into a dedicated file in @macos/Sources/Features/Update . This should
contain multiple simulation scenarios (happy path, not found, errors, etc.)
so that we can easily try different demos.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Agents are great at generating tests and simulations. The simulation code specifically
that it generated here is honestly pretty gross but it works and it's not part of the release
binary so the quality doesn't matter to me. I didn't even bother cleaning it up beyond the basics
you can see in the session.</p></div>
<p>I then ran the various simulations and found a number of UX improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-01583a65-e9c8-457d-bf27-603b0297bb8d">Cleaning up the "No Update Found" state</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-e5a5cd11-c024-4562-8afc-8d1574b32a87">Reset state on confirming error</a></li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="last-mile">Last Mile</h2>
<p>At this point, I had a working backend and frontend and I needed to
hook it all up.</p>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-6968a022-f1a2-4011-806a-1060e8e8fd81">next session</a>
prompted the agent to do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make an <code>UpdateController</code> class the same as
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/Sparkle/SPUStandardUpdaterController.m">https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/Sparkle/SPUStandardUpdaterController.m</a>
but for our updater types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This required some back and forth and manual polish, but it got there.</p>
<p>I then <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-fce4f9e0-7bb4-4930-b2b1-34fd600bc242">made some minor improvements</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our update available state with the appcast, look at
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Classes/SUAppcastItem.html">https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Classes/SUAppcastItem.html</a>
and show other relevant metadata if its set. For example, content length for
size.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="anything-else">Anything Else?</h2>
<p>My <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ampcode.com/threads/T-e4cc70f0-d222-4c40-a1e7-745025e3dc9c">last prompt to an agent</a>
is always to ask what else I might be missing.
<strong>I do this regardless of if I manually wrote the code myself or not.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there any other improvements you can see to be made with the
@macos/Sources/Features/Update feature? Don't write any code. Consult the
oracle. Consider parts of the code that can also get more unit tests added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This highlighted some real issues, so I went ahead and asked it to
implement them. I find its easier to tell the agent "okay just do it all"
rather than ask it specific things to do, since I can always easily clean
it up in selective commits later.</p>
<p>An amusing thing in this session is that the agent started going down
a really crazy rabbit hole and so I stepped in to stop it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop stop stop. Undo all the main actor stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also noticed that it did something rather poorly when there is
a better way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the error message, instead of truncating, isn't there a SwiftUI standard
way to do this? We should add an additional UI element they can use to view
the whole message.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="cost-and-time">Cost and Time</h2>
<p>The work took a total of <strong>16 separate sessions</strong> totalling <strong>$15.98</strong> in
token spend on Amp<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>. I won't try to speculate whether this is expensive
or cheap in general, but I will say for me personally I spent more than that
in coffee shops in the two calendar days I spent on this feature.</p>
<p>The total "wall clock" time I spent on this feature I estimate around
8 hours. I only spend around 4 hours a day on the computer the first
and last commit span 3 days. But I also didn't spend all of my time on this
feature. For example, I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/install/release-notes/1-2-2">shipped a Ghostty update</a>,
was a guest on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen">ThePrimeagen</a> for an hour,
and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://x.com/adam_chal/status/1976527358099337325">gave a guest presentation at Zoo's annual all-hands</a>,
all during the hours I have available for "computer work" during the
same days I was working on this feature<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. So, I think the 8 hour estimate
is generous.</p>
<p>Many people on the internet argue whether AI enables you to work faster
or not. In this case, I think I shipped this faster than I would have if I
had done it all myself, in particular because iterating on minor SwiftUI
styling is so tedious and time consuming for me personally and AI does
it so well.</p>
<p>I think the faster/slower argument for me personally is missing the thing
I like the most: the AI can work for me while I step away to do other things.
Here is a picture I took of one of my cleanup sessions while I was making
breakfast for my family:</p>
<p><img alt="Vibing and Cooking" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="1050" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fvibing-breakfast.jpeg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fvibing-breakfast.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://mitchellh.com/_next/image?url=%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fvibing-breakfast.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<div><p>There's all sorts of dismissals about this, such as "I don't want to be coding while I'm cooking"
or "Be more present" or whatever. If that's how you want to be, that's fine. In my case, in this
specific example, I'm the first person awake in my household and I prep breakfast while everyone
else is still asleep. I don't do this every waking moment.</p></div>
<p>All this is to say: it works for me. I'm really, really not trying to <em>convince you</em>. I'm
not associated financially with any AI company. But as someone who has
a lot of success with AI tooling and likes to talk about it, people
ask me to share examples all the time. That's what I'm doing here.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>I think the feature is beautiful, works great, and after a final manual
review I merged it<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>.
For Ghostty users who are on the tip release, it is available now.
For Ghostty users who are on tagged releases, this feature will be
available in Ghostty 1.3.</p>
<p>I'm an outspoken advocate about the importance of sharing agentic
coding sessions publicly<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>, with one of the reasons being that it's an
incredibly powerful way to educate others about how to use these tools
effectively. I hope this post helps demonstrate that.</p>
<section data-footnotes="true">
<ol>
<li id="user-content-fn-6">
<p>It is currently only shipped to nightly beta testers ("tip" testers)

</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-2">
<p>Yes, it was good marketing. No, it was not on purpose. And no, I'm not
celebrating it, because you don't want users to a fear a tool will
take advantage of them. You want to trust that it's there to help.
I want presenters (or anyone, really) to <em>want</em> to use Ghostty, and
caring about stuff like this is part of that. <a href="#user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref="true" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

  <p>Firefox is an open source, private browser, one of the few mainstream browsers that supports extensions on mobile (Android) as powerful as the desktop ones (A lot of extensions have been ported), with seamless sync and a customizable homepage.</p>
<h2 id="browser-extensions">Browser Extensions</h2>
<p>There are many extensions that have improved my browsing experience dramatically, by helping me fight the <strong>bloat</strong> of modern web browsing. This is especially more important on mobile, where resources and screen space are more limited.</p>

<p>The extension store is very similar to the desktop one. My browsing use case on my phone is to read articles, look up something quickly, buy things in online stores, or just see what people are saying online. When I do that, I don’t want to see ads, and I don’t want pop-ups taking up half of my screen.
No, I don’t want to download your <strong>app</strong>,
<em>The website is fine</em>; I don’t want to talk with your AI chat. I’m not interested in receiving fake notifications either. And I might have subscribed to your newsletter if you hadn’t put a pop-up while I was midway through reading your article.</p>
<p>The following extensions have helped me in my fight against bloat and antipatterns on the web. Making my time on the web rather  a  pleasant experience</p>
