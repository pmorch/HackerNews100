<p>Authorities are now considering whether a falling object, possibly from space, caused damage to the windshield and frame on a United 737 MAX over Colorado on Thursday. Various reports that include watermarked photos of the damage suggest the plane was struck by a falling object not long after taking off from Denver for Los Angeles. One of the photos shows a pilot’s arm peppered with small cuts and scratches. In his remarks after the incident, the captain reportedly described the object that hit the plane as “space debris,” which would suggest it was from a rocket or satellite or some other human-made object. Some reports say it was possibly a meteorite.</p>



<p>Whatever hit the plane, it was an enormously rare event and likely the first time it’s ever happened. The plane diverted without incident to Salt Lake City where the approximately 130 passengers were put on another plane to finish the last half of the 90-minute flight. Apparently only one layer of the windshield was damaged, and there was no depressurization. The crew descended from 36,000 feet to 26,000 feet for the diversion, likely to ease the pressure differential on the remaining layers of windshield. Neither the airline nor FAA have commented.</p>

<div><p>I work for an MSP, mostly with small to medium companies. Licensing costs went up a ton when broadcom acquired vmware. They went up a ton more this year with minimum core counts, current licensing costs are roughly $20k a year minimum. They might hike the price again, even medium businesses that see some value in avoiding an expensive migration want to avoid this uncertainty. Basically they don't want to deal with small and medium sized businesses. I'm sure large businesses are facing price hikes too but I don't have experience with that.</p><p>If you are on a perpetual license you can put the management vlan on a network not connected to the internet if it wasn't already and realistically this buys a few years. You will not be able to patch, eventually auditors will not accept that. For the rest not on perpetual licensing, when the licensing expires you will not be able to power on machines, if they reboot they stay off.</p><p>About half of clients we are migrating to hyper-v. Most are already running windows servers. There are some differences but hyperv covers the important features and the licensing is basically already included. Beeam makes the virtual to virtual move a lot easier, this is what most of our customers use for backups</p><p>For a good chunk they are migrating to azure or another hosted environment.

We have customers moving to OpenNebula, CloudStack, Proxmox, OpenStack, HP VME, Oracle Virtualization, and even some homegrown solutions. The common thread is that they're all looking for a storage backend that is not tied to a specific hypervisor and can deliver predictable high performance. The beauty of the KVM ecosystem is the freedom to choose the best tool for the job, and that extends to the storage layer. A good software-defined block storage solution should have the features (data migration, disaster recovery) and capabilities to make the transition away from VMware as smooth as possible.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45638920"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45638920" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45638920&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45635940"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Hard to say much given we weren't given much info on how it'd be used.</p><p>E.g. Parallel's is only useful for people looking to run VMs locally on their Mac, but Hyper-V can be anything from that for a Windows PC to a full-blown headless hypervisor cluster with HA, shared volumes, replication, etc.</p><p>For several of the common categories, these are my takes:</p><p>- Traditional Enterprise: Nutanix [paid] if money is available, otherwise Hyper-V [paid] if a large Microsoft contract is already in place. If neither fit: fall through to acting like an SMB.</p><p>- SMB/Modern Mid-Sized Enterprise: Cloud [paid] only and/or Proxmox [free/paid]</p><p>- Tech Company: Doesn't matter, they'll do whatever sounds cool that year and make it work well enough</p><p>- Home Lab: Proxmox [free/paid]</p><p>- Windows PC: Hyper-V [free w/ Windows] (it's meh, but it's integrated - doubly so if you plan on using WSL on the side).</p><p>- Mac PC: Parallels [paid] if you need a GPU accelerated Windows guest, UTM [free] otherwise.</p><p>- Linux PC: QEMU+KVM [free], the choice of (optional) GUI client is up to preference.</p><p>Some extra notes by solution:</p><p>- Nutanix: Enterprises were staring to use this more and more even prior to the VMware sale. It's definitely the spiritual successor of traditional VMware usage in the data center. A bit less full of themselves, for now at least, than VMware ever managed to keep themselves (IMO).</p><p>- Proxmox: Has a bit of a habit of feeling like it always ends up a little broken by the time you've used an install/cluster for 6 months, but is by far the best option for the homelabber type use case (even ignoring that it's free as a reason). It's basically like someone configured KVM with what you want to be able to just (try to) use it without thinking about what's underneath, while still having access to the underneath to un-stick it in certain situations. Also does host-native containers! I never did have the guts to pitch my company try to run anything production on a cluster, but they do have reasonably priced support plans and advanced feature tiers for that.</p><p>- Parallels: Kind of sucks for the price, but there isn't anything else on macOS with the same GPU acceleration for Windows.</p><p>- Hyper-V: I think this is mostly still around because it helps Microsoft stay sticky at companies when the yearly renewal comes up. That said, it's alright - and it's also integrated into Windows in some pretty nifty ways for local use these days.</p><p>- UTM: Fantastic QEMU client for macOS, worth giving a few bucks for even though it's free.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45636581"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45636581" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45636581&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45635940"></a></center></td><td><br>

<h2>Doing well in your courses</h2>
<p>a guide by Andrej Karpathy</p>
<br>

<div><p>Here is some advice I would give to younger students if they wish to do well in their undergraduate courses.</p><p>
  
  Having been tested for many years of my life (with pretty good results), here are some rules of thumb that I feel helped me:</p></div>

<div>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<p>
  <strong>All-nighters are not worth it. <br>
  </strong>Sleep does wonders. Optimal sleep time for me is around 7.5 hours, with an absolute minimum of around 4hrs.<br>
  It has happened to me several times that I was stuck on some problem for an hour in the night, but was able to solve it in 5 minutes in the morning. I feel like the brain "commits" a lot of shaky short-term memories to stable long-term memories during the night. I try to start studying for any big tests well in advance (several days), even if for short periods of time, to maximize the number of nights that my brain gets for the material.
</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Attend tutorials or review sessions</strong>.<br>
  Even if they are bad. The fact that they get you to think about the material is what counts. If its too boring, you can always work on something else. Remember that you can also try to attend a different tutorial with a different TA.</p></div>

<div>
<h2>TESTS: PREPARATION</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Considering the big picture and organisation is the key.</strong> <br>
  Create schedule of study, even if you dont stick to it. For me this usually involves getting an idea of everything I need to know and explicitly writing it down in terms of bullet points. Consider all points carefully and think about how long it will take you to get them down. If you don't do this, there is a tendency to spend too much time on beginning of material and then skim through the (most important) later material due to lack of time.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always try to look at previous tests BEFORE starting to study</strong>.<br>
Especially if the past tests were written by the same professor. This will give you strong hints about how you should study. Every professor has a different evaluation style. Don't actually attempt to complete the questions in the beginning, but take careful note of the type of questions.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content.<br>
</strong>Even I often make this mistake still: You read a formula/derivation/proof in the book and it makes perfect sense. Now close the book and try to write it down. You will find that this process is completely different and it will amaze you that many times you won't actually be able to do this! Somehow the two things use different parts of the memory. Make it a point to make sure that you can actually write down the most important bits, and that you can re-derive them at will. Feynman famously <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand">knew this</a> very well.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always try to collaborate with others, but near the end. <br>
  </strong>Study alone first because in the early stages of studying others can only serve as a distraction. But near the end get together with others: they will often point out important pitfalls, bring up good issues, and sometimes give you an opportunity to teach. Which brings me to:</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Don't only hang out only with stronger students</strong>.<br>
  Weaker students will have you explain things to them and you will find that teaching the material helps A LOT with understanding.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Go to the prof before final exam at least once for office hours.</strong> <br>
  Even if you have no questions (make something up!) Profs will sometimes be willing to say more about a test in 1on1 basis (things they would not disclose in front of the entire class). Don't  expect it, but when this does happen, it helps a lot. Does this give you an unfair advantage over other students? Sometimes. It's a little shady :)<br>
But in general it is a good idea to let the prof get to know you at least a little.</p>
<div><p><strong><br>
  Study well in advance.</strong> <br>
   Did I mention this already? Maybe I should stress it again. The brain really needs time to absorb material. Things that looked hard become easier with time. <br>
   You want to alocate ~3 days for midterms, ~6 days for exams.</p><p>
  
  <strong><br>
  If things are going badly and you get too tired, in emergency situations, jug an energy drink.</strong><br>
  They work. It's just chemistry.</p></div>
<p><strong><br>
  For things like math: Exercise &gt; Reading.</strong><br>
  It is good to study to the point where you are reasonably ready to start the exercises, but then fill in the gaps through doing exercises, especially if you have many available to you. The exercises will also make you go back and read things you don't know.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Make yourself cheat sheet.</strong> <br>
  Even if you're not allowed to bring it to the exam. Writing things down helps. What you want is to cram the entire course on 1 or more pages that you can in the end tile in front of you and say with high degree of confidence "This is exactly everything I must know"</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Study in places where other people study as well, even if not the same thing.</strong> <br>
  This makes you feel bad when you are the one not studying. It works for me :)<br>
  Places with a lot of background noise are bad and have a research-supported negative impact on learning. Libraries and Reading rooms work best.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>TESTS: ON DAY OF</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Optimal eating/drinking habit is: T-2 hours get coffee and food.</strong><br>
  For me, Coffee or Food RIGHT before the test is ALWAYS bad<br>
  Coffee right before any potentially stressful situation is ALWAYS bad.<br>
  No coffee at all is bad.<br>
  I realize the coffee bit may be subjective to me, but its something to think about for yourself.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Study very intensely RIGHT before the test.</strong> <br>
   I see many people give up before the test and claim to "take a break". Short term memory is a wonderful thing, don't waste it! Study as intensely as possible right before the test. If you really feel you must take a break, take it about an hour before the test, but make sure you study really hard 30-45 minutes before the test.<br>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>DURING THE TEST</h2>
<p>
  <strong> Always use pencil for tests</strong>.
  <br>
  You want to be able to erase your garbage "solutions"</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Look over all questions very briefly before start.</strong> <br>
A mere 1-3 second glance per question is good enough. Just absorb all key words, and get idea of the size of the entire test.</p>
<p><strong> <br>
  On test, do easy questions first.</strong> <br>
  Do not allow yourself to get stuck on something too long. Come back to it later. I skip questions all the time... Sometimes I can complete as little as 30% of the test on my first pass. Some questions somehow become much easier once you're "warmed up", I can't explain it.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always try to be neat on the test.</strong> <br>
  Surprisingly few people actually realize this obvious fact: A human being will mark your test. A sad human being gives low marks. I suspected this as undergrad student and confirmed it strongly when I was TAing and actually marking. </p>
<p><strong><br>
  Always BOX IN/CIRCLE the answer</strong><br>
  Especially when there is derivation around it. This allows the marker to give you a quick check mark for full marks and move on. Get in the mindset of a marker.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  NEVER. EVER. EVER. Leave test early. </strong><br>
  You made a silly mistake (I guarantee it), find it and fix it. If you can't find it, try harder until time runs out. If you are VERY certain of no mistakes, work on making test more legible and easier to mark. Erase garbage, box in answers, add steps to proofs, etc.<br>
  I have no other way of putting this-- people who leave tests early are stupid. This is a clear example of a situation where potential benefits completely outweigh the cost.
  <br>
  </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Communicate with the marker.</strong> <br>
  Show the marker that you know more than what you put down. Ok you can't do a particular step, but make it clear that you know how to proceed if you did. Don't be afraid to leave notes when necessary. Believe it or not the markers often end up trying to find you more marks-- make it easy for them.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  Consider number of points per question.</strong><br>
  Many tests will tell you how many marks every question is worth. This can give you very strong hints when you are doing something wrong. It also gives you strong hints at what questions you should be working on. It is, of course, silly to spend too much time on questions worth little marks that are still relatively hard for you.</p>
<p><strong><br>
  If there are &lt;5 minutes left and you are still stuck on some question, STOP.</strong> <br>
  Your time is better spent re-reading all questions and making absolutely sure you did not miss any secondary<br>
  questions, and that you answered everything. You wouldn't believe how many silly marks people lose this way.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Congratulations if you got all the way here! Now that you are here, here's my last (very important advice). It is something that I wish someone had told me when I was an undergraduate.</p>

<p>Undergrads tend to have tunnel vision about their classes. They want to get good grades, etc. The crucial fact to realize is that noone will care about your grades, unless they are bad. For example, I always used to say that the smartest student will get 85% in all of his courses. This way, you end up with somewhere around 4.0 score, but you did not over-study, and you did not under-study.</p>

<p>Your time is a precious, limited resource. Get to a point where you don't screw up on a test and then switch your attention to much more important endeavors. What are they?
</p>

<p>Getting actual, real-world experience, working on real code base, projects or problems outside of silly course exercises is extremely imporant. Professors/People who know you and can write you a good reference letter saying that you have initiative, passion and drive are extremely important. Are you thinking of applying to jobs? Get a summer internship. Are you thinking of pursuing graduate school? Get research experience! Sign up for whatever programs your school offers. Or reach out to a professor/graduate student asking to get involved on a research project you like. This might work if they think you're driven and motivated enough. Do not underestimate the importance of this: A well-known professor who writes in their recommendation letter that you are driven, motivated and independent thinker completely dwarfs anything else, especially petty things like grades. It also helps a lot if you squeeze in at least one paper before you apply. Also, you should be aware that the biggest pet peeve from their side are over-excited undergrad students who sign up for a project, meet a few times, ask many questions, and then suddenly give up and disappear after all that time investment from the graduate student's or professor's side. Do not be this person (it damages your reputation) and do not give any indication that you might be.</p>

<p>Other than research projects, get involved with some group of people on side projects or better, start your own from scratch. Contribute to Open Source, make/improve a library. Get out there and create (or help create) something cool. Document it well. Blog about it. These are the things people will care about a few years down the road. Your grades? They are an annoyance you have to deal with along the way. Use your time well and good luck.</p>

                                        <p>PARIS (AP) — In a minutes-long strike Sunday inside the world’s most-visited museum, thieves rode a basket lift up the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/video/police-outside-the-louvre-museum-after-theft-8abcc540ef4640789c03ae9e54f7e6a0">Louvre</a></span> ’s facade, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said. </p><p>The daylight heist about 30 minutes after opening, with visitors already inside, was among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory and comes as staff complained that crowding and thin staffing are straining security.</p><p>The theft unfolded just 250 meters (270 yards) from <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mona-lisa-paint-recipe-leonardo-louvre-2b82601ad75f8514754966d74e95a211">the Mona Lisa</a></span>, in what Culture Minister Rachida Dati described as a professional “four-minute operation.” </p><p>One object, the emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum, French authorities said. It was reportedly recovered broken.</p><p>Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine. No one was hurt. </p><p>Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone, since removed — the thieves’ entry point and, observers said, a striking vulnerability for a palace museum.</p>
    
    
    
<h2>A museum already under strain</h2><p>Around 9:30 a.m., several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the glass display cases, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift via the riverfront facade, where construction is underway, to reach the hall with the 23-item royal collection.</p><p>Their target was the gilded Apollon Gallery — where the Crown Diamonds are displayed, including the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia. </p><p>The thieves smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes, Nunez said. Alarms brought Louvre agents to the room, forcing the intruders to bolt, but the theft was already done.</p>
    
<p>Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a reliquary brooch; Empress Eugénie’s diadem; and her large corsage-bow brooch — a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.</p><p>“It’s a major robbery,” Nunez said, noting that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years and would be reinforced further as part of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/paris-louvre-museum-renovation-64c83759247406323def9e54bb4890c9">the museum’s upcoming overhaul plan</a></span>. Officials said security upgrades include new-generation cameras, perimeter detection, and a new security control room. But critics say the measures come far too late.</p><p>The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday for the forensic investigation to begin as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine. </p><p>Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre with visitors present ranks among Europe’s most audacious in recent history, and at least since <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/dresden-berlin-0ba8c0a7adf4719aaecd64753c000a51">Dresden’s Green Vault museum in 2019</a></span>. </p>
    
<p>It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/louvre-museum-paris-closed-lines-delay-2bbf9be4f49de739fd14dd4d908e4d72">June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing</a></span>. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.</p><p>Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa sits behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case — but Sunday’s theft also underscored that protections are not uniformly as robust across the museum’s more than 33,000 objects.</p><p>The theft is a fresh embarrassment for a museum already under scrutiny.</p><p>“How can they ride a lift to a window and take jewels in the middle of the day?” said Magali Cunel, a French teacher from near Lyon. “It’s just unbelievable that a museum this famous can have such obvious security gaps.”</p><p>The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at her world-famous smile, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass.</p>
    
<p>Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo’s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi’s carved laws; Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa. The objects — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe’s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.</p>
    
<h2>Politics at the door</h2><p>The heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament. </p><p>“The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,” Bardella wrote on X. “This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?” </p><p>The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long “Louvre New Renaissance” plan — about €700 million ($760 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.</p><h2>What we know — and don’t</h2><p>Forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of “inestimable” historical value. </p><p>Recovery may prove difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,” said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. “Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.”</p><p>Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter. French authorities did not immediately comment on this.</p><p>Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It seems like Microsoft has encountered a significant issue with the latest <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341976/microsoft-breaks-localhost-with-windows-11-october-update-users-forced-to-revert" target="_blank">Windows 11 25H2 October update, KB5066835</a>. The company confirmed that this update disrupts mouse and keyboard functionality within the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), making them unresponsive and unusable. As a result, the WinRE feature is completely inoperative. WinRE is a built-in troubleshooting toolkit included with Windows. It's intended to assist users when their computer encounters startup problems or system issues. WinRE activates automatically when Windows crashes or fails to boot properly, but users can also access it manually to utilize various repair tools.</p><p>

However, with the current problem affecting keyboard and mouse input, WinRE is essentially ineffective. Microsoft stated that "the USB keyboard and mouse continue to work normally within the Windows operating system," and assured users that they are "working to release a solution to resolve this issue in the coming days. More information will be provided when it is available." This is yet another incident related to the recent Windows 11 updates, which have previously caused localhost issues. The list of Windows 11 problems continues to grow as the latest updates are released. Microsoft maintains a Windows 11 version 25H2 known issues and notifications <a rel="nofollow" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-25H2" target="_blank">website</a> that provides status updates on the latest problems, including this one.</p><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/eVE26AT7I8nb5Xs0.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1024" data-height="768" data-fancybox="g342032"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/eVE26AT7I8nb5Xs0_thm.jpg" width="173" height="130" alt=""></a> <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/JFGDRMELQOYGydHH.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1024" data-height="768" data-fancybox="g342032"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/JFGDRMELQOYGydHH_thm.jpg" width="173" height="130" alt=""></a> </p><p>Early last week, Microsoft <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341832/microsoft-breaks-windows-media-creation-tool-ahead-of-windows-10-eol" target="_blank">accidentally broke</a> the Windows Media Creation Tool (MCT) just a day ahead of Windows 10's end-of-life. Additionally, the company began requiring <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341656/microsoft-blocks-online-account-bypass-on-windows-11" target="_blank">Online Accounts for Windows 11 installations</a>, making them increasingly difficult to bypass. Every previously reported issue has been addressed or resolved, except for the broken localhost functionality and now this WinRE problem. Without keyboard and mouse input, users are unable to initiate any recovery processes to resolve OS issues. Until Microsoft releases a patch, we must wait and hope that the OS remains stable without needing any intervention.</p></div></div>]]></description>

It’s one of those inventions that conquered the world by blending into it. Billions are used every day, yet few people ever stop to think about how they work.</p><p>Now, after a hundred years of stasis, YKK, the Japanese company that makes roughly half the world’s <a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">zippers</a>, has decided it’s time to rethink the mechanism that holds much of modern <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/fashion/">clothing</a> together. Their new <a data-offer-url="https://ykkdigitalshowroom.com/en/item/143/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ykkdigitalshowroom.com/en/item/143/&quot;}" href="https://ykkdigitalshowroom.com/en/item/143/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AiryString zipper</a> looks ordinary at first glance. Then you realize what’s missing: there’s no tape.</p><p>That absence transforms everything. Without the woven fabric that normally flanks the teeth, the AiryString is lighter, sleeker, and far more flexible. It’s a small but important redesign that feels almost futuristic in its simplicity, a fastening system that sinks into a garment instead of sitting on top of it.</p><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="YKK probably makes the zippers on the clothes you're wearing right now.

The idea grew out of a collaboration with JUKI Corporation, a leader in industrial sewing machines. Together, the two companies reconsidered how a zipper could be made and how it could merge more seamlessly with fabric. The partnership began in 2017 and made its public debut at the JIAM 2022 Osaka trade show—a detail that hints at how long YKK plays the long game.</p><p>If <a data-offer-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK&quot;}" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YKK" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YKK’s name</a> doesn’t ring a bell, check the pull tab on your jackets or pants, because you probably already wear their work. In 2023, the company had more than $6 billion in revenue. Founded in Japan in 1934, the company makes zippers for everyone from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-wants-you-to-do-space-in-style-with-the-prada-axiom-spacesuit/">Prada</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-puffer-jackets/">Arc’teryx</a> to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/patagonia-sustainable-clothing/">Patagonia</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/the-north-face-base-camp-duffel-bag/">The North Face</a>.</p><p>Its dominance comes from an unusual level of control: YKK manufactures its own machines, designs its own molds, and even spins its own thread. That self-sufficiency lets it experiment in ways competitors can’t, turning a mundane component into a field for continuous innovation.</p><h2>Reinventing an Everyday Mechanism</h2><p>The zipper, as we know it, hasn’t had a real overhaul since the 1910s. Its long reign owes much to reliability—it’s sturdy, inexpensive, and easy to sew. For most of the 20th century, that was enough. But materials have evolved. Designers now work with featherlight nylons, stretch fabrics, and technical blends that behave more like skin than cloth. The old zipper, with its woven borders and stiff seams, has started to feel out of sync with what surrounds it.</p><p>“There has been a growing demand from the market for lighter and more flexible garments,” Nishizaki says. “And similar expectations have extended to zippers.” However, removing the tape introduced a host of engineering problems. Those strips of fabric give a zipper its structure and provide the surface tailors sew through. Without them, YKK had to rethink every step of production.</p><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="The North Face has selected YKK's new AiryString zipper system for its new Summit Series Advanced Mountain Kit." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_120,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_240,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_320,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_640,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_960,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_1280,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_1600,c_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2722e88e482d8587d0192/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TNF_FW25_AMK_Hillton_ALT_FL_B.jpg"></picture></span></p><p><span><p>The North Face has selected YKK's new AiryString zipper system for its new Summit Series Advanced Mountain Kit.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of North Face</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The teeth were redesigned, the manufacturing process rewritten, and new machinery developed to attach the closure to garments. “The absence of the tape posed various production challenges,” Nishizaki says. “We had to develop new manufacturing equipment and a dedicated sewing machine for integration.” The result: a lighter, more flexible system that reduces material use and environmental impact compared with a standard Vislon zipper.</p><p>Early adopters are already experimenting. <a data-offer-url="https://www.descente.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.descente.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.descente.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Descente Japan</a>, known for technical sportswear, was among the first to prototype AiryString in 2022. The North Face has selected the system for use in its new <a data-offer-url="https://www.thenorthface.com/en-gb/summit-series?gender=men" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenorthface.com/en-gb/summit-series?gender=men&quot;}" href="https://www.thenorthface.com/en-gb/summit-series?gender=men" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Summit Series</a> Advanced Mountain Kit. Smaller brands like <a data-offer-url="https://earthletica.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://earthletica.com/&quot;}" href="https://earthletica.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Earthletica</a>, an eco-conscious swim and performance label, have also tested it, describing the zipper as “soft, flexible, and almost silent.”</p><p>The effect is apparently tactile. Garments move more naturally, lie flatter against the body, and feel less mechanical. “We repeatedly conduct durability and strength tests by sewing AiryString <em>and</em> conventional zippers into various fabrics,” Nishizaki says. “In terms of usability, AiryString offers much smoother operability.” That translates to a softer, slicker glide—the satisfying pull that separates a well-made jacket from a cheap one.</p><h2>Little Parts, Big Change</h2><p>On the factory floor, the benefits add up, too. Traditional zippers consume extra fabric and dye and require multiple sewing passes. By removing the tape, YKK says it trims both material and labor. “It contributes to reducing work in customers’ sewing processes,” Nishizaki says. “It also reduces fiber use and water consumption in the dyeing process, lowering CO₂ emissions.”</p><p>The math adds up fast. YKK offers a 100 percent recycled-material version of AiryString and claims measurable cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. The impact is magnified by scale: The company operates in 71 countries and regions, and its trademark is registered in 177. When you make <em>billions</em> of zippers a year, these small efficiencies ripple globally.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="Tape takeaway YKK's new zipper design completely removes the fabric strip on either side of the teeth making the..." loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_120,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_240,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_320,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_640,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_960,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_1280,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_1600,c_limit/AiryString%C2%AE%20zipper2.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/68f2711a0c81d4d8fb44c34f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AiryString%25C2%25AE%2520zipper2.jpg"></picture></span></p><p><span><p>Tape takeaway: YKK's new zipper design completely removes the fabric strip on either side of the teeth, making the AiryString lighter, sleeker, and far more flexible.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of AiryString</span></p></figure><p>That incremental progress mirrors YKK’s founding philosophy, the “Cycle of Goodness.” The principle—that no one prospers without benefiting others—has supposedly guided the company for decades. It’s visible in its other micro-improvements: corrosion-resistant alloys, sound-dampened sliders, recyclable polyester tapes. AiryString continues that tradition, shrinking the zipper’s physical and environmental footprint at once.</p><p>Adoption, though, will take time. AiryString can fit into existing workflows, but to unlock its full potential, factories will apparently need specialized sewing equipment. That limits early use to design-led and performance-oriented brands, such as The North Face, willing to retool. Once those experiments prove successful, the technology could spread quickly, especially in an industry where efficiency drives everything from pricing to sustainability.</p><p>When asked what zippers might look like in 50 years, Nishizaki doesn’t talk about smart fabrics or AI-assisted closures. He returns to YKK’s mantra: “Little parts. Big difference.” AiryString embodies that principle. It’s not a flashy reinvention, it's a recalibration. A century-old mechanism made lighter, cleaner, and almost invisible. In a world addicted to louder, faster innovation, YKK’s breakthrough succeeds by subtracting rather than adding.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>Earlier this month, the Trump administration made nine elite universities <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/trump-offers-universities-a-choice-comply-for-preferential-funding/">an offer they couldn’t refuse</a>: bring in more conservatives while shutting down “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas,” give up control of admissions and hiring decisions, agree to “biological” definitions of sex and gender, don’t raise tuition for five years, clamp down on student protests, and stay institutionally “neutral” on current events. Do this and you won’t be cut off from “federal benefits,” which could include research funding, student loans, federal contracts, and even student and faculty immigration visas. Instead, you may gain “substantial and meaningful federal grants.”</p>
<p>But the universities <em>are</em> refusing. With the initial deadline of October 20 approaching, four of the nine universities—the <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/announcements/update-penns-response-compact-academic-excellence">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5557914-brown-university-rejects-trump-compact/">Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-16/usc-rejects-trump-education-compact">University of Southern California</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/mit-rejects-white-house-compact.html">MIT</a>—that received the federal “compact” have announced that they will not sign it.</p>
<p>In addition, the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, today <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Statement-Trump-Administration-Compact.aspx">issued a statement</a> calling for the compact to be completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>The compact would “impose unprecedented litmus tests on colleges and universities as a condition for receiving ill-defined ‘federal benefits’ related to funding and grants,” the statement says, and goes on to add that “it offers nothing less than government control of a university’s basic and necessary freedoms—the freedoms to decide who we teach, what we teach, and who teaches… The compact is just the kind of excessive federal overreach and regulation, to the detriment of state and local input and control, that this administration says it is against.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Think about it for a second: could the internet exist without standards and protocols? Of course not! Computers need shared rules and agreements to communicate with one another. Even human languages, like English, work much the same way. They function as a kind of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">communication protocol</a> because we’ve all agreed on words and grammar that carry shared meaning. In both cases, whether among machines or people, communication depends on common understanding.</p><p>This is where <strong>RFCs</strong> come in. They’re the blueprints and proposals that define how the internet operates and how systems interact. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at <strong>RFCs</strong> and uncover some of the fascinating history behind the internet.</p><p>Before we dive in, here’s a quick overview: RFCs, or <em>Requests for Comments</em>, are <strong>official documents that explain how Internet technologies work</strong>. They outline how systems are expected to behave and interact. Think of them as the reference guides for anyone who wants to build, understand, or improve the Internet.</p><h2 id="the-birth-of-the-internet"><span>the Birth of the Internet</span><a href="#the-birth-of-the-internet"><i></i></a></h2><p>The history of the internet is a long and amazing tale — one that deserves its own post (and I’ll probably write about it). But for now, let’s focus on how it all began.</p><p>I’m not going to answer “Who invented the Internet?” because that’s the wrong question. The internet didn’t appear overnight; it took decades to mature. Instead, we can highlight the people who played key roles in shaping today’s internet.</p><p>It all started in the USA in 1958, when the government created the <strong>Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)</strong> to fund research in new technologies — partly driven by <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Cold War</a> tensions. The US government was worried that a nuclear first strike from the Soviets could wipe out their communication. To prevent that, they established computer research centers at leading universities. The goal was to create a <strong>reliable, distributed communication system</strong> that could continue operating even if parts of it were damaged by a nuclear attack.</p><p>Computers — or better to say, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">mainframes</a> back in those days — were gigantic and could fill an entire room. Here’s what an IBM 7090 mainframe looked like in the early 60s:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/60s-mainframe.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/60s-mainframe.webp" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090" width="550" loading="lazy"></a> <em><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_J._Corbat%C3%B3" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Fernando Corbató</a> with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p><p>Back then, transferring data was nothing like the internet file uploads we know today. First, everything was physical: <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">punch cards</a> or paper tapes had to be loaded manually into machines. Then came <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-tape_data_storage" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic tapes</a> (big reels of tape containing data) which you’d physically transport to other machines:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/mainframe-data-storage.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/mainframe-data-storage.webp" alt="Set of punch cards + punched paper tape + magnetic tape" width="520" loading="lazy"></a> <em>Set of punch cards + punched paper tape + magnetic tape</em></p><p>Since these computers were geographically separated, they needed a way to <strong>connect and exchange information reliably and fast</strong>. The solution was to develop a <strong>packet-switching network</strong>, which could send data in small blocks called “packets” that could travel independently across the network and be reassembled at their destination. This system eventually became the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">ARPANET</a>, the first network to implement packet switching, laying the foundation for the modern internet.</p><p>In fact, the first use of the term <em>protocol</em> in a modern data communication context appeared in April 1967, in a memorandum titled <strong>“A Protocol for Use in the NPL Data Communications Network”</strong>. It was written under the direction of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Davies</a>, who pioneered the concept of packet switching.</p><p>In 1969, the first message was sent over ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford university. They tried to send the word <code>LOGIN</code>, but only <code>LO</code> made it through before the system crashed. About an hour later, after recovering from the crash, the full message was successfully transmitted.</p><p>by 1970, there were around 15 nodes (or computers), and by 1972, 19 nodes were connected. In 1973 they even created a map of ARPANET — the same one you see in the post preview image. ARPANET was considered a major success because it showed that packet-switching technology worked in practice and made it possible for distant computers to share information reliably. However, access was still limited to universities and research organizations that held contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.</p><p>As you can see, the network was growing rapidly and that didn’t happen by chance. It was the result of coordination and collaboration. Every node and computer had to follow the same rules and standards to communicate effectively.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the foundations laid by ARPANET and early networking experiments made it possible for something revolutionary: in 1989, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Berners-Lee</a> proposed the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, which went public in 1991, opening the internet to everyone.</p><p>We’ll pause the story of the internet here, having covered the key parts. If you’re interested to know more, you can check out this infographic:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/history-of-the-internet-infographic.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/history-of-the-internet-infographic.webp" alt="Internet History Timeline Infographic from Behance" width="400" loading="lazy"></a> <em>Internet History Timeline (Infographic from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/6310935/History-of-the-Internet-Infographic">Behance</a>)</em></p><p>Now it’s time to explore the technical documents that shape and standardize Internet operations.</p><h2 id="what-are-rfcs"><span>What Are RFCs?</span><a href="#what-are-rfcs"><i></i></a></h2><p><strong>Request for Comments (RFCs)</strong> are a series of numbered documents that describe how the internet works and how different systems communicate. They address a variety of topics, including core standards, communication protocols, guidelines, design ideas, and concepts that help keep the global network running smoothly. Each RFC is written by engineers and computer scientists as a memorandum presenting new ideas, research findings, proposed methods, or other concepts related to internet technologies.</p><p>The RFC system was created in 1969 by <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Crocker</a> to record and share informal notes on the development of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">ARPANET</a>. The goal was to help researchers share ideas about how the network should operate, how computers (hosts) should communicate, and how software running on these hosts should behave.</p><p>The very first RFC, titled <strong>“Host Software”</strong>, was published by Crocker himself on <strong>April 7, 1969</strong>. In this context, “host software” referred to the programs and protocols that computers needed to communicate over ARPANET, essentially the foundational rules for networked computing at the time:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc0001.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc0001.webp" alt="RFC 1: The first Request for Comments document published in 1969" width="400" loading="lazy"></a> <em>RFC 1: The first Request for Comments document published in 1969</em></p><p>Every RFC is assigned a unique number upon publication — starting with RFC 1 — and these numbers are permanent. Once a document receives its number, it never changes or gets reused, even if that RFC later becomes obsolete or is replaced by a newer one. This numbering system helps maintain a consistent historical record of the internet’s evolution and ensures that every RFC can be precisely referenced.</p><p>Today, RFCs are maintained and published by the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>, which continues to develop and expand them. While many RFCs are experimental in nature and never become official standards, others have become the backbone of the Internet’s architecture. These include the core technologies we rely on every day, such as <strong>TCP/IP</strong>, <strong>HTTP</strong>, and <strong>DNS</strong>. RFCs not only define how these protocols operate but also reveal the reasoning behind their design, helping us understand how the global network actually operates.</p><p>RFCs are often described as the blueprints of the internet. Yet, in an age where artificial intelligence and higher-level tools make technology more accessible, fewer people explore the underlying systems and details of how things actually work (at least, that’s my perspective). I believe RFCs are essential reading for anyone involved in technology or IT — that’s why I wrote this post.</p><h2 id="why-they-still-matter-today"><span>Why They Still Matter Today?</span><a href="#why-they-still-matter-today"><i></i></a></h2><p>RFCs remain the <strong>official source of truth</strong> for Internet standards, ensuring consistency across the global network. By studying them, developers learn not just the rules, but also <em>why</em> they exist, gaining the knowledge needed to build software and systems that communicate reliably with other computers.</p><p>You can’t create something truly dependable without understanding its foundations — just as you couldn’t design a beautiful building without knowing architecture, the same principle applies to apps and networked systems.</p><p>For instance, if you ever wanted to <strong>build your own DNS server</strong>, the first step isn’t writing code from scratch or copying an online tutorial. You’d start by reading relevant RFCs, which define the domain name system and how queries and responses should work. By understanding the protocol from the original source, you can ensure your implementation is reliable, interoperable, and standards-compliant. This is the power of RFCs: they let you build on solid foundations rather than reinventing the wheel.</p><h2 id="finding-and-reading-them"><span>Finding and Reading Them</span><a href="#finding-and-reading-them"><i></i></a></h2><p>The official source for RFCs is the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC Editor</a>, which manages the publication, editing, and archiving of all RFC documents. If you want to explore the development process behind RFCs — including drafts, authors, and approval stages — the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">IETF Datatracker</a> provides detailed information on every document’s history and current status. Also, for a more comfortable reading experience, <a href="https://www.rfcreader.com/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC Reader</a> offers an online viewer with features like an automatic table of contents, note-taking, and search capabilities.</p><p>For guidance on how to read RFCs, the IETF provides a helpful article titled <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/how-read-rfc/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">“How to Read an RFC”</a>. I strongly recommend reading it. The article explains how to search for the right documents, understand the structure of RFCs, and identify the most relevant information on the first page.</p><p>Some RFCs are <em>informational</em> or <em>experimental</em>, so you should be careful about which ones you read. For example, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1149.html" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 1149</a> literally describes a method for transmitting IP packets using pigeons! Its humorous follow-up, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2549.html" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 2549</a>, improves on the idea. You can think of it like something out of a Harry Potter movie — sending messages via birds — but applied, jokingly, to the Internet:</p><p><a href="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc-1149.webp"><img src="https://ackreq.github.io/assets/media/posts/what-are-rfcs/rfc-1149.webp" alt="RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers" width="500" loading="lazy"></a> <em>RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers</em></p><p>Also, RFCs are archival documents, which means they cannot be updated once published. As a result, older RFCs may be obsolete or superseded by newer versions, and it’s important to ensure you are reading the correct, up-to-date document. The IETF article linked above explains how to identify the most relevant RFCs and determine which ones are current.</p><p>You can also check the references at the end of a Wikipedia article on a given topic, where several related RFCs are often listed for further reading.</p><p>When reading these documents, you might come across words like <strong>“MUST”</strong>, <strong>“MUST NOT”</strong>, <strong>“REQUIRED”</strong>, <strong>“SHALL”</strong>, <strong>“SHALL NOT”</strong>, <strong>“SHOULD”</strong>, <strong>“SHOULD NOT”</strong>, <strong>“RECOMMENDED”</strong>, <strong>“MAY”</strong>, and <strong>“OPTIONAL”</strong>. These are not just casual suggestions — they have <strong>precise and standardized meanings</strong> in the context of RFCs. These terms are defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 2119</a>, which provides guidance for specifying requirement levels in technical documents. Here’s a quick summary of what they mean:</p><ul><li><strong>MUST / MUST NOT / REQUIRED / SHALL / SHALL NOT</strong> – Indicates an <strong>absolute requirement</strong>; the behavior described is mandatory.</li><li><strong>SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / RECOMMENDED</strong> – Indicates a <strong>strong recommendation</strong>, but there may be valid reasons to deviate.</li><li><strong>MAY / OPTIONAL</strong> – Indicates a <strong>truly optional</strong> behavior; implementers have complete discretion.</li></ul><p>Understanding these words is crucial because RFCs use them to <strong>clearly communicate which rules are mandatory and which are flexible</strong>, ensuring interoperability and consistency across the Internet. If you plan to implement protocols, <strong>don’t skim RFCs or read them selectively</strong>. It’s easy to misinterpret a specification if you only look at part of it. You should read not just the sections that seem directly relevant to what you’re working on, but also any referenced material, to fully understand its requirements.</p><h2 id="final-words"><span>Final Words</span><a href="#final-words"><i></i></a></h2><p>The early developers built much of the technology we rely on today <strong>without the Internet or Stack Overflow</strong>, relying purely on their skill, curiosity, and persistence. It’s easy to copy and paste something that works — but doing so only makes you one of many. The ones who <strong>truly understand</strong> are those who push limits and create what has never existed before.</p><p>Every protocol, every standard, every “MUST” or “SHOULD” is part of a story crafted by engineers over decades. So don’t be intimidated — explore, read carefully, and let these documents guide you. And if you ever discover a better idea or approach, share it with the world — perhaps even as an RFC. Who knows? The next specification you write could help shape the Internet of tomorrow.</p><p>I’ll end this post with a quote from one of my all-time favorite animated films, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Ratatouille</a> — a reminder that mastery comes from courage and curiosity:</p><blockquote><p><em>“You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true — anyone can cook… but only the fearless can be great.”</em></p></blockquote><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9JTgpk1hXs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By the time you read this essay, no matter the hour of the day, you will likely have already made some kind of choice: coffee with skimmed milk, whole milk, cream, or black? Sugar or no sugar? Tea instead? Personalised, preference-based choice is, at present, a deeply familiar aspect of life in much of the world, though perhaps most markedly so in the United States, where I live and work. It is also something people don’t generally spend a lot of time discussing, in part because it feels so ordinary. People around the globe shop for everything from housing to vacations to, yes, caffeinated drinks. They pick what they want to read, what they want to listen to, and what they want to believe. They vote for favourite candidates for office. They select friends and lovers, fields to study, professions and jobs, places to live, even insurance plans to hedge their bets when something they cannot choose occurs.</p>
<p>Perusing a menu of options to decide what best matches individual desires and values – which is what we generally mean today by making a choice – is a key feature of modern democratic and consumer culture alike. It is also an exalted one. People may disagree about what the possibilities should be, but rarely about the principle of maximising arenas for choice-making or the options themselves. For many of the world’s citizens, this is simply what freedom feels like.</p>
<p>Yet, as you may have also felt at various moments, abundant choice isn’t always so straightforward. Behavioural economists point out that most people are actually pretty bad at making decisions of this kind (which explains the appeal of return departments and divorces for when things don’t go as hoped). Philosophers and political theorists say it promotes selfish individualism and discourages collective action around issues that affect us all. And sociologists add that societies that prize choice too much tend to blame those with only poor or limited options for their own misfortunes. So much for choice as consistently synonymous with freedom.</p>
<p>What is strange, though, is that few of these critics ever really question either the centrality or the value of choice-making in contemporary life. On the contrary, they tend to make their case as if people everywhere had always spent their days doing things that feel commonplace in capitalist democracies and, indeed, hankering for more such chances. But for the historian, it is obvious that this entire phenomenon is culturally specific. There are people around the globe even today who actively resist this framing of freedom. What may be more surprising is that granting this special status to choice-making is also a relatively recent development even in Western Europe and the United States, not to mention the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So how did we get to this point? How did choice become a proxy for freedom in so many domains in modern life? As we discover more and more about our troubles navigating it, we might also wonder if there are other, better ways to be free.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hough the explosion of choice has largely been a <span>20th-century</span> phenomenon, the full story is a long one, going all the way back to the 17th and <span>18th centuries.</span> Personal choice, as both experience and term of art, got its start in two quite distinct early modern spaces.</p>
<p>One is the realm of the shop. Fuelled by the building of colonial and interior trade networks, new goods started to enter cities and towns as early as the <span>17th century,</span> first in Western Europe, then in the New World, and gradually in their hinterlands too. Particularly significant among those goods were patterned and brightly coloured textiles called calicoes, originally from South Asia, whose price point made it possible for ordinary people to have the novel experience of selecting from among different designs for clothing or home furnishings. Checks? Flowers? Stripes? Purple or green? The decision could, distinctively, be based on nothing more than personal preference. For at the same time, a leisure-time activity blossomed, first at auctions in temporary locations and then increasingly in fixed destinations called shops, in which consumers were invited to peruse a display of the options for sale before ever opening their purses.</p>
<p>Even people with limited means started to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers</p>
<p>The English-language neologism ‘shopping’, as opposed to provisioning, took off in the second half of the <span>18th century</span> precisely to describe this newfangled business. We now also call it consumer choice. The customer learned from all of this browsing and weighing the possibilities to ‘make a choice’ – which is to say, an aesthetic as well as a practical determination en route to purchasing – from what were often already described as a set of ‘choice’, or pre-selected, goods ripe for picking.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>The post-Reformation fracturing of Christianity, combined with the Protestant tradition of ‘freedom of conscience’ or ‘religious choice’, gradually produced a sense of ideas and beliefs as being similarly up for selection in a pluralist world. With the double emergence of Enlightenment notions of tolerance in Europe and of the Great Awakening religious revival in the British colonies, even people with limited means started, on both sides of the Atlantic, to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers and churches where congregations had become voluntary communities, attending varieties of public lectures, and picking books from lending libraries and sales catalogues. These, too, were learned recreations, ones that soon revolved around secular as well as sacred notions. Consider Jane Austen’s fictional heroine in <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814) who, when she gets up the nerve to subscribe to a lending library, is, in Austen’s lightly satirical telling, ‘amazed at her own doings in every way, to be a renter, a chuser [sic] of books!’ From such actions, the stage was set for intellectual choice <span>as well.</span></p>
<p><span>B</span>etween the late 18th century and the First World War, choice continued to expand its domain, encompassing the selection of other people, from marriage partners to employees to political representatives, too. At the same time, it became subject to ever more rules and strictures, formal and not, so as both to tame its potential for undermining the social order and to make it work.</p>
<p>In the course of the 19th century, choice increasingly entered the romantic and sexual lives of urban men and women, though with significant gender distinctions when it came to the rules, creating affective and bodily choice as well. This was a development tied very much to the rise of both the idea of companionate marriage – spouses who consent to marry out of mutual affection or even attraction – <em>and </em>an elaborate etiquette about how to identify and court possible partners in a world in which everyone didn’t already know everyone else. From Santiago and Chicago to Paris and Stockholm, and from working-class ticketed dance halls to private soirées for the elite, balls, in particular, became places for organising and evaluating the options in a world in which both young men and young women had been given the power to contract freely for a spin around the dance floor – and also, potentially, for permanent coupledom in the form of a marriage (aka ‘The Choice’, though a marriage contract would technically mean the end of sexual choice once it was signed and sealed). Employment saw a similar kind of transition insofar as it, too, became increasingly a matter of sorting mechanisms, markets and contracts.</p>

<p>Finally (and surprisingly late), a similar form of choice came to politics in the form of new voting practices as well as an increase in formal laws to go with them. It is well known that the <span>19th century</span> was marked by intense debates, from Central Europe to Latin America, about <em>who</em> should be able to vote as new democratic norms spread to many parts of the world. Much less well remembered is the rise of intense discussions about how all these new voters should go about the business of suffrage, especially when it came to the moment of choice itself. Voices in favour of secret balloting, like the Sons of Liberty in New York City, had made themselves heard by the end of the 1760s. But it wasn’t until another century had passed that this mode of voting, rooted in the idea of the protection of internal personal preferences from outside pressure, became the international gold standard, instituted first in Australia in the 1850s (hence what is sometimes still called the Australian ballot) and then by a host of other nations around the globe in the decades just preceding the First World War.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists, marketing experts and economists devoted themselves, in different ways, to the <em>study</em> of choice-making</p>
<p>Even at the time, commentators were amazed that this transformation took place with so little upheaval. That may well be because the change to secret, individualised voting diminished the rowdiness and violence so often previously associated in many places with popular and considerably more communal elections. But surely it was also because, by the time this shift occurred, it seemed to bring elections into line with so many other kinds of 19th-century leisure-time activities. The secret ballot allowed for the same sorts of choice-making to be enacted when it came to candidates, though with the results eventually aggregated into group choice, as it did for other forms of picking – overcoming the longstanding objections of even liberals like John Stuart Mill, who worried that the last stronghold of public life would in this way be privatised. Only the workplace would remain largely immune. In effect, if the initial age of revolutions in the <span>18th century</span> introduced popular sovereignty based on elections in the first place, we might think of this as the moment of a second age of democratic revolution.</p>

<p>But the 20th century added its own finishing touches to the story of choice. The ranks of choosers continued to expand, albeit highly unevenly, to include women, poor people, sometimes even children, especially in places where mass goods, from newspapers to chewing gum, became widely available. So did the ranks of ‘choice agents’, the people creating the menus of options, inventing the rules, and directing the activity itself. Beyond shop owners, itinerant preachers, dancing masters and political party officials, now new kinds of social scientists came to the fore. Psychiatrists, marketing experts, economists: in different ways, they all devoted themselves to the <em>study</em> of choice-making, exploring who makes what choices under what conditions and with what effects, along with how individuals and groups could be steered to make better ones. Ordinary people participated in this work every time they sat on a couch for a therapy session or filled out a survey card or took a multiple-choice exam. Together, researchers and their everyday subjects, male and female, invented sciences of choice, further entrenching the idea of humans as, fundamentally, choosers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the rise of the internet has only expanded this model. Today, the sheer number of both choice-making opportunities and options has grown exponentially, whether we are talking about music or vacuum cleaners. The nature of our choices has also changed. Before the age of shopping for goods and selecting ideas had really gotten underway, most choices were structured around doing the right thing rather than the wrong. Since then, choice has increasingly become value-neutral, a matter of one’s own interior preferences being externalised in the act of selection. Moreover, choice has become more and more important to conceptions of human flourishing. Once, picking from menus was of relatively little significance, especially since freedom was imagined in the Western tradition well into the <span>18th century</span> more often as a matter of <em>not</em> having to make many choices or strive too much thanks to being born with the status of an independent person. Over time, however, choice became a means of achieving the liberty to shape one’s life as one saw fit. It also became a key signifier of being a full-fledged, autonomous person worthy of respect by others. Since the end of the Second World War, we might say that it has become a value unto itself, widely celebrated from billboards to international human rights decrees as the meeting point of capitalism and democracy. When then French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said, in 2016, ‘I believe deeply in a society governed by choice,’ he was in a certain sense uttering what had become a banality.</p>
<p><span>T</span>his is a story that has not been told before, even as some of the details may feel familiar from lived experience. It is also an essential story to grapple with if we want to try to understand what has been gained and lost from an investment in choice as the defining feature of ‘free time’ as well as a basic understanding of freedom. How have people, individually and collectively, benefitted from this mushrooming of options and opportunities for choice – and how and when has choice led us astray? This is a question that behavioural economists and all others who take our current actions and investments as constants have largely failed to ask.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is easy to read this narrative as a tale of liberation. Take feminism. Women in Europe and its outposts got their first real taste of the modern form of choosing as shoppers for ribbons, fabrics and other sundries, as late-18th-century novels – and especially those written by and for women – make very clear. Certainly, both women and this new kind of value-neutral, preference-based choice-making were quickly tainted by association with each other; the <em>coquette </em>was a much-mocked figure of the 18th and <span>19th</span><span><sup> </sup></span><span>centuries,</span> a stereotype of a woman who relishes her own choices a little too much and isn’t very good at them either. But as new forms of individualised selection became more important to life beyond the textile purveyor’s shop, and as men got in on the game as well, an expanded repertoire of choice, including in ideas, reading matter, marriage, children, career and finally politics, became one of the key aspirations for women looking to break free of their traditional constraints.</p>
<p>Female suffrage, for example, could be advocated at the start of the <span>20th century</span> as simply an extension of women’s already existing capacity to make a selection from a list-like menu. By the start of the 1960s, the American feminist Betty Friedan could argue that women’s full liberation required them to follow their male counterparts in seizing ‘the power to choose’ in their personal lives too, including in forging ‘an identity’ beyond housewife. And a decade later, mainstream abortion rights advocates, not surprisingly, took the same tack, imagining limited resistance to a focus on choice. Who, after all, could object? Behind the 1970s feminist idea of ‘a right to choice’ when it came to motherhood was the argument that no one should be compelled to pick this solution – abortion – for themselves; the law now simply ensured that everybody could, as needed, determine which of the possibilities on offer seemed like the best option by their own criteria. Plus, having choices meant the essential opportunity to reassert one’s standing as author of one’s own destiny – a point sometimes made by stateless people today as well. No wonder the ability to choose has become a key factor in global happiness indexes.</p>
<p>A market model for governance would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we <span>know it</span></p>
<p>But the abortion debate of the 1970s also illustrates some of the limitations of this framing. Soon after the passage of the <em>Roe v Wade </em>US Supreme Court Ruling legalising abortion in the early months of pregnancy, an emerging Right-wing coalition landed on a clever strategy for opposition, arguing that the ‘life’ of the fetus outweighed mere ‘choice’ on the part of the mother. In other words, in feminists’ enthusiasm for having choices, the moral dimension of what was being chosen had been pushed to the side, leaving behind a very thin foundation for a major policy matter. And from the Left, and especially from Black feminists, came the argument that choice itself was meaningless, an empty promise, unless it was to be accompanied by a commitment to meeting women’s basic needs, whether that meant the money necessary to travel and pay for an abortion, or greater financial and institutional support for mothers after their children were born. In this sense, they too warned of the dangers of the shopper and shopping as models for all our activities, even when couched as rights.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing some of the fallout of this debate writ large. Today, a far-Right ‘dark enlightenment’ movement imagines a market model for everything, including governance, which would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we know it. At the same time, significant pushback around the world against feminism, and now against gay and trans rights as well, has become emblematic of the rejection of a larger vision of freedom rooted in personal choice. As a result of democracy-promotion and global capitalism, almost no one in the world currently stands entirely outside the choice-as-freedom paradigm; it has gradually enveloped even those with very limited ability or opportunity to choose or with only rotten choices before them. Voting, for example, is near universal today even in places like Russia, where it is a sham. But an emphasis on choice as a form of liberation has occasioned serious resentments in different sectors and geographies, where it can seem a direct threat to other, more communal values and needs.</p>
<p>Indeed, even in democracies, choice can sometimes seem to be not only an illusion (is there any real difference between the scores of toothpastes or breakfast cereals in contemporary supermarkets?) or a headache to contend with, but a regressive force. Think, for example, of people who took up the pro-abortion rights phrase ‘My body, my choice’ to protest mask or vaccine mandates during the <span>COVID-19</span> pandemic, even as they were told that the point of both actions was to limit the spread of the disease and advance public health more broadly. Or consider how the US president Donald Trump’s current claims to be restoring the American people’s ‘freedom to choose’ in the market for cars and appliances will require gutting environmental regulations and thus advancing climate change in ways that will negatively impact all of us. It’s not just that we don’t always know our minds. It’s that choice in its current incarnation isn’t, in fact, always freeing.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? The answer is not with one or the other of these visions. But considering the history of choice should make us more self-conscious the next time we are fretting over whether to pick the oat milk rather than the half-and-half, not to mention one train ticket or candidate for office or college course over another. We might instead ask ourselves: when, collectively, should we be invested in individual choice as a good way to solve a shared problem, and when not? And when should I, as an individual, try to maximise the opportunity to make choices about my own life versus not doing so? Most of all, though – as we struggle with both choice overload and the failures of personal choice to help us solve some of our biggest problems, including the rise of forms of authoritarianism directed squarely against choice – thinking about our attachment to choosing off menus should make us wonder what other possibilities for defining freedom might be lurking out there. In the past, for example, freedom has sometimes been imagined as a release from oppression or as an act of pure imagination, alternative visions we might want to bring back into circulation. As it turns out, choice doesn’t always produce freedom, and freedom itself often looks very different.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>On a scorching Texas afternoon, some Houston neighborhoods heat up far faster than others. New research from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&amp;M University</a> shows vacant and abandoned land is a big reason why.</p>



<p>A new study led by Dr. Dingding Ren, a lecturer in the <a href="https://www.arch.tamu.edu/laup/">Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning</a>, finds that vacant lots with vegetation can help cool surrounding areas. Abandoned buildings and paved lots do the opposite, raising land surface temperatures by as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>



<p>Ren said many low-income residents run their air conditioning less to save money, leaving them even more exposed to the heat.</p>



<p>“Residents living in these vulnerable areas are more likely to suffer heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses,” Ren said. “Because of more vacant land and abandoned structures, [these neighborhoods] retain more heat during the daytime and even experience higher overall temperatures at night, because the concrete absorbs heat and releases it slowly.”</p>



<h2><strong>Drone data reveals hotspots</strong></h2>



<p>Houston ranks among the top 10 hottest cities in the U.S., and Ren set out to understand why.</p>



<p>Using more than 1,400 drone images and NASA satellite LandSat data, he mapped heat at a street-by-street level across seven sites, including residential neighborhoods, commercial strips and industrial zones. Each location had patterns of both above-average land surface temperatures and high social vulnerability, a measure for communities most at risk during disasters.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" width="472" height="406" data-id="330060" src="https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-e1759158977405-lbox-800x536-27211D-e1759623606141.png" alt="Thermal map showing heat patterns in a Houston commercial area. Hot areas appear in red and orange, cooler areas in blue and purple."><figcaption>A heat map of a commercial site reveals abandoned buildings and paved lots as major heat sources, while trees and vacant land create cooler pockets.

<figure><img decoding="async" width="461" height="398" data-id="330061" src="https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5-e1759158940487-lbox-800x536-27211D-e1759623748904.png" alt="Thermal map showing heat patterns in a Houston residential neighborhood. Hot areas appear in red and orange, cooler areas in blue and purple."><figcaption>A map of a residential site reveals how the abundance of trees and open lots helps keep the neighborhood cool and comfortable, even with some abandoned buildings. </figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>“The type of surface on vacant land matters significantly,” Ren said. “Lots with bare soil or gravel tend to have higher land surface temperatures than those covered with vegetation, though lower than heavily built-up areas.”</p>



<p>Houston alone contains roughly 45,000 acres of vacant land and 10,000 acres of abandoned buildings, according to the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even a small cluster of abandoned structures in industrial areas can raise nearby land temperature dramatically.</p>



<h2><strong>Walking into danger</strong></h2>



<p>Higher surface temperatures can make public spaces, like sidewalks and bus stops, dangerously hot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Houston is famous as an unwalkable city,” Ren said. “Low-income people are sometimes forced to walk or bike in this extreme heat with zero shading, and over time, being exposed like this every summer is not healthy.”</p>



<p>Ren shared his own experience trying to navigate Houston. “Google Maps said it was a five-minute walk from my hotel to a pharmacy, but it took me 30 minutes with no shade, no red lights and no safe place to cross,” Ren said. “That day, I even got heat stroke.”</p>



<p>Ren said heat absorbed by concrete and rooftops lingers into the night, raising risks of heat-related illness while forcing households to spend more on cooling. The city’s power grid feels the strain too, as residents rely heavily on air conditioning to stay safe.</p>



<h2><strong>Green space solutions</strong></h2>



<p>While the findings reveal serious public health risks, Ren said small-scale interventions could make a measurable difference for vulnerable residents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Low-income communities lack trees and green space,” Ren said. “Green infrastructure would really help reduce their risk and also encourage healthier, more active living.”</p>



<p>Vacant lots can also serve as a climate adaptation tool, making the outdoors safer. “If managed effectively, it can be redeveloped as green infrastructure gardens or shade areas to reduce the urban heat.”</p>



<p>Ren plans to expand the research by combining his heat data with CDC health records. He is co-authoring the paper with Jiang Zheng, a doctoral student in <a href="https://www.arch.tamu.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ph-d-in-urban-regional-sciences/">urban and regional sciences</a>, to study how heat exposure contributes to illness.</p>



<p>He hopes the findings will guide city leaders and planners in prioritizing cooling strategies for Houston’s hottest, most vulnerable neighborhoods. Ren said its lessons may extend beyond Houston, too.</p>



<p>“If the problem presents even in <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/vintage-2024-popest.html">one of the fastest-growing cities,</a> then the situation could be worse in shrinking cities,” where there may be even more vacant lots, Ren said.</p>

<p>
Inspired by <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">WTF Happened in 1971</a> I wanted to make a website detailing many charts that show something weird is happening.
</p>

<p>
Beginning around the late 2000s and accelerating through the 2010s, a series of troubling trends emerged. Measures of well-being, including happiness and life satisfaction, began to show signs of strain. Youth mental health entered a state of crisis, with rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm rising to unprecedented levels. Concurrently, metrics of cognitive performance and academic achievement, such as international test scores and measures of fluid intelligence, appeared to stagnate or decline after decades of progress. Labour productivity growth, a cornerstone of economic prosperity, slowed to a crawl.
</p>

<p>
We had many major events in that time including the Great Recession and COVID-19 that had an large impact, but my hypothesis is that the introduction of the iPhone, and thus the modern mobile age is causing a huge impact on attention and is limiting life outcomes of millions around the globe.
</p>

<p>
This is not an attempt to say these trends are monocausal - it is worth remembering that Correlation != Causation - but it is at the very minimum interesting that the charts seem to line up around 2007, and increase in magnitude of upward or downward slope as adoption of smartphones increase.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

Globally, the figures are similarly high, with one study finding that 27% of young adults aged 19 to 29 experience feelings of loneliness. When compared generationally, the contrast is stark. One report found that 80% of Generation Z individuals (born roughly 1997-2012) reported feelings of isolation over the past year, significantly higher than the 72% of Millennials and 45% of Baby Boomers who said the same

Economic productivity, specifically labour productivity (output per hour worked), is the primary driver of long-term improvements in living standards.

The Great Recession and COVID are obviously huge drivers of lost productivity, but it stands to reason that if we're sleeping less, are more depressed, and have less socially active lives, our productive output will suffer in some way.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2>Déjà Tune</h2>
<p>Most of my reading this week focused on fine-tuning, sparked by Thinking Machines Labs’ <a href="https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/announcing-tinker/">announcement of Tinker</a>. The six-month-old, already $12B-valued startup founded by OpenAI’s former CTO Mira Murati wants to bring fine-tuning back into the spotlight with a new fine-tuning-as-a-platform initiative positioned as a foundation for research collaborations with universities.</p>
<p>A few days later, Clément Delangue from Hugging Face <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clementdelangue_am-i-wrong-in-sensing-a-paradigm-shift-in-activity-7383908410167152640-rOEi/">posted</a> that he sensed a paradigm shift toward self-managed, open-source, and specialized LLM deployments, even backed by dedicated hardware like <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/">NVIDIA’s DGX Spark</a>, many conversations with founders about growing client demand, or the <a href="https://a16z.com/building-a16zs-personal-ai-workstation-with-four-nvidia-rtx-6000-pro-blackwell-max-q-gpus/">Personal AI Workstation</a>, a very clever marketing stunt from a16z (I’m jealous).</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucfU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F220237f8-8aa7-4d59-9024-6a1630e9d5e9_1600x1165.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All of this feels like a déjà vu. For a brief moment after the first wave of large language models, fine-tuning was the hottest topic in machine learning. Then, just as quickly, it disappeared from most production systems, now accounting for <a href="https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/">less than 10% of AI inference workloads</a>.</p>
<p>So, how did fine-tuning get sidelined so fast, and why do we feel it could be time for a come-back? And more importantly, what could be different this time?</p>
<h2>Attention, Please</h2>
<p>Before the Transformer breakthrough, the spark that led to the LLMs we use today, NLP relied on specialized models. Early progress came from recurrent architectures like <a href="https://aditi-mittal.medium.com/understanding-rnn-and-lstm-f7cdf6dfc14e">RNNs and LSTMs</a>, which for the first time learned directly from word sequences instead of relying on hand‑crafted linguistic features. A step forward in representations, but without any learning paradigm that would define later foundation models. Each application required to start from scratch on task-specific data.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mfeN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F446a7a1b-e964-45b7-a60d-f27e18f5adb1_551x380.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2017, Google’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a> introduced the Transformer architecture, replacing recurrence and convolution with self‑attention alone. Seven months later, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFiT</a> demonstrated that a pretrained language model (at the time still based on LSTMs) could be fine‑tuned for different tasks, and helped establish the methodological foundation that made Transformers practically useful. And a year later, models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and GPT‑1 <a href="https://ravjot03.medium.com/bert-vs-gpt-a-guide-to-two-powerful-language-models-b14502438065">applied the design in practice</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bvz0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed45b2db-a685-4654-9058-283092ae75b8_1400x831.png" alt=""></p>
<p>BERT leveraged the encoder side with bidirectional attention for understanding, while GPT used the decoder side with unilateral attention for generation, beautifully illustrated in <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/"><em>The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and Co</em></a> and <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/"><em>The Illustrated GPT-2</em></a>, two readings recommended by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdeltheil/">Cédric Deltheil</a> (<a href="https://finegrain.ai/">Finegrain</a>).</p>
<p>BERT in particular reshaped the culture of NLP: instead of building every model from scratch, researchers could “just fine-tune” a pretrained Transformer and achieve results that once required months of manual feature engineering.</p>
<p>Everything was fine until LLM madness turned into a full-blown parameter explosion, with models jumping from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters (and then some). Fine-tuning was no longer a smart idea. What had once been a few GPU-hours task quickly became a massive industrial operation and raised serious deployment challenges. This practice, called Full Fine-Tuning (FFT), meant retraining every layer and every weight. It offered precision but at a brutal cost.</p>
<p>Then, in 2021, Microsoft Research introduced LoRA (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685%5D"><em>Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</em></a>). Instead of retraining billions of parameters, LoRA freezes the original weights and adds small low-rank matrices to selected layers. Only these are trained, cutting costs by an order of magnitude while maintaining (and sometimes even improving) FFT performance. Unsurprisingly, LoRA became the default. And by 2024, thanks to <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index">Hugging Face’s PEFT library</a>, implementing it was a one-line command.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Yp0-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fea19c5-e989-40d7-84b5-bb349644520b_1456x612.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Finding The Right Tune</h2>
<p>A surface-level simplicity masking an ugly truth: fine-tuning is more than a package to deploy and maintain. The tuning itself is where the real magic happens, and it is never a one-config-fits-all process. Generally speaking, this <a href="https://symbl.ai/developers/blog/a-guide-to-llm-hyperparameters/">hyperparameter tuning</a> alone can make or break a model. The critical process feels more like alchemy than science, balancing ranks, learning rates, and alpha ratios while hoping your adapters don’t overfit or forget what the model already knows (a phenomenon called <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2403.05175v1">catastrophic forgetting</a>). And when you finally get something that works, evaluating it feels less like validation and more like divination.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rtoz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37684f0c-2a81-47d2-aa66-8320af9d527d_430x303.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Meanwhile, LLMs kept getting better at nearly every task, approaching something close to omniscience. Writing a leasing contract? A whole chapter on the Industrial Economy in Rural Britain in the nineteenth century? A movie script? A REST API or a website for your mom? By 2023, most teams realized they could achieve about 90% of fine-tuned performance through prompt engineering, thanks to larger context windows, or RAG (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation">Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a>, which gives the model access to an external knowledge base). Both approaches required no retraining and came with far less operational burden for quite decent results.</p>
<h2>Tuning Back In</h2>
<p>But why does fine-tuning seem to be gaining fans again? Maybe because the very factors that once made it irrelevant or inefficient are now, piece by piece, being solved.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GPU-as-a-service platforms such as <a href="http://together.ai/">Together.ai</a> allow you to spin up a LoRA fine-tuning pipeline with minimal friction and in many cases in minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While new models still come fast, the changes are now more evolutionary than revolutionary. That shift means tuning a model today is less likely to be totally invalidated tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open-weight ecosystems like Mistral, Llama, Falcon, Yi, and Gemma offer a lot of alternatives for organizations to own, inspect, and persist their fine-tuned variants without vendor lock-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, companies may have reached the ceiling of what can be achieved with prompting alone. Some want models that know their vocabulary, their tone, their taxonomy, and their compliance rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all those reasons, fine-tuning is slowly dipping its toes back into the spotlight, not as a trendy feature this time, but as a strategic lever for control, differentiation, and embedded intelligence.</p>
<p>Thinking Machines Lab’s Tinker, which focuses on theorem proving, chemistry reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and AI safety, embodies this shift. And they have already made several recommendations shared in their blog post <a href="https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/"><em>LoRA Without Regret</em></a>, which explores how to fine-tune more effectively.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vHdd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05bf9ca8-833f-4e2d-a11f-a6b63829a633_900x600.png" alt=""></p>
<p>They recommend applying LoRA to all linear modules, not just attention layers as in the original paper. They also emphasize the importance of LoRA rank, a hyperparameter often overlooked, and advise setting higher learning rates (at least 10x), smaller batch sizes (the opposite of common practice), and defining reward functions explicitly with mathematical or logical verification. All these recommendations are clearly explained and reproducible on <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/lora_without_regret">Hugging Face’s TRL</a>.</p>
<p>This is great for tuning, but maybe Tinker’s major contribution to fine-tuning is elsewhere.</p>
<h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>As expected, the modern fine-tuning pipeline looks nothing like what we used five years ago. It is modular, serverless, and orchestrated. A single deployment can run a base model alongside dozens of LoRA adapters, each representing a specific tone, function, or domain. During inference, the system routes queries to the right combination of adapters instead of relying on a static model file.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l1I-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78b829a9-a666-4228-b058-ddf8ad133ebe_1468x974.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Such modularity introduces its own challenges. All-in-one platforms like <a href="http://together.ai/">Together.ai</a> handle most of the heavy lifting, but they often lack the granularity many teams need for fine-grained configuration and observability, and costs at scale can escalate quickly.</p>
<p>On paper, Tinker seems to offer the best of both worlds: the comfort of a modern, fully managed fine-tuning stack combined with fine-grained control for researchers. It provides direct API <a href="https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/losses">access to low-level training primitives</a>, allowing users to orchestrate training workflows and custom algorithms at the deepest level while taking care of the grunt work. Hopefully this will inspire other platforms, since Tinker is currently reserved for research purposes.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h8Bt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5331bbd8-bf94-4772-83b9-65ef063f1245_1326x1430.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyway, as imperfect as they are, infrastructure challenges are becoming problems of the past. Yet one major difficulty remains: evaluation.</p>
<p>Models are notoriously difficult to evaluate. Human evaluation is inconsistent, slow and more importantly expensive, while benchmarks age quickly and lose relevance with data contamination. Even automated approaches such as <a href="https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/g-eval-the-definitive-guide">G-Eval</a> or <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/">Chatbot Arena</a> introduce their own problems, often amplifying bias and producing unstable scores.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Tinker, Benjamin Anderson suggested they might have part of the solution. As he wrote in “<a href="https://benanderson.work/blog/anatomy-of-finetuning-api"><em>Anatomy of a Modern Fine-Tuning API</em></a>” on his blog, “<em>It gives the user the power to do online reinforcement learning: take a completion from the current model weights, score that completion, and update the model based on whether that completion was good or bad. Supervised fine-tuning teaches the model to mimic pre-written responses, while online RL improves it by scoring its own responses.</em>” Therefore, with such architectures, the future of fine-tuning may not look like fine-tuning at all: it starts to resemble continuous learning.</p>
<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ilw9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1314b3c5-cc3e-4863-a96a-d60d478199dd_1600x603.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>A Very Different Tune</h2>
<p>“<em>Theoretically, fine-tuning has always made sense. But the speed at which closed-source labs were scaling their model intelligence made it a practically bad bet. Now, with compute, data, and better frameworks, the scales are tipping back toward specialization</em>.” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhommes/">Robert Hommes</a> from <a href="https://www.moyai.ai/">Moyai.ai</a>, a company specialized in adaptive fine-tuning.</p>
<p>And regarding the shift to self-hosting, this could go even closer to you than you might think. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/constant-razel/">Constant Razel</a> from <a href="https://withexxa.com/">Exxa</a> put it, “<em>Personal AI computers are no longer a distant idea. Technology is improving and becoming more accessible. Security and cost will likely drive early adoption, while fine-tuning will enable specialized, high-performance agents to run on them.</em>”</p>
<p>From a brute-force chase for marginal accuracy to a framework for ownership, alignment, and continuous improvement rooted in proximity and control, fine-tuning might have found a new territory to thrive. It is no longer just a technical step but perhaps a strategic layer in how intelligence will be built and owned.</p>

</p>

<p>Thanks for having me. I’m very happy to be here in Cambridge. This is my first time visiting, so I spent the afternoon Tuesday doing some sightseeing, including a lovely ride down the River Cam. I was delighted to learn yesterday that I had Simon Wardley to thank for chauffered punt rides, including the completely fictional story I was told about the mathematical bridge.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about Cambridge is its rich history. Of course, lots of history is important when you have...</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/003.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A picture of the Chronophage, a large circular clock with a grasshopper-like monster at the top.">
</p>

<p>...this monster eating up every second.</p>

<p>That’s the Chronophage outside of Corpus Christi college, if you aren’t familiar with it, and much more impressive in person than in my terrible vertical picture with window glare.</p>

</p>

<p>Before we get going, I should explain my context. You’ll hear a lot of advice at this conference, and how much that advice is relevant to you has a lot to do with how much their context matches yours.</p>

<p>I’m currently VP of Engineering at OpenSesame, and for the 23 years prior to that, I was a consultant. As VP, and as a consultant, I specialize in late-stage startups: entrepreneurial organizations that were successful enough that they were able to grow. These are companies with a product mindset that value entrepreneurial thinking, but they’re also trying to grow up and be “real companies,” and they’re trying to figure out how to do that without losing their entrepreneurial edge.</p>

<p>So that’s the context of my material: entrepreneurial companies building software products that they sell. If you’re not in that situation, I encourage you to mine my talk for ideas, but don’t try to apply it blindly. And if you <em>are</em> in that situation... well, mine my talk for ideas, and don’t try to apply it blindly!</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>A few more disclaimers. All the substantive content of this talk—the words, diagrams, examples, and so forth—were created with my actual meat brain, without any AI. Large images have been sourced from various locations, and are credited in the bottom left corner.</p>

<p>I’ve also dressed up some of the slides with decorative AI-generated images from ChatGPT 5, like that rapper holding a stop sign. If there’s one thing GenAI is good at, it’s embellishment.</p>

<p>I should also mention that, although I work for OpenSesame, I’m not speaking for OpenSesame. I created this talk on my own time, and I’m technically on vacation right now. The opinions I express are my own.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Anyway, as I was saying, one of the things I love about Cambridge is its rich history. I’m sure you’ve all heard several times by now that the university was founded back in 1209, by people fleeing <em>[waves hand dismissively]</em> the other university. In comparison, my home town of Astoria, Oregon, which is the <em>oldest permanent settlement</em> on the west coast of the US, was founded in 1811. I think that’s last Tuesday by British standards.</p>

<p>Part of the history surrounding Cambridge is this man: LP Hartley. He was born in Cambridgeshire in 1895, although he never went to Cambridge University. He went to... the other one. But, despite that choice, he went on to become a successful novelist.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/010.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A picture of the cover of the book, “The Go-Between,” by LP Hartley. The cover has a watercolor picture of a boy in the English countryside.">
</p>

<p>His most famous novel is “The Go-Between.” It begins with a wonderful opening line:</p>

<p>“The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.”</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/011.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A picture of the cover of the book, “The Past is a Foreign Country,” by David Lowenthal. The cover has a scene that could be set in the ancient middle-east with pillars of ruined structures in the background.">
</p>

<p>And that connects us back to Cambridge. The University of Cambridge Press published this book in 1985. It’s by David Lowenthal, and it created an entire sub-genre of history called Heritage Studies. It’s still in print today, in a revised edition.</p>

<p>The concept of this idea is that, although the past informs the present, the present also informs the past. Our thoughts and actions today extend from events that occurred in the past. But, at the same time, our understanding of the past is colored by our thoughts and actions today.</p>

<p>The past is a foreign country. They do things different there. But we can’t visit the past. We can’t see what they did differently. We can only <em>interpret</em> what they’ve left behind.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/012.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="Two pictures of medieval manuscripts features drawings of elephants. The elephants are oddly proportioned, with flaring trunks, boar-like tusks, hairy bodies, and (in some cases) no knees. A few of the elephants have castle turrets on their backs, with knights standing within.">
</p>

<p>And like medieval scholars drawing elephants they’ve never seen, we make those interpretations through the lens of our own biases.</p>

<p>I love these medieval drawings of elephants. They’re so delightfully <em>strange.</em></p>

<p>But I’m not showing you these pictures to make a point about how difficult it is to draw an elephant when you haven’t seen one.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/013.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A picture of another medieval manuscript. It contains a realistic drawing of an elephant.">
</p>

<p>If you go back to Corpus Christi, where they have the Chronophage—not right now! I’ll start talking about software soon, promise. Anyway, at Corpus Christi, they have Matthew Paris’ <em>Chronica Majora</em>. It contains this drawing of an elephant. You might assume that it came much later, because it’s so much more accurate. But all of these drawings were created around the same time, in the 13th century.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/014.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A side-by-side comparison of the two styles of elephants.">
</p>

<p>It’s quite the difference, isn’t it?</p>

<p>I’m not showing you these images to make a point about medieval monks. I’m actually showing them to make a point about <em>your</em> biases. In the modern era, we expect images to be true to life. We have cameras that give us nearly perfect representations of the world. But realism isn’t what medieval monks were always trying to accomplish. Religion and metaphor were a central part of their lives, to a degree that I think we in the modern world have trouble understanding.</p>

<p>The elephants on the left aren’t really elephants. They’re a way of presenting a moral lesson about your place in the world. The image serves that story. It’s not there to teach you about elephants. It’s there to teach you about <em>God.</em></p>

<p>So if your first reaction to these elephants was to laugh at those ignorant medieval monks... then perhaps you’ve fallen prey to your biases. The elephant doesn’t look like an elephant because <em>the metaphor was more important than the reality.</em></p>

<p>The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there.</p>

<p>[beat]</p>

<p>The past informs the present, but the present informs the past. We can’t help but to interpret it through the lens of our own experience, and those biases distort the reality of what it was actually like to live there.</p>

<p>This idea fascinates me, because it’s not only true of the past; it’s true of everything. Our biases and experiences influence so much of how we interpret the world.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/016.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “XP’s TDD.” It shows a loop of “Think”, “Red”, “Green”, “Refactor,” and then back to “Think.” There’s a smaller loop from “Refactor” back to “Green.”">
</p>

<p>I taught teams Extreme Programming for a few decades, as a consultant. Now that I’m VP of Engineering, I’m still teaching it, in a way. One thing that’s stood out to me over the years is that the people who struggle the most to learn XP are the ones who are more senior.</p>

<p>Junior developers have no problem! It’s the senior developers who struggle. They have too much baggage from their preconceptions.</p>

<p>A good example of this comes from Microsoft. XP was popular in the early 2000s, and practices like test-driven development, which come from XP, were entering the mainstream. So Microsoft published a set of “Guidelines for Test-Driven Development.”</p>

<p>There was a big backlash, and Microsoft took their guidelines down pretty quickly, because they got them terribly, ridiculously, horribly wrong. Microsoft didn’t actually practice XP, as far as I can tell, so they didn’t know that XP is a way of keeping software design simple and evolving it in response to customer needs. In XP, you don’t create your design in advance; you discover it as you go, and you focus on keeping it as simple as you can.</p>

<p>People who have practiced XP know that TDD is about tests and code evolving in step with each other, so that you learn as you go. A few lines of test code. See the tests fail. A few lines of production code. See the tests pass. A few improvements to the design. See the tests pass. A few more lines of test code. See the tests fail. And so on, and so forth, until the software is done, without following a preconceived path.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/017.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Microsoft’s ‘TDD’.” It shows a waterfall-style process. The details are explained in the text.">
</p>

<p>As with many companies past and present, the Microsoft way wasn’t to evolve their design; it was to come up with a software design in advance, then build to that preconceived design. And so they saw what Kent Beck and others had said about TDD and <em>interpreted</em> it in the only way they knew how: as a way of coming up with a software design in advance, and then building to that design. Their guidelines for TDD were to:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Gather the requirements for your new feature</p></li>
	<li><p>Make a list of tests that will satisfy the requirements</p></li>
	<li><p>File work items for the tests that need to be written</p></li>
	<li><p>Generate all the interfaces and classes you’ll need—using Visual Studio, of course!</p></li>
	<li><p>Write all the tests</p></li>
	<li><p>Write all the production code</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not exaggerating! This is what they actually said. Refactoring, iteration, learning as you go—key ideas of XP and TDD—nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s approach to TDD was the <em>exact opposite</em> of what TDD was about. But they were only able to interpret TDD through the lens of their corporate approach to software development. And to this day, you see this same misunderstanding about TDD repeated by people who are steeped in up-front thinking.</p>

<p>XP is a foreign country. We do things differently here.</p>

<p>[beat]</p>

<p>As people, we can’t help but to interpret the world through lens of our own biases. But that means that we make assumptions about the world that aren’t true, and we can’t even recognize that we’re doing it. It’s not just the past that’s a foreign country... almost <em>everything</em> is.</p>

<p>That leads to problems. And in software, one of the biggest, is...</p>

</p>

<p>People who aren’t software developers have probably seen more “programming” in movies and TV shows than in real life. Those shows are filled with magical people who can “hack” anything off-camera and in moments.</p><p>“The ship’s going to ram us, captain!” “Quick, hack into their retro-encabulator and reverse the polarity of their thrusters!” (frantic typing, dramatic music, camera <em>zoooooooom</em>) “It just barely missed us! Hoorah!”</p>

<p>I only wish software development was that cool.</p>

</p>

<p>Of course, people do know that’s fiction. Some of them might have even written code in school. But in school, people write small programs that fulfill an assignment and don’t have to be maintained.</p>

</p>

<p>None of these experiences bear any relationship to the modern world of software development.</p>

<p>TV show hackers are just another <em>deus ex machina</em>... quite literally. It’s lazy writing.</p>

<p>School projects don’t require long-term maintenance or large-scale coordination.</p>

<p>Unsupervised AI coding assistants feel magical, but they break down once you get past the prototype stage.</p>

<p>All of these things trick people into thinking that software development is about <em>code.</em> About <em>hands on keyboard.</em> But that’s not what it’s about at all.</p>

</p>

<p>To paraphrase Kent Beck, professional software development is about...</p>

<p><em>Communication and collaboration</em> between large numbers of people with different perspectives.</p>

<p><em>Feedback loops</em> that enable us to tell when we’re building the right thing, and the thing right... and when we’re not.</p>

<p><em>Simplicity,</em> because it’s our ability to understand and change software that determines timelines and cost.</p>

<p><em>Courage</em> to do the right thing even when it’s hard, and it’s often hard.</p>

<p><em>Respect</em> for the people doing the work and the people affected by the work.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/026.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Business Assumptions.” It’s marked “Incorrect” in bold red text. The contents of the slide are explained in the text.">
</p>

<p><em>We</em> know that software development is a matter of discovery and coordination. But to our business partners, we’re a foreign country. They can only see us through the lens of their experience.</p>

<p><em>Their</em> experience is that software development is about writing code, in the same manner that someone might do a homework assignment. It’s tedious, perhaps; time-consuming, maybe; but ultimately, a matter of buckling down and doing the assignment... following a straight path from here to there.</p>

<p>If you think this way—if you think that software development is like a big homework assignment—then you start making a bunch of assumptions.</p>

<p>You assume that you only need to define the assignment correctly to get the right answer.</p>
<p>You assume that the assignment has one right answer, and there’s a clear path to that answer.</p>
<p>You assume that people can tell you what that path is and how long it will take.</p>
<p>You assume that, when work isn’t getting done according to that schedule, it’s because people aren’t working hard enough.</p>
<p>And you assume that, when work’s behind, putting pressure on people will make them work harder and get it done on time.</p>



<p>Ultimately, you think software development looks like this <em>[play animation]:</em> a trip from point A to point B.</p>



<p>When in reality, it’s more like this <em>[play animation]:</em> a process of exploration and discovery, where the outcome isn’t known until you get there.</p>

<p>Software development is a foreign country. We do things differently here.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/031.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Project-Based Governance.” It’s marked “Avoid” in bold red text. The slide shows three steps: 1. Build the plan; 2. Work the plan; 3. Track progress vs. plan. The slide defines “Success” as “On time, on budget, as specified.”">
</p>

<p>These misconceptions aren’t harmless. They extend deep into organizational structures. The biggest impact is how software development is run in most organizations. Most organizations use project-based governance. You create a plan, then you work the plan. If you execute the plan properly, you’ll be successful, and you’ll finish on time.</p>

<p>In this environment, it’s management’s job to make sure that the plan is created correctly, worked correctly, and that people don’t slack off.</p>

<p>How do you know management is doing their job? What are they accountable for?</p>

<p>Delivering software on time and on budget.</p>

<p>It’s clean, it’s neat, it’s easy to understand, and it matches people’s misconceptions about software development.</p>

<p>And it results in <em>bad software.</em></p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/032.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide showing a waterfall with four stages: “Analyze market,” “Define exactly what to build,” “Build it,” and “Profit.” The first two stages (“analyze market” and “define exactly what to build”) are labelled “wishful thinking” in bold red text.">
</p>

<p>The whole premise that we can define the assignment in advance is incorrect. Software development is a process of discovery—of iteration and refinement. We learn as we go, and that changes our plans.</p>

<p>This is an Agile development conference. You’ve heard it all before. I’m not going to belabor the point.</p>

<p>But our business partners <em>haven’t</em> heard it before, or if they have, it’s <em>counter to their experiences.</em> Like us seeing medieval pictures of elephants, like Microsoft with TDD, they can’t help but interpret the world through their own biases. And those biases lead to project-based governance.</p>

<p>In their minds, anything less... is a lack of accountability.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>So what can we do about this?</p>

<p>Ultimately, accountability is about being responsible for a set of results. At the executive level, everybody has to be accountable.</p>

<p><em>Marketing</em> is responsible for generating leads for your Sales department. They say how many qualifying leads they’re going to create, and they’re accountable for having done so.</p>

<p><em>Partners</em> also generates leads, or even sales, from people who are using complementary products and services. They’re accountable for bringing in partners, and for the revenue those partners generate.</p>

<p><em>Sales</em> converts leads into paying customers. They’re accountable for the revenue generated by those customers.</p>

<p><em>Customer Success</em> takes care of your customers. They’re accountable for retention, and for generating additional revenue from upsells.</p>

<p>Everyone is accountable for doing what they say they’ll do, including us in software development. But there’s something different about how everyone else is accountable. Did you notice?</p>

<p>For other departments, accountability is about the <em>results</em> they’re bringing to the organization, not the <em>work</em> they’re putting in. Sales isn’t saying, “we’re going to land customer X on date Y.” Everybody knows that sales take time, and things go sideways. So Sales says “we don’t know exactly which customers we’re going to land, or when, but <em>overall</em>, we’re going to generate X dollars of revenue.” Same for Marketing, and Partners, and Customer Success. We in software are the only ones who have to predict <em>exactly</em> what and when.</p>

<p>Our business colleagues aren’t unreasonable. They understand that things go wrong. But they also <em>believe</em>, deep in their hearts, that if you aren’t accountable, you won’t put forth your full effort.</p>

<p>And if we don’t define how we’re going to be accountable, they’ll do it for us, in the only way they know how. Which features are you going to deliver? When? If you don’t deliver them on time, you aren’t being accountable.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/034.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same list of departments with their purpose removed.">
</p>

<p>We have to change the script.</p>

<p>So what should we be accountable for instead? What, exactly, do we do? What results do <em>we</em> create?</p>

<p>[beat]</p>

<p><em>We create new opportunities.</em> Let’s say that the trajectory of your company is to grow its annual revenue by $10mm per year. Our job is to increase that rate of growth, to $12, $15, $20mm per year. Every time we ship a new feature, we should be increasing that rate of growth.</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/038.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same list of departments again, but now they’re larger. Sentences describing how product engineering helps them grow have been added. Those sentences are described in the text.">
</p>

<p>Our features should open up new markets, allowing Marketing to generate more leads.</p>

<p>We should provide useful APIs, allowing Partners to build new relationships.</p>

<p>We should respond to market trends, allowing Sales to convert more leads.</p>

<p>And we should fix the problems that get in customers’ way, reducing churn and increasing upsell.</p>

<p>What are we accountable for? We’re accountable for improving our companies’ trajectories. Every dollar invested into software development, other than keeping the lights on, should be reflected in permanent improvements to the value your company creates. That value may not be literal dollars or pounds; it may be helping to cure malaria or fighting climate change. But however you define value, the purpose of our work is to change that trajectory for the better.</p>

</p>

<p>It’s easy to say that we’ll be accountable for improving our companies’ trajectories. But how do we actually demonstrate that we’re doing so?</p>

<p>It’s nearly impossible to quantify the impact of any individual feature. It takes months to see an impact from a new feature, and even then, we can’t say that feature X resulted in change in behavior Y. Let’s say churn went down by half a percent. That’s great! Did it go down because of the feature we just released? Or because of a different one? Or is it more that interest rates just dropped and we hired an amazing new director for our customer success department?</p>

<p>This is why it’s tempting to look at <em>when</em> you’ll deliver a feature. It’s easy to measure.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>But ultimately, features are a <em>means to an end,</em> not the end itself. There’s an old cliché that people don’t want a shovel, they want a hole in the ground. And they don’t want a hole in the ground, they want a building foundation. And they don’t want a building foundation, they want a nice big stable. And they don’t want a stable, they want war elephants that make their enemies say things like, “Carthago Delende Est!”</p>

<p>When we talk about delivering features, we’re talking about shovels when we should be talking about striking fear into the hearts of Roman soldiers.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/041.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “product bet.” It reads, “Strike fear into the hearts of Roman infantry by fielding a battalion of war-capable elephants.”">
</p>

<p>So instead of talking about features, I’ve introduced a way of talking about value. At OpenSesame, we’re calling them “Product Bets.”</p>

<p>Before we go further, a quick disclaimer. The term “bet” is common among startups and other entrepreneurial organizations, so you’ll hear the phrase “product bet” from a lot of different people. Each of us is using it in our own way. So my use of “product bets” isn’t the same as what you might have seen from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Okay, so what do <em>we</em> mean when we say product bet?</p>

<p>Ultimately, it’s a strategic investment in a business result. It’s summarized with a single sentence that has two parts:</p>

<p>First, the business outcome: Strike fear into the hearts of Roman infantry!</p>

<p>Second, the means by which we do so: ...by fielding a battalion of war-capable elephants.</p>

<p>The result always comes first: strike fear. The mechanism comes second: war elephants. And even then, it’s high level. We need a stable, we need animal breeders and trainers, we need to train soldiers, we need a supply line. We need so many things, and not just software. Those are <em>features.</em> We don’t talk about features in our product bet. We keep it high level. Just the headline.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/042.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same slide as before, but a new line has been added. It reads, “Sponsor: General Hannibal.”">
</p>

<p>Next, we need a sponsor. Who amongst our leadership team is going advocate for this result? At OpenSesame, it’s usually our Chief Product Officer. But sometimes it’s our Chief Customer Officer, who’s in charge of sales and retention.</p>

<p>For the Carthaginians, of course, the sponsor is General Hannibal.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/043.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The same slide as before, but another new line has been added. It reads, “Present Value: 10,385,202 shekels.”">
</p>

<p>Next we talk about <em>estimated present value.</em> This is a core innovation. As I said, it’s nearly impossible to measure the impact of any feature, or even set of features. There’s too many confounding factors.</p>

<p>So we don’t <em>measure</em> the impact. We <em>estimate</em> the impact.</p>

<p>My software department takes accountability for delivering <em>estimated value,</em> not <em>measured value.</em></p>

<p>Now, that’s not to say that we don’t want to validate results. Jeff Patton talks about using Dave McClure’s Pirate Metrics to do so. I welcome and encourage that kind of validation. Ultimately, you have to decide if the bet was successful.</p>

<p>(Spoilers: Hannibal’s bet isn’t going to be as successful as he was hoping.)</p>

<p>But the key idea of these product bets is that <em>you don’t have to measure value.</em> You only have to decide if the bet was successful. If it is, we get credit for the <em>estimated value,</em> not the actual value, which saves us a lot of time and trouble.</p>

<p>Estimating value allows us to be accountable without predicting specific dates and features.</p>

<p>Remember that the head of Sales is accountable for delivering a certain amount of new business every year. Let’s say it’s 10 million dollars. They’re going to deploy a certain number of sales people towards small-to-medium businesses, some towards mid-market, some towards enterprise. They’re going to conduct training and organize incentive programs. They’re going to get everybody fired up about how they need to <em>sell, sell, sell!</em> They’re going to monitor calls, check SalesForce, make sure people are following up.</p>

<p>But they’re <em>not</em> going to say, “Enterprise X is going to sign on date Y.” Because they can’t. The buyer’s going to go on vacation. Legal’s going to demand redlines. A year in advance, nobody knows when the contract will be signed, or if it will even be signed at all. <em>But overall,</em> they’ve got enough going on that they can say, “yes, we’re going to close $10mm in sales this year.”</p>

<p>The same is true of us. A year in advance, we don’t know which bets we’re going to do. We don’t know how much it’s going to cost to build them. We don’t know which ones are going to be successful and which ones are going to fail. <em>But overall,</em> we can say, “Yes, we’re going to deliver bets that are worth $10mm in estimated value this year.”</p>

<p>And that’s accountability.</p>

It shows “Ideas” proceeding to “Build” proceeding to “Code.” “Code” proceeds to “Measure” proceeds to “Data.” Finally, “Data” proceeds to “Learn” back to “Ideas.” The center of the loop is labelled “Minimize total time through the loop.”">
</p>

<p>Wait a moment. “We don’t know how much it’s going to cost to build a bet?” How can we decide what to do if we don’t know how much it’s going to cost?</p>

<p>At this point, all we have is a headline. There’s no way for us to know how much it will cost, because we don’t know exactly what we’re going to build.</p>

<p>And if we’re doing Agile right, we will <em>never</em> know exactly what we’re going to build <em>until after it’s done.</em> As you all know, Agile software development is iterative and incremental. It’s a process of discovery.</p>

<p>I like Eric Ries’ characterization of this idea: we build, we measure, we learn, over and over again. And we don’t know what we’re going to do here <em>[points at “build” step]</em> until we know what happened here <em>[points at “learn” step].</em> As long as we’re genuinely learning, we can’t know our costs in advance.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/047.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The product bet slide again, with another line added. It reads, “Maximum Wager: 5,000,000 shekels.”">
</p>

<p>What we <em>can</em> do, though, is put a maximum limit on how much we’ll spend. I call it the “maximum wager,” to continue with the betting theme. We track our spending, and if we’re not successful by the time we hit the limit, the bet has failed. We shut it down and move on to the next one. Or, at the very least, take a hard look at where things are at and decide on a new wager. As long as the total spending is less than the present value, it could still be a good investment.</p>

<p>The amount of the maximum wager is for your leadership team to decide. It’s not an <em>estimate of cost.</em> It’s a gut check about <em>risk</em> and <em>value.</em> The higher the value of the bet, the more you can wager. But you don’t want to wager so much that it would be crippling if the bet failed. Some bets will fail, and you’ll get nothing for your efforts. Success doesn’t mean fielding elephants. Success means <em>winning a war</em> with our elephants, and those Romans can be tricky.</p>

<p>The maximum wager is based on your leadership team’s gut feel of the risk and value involved. It’s not based on how much we think the bet will cost; it’s based on <em>how much we’re willing to lose.</em></p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/044.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="The build-measure-learn slide again.">
</p>

<p>And then we do our best to make sure that potential loss is minimized. We use the "Build, Measure, Learn" loop to validate whether the bet is going to be successful early on. Maybe one loop is focused on taking elephants up into the mountains to see how they handle the harsh conditions, and another loop dedicates a “red team” to see if they can be spooked into fleeing during battle.</p>

<p>It turns out they can. It would be nice to discover that early, not in the middle of battle with the Romans.</p>

<p>Although we in software are accountable for estimated value, not actual value, we only get to take credit for <em>successful</em> bets. It’s in our interest, and everyone’s interest, to weed out the unsuccessful bets early, so we can spend more time focusing on the successful ones. And so, we should design our build-measure-learn loops to test for failure as early as possible.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>With value and a maximum cost, we can perform an apples-to-apples comparison between bets and choose the one that seems like the best one to do next. Often, that will be the one with the highest value.</p>

<p>But don’t be fooled by all these numbers! They’re just estimates and guesses. A smart leadership team will go with their gut, not just follow the numbers like robots. The numbers are there to feed a conversation: to get people thinking. They’re not there to substitute for experience and judgment.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>The big question: Does this work?</p>

<p>For me, so far, yes. It took me nearly two years to get my leadership team to really engage with this approach, and I needed the strong support of my CEO and CPO to get there. My CEO, in particular, had to get pretty insistent before people would engage.</p>

<p>The fact is, putting together bets, even such high-level ones, takes work. It also makes people accountable, by putting concrete numbers on previously-vague statements about value, and despite everybody’s desire for <em>other</em> people to be accountable, most leadership teams I’ve worked with aren’t really looking to take on more accountability <em>themselves</em>.</p>

<p>But, thanks to my CPO and CEO’s support, I can say that we <em>are</em> building software using product bets. We identified a handful to take to the leadership team earlier this year. They estimated the value, then chose a specific set of bets for us to pursue based on our capacity. It’s definitely elevated our conversation around product strategy, and I can see it getting even better as we gain familiarity with the approach.</p>

<p>What we <em>haven’t</em> done yet is <em>finish</em> any bets. We just started our first formal bets this year. So I can’t yet tell you how it will turn out.</p>

<p>What I <em>can</em> tell you is that I’m getting a lot less pushback than I used to about features and dates. The conversation is focused on bets, not features and dates, and when we talk about what folks want from Engineering, it’s less about, "tell me when you’re going to be done," and more about how we can take on more bets.</p>

<p>So, even though I haven’t yet used product bets to truly demonstrate accountability, they already seem to be helping.</p>

<p>Does it work? For me, so far, yes.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>To summarize, we’re working on demonstrating accountability with product bets.</p>

<p>Specifically, we’re going to commit to delivering a certain amount of <em>estimated</em> value each year.</p>

<p>That estimated value comes from product bets. Each product bet is summarized by headline that focuses on a <em>business result</em> with a high level description of how we’ll achieve that result.</p>

<p>The bets to pursue are decided by the leadership team, and each bet has a leadership sponsor who champions it within that team.</p>

<p>Bets have an estimated value, and we focus on the <em>estimate</em> rather than trying to prove out actual value.</p>

<p>The leadership team also defines a maximum wager for each bet, which is based on a gut feel of risk and benefits, not costs, and together with the present value allows us to perform apples-to-apples comparisons of the bets.</p>

</p>

<p>At this point, you might be wondering: where does that "present value" number come from?</p>

<p>The answer, like all things in business, is spreadsheets. Magical spreadsheets filled with arbitrary guesses.</p>

<p>The secret to spreadsheets is that they make our guesses look official. Professional. Good Business-y.</p>

<p>But seriously, yeah, spreadsheets. Let me show you.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/053.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide showing a spreadsheet calculating present value from future value. It’s described in the text.">
</p>

<p>Let me start out by explaining what “present value” is, just in case some of you aren’t familiar with it.</p>

<p>The core idea of “present value” is that money—let’s say $10—is worth more today than it is tomorrow. Today, I can buy a couple of candy bars with $10. In a few decades, I’ll only be able to buy half a candy bar due to inflation.</p>

<p>This is called “the time value of money,” but it’s very simple: money today is worth more than money tomorrow.</p>

<p>What this means is that earning $10 today is better than earning $10 next year, and even better still than earning $10 in two years. If inflation was 20%, $10 in <em>future value</em> next year would be equivalent to $8.33 in <em>present value</em> today. $10 in future value two years from now would be equivalent to $6.94 today. And so forth.</p>

<p>Of course, inflation isn’t 20%, thank goodness. But when your company makes an investment, they expect a certain return on that investment. The return they expect is called “cost of capital.” Your leadership team will tell you the cost of capital to use. It’s based on their judgment of how much they could get from using the money on other investments along with an adjustment for risk. For these examples, I’m arbitrarily choosing a 20% cost of capital.</p>

<p>The neat thing about cost of capital is that you can wager your <em>entire present value</em> and still get a good return on investment. As long as the bet is successful, even if you spend all of the present value, you’re still making money.</p>

<p>If you ask me for an investment and promise to return $10 to me today, $10 next year, and so on for the next three years, you’ll return $40 total. If my cost of capital is 20%, then I can look at the present value of each of those returns. It’s $10 today, $8.33 next year, $6.94 the following year, and so forth. Adding up those future returns gives me the total present value, which is $31.06, which means that I can invest up to $31.06 and still get at least a 20% return on my investment.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/054.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Present Value Components.” The components are “Sales to new customers,” “Upsell of existing customers,” “Retention,” “Cost savings,” and “Expenditures.”">
</p>

<p>Okay, so that’s what present value is. Now, how do we determine what numbers to use?</p>

<p>As I said before—spreadsheets and guesses. You build a financial model that makes guesses about the future.</p>

<p>I’m going to share the model I used, but I have to be honest: I had a lot of trouble getting my leadership team to engage with product bets at first. In order to get this off the ground, I had to provide the financial model myself... and honestly, I think it could be a lot better.</p>

<p>We have a new CFO at OpenSesame, so I showed him about the model I’m about to show you. He said—this is a direct quote—“it’s an okay framework to start.” He also said, “come talk to me early when you start on the next set of bets.”</p>

<p>So, yeah. Thank you for coming to my okay talk. I’m sure it will be better next year.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, our CFO liked the general idea of product bets, and the categories I was using. He just thinks he can make the specifics more rigorous, which is great, and I’m looking forward to his help.</p>

<p>The fact is, it doesn’t really matter if the model is accurate or not. The important thing is to get people to engage with <em>value</em> rather than <em>cost and dates</em> being the primary driver of decision-making. You can use a rough, back-of-the-envelope model to get started. That’s what I did. As long as you’re consistent with your approach across bets, it’s still useful.</p>

<p>With that said, our product bets are broken down into five sections. Each one has its own little present value calculation.</p>

<p>There’s Sales, which represents the money we make from new customers as a result of the bet.</p>

<p>Upsell, which is the money we make from existing customers as a result of the bet.</p>

<p>Retention, which has to do with the fact that we sell subscriptions. Once we make a sale, we keep making money from that customer every year, so long as we can retain them. This is typical in the modern software-as-a-service world. So retention is a very important number.</p>

<p>Cost savings is <em>reduction</em> in spending, which counts as value, because spending $5 less on candy each year means I have $5 more in my pocket.</p>

<p>And then expenditures, which is <em>additional</em> spending we’ll incur as a consequence of the bet. For example, maybe I spend $5 less on candy each year, but I have to spend $1 every year on a budget tracking app that reminds me not to waste money on candy.</p>

It reads, “War Elephants as a Service.” It shows an elephant with a castle turret on its back. The elephant has two trunks.">
</p>

<p>To illustrate these ideas, let me introduce you to my new employer: War Elephants as a Service.</p>

<p>We’re your one stop shop for all elephant-related warfare. We take care of the elephants, so you can take care of the invasion! Look at our glowing testimonials from top customers: Carthage... and Rome! Business is good. Or at least, it was. There’s not much demand for war elephants these days.</p>

<p>PS: Apologies for the mutant two-trunked elephant in the logo. Our ex-CEO tried to solve our financial problems with cost-cutting, so he replaced all of our graphic designers with AI. His last words as he was escorted out the building were, “I’ve made a terrible mistake.”</p>

It’s decorated with a cute baby elephant. The headline of the bet reads, “Open up new markets and improve retention with family-friendly elephant activities.” The sponsor is Babar, the CEO.">
</p>

<p>But we have new CEO now! Babar is our new “Chief Elephant Officer,” and he has an idea for keeping our business relevant in today’s fast-paced world. Since nobody seems to want war elephants any more, we’re going to switch from “war elephants” to “more elephants!” Elephant parades! Elephant-themed merchandise! And especially, cute baby elephants! Nothing says “more elephants” like an adorable fuzzy pachyderm.</p>

<p>Specifically, we’re going to open up new markets and improve retention by introducing family-friendly elephant activities. That’s our bet.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/057.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A spreadsheet labelled “Sales to New Customers.” It has four main rows: “Service Obtainable Market,” “Sales Rate,” “Future Value,” and “Present Value.” At the bottom are cells labelled “Cost of Capital” (which is set to 20%) and “Total Present Value.” The numbers are described in the text.">
</p>

<p>To quantify this bet, we’re going to look at the five categories I mentioned before: Sales to new customers, upsells to existing customers, retention, cost savings, and expenditures.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Service Obtainable Market” row]</em> For new sales, we’re going to look at the “service obtainable market,” which is the total size of the market that we can reach for family-friendly elephant activities. Let’s say it’s 100 million dollars at the end of the first year, and grows over time as word gets out.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Sales Rate” row]</em> Next, we’re going to estimate how much of that market we can capture. We face competition from zoos, but nobody has quite the expertise deploying large numbers of elephants that we do, so we’re going to say we can sell into 1% of the market, and that will also grow over time.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Future Value” row]</em> Multiplying the service obtainable market by our sales rate of 1% gives us the amount we expect to make each year in future dollars. <em>[points to “Present Value” row]</em> Then we apply our present value formula at a 20% cost of capital and <em>[points to “Total Present Value”]</em> add it all up to get a total present value of nearly $5 million from new sales.</p>

<p>It all looks very official, doesn’t it? But how do we know it’s a 100 million dollar market? How do we know we can sell into 1% of it?</p>

<p>We don’t! It’s guesses. Educated guesses, maybe, but ultimately... guesses. That’s how these things work, and that’s why you need your leadership team to get involved. You can make your models more and more rigorous, but at the end of the day, somebody’s making their best guess, and those guesses should be overseen by the people in charge of those departments.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/063.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A spreadsheet labelled “Upsell to Existing Customers.” It has the same structure as the previous spreadsheet, but the numbers are different.">
</p>

<p>Next, we look at upsell. How many of our existing customers can we convince to try our new family-friendly elephant activities?</p>

<p><em>[points to “Service Obtainable Market” row]</em> As before, we start with the total market that we can reasonably reach. This is the amount we think that our existing customers would be willing to spend on our new offering. In our case, it turns out our customers aren’t actually using their war elephants for war, but for things like parades. We think there’s a good $25 million to be made from our existing customers, and we don’t expect that to change much over time. To be clear, that’s not <em>what we make</em> from our existing customers, it’s the <em>extra amount</em> we think they’d pay for our new service.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Sales Rate” row]</em> Then we look at our sales rate for that market. Given that our customers are already using their elephants for parades, we think they’re going to be pretty receptive to us providing services to support them. We estimate that we’ll be able to convert 5% of the upsell market, and that number will also grow over time.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Total Present Value”]</em> Multiply the numbers, apply present value formula, and we have the total upsell value of $6.3mm.</p>

</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about retention. Our retention numbers have been pretty bad—as I said, countries don’t really need war elephants any more. <em>[points to “Service Obtainable Market” row]</em> But we still have a hundreds of millions of recurring revenue, even though it’s going down each year. That’s the ARR line—annual recurring revenue.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Retention Change” row]</em> By pivoting from a focus on war to a focus on the military parades our clients are actually using elephants for, we think we can stem the bleeding a bit. Not much... about a quarter of a percent each year, going up slightly over time.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Total Present Value”]</em> Multiply, present value, and there you have it. Three and a half million.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/071.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A spreadsheet labelled “Cost Savings.” It’s similar to the previous spreadsheets, with two major differences: the first two rows are labelled “Work Eliminated” and “Expenses Eliminated,” and the “Future Value” row adds those two rows together rather than multiplying them. All the dollar values are zero.">
</p>

<p>What about cost savings? <em>[points to “Work Eliminated” row]</em> Is this bet going to eliminate any of the existing work our employees do? Not really. <em>[points to “Expenses Eliminated” row]</em> Is it going to eliminate any expensive software subscriptions or other expenses? No, probably not.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Total Present Value”]</em> Normally, we’d add up the cost savings and apply the present value calculation, but the numbers total out to zero in this case.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/075.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A spreadsheet labelled “Expenditures.” It only has two rows: “Future Value” and “Present Value.” (Like the other spreadsheets, it also has a “Cost of Capital” cell, which is set to 20%, and a “Total Present Value” cell.) All the numbers are negative.">
</p>

<p>And finally, expenditures. How much more are we going to spend as a result of this bet?</p>

<p>Well, there’s the cost of developing the bet itself, which is our wager, but we’ll bring that in later. In this section, we’re looking at the ongoing costs of running the program. <em>[points to “Future Value” row]</em> I’m going to hand-wave that a bit—you might have multiple line items here normally—but let’s just say it’s $2mm per year, going up as the program becomes more popular. Elephants aren’t cheap.</p>

<p><em>[points to “Total Present Value”]</em>  Present value, etc., gives us a total of $8.5mm in expenditures.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/078.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A summary spreadsheet labelled “Net Present Value.” This has a completely different structure from the previous sheets. It adds up the total present value of the previous bets, then the wager, to arrive at a net present value. The numbers are described in the text.">
</p>

<p>Bringing it all together, we have $5mm in new sales, $6.3mm in upsell, $3.5mm in improved retention, $0 in cost savings, and $8.5mm in expenditures. That comes to a total present value of $6.3mm before our development costs.</p>

<p>Now, how much do we want to wager on development? The leadership team thinks this is a slam dunk, and a way to save the business, so they’re going to wager nearly all of the value. Five million dollars. Remember, using cost of capital to determine present value means that we could wager the entire present value and still come out ahead... if the bet is successful.</p>

<p>That said, bets still have a risk of failure. Our leadership team is making some assumptions about how much people will be excited about baby elephants, so we’ll want to work incrementally and iteratively to test their assumptions early.</p>

<p>To summarize, the present value of the bet is based on sales to new customers, upsell to existing customers, change in retention, cost savings, and non-development expenditures related to those benefits.</p>

The present value and wager numbers have been added to the headline and sponsor from before.">
</p>

<p>And that’s how we come up with the numbers in the product bet. To bring it back around, we’re betting that we can open up new markets and improve retention with family-friendly elephant activities. Babar is the sponsor for this bet and he thinks it’s worth $6mm in present value, and he’s willing to spend up to $5mm to try to make it work.</p>

<p>To calculate the value of those categories, we took a back-of-the-napkin approach where we estimated the size of the market and our ability to sell into that market. There’s certainly room for more rigor, and I encourage you to talk to your finance team about how to improve the model.</p>

<p>But do remember that it’s all still guesses at the end of the day. It’s better to have <em>some</em> model than a <em>perfect</em> model. The real benefit is in shifting the conversation from features and dates to about being accountable for value.</p>

<p>We may be a foreign country, but we can still speak our business partners’ language.</p>

<p>But how do we get them to talk to us?</p>

</p>

<p>A leader I respect once told me, “You have 18-24 months after becoming VP of Engineering to make a difference. After that, the organization’s problems become your problems.”</p>

<p>I think he was right on target. As a leader, your colleagues in other departments will reserve judgement for the first six months or so. They’ll get impatient over the course of the next year. By the end of two years, they’ll be holding you accountable. If you don’t define what that looks like, they’ll define it for you, and they’re going to default to features and dates.</p>

<p>The problem with product bets, as an idea, is that they require leadership participation. You can’t create these spreadsheets on your own. Even if you did, nobody’s going to pay attention if you don’t have their buy-in. I’ve tried variants of the product bet idea many times over the years and getting that participation has been extraordinarily difficult. I’m a little surprised we’re able to do it at OpenSesame, to be honest.</p>

<p>Before you can get people to buy in to your definition of accountability, you need them to trust you. And in order for them to trust you, you need to be accountable.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to solve this chicken-and-egg problem for <em>your</em> organization. I can tell you how I solved it for <em>mine.</em> Any change you introduce has to be in the context of your specific situation, so I’m <em>not</em> saying that you should do it my way. Some of my changes were pretty radical, and they’re not going to be a good idea for every situation.</p>

<p>We don’t have time to go into every detail, so this is going to be more of an overview than a how-to guide. I’ll provide resources for further investigation.</p>

<p>QR Code: <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/presentations/2022/fast-an-innovative-way-to-scale">FaST: An Innovative Way to Scale</a></p>

<p>When I joined OpenSesame, I started by getting the lay of the land and deciding what to do. One of the things I saw was that the teams were heavily siloed by technology area, rather than by product line. Cross-team delays weren’t too bad, although they often can be in this situation, but it did mean that teams’ work didn’t line up to our business needs. So the first thing I did was to introduce Quentin Quartel’s Fluid Scaling Technology, or FaST.</p>

<p>We don’t have time to discuss FaST today, but you can learn more about my approach to it by following <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/presentations/2022/fast-an-innovative-way-to-scale">this QR code</a>. The short version is that we combined teams into product-centric “collectives” and created a single queue of work for each collective. Each product has a dedicated collective and work queue. Those collectives self-organize into teams as needed to tackle the highest priority work.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/083.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Valuable Increments.” It describes VIs in three parts: Releasable. When it’s done, you never have to work on it again. Valuable. It benefits your organization in some way. Incremental. It’s the smallest thing that’s still releasable and valuable. To the side is a picture of the second edition of James Shore’s book, “The Art Agile Development,” with the “Adaptive Planning” section highlighted.">
</p>

<p>FaST solved the problem of teams not matching business needs. A related problem was the teams planned their work in terms of technical priorities rather than business results. They called them “stories,” and “epics,” and recorded them in Jira, but they were more like technical tasks. At the same time that I introduced FaST, I also introduced the idea of “Valuable Increments” from my book. (In case it’s not clear on the slide, my book is <em><a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2">The Art of Agile Development</a>,</em> and it’s now available in a second edition. You can find this material in the “<a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/adaptive_planning">Adaptive Planning</a>” section.)</p>

<p>A valuable increment is a similar idea to an epic, in that it groups together multiple stories, but an “epic” is literally a “big story.” A valuable increment isn’t focused on size; it’s focused on <em>value</em>. Each VI is something that stands alone. When it’s done, you can release it, and you’ll have gotten value out of it even if you never work on anything related to it ever again.</p>

<p>Introducing FaST and VIs allowed me to talk in terms of the <em>business results</em> my teams were creating for each product line, not just their technical accomplishments.</p>

It says: PM provides a brief 1-2 minute description; Everyone estimates in team-weeks; Use the median as the estimate. On the right is a graph labelled “Estimate distribution.” It shows a cumulative log-normal graph of actual to estimate ratios. Next to the graph is a picture of the second edition of James Shore’s book, “The Art Agile Development,” with the “Forecasting” section highlighted.">
</p>

<p>I also knew, from experience, that one of my biggest battles was going to be around estimates and forecasting. Before I could gain the trust of the organization, I needed to be able to demonstrate that I could do what I said I would. Up to this point, their experience of software development was that we never delivered on time. At the same time, I didn’t want people to <em>over</em> focus on features and dates.</p>

<p>So I played a game that, to this day, I’m not sure was the right approach. I had my engineering managers start collecting data so we could provide more accurate forecasts. While they did that, I told teams to stop providing estimates to stakeholders.</p>

<p>This caused a <em>lot</em> of anger in my stakeholders. They didn’t like hearing that they couldn’t have estimates. I told them that our estimates weren’t accurate, and we were working on getting better information, but they still didn’t like it. I think I only got away with it because there had been high-profile failures with the old approach, and I was still in my honeymoon period, but it still caused a lot of friction.</p>

<p>It worked out in the end, I think, because the new forecasts <em>really are</em> much more reliable, but I had to collect data for about six months before I could provide the new forecasts. That was an uncomfortable period. I could have kept the old approach to forecasting, but it definitely didn’t work. I’m not sure if “wrong estimates” would have been better than “no estimates.” On the one hand, a clean break meant that it was obvious that I had switched to a new approach, and—as I said—it really works. On the other hand, I made some important members of the leadership team angry in the meantime.</p>

<p>Anyway, the way it works is that we get a “wisdom of the crowd” estimate for each VI before works starts. That involves a product manager providing a very brief description of what the VI involves—just a minute or two of verbal explanation. People can ask clarifying questions, but there usually aren’t many. Then everyone provides their gut feel of how long the work will take a team to accomplish, in weeks. We collect the answers without discussing them and record the median response. That’s the estimate. It only takes a few minutes per VI. Since our collectives have between 12 and 25 people, including managers, product managers, and designers, there’s enough people to make the “crowd” part of “wisdom of the crowd” work.</p>

<p>Our Wisdom of the Crowd estimates are stunningly accurate. The median estimate for a VI <em>actually matches</em> the median reality. It’s amazing. The approach comes from Quentin Quartel and his FaST method, and I’ve never seen anything so good. It’s easy <em>and</em> it’s accurate.</p>

<p>However, although Wisdom of the Crowd estimates are <em>accurate,</em> in aggregate, they’re not very <em>precise.</em> We graph estimates versus actuals—you can see it on the right there. About 30% of VIs take twice as long as estimated, and about 30% take half as long as estimated. That’s a pretty big range.</p>

<p>So we don’t present the raw estimates to stakeholders. If we did, we’d be late half the time. Instead, we increase the estimate so we’re early more often than we’re late.</p>

<p>Doing this requires me to play a political balancing act. According to our data, never being late would require us to multiply our estimates by six or seven, and that wouldn’t fly. We can’t tell them that a small, two-week VI is going to take 3-4 months. On the other hand, it’s also not acceptable to be late half the time.</p>

<p>Right now, I’ve chosen to be 75% accurate. In other words, we’re early 75% of the time and late 25% of the time. For us, that’s about a 2x multiplier, depending on the team. I’ve also told stakeholders to expect about 1 in 4 VIs to go longer than expected. So far, it’s working well.</p>

<p>If you’d like to know more about the analysis behind this technique, it’s in my book in the “<a href="http://localhost:5010/v2/books/aoad2/forecasting">Forecasting</a>” section.</p>

<p>
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/085.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A slide labelled “Visibility,” with a graph showing how effort is spent over time. The graph has five sections: “Value Add,” “Bugs,” “Routine Maintenance,” “On Call &amp; Incidents,” and “Deferred Maintenance.” The “Value Add” section is in blue, and is a small portion of the overall time. The other sections are in grey.">
</p>

<p>Collecting all that data for forecasting had a side benefit. My CEO pushed me to report productivity—that’s a whole ’nother story—and I decided to do it by reporting the percentage of time spent on muda versus the percentage of time spent on adding value to the business. Muda is activity that doesn’t add value. It’s the grey sections in the graph: maintenance, bugs, and on call.</p>

<p>This isn’t the real graph, for confidentiality reasons, but the story it tells is all too familiar: lots of time spent on deferred maintenance, lots of time spent on incidents, lots of bugs. And then just a fraction of time left over for doing valuable work.</p>

<p>I shared the real version of this graph with my leadership team and it was <em>eye opening.</em> All of the sudden, they understood exactly why things took so long, and why they didn’t ever get what they wanted. They had thought we had way more capacity than we actually did.</p>

<p>I told them that my responsibility was to reduce muda—the grey part—and make more room for valuable work—the blue part. That was an act of deliberate accountability, and it flipped the script. Yes, people still wanted me to be accountable for making teams deliver feature X on date Y, with all the fighting about deadlines that involves, but even more importantly, and primarily, I was accountable for decreasing muda. That’s precisely what I needed to be focused on, because that was our biggest problem.</p>

<p>And, over the past two years, that’s exactly what I’ve done. I report on my progress every quarter, and every quarter it’s a little bit better than it was before. And every quarter, I get a little bit less pushback on predicting dates.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>And then, finally, I just kept pushing. These two books are excellent resources on how to do so.</p>

<p>I introduced the original variant of the product bet idea in January 2024, or maybe even earlier. It didn’t go anywhere. I brought it up again in March 2024. We sort of tried it, without leadership buy-in, and it sort of fizzled. I brought it up again, and again. I worked with my colleague, the VP of Product. I talked to the Chief Product Officer. I included it in a presentation to leadership about how Agile works. I piggybacked on the CEO’s passion for quantifying results. I stopped asking Leadership to create financial models and just created my own, then asked them to fill in the values. (That’s why they’re not very rigorous.)</p>

<p>And then finally, in March of 2025, the stars aligned. The CPO started pushing the rest of the leadership team to get involved. We created five product bets, the leadership team filled in my spreadsheet, and we started working on the first bet. And now we’re off to the races. We just started our second bet a few months ago, and we’re talking about how to increase capacity for more bets.</p>

<p>There’s lot more to do, and lots more to learn, but now that the logjam has broken, I think it’s going to stick. Our new CFO is intrigued and I’m able to show steady progress with my VIs and forecasting techniques. I’m well on my way to erasing the stigma that engineering can’t be trusted to deliver. I had 18-24 months to make a difference. I’ve just passed my 2nd year at OpenSesame, and I’m still here. I think it’s going to work out.</p>

<p id="conclusion">
	<img src="https://2.media.letscodejavascript.com/www.jamesshore.com/images/accountability-problem/087.jpeg" width="640" height="360" alt="A title slide reading “Conclusion.” It’s presented in the style of an illuminated medieval manuscript.">
</p>

<p>Software development may be a foreign country to the rest of the business, but we can still be a trusted part of their empire.</p>

<p>To do so, we have to <em>take</em> accountability, rather than allowing it to be forced upon us. Rather than falling into the habit of delivering X features on Y date, we can be accountable for what really matters: results, just like our colleagues in sales, marketing, and other parts of the business. And the results we create are new opportunities. Enabling more prospects. New partners. More leads. Better retention.</p>

<p>Product bets allow us to be accountable for the estimated value of those results. So far, they’ve been working for me. I hope they work for you, too.</p>
