<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>This 31st annual Institute for Policy Studies Executive Excess report takes an in-depth look at the 100 S&amp;P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay, a group we have dubbed the “Low-Wage 100.” For each of these companies, we analyze CEO and worker pay trends since 2019. We also compare, for the past six years, what these companies have spent on stock buybacks to pump up short-term share prices with what they have invested in long-term capital improvements.</p>



<p>The report’s overall finding: At a time when many American workers are struggling with high costs for groceries and housing, the nation’s largest low-wage employers are fixated on making their overpaid CEOs even richer.</p>



<p>Our analysis ends with realizable policy solutions for pushing Corporate America in a more equitable direction.</p>



<p>For detailed analysis , including our methodology, see the full PDF below. A summary follows.</p>


            
        


<div>
<h2>Key findings</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>CEO pay at Low-Wage 100 firms has soared since 2019 while median worker pay has lagged behind U.S. inflation.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Between 2019 and 2024, average CEO compensation within this group rose 34.7 percent in nominal — unadjusted for inflation — terms, more than double the 16.3 percent increase in these firms’ average median worker pay. The U.S. inflation rate over this same period: 22.6 percent.</li>



<li>Average CEO compensation within the Low-Wage 100 hit $17.2 million in 2024. The group’s average median worker pay sat at just $35,570.</li>



<li><strong>The average CEO-worker pay ratio of Low-Wage 100 firms has widened by 12.9 percent, from 560 to 1 in 2019 to 632 to 1 in 2024.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The nominal value of median pay actually <em>fell</em> at 22 Low-Wage 100 corporations during this period.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Starbucks pay gap hit 6,666 to 1 last year</strong>, the Low-Wage 100’s widest spread by far. In 2024, the Starbucks CEO pocketed $95.8 million.<strong> </strong>Over the past six years, amid worker discontent fueling union-organizing drives at hundreds of Starbucks stores, the firm’s median pay rose just 4.2 percent in real terms to $14,674. Only seven S&amp;P 500 firms have lower median pay.</li>



<li><strong>Ulta Beauty reported the Low-Wage 100’s steepest drop in median pay</strong>. Between 2019 and 2024, a period when the cosmetic retailer significantly expanded the part-time worker share of its workforce, the company’s real median pay plunged by 46 percent to $11,078.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>From 2019 through 2024, the Low-Wage 100 spent $644 billion on stock buybacks.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over the past six years, all but three Low-Wage 100 firms spent corporate dollars on stock buybacks</strong>. By repurchasing their own shares, companies artificially inflate executive stock-based pay and siphon resources out of worker wages and productive long-term investments.</li>



<li><strong>Lowe’s ranks as the Low-Wage 100’s buyback leader. The company spent $46.6 billion on share repurchases from 2019 through 2024</strong>. Over that span, this sum could have funded an annual $28,456 bonus for each of the firm’s 273,000 employees — or added 88 employees to each of the firm’s retail outlets. <strong>In 2024, Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison enjoyed a total compensation of $20.2 million —</strong> <strong>659 times more than the retailer’s $30,606 median annual worker pay</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Home Depot currently sits second in the Low-Wage 100 buyback rankings</strong>. The big-box chain spent $37.9 billion on share repurchases between 2019 and 2024. That outlay would have been enough to give each of Home Depot’s 470,100 global employees six annual $13,423 bonuses. The Home Depot median pay: just $35,196.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>From 2019 through 2024, a majority of Low-Wage 100 firms spent more on stock buybacks than on long-term capital expenditures.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over the past six years, <strong>56 Low-Wage 100 companies plowed more corporate cash into buying back their own shares of stock than investing in capital improvements</strong>.</li>



<li>If we exclude capital expenditure outlier Amazon from the calculation, <strong>the Low-Wage 100 as a whole spent more on buybacks than on “CapEx” during this period</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>At least 32 billionaires owe their wealth to Low-Wage 100 companies.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Five of these firms have spawned multiple billionaires still living today: Walmart (eight), Estee Lauder (four), DoorDash (three), Public Storage (two), and Tyson Foods (two).</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Policy changes can prevent wasteful stock buybacks and excessive CEO payouts.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxing extreme CEO-worker pay gaps: </strong>In<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2024/4/dfp_progressive_leg_agenda_tabs.pdf">one recent survey</a>, 80 percent of likely voters expressed support for a tax hike on corporations that pay their CEO over 50 or more times what they pay their median employees.</li>



<li><strong>Increasing the buybacks tax:</strong> If Congress in 2022 had set our current <a href="https://inequality.org/research/congress-takes-historic-step-to-tax-stock-buybacks/">1 percent excise tax</a> on stock buybacks at 4 percent, the Low-Wage 100 would have owed approximately $6.3 billion in additional federal taxes on share repurchases in 2023 and 2024.</li>



<li><strong>Restricting buybacks and CEO pay through federal contracts and subsidies:</strong> The Biden administration made modest progress on this front through the CHIPS semiconductor subsidy program. But the federal government could be doing much more to leverage the power of the public purse against wasteful stock buybacks and excessive CEO pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>



<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>



<p>We highlight three particularly promising areas for CEO pay policy reform.</p>



<h4>Subjecting corporations with excessive levels of CEO pay to higher tax levies.</h4>



<p>Higher tax rates on companies with wide CEO-worker pay gaps would create an incentive to both rein in executive pay and raise worker wages, all the while generating significant new capital for vital public investments. Laws that share those goals are already generating revenue in <a href="https://inequality.org/action/corporate-pay-equity/">two major cities</a>, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.</p>



<p>Members of the U.S. Congress have also introduced several related bills, including:</p>



<p>The<strong> Curtailing Executive Overcompensation (CEO) Act: </strong>This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3176">bill</a> applies an excise tax to publicly traded and private companies with CEO-to-median-worker pay disparities that run over 50 to 1. Under this excise tax formula, the tax owed would be proportional to the degree a company’s pay ratio exceeds 50 to 1 and to the level of the CEO’s compensation. In other words, companies with large pay gaps would owe extra taxes — and those companies with extremely high CEO pay would owe Uncle Sam even more.</p>



<p>Revenue estimate: This bill, had it been in effect in 2022, would have raised <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-lee-ocasio-cortez-introduce-legislation-to-increase-worker-pay-rein-in-runaway-ceo-compensation/">over $10 billion</a> in annual revenue from the <em>Fortune</em> 100 largest U.S. companies alone.</p>



<p>The<strong> Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act:</strong> This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3620?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Tax+Excessive+CEO+Pay+Act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=3">legislation</a> ties a company’s federal corporate tax rate to the size of the gap between its CEO and median worker pay. Tax penalties would begin at 0.5 percentage points for companies that pay their top executives between 50 and 100 times more than their median workers. The highest penalty would apply to companies that pay top executives over 500 times worker pay.</p>



<p>Revenue estimate: <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-combat-corporate-greed-and-end-outrageous-ceo-pay-2/">$150 billion over 10 years</a>. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3301">CEO Accountability and Responsibility Act</a> imposes similar tax penalties for large ratios and ties the pay ratio to government contracting.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2024/4/dfp_progressive_leg_agenda_tabs.pdf">May 2024 survey</a> suggests that such taxes would be enormously popular. Overall, 80 percent of likely voters favor a tax hike on corporations that pay their CEOs over 50 or more times more than what they pay their median employees.</p>



<h4>Taxing and restricting stock buybacks.</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://inequality.org/research/congress-takes-historic-step-to-tax-stock-buybacks/">1 percent federal excise tax</a> on the repurchase of corporate stock went into effect in 2023. With nearly $209 billion in combined stock buybacks for 2023 and 2024, the Low-Wage 100 owed approximately $2.1 billion in federal taxes over those two years.</p>



<p>A Senate bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/413?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22chamberActionDateCode%3A%5C%222023-02-14%7C118%7C10000%5C%22+AND+billIsReserved%3A%5C%22N%5C%22%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=16">Stock Buyback Accountability Act</a>, would quadruple this excise tax. If that 4 percent tax had been in place in 2023 and 2024, the Low-Wage 100 would have owed approximately $6.3 billion in additional federal taxes on their share repurchases, assuming no change in their buyback behavior. That increase would be enough to cover the cost of <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/interactive-data/trade-offs/?state=00&amp;program=111111">327,218</a> public housing units each year for two years.</p>



<p>Another Senate bill, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/3/warner-introduces-legislation-to-encourages-companies-to-prioritize-long-term-investments-over-short-term-gains-by-instituting-holding-periods-for-stock-buybacks">ALIGN Act</a>, would ban executives from selling their shares within a year of a stock buyback announcement. This would prevent CEOs from timing share repurchases to cash in personally on a short-term price pop they themselves have artificially created.</p>



<h4>Using federal contracts and subsidies to discourage wide corporate pay gaps.</h4>



<p>The Biden administration took several steps to use the power of the public purse to discourage CEO pay-inflating stock buybacks. During the Biden White House years, the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/28/CHIPS_NOFO-1_Fact_Sheet_0.pdf">Department of Commerce</a> gave preferential treatment in the awarding of $39 billion in CHIPS subsidies for domestic semiconductor production to firms that committed to refraining from all stock buybacks for five years.</p>



<p>Future administrations could do much more to leverage the power of the public purse against extreme pay disparities. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4186?s=1&amp;r=5#:~:text=Introduced%20in%20House%20(06%2F25%2F2021)&amp;text=This%20bill%20establishes%20new%20requirements,taxes%2C%20and%20private%20equity%20firms.">Patriotic Corporations Act</a> could serve as a model. This bill would grant preferential treatment in federal contracting to firms with CEO-worker pay ratios of 100 to 1 or less, among other benchmarks. The <a href="https://progressives.house.gov/_cache/files/6/8/68a45450-d818-4c0c-a564-cd85ea395d47/88561AA25D995B4AF31FCC6F40CA177D.cpc-recommendations-for-executive-action-3-17-22.pdf">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a> has supported such incentives.</p>



<p>By encouraging major corporations to narrow their pay gaps, a president can also help ensure that taxpayers get the biggest bang for federal contract bucks. <a href="https://inequality.org/action/corporate-pay-equity/#academic-research">Studies have shown</a> that companies with narrow gaps in CEO-worker compensation tend to perform at higher levels than firms with wide gaps.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    
    

    <div>
  

<p>One of my favorite little bits of python is <code>__subclasshook__</code>. Abstract Base Classes with <code>__subclasshook__</code> can define what counts as a subclass of the ABC, even if the target doesn’t know about the ABC. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>class</span> <span>PalindromicName</span><span>(ABC):</span>
   
  <span>@classmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(cls,</span> <span>C):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>C</span><span>.</span><span>__name__</span><span>.</span><span>lower()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>name[::</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>name</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Abba</span><span>:</span>
  <span>...</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Baba</span><span>:</span>
  <span>...</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>isinstance(Abba(),</span> <span>PalindromicName)</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>isinstance(Baba(),</span> <span>PalindromicName)</span>
<span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can do some weird stuff with this. Back in 2019 I used it to create <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/negatypes/">non-monotonic types</a>, where something counts as a <code>NotIterable</code> if it <em>doesn’t</em> have the <code>__iter__</code> method. There wasn’t anything too diabolical you could do with this: nothing in Python really interacted with ABCs, limiting the damage you could do with production code.</p>

<p>Then Python 3.10 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">added pattern matching</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/_pj7e4VKqDoAAAAC/elmo-burning.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="a-quick-overview-of-pattern-matching">A quick overview of pattern matching</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/">pattern matching tutorial</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>match</span> <span>command</span><span>.</span><span>split():</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>[</span><span>"quit"</span><span>]:</span>
        <span>print(</span><span>"Goodbye!"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>quit_game()</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>[</span><span>"look"</span><span>]:</span>
        <span>current_room</span><span>.</span><span>describe()</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>[</span><span>"get"</span><span>,</span> <span>obj]:</span>
        <span>character</span><span>.</span><span>get(obj,</span> <span>current_room)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can match on arrays, dictionaries, and custom objects. To support matching objects, Python uses <code>isinstance(obj, class)</code>, which checks</p>

<ol>
<li>If <code>obj</code> is of type <code>class</code></li>
<li>If <code>obj</code> is a transitive subtype of <code>class</code></li>
<li>If <code>class</code> is an ABC and defines a <code>__subclasshook__</code> that matches the type of <code>obj</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>That made me wonder if ABCs could “hijack” a pattern match. Something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span>

<span>class</span> <span>NotIterable</span><span>(ABC):</span>

    <span>@classmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(cls,</span> <span>C):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>not</span> <span>hasattr(C,</span> <span>"__iter__"</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(x):</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>x:</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>NotIterable():</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is not iterable"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>case</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is iterable"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span><span>:</span>
    <span>f(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
    <span>f(</span><span>"string"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>f([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But surely Python clamps down on this chicanery, right?</p>

<pre><code>$ py10 abc.py
10 is not iterable
string is iterable
[1, 2, 3] is iterable
</code></pre>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Oh my.</p>

<h3 id="making-it-worse">Making it worse</h3>

<p>Pattern matching can also <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/#adding-a-ui-matching-objects">destructure object fields</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>match</span> <span>event</span><span>.</span><span>get():</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Click(position</span><span>=</span><span>(x,</span> <span>y)):</span>
        <span>handle_click_at(x,</span> <span>y)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can only get the field <em>after</em> we’ve decided the object. We can’t match “any object that has the <code>foo</code> field”… unless we use ABCs.<sup id="fnref:property"><a href="#fn:property">1</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span>

<p>It gets better! While the ABC decides the match, the object decides the destructuring, meaning we can do stuff like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(x):</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>x:</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>DistanceMetric(z</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>):</span>

            <span>print(</span><span>f"A point with a z-coordinate that's not 3"</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="combinators">Combinators</h3>

<p>The pattern matching is flexible but also fairly limited. It can only match on an object’s type, meaning we have to make a separate ABC for each thing we want to test. Fortunately, there’s a way around this. Python is dynamically typed. 99% of the time this just means “you don’t need static types if you’re okay with things crashing at runtime”. But it <em>also</em> means that type information exists at runtime, and that <strong>types can be created at runtime</strong>.</p>

<p>Can we use this for pattern matching? Let’s try it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>Not</span><span>(cls):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>_Not</span><span>(ABC):</span>
        <span>@classmethod</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(_,</span> <span>C):</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>not</span> <span>issubclass(C,</span> <span>cls)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>_Not</span>

<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(x):</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>x:</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>Not(DistanceMetric)():</span> 
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is not a point"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>case</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is a point"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>Not</code> is a function that takes a class, defines a <em>new</em> ABC, sets the hook for that ABC to “anything that’s not the class”, and then returns that ABC.</p>

<p>We try this and…</p>

<pre><code>    case Not(DistanceMetric)():
                            ^
SyntaxError: expected ':'
</code></pre>

<p>It’s an error! We’ve finally hit the limits of pattern matching on ABCs. Then again, it’s “just” a syntax error. Maybe it would work if we tweak the syntax a little?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>+   n = Not(DistanceMetric)</span>
<span> </span>   match x:
<span>-       case Not(DistanceMetric)(): </span>
<span>+       case n(): </span>
</code></pre></div>

<pre><code>PlanePoint(x=10, y=10) is a point
SpacePoint(x=5, y=6, z=7) is a point
[1, 2, 3] is not a point
</code></pre>

<p>Success! And just to test that this is composable, let’s write an <code>And</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span>
<span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>collections.abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>Not</span><span>(cls):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>_Not</span><span>(ABC):</span>
        <span>@classmethod</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(_,</span> <span>C):</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>not</span> <span>issubclass(C,</span> <span>cls)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>_Not</span>

<span>def</span> <span>And</span><span>(cls1,</span> <span>cls2):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>_And</span><span>(ABC):</span>
        <span>@classmethod</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(_,</span> <span>C):</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>issubclass(C,</span> <span>cls1)</span> <span>and</span> <span>issubclass(C,</span> <span>cls2)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>_And</span>


<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(x):</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>And(Iterable,</span> <span>Not(str))</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>x:</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>n():</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is a non-string iterable"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>str():</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is a string"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>case</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is a string or not-iterable"</span><span>)</span>


<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span><span>:</span>
    <span>f(</span><span>"abc"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>f([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This works as “”“expected”“”.</p>

<h3 id="caching-rules-everything-around-me">Caching Rules Everything Around Me</h3>

<p>This got me thinking: what if <code>__subclasshook__</code> wasn’t a pure function? Could I make an ABC that matched the <em>first</em> value of each type passed in, but not subsequent ones?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="py"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OneWay</span><span>(ABC):</span>
    <span>seen_classes</span> <span>=</span> <span>set()</span>

    <span>@classmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(cls,</span> <span>C):</span>
        <span>print(</span><span>f"trying {</span><span>C</span><span>}"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>C</span> <span>in</span> <span>cls</span><span>.</span><span>seen_classes:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>False</span>
        <span>cls</span><span>.</span><span>seen_classes</span> <span>|=</span> <span>{C}</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>True</span>




<span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(x):</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>x:</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>OneWay():</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"{</span><span>x</span><span>} is a new class"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>case</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>f"we've seen {</span><span>x</span><span>}'s class before"</span><span>)</span>


<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span><span>:</span>
    <span>f(</span><span>"abc"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>f([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span>
    <span>f(</span><span>"efg"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sadly, this was all for naught.</p>

<pre><code>trying &lt;class 'str'&gt;
abc is a new class
trying &lt;class 'list'&gt;
[1, 2, 3] is a new class
efg is a new class
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like <code>__subclasshook__</code> caches the results for a given type check. CPython assumes that people don’t want to shove side effects into esoteric corners of the language. Show’s how much <em>they</em> know.</p>

<p>We can still have fun with side effects, though. This ABC lets through every-other type.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>class</span> <span>FlipFlop</span><span>(ABC):</span>
    <span>flag</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>

    <span>@classmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(cls,</span> <span>_):</span>
        <span>cls</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span> <span>=</span> <span>not</span> <span>cls</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>cls</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this ABC asks the user what it should do for each type.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Ask</span><span>(ABC):</span>
    <span>first_class</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>@classmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__subclasshook__</span><span>(cls,</span> <span>C):</span>
        <span>choice</span> <span>=</span> <span>input(</span><span>f"hey should I let {</span><span>C</span><span>} though [y/n]  "</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>choice</span> <span>==</span> <span>'y'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print(</span><span>"okay we'll pass em through"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Try them in a pattern match. They both work!</p>

<h2 id="should-i-use-this">Should I use this?</h2>

<p>God no.</p>

<p>The pattern matching feature is, on the whole, pretty reasonably designed, and people will expect it to behave in reasonable ways. Whereas <code>__subclasshook__</code> is <em>extremely</em> dark magic. This kind of chicanery <em>might</em> have a place in the dark beating heart of a complex library, certainly not for any code your coworkers will have to deal with.</p>

<p>So yeah, you didn’t learn anything useful. I just like horrible things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <p>I’ve been coding entirely with Claude Code for the past two months. At first it was exhilarating. I was speeding through tasks. I was committing like mad.</p>
<p>Now, as I’ve built up a fairly substantial app, it’s slowed to a crawl. Ironically, the app I’m building lets me parallelize many instances of Claude Code at once.</p>
<p>Often, I’ll have 5 instances running while I’m thinking about new features.</p>
<p>The slowness comes in when I actually need to review all the PRs. One by one, I have to apply them locally. One by one, I have to step through the console logs. One by one, I have to tell Claude to fix the issues it created.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s faster. I’m committing an incredible amount of code these days—more than I ever have.</p>
<p>It also feels incredibly, maddeningly slow. Once you’ve felt that first boost of speed with Claude Code, you want every coding task to feel like that. <a href="https://steipete.me/posts/just-one-more-prompt">It’s addictive.</a></p>
<p>Instead, as you build, you still have to serve as Claude’s QA engineer.</p>
<p>Maybe one day we’ll solve that. But I’m skeptical it will be in the form of a CLAUDE.md. I can barely get Claude to consistently follow the bare set of rules I have, much less ensure it performs a complex integration test for a web app.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll keep pulling PRs locally, adding more git hooks to enforce code quality, and zooming through coding tasks—only to realize ChatGPT and Claude hallucinated library features and I now have to rip out Clerk and implement GitHub OAuth from scratch.</p>

<p><em>This is the story of how a circle of popular science communicators, who built their brands on championing free inquiry, worked to suppress scientific critique. Of how Eric Weinstein, the man who condemns the scientific community for suppressing his and his family’s work, nearly succeeded in cancelling me through intimidation and false threats. And of how Sabine Hossenfelder spins the truth for the sake of audience capture and podcast hosts Brian Keating and Curt Jaimungal prioritize tribe loyalty over the scientific process. In revealing personal details I have kept private for years, this account shows the lengths to which the individuals involved have gone in order to deceive the public.&nbsp;</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Science communication, at its best, serves a noble purpose: to act as a bridge between the intricate, often intimidating world of scientific research and the public’s curiosity. Skilled communicators translate complexity into clarity, demystify the scientific process, and inspire a shared sense of wonder. Yet a growing and troubling trend has emerged: the rise of the contrarian science communicator. These are not easily dismissed cranks. They are skilled performers who blend legitimate science with dubious claims, making it hard to separate the valuable from the misleading.</p>



<p>One of the most prominent examples is the contrarian physics subculture centered around Eric Weinstein, which includes Sabine Hossenfelder, Brian Keating, and Curt Jaimungal. These figures command millions of followers across social media and have built their reputations by tackling charged topics in physics, such as the validity of string theory or the claim that theoretical physics faces a crisis. Their YouTube channels feature long, thoughtful discussions with leading physicists like Roger Penrose and Leonard Susskind, and both Hossenfelder and Keating are professional physicists with undeniable expertise in their respective areas. Taken at face value, their content and profiles thus suggest that they are doing a valuable service in making science accessible and entertaining to the public.</p>



<p>But this engagement with legitimate science conceals a concerted effort to suppress criticism and mislead the public. The deception exposes the central problem facing these prominent science communicators: they are willing to trade scientific integrity for audience capture and tribal loyalty. A prime example of this dilemma is that of Weinstein’s so-called “Geometric Unity” (GU), a proposed theory of everything first unveiled in 2013 and revived in the 2020s through podcast appearances. Despite its lack of seriousness as a scientific theory, GU continues to be entertained by Hossenfelder, Keating, and Jaimungal. As an author of the first scientifically-detailed rebuttal of GU, I have directly witnessed how this contrarian cohort reacts when their ideas or allies face substantive criticism. It lays bare their gross hypocrisy of claiming to be champions for unorthodox views while working hard to ignore or suppress challenges to one of their own. This post is a firsthand account of their campaign to silence dissent.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> In what follows, I will discuss Geometric Unity as if it were unambiguously known to be unserious and flawed. For those uncertain or new to the subject, this will be justified later in the section “The Jury Is Already In”.</p>



<h2>The Eric Weinstein Affair: A Short Recap</h2>



<p>Eric Weinstein wears many hats. With a PhD in mathematics from Harvard, he has worked as a managing director of Thiel Capital, founded the “Intellectual Dark Web,” and regularly comments on a wide range of topics on popular podcasts. Crucially however, Weinstein sits squarely outside the scientific establishment, having left academia a few years after completing his doctorate in the early 1990s with only a single published and forgotten paper. His Geometric Unity proposal, therefore, has all the hallmarks of an outsider attempting to revolutionize physics, casting him as an Einstein-like figure toiling alone at the patent office.</p>



<p>But the noteworthy aspect of GU is not its scientific merit or lack thereof. Rather, it is how GU ties into Eric Weinstein’s narrative of being an outcast decrying the profound failures of our institutions. Indeed, Weinstein has built his public persona around the concept of a “Distributed Idea Suppression Complex” (<a href="https://youtu.be/QxnkGymKuuI?si=BVtwZSG_22tGD2Jy">DISC</a>), an alleged establishment in academia and science that marginalizes or silences brilliant outsiders with revolutionary ideas. Within this framework, GU is presented as a transformative proposal that powerful institutions are too fearful to engage with. This creates a self-reinforcing loop: when physicists ignore the work, it confirms that the DISC is real, but when they criticize it, they are cast as bad-faith agents protecting their entrenched paradigms. In this way, Geometric Unity functions as a foundation for Weinstein’s personal brand of scientific and institutional grievances.</p>



<p>Until April 2021, the only public material on GU was a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rd04KzLcg&amp;pp=ygUeZXJpYyB3ZWluc3RlaW4gZ2VvbWV0cmljIHVuaXR5">video</a> of Weinstein’s highly technical 2013 Oxford lecture. That few could follow it allowed Weinstein’s grievances to go unchecked. The situation changed in February 2021 when a detailed scientific <a href="https://files.timothynguyen.org/geometric_unity.pdf">rebuttal</a>, authored by myself and Theo Polya, was released.<sup data-fn="4c352d1d-79df-4aea-9105-5366061e4738"><a href="#4c352d1d-79df-4aea-9105-5366061e4738" id="4c352d1d-79df-4aea-9105-5366061e4738-link">1</a></sup> My critique directly tested Weinstein’s narrative: how would he respond to the thorough feedback he long claimed to want, which was free from the institutional and academic conventions he so strongly condemned?<sup data-fn="5f5a9faf-dd45-4cf3-8a2c-613959c6204a"><a href="#5f5a9faf-dd45-4cf3-8a2c-613959c6204a" id="5f5a9faf-dd45-4cf3-8a2c-613959c6204a-link">2</a></sup> The outcome was that instead of engaging with the substance of the critique, Weinstein and his circle deployed a playbook of tactics designed to suppress, deflect, and protect his contrarian brand at all costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Anatomy of the Grift</h2>



<h2>Suppress Your Critics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When I initially released my response paper to Geometric Unity in 2021, unknown to the public, Weinstein immediately tried to suppress it. Now that four years have passed, and the risk of personal drama overshadowing the scientific legitimacy of the rebuttal is gone, I feel that the time has come to reveal the full story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most direct incident concerns Weinstein’s attempt to block my podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o31cGMENDTI">episode</a> on <em>Eigenbros</em>, a show specializing in physics hosted by two physics graduates. In our episode, I presented a two-hour whiteboard lecture giving a gentle exposition of my paper and a refutation of Weinstein’s baseless <a href="https://youtu.be/8_uiqjO1IEU?si=9uuereikfD_Rv8bW&amp;t=5078">claim</a> that he had originally discovered what are now known as the Seiberg-Witten equations. Our episode was released on Friday June 18, 2021. The following morning I received a message from <em>Eigenbros </em>on Discord, who wanted to speak to me on the phone. What they revealed was utterly despicable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weinstein had called them earlier and implied that if they kept the video online, there could be “legal action”. The intimidation worked; <em>Eigenbros </em>took the video down for the better part of that Saturday. In response, I immediately reassured them that the threat was a baseless bluff: what would be the basis for legal action? The <a href="https://timothynguyen.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/f752e-1mtc4frxmdfsfv5tj3itbrg.webp">copyright</a> notice on his Geometric Unity paper? Bullshit. After my phone call with <em>Eigenbros</em>, the video went back up. Rumors circulated about Weinstein’s potential involvement in the disruption, e.g. in a Facebook thread shown below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeuArp68LFzjWKrMJMm9P7pnfwNxJtMUnDUBEGIdh0dtSdp7xDvlCBY12JhVmWhmE7nRjxR3jlAnECZccmtbParRUk9A5Q-DQgSAAHCFFPEBGoJ67itqRhEFMKa_crMzj0nAFEuOg?key=lmBFMXKQq2DciE8O8OstVA" alt=""></figure>



<p>But at the request of the hosts who wanted to avoid public controversy, I never spoke of the situation publicly until now. This is the suppression incident I alluded to in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j86WIfRfPDk&amp;t=6339s">interview</a> in the following month with Bob Wright, which Bob duly noted in his <a href="https://www.nonzero.org/p/is-eric-weinstein-a-crackpot">retrospective</a> of our conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, Weinstein’s suppression efforts began months earlier. Immediately after our paper’s release, Curt Jaimungal, a friend of Weinstein and host of the popular <em>Theories of Everything</em> podcast, reached out to invite me and my co-author on his show. He proposed a date “6-8 weeks” out, which in hindsight was clearly meant to coordinate with Weinstein’s own paper release on April 1st. I agreed to the interview, noting my co-author’s wish for anonymity. Curt was pleased and said he would follow up.</p>



<p>But the follow-up never came. When I reached out in May, Curt punted, citing a hectic schedule. The truth about the situation came out a month later during the <em>Eigenbros </em>affair. In his call, Weinstein revealed to the hosts that Curt had cancelled his interview with me. It’s not hard to put two and two together: Weinstein told Curt to call off my interview and then tried to use that cancellation as leverage to discredit me.</p>



<p>We thus have a disturbing truth. Eric Weinstein, the man who waxes poetic about a Distributed Idea Suppression Complex, is a hypocrite willing to use his own influence to squash criticism. Weinstein’s grievances and tale of persecution are frequently invoked to serve his narrative, yet when he receives opposition, he is willing to use his own power to suppress others.</p>



<h2>Attack the Person, Not the Science</h2>



<p>A month after the release of the GU paper, Weinstein was asked publicly about my critique in a now infamous Clubhouse <a href="https://ok.ru/video/2552683563745">discussion</a>, hosted by Brian Keating, a close friend of Weinstein, distinguished professor of physics at UC San Diego, and host of the popular <em>Into the Impossible</em> podcast. When pressed on scientific details, Weinstein didn’t address the physics and instead demanded to know the identity of my anonymous co-author Theo Polya.<sup data-fn="636785f9-94c8-4831-8051-8a3a00800328"><a href="#636785f9-94c8-4831-8051-8a3a00800328" id="636785f9-94c8-4831-8051-8a3a00800328-link">3</a></sup> Furthermore, he launched into an incoherent word salad of accusations about Theo Polya (and thus by extension myself), invoking references to misogyny, rape jokes, and 4chan. To borrow a phrase of Weinstein’s during his recent <a href="https://youtu.be/5m7LnLgvMnM?si=d-Zr_Hjeq2Ma2VIu&amp;t=2360">debate</a> with Sean Carroll: “How dare you Eric”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The takeaway from that cringeworthy session was that Weinstein, together with Keating, refused to engage with our critique because they didn’t know who Theo Polya was. I feel it is hardly worth stating but I’ll do so anyway: what does the anonymity of one of two authors have to do with the merits of a critique? If Geometric Unity is so visionary, why would it matter? It’s a classic bait-and-switch. Weinstein, who demands his ideas be judged on merit alone, retreats from the science and falls back on personal attacks as soon as his ideas are actually challenged.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Protect Your Tribe&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It is illuminating to see how Sabine Hossenfelder, Brian Keating, and Curt Jaimungal have been continuing to bolster Weinstein over the years, either directly through promoting his ideas when they know better or else indirectly by amplifying ambiguity about the status of his work.</p>



<p>I already discussed how Curt was complicit in cancelling my interview, which would have been critical of GU. Despite the seriousness he projects by hosting top scientists, he continues to treat GU as a substantive proposal, inviting many guests to give their (uninformed) opinion on GU while giving zero attention to the singularly critical work that is my rebuttal.<sup data-fn="a14f1ba7-9bfb-4219-a5b4-b1f10a812ce7"><a href="#a14f1ba7-9bfb-4219-a5b4-b1f10a812ce7" id="a14f1ba7-9bfb-4219-a5b4-b1f10a812ce7-link">4</a></sup> In fact, he requested a copy of my interview from <em>Eigenbros</em> when the video was briefly taken down, though he has never made any reference to it whatsoever. Even if one were to suppose Curt had disagreements with the critique, he is someone who platforms people with a diversity of viewpoints, including outsiders like Chris Langan and UAP specialists. That Curt would compromise his intellectual openness and rigor in order to promote and protect Weinstein is a tragic consequence of tribalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A similar and more pronounced story holds for Brian Keating, Weinstein’s most prominent promoter and staunch defender. Indeed, Brian continually hosts Eric Weinstein on his podcast (over 30 times as of this writing), many of which explicitly promote Geometric Unity. His strong support of Weinstein takes on many forms, including hosting him as a <a href="https://youtu.be/AzsZO3_WhDA?si=DqaR4LR-HPj5BOWz&amp;t=3330">scholar in residence</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVkUya368Es">speaker</a> at UC San Diego, expressing interest in experimentally <a href="https://youtu.be/AzsZO3_WhDA?si=dOd3orolxR5GKS0O&amp;t=3341">testing</a> GU, and inviting scientists to engage with Weinstein and his work (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_aN8NnoeO0">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI0AZ4Y4Ip4">here</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/nhGwJLXzHs8?si=-IWdTLp8LBh5vgoe&amp;t=11638">here</a>). So if there is anyone else other than Weinstein who has a vested interest in getting to the bottom of my critique of GU, it would be Brian.</p>



<p>Two weeks after the release of my response paper and shortly after Sabine hosted my blogpost, Theo Polya and I sent the following message to Brian:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDsai3NIsE5uZ_7vs49HYf8oJ_1bzxzS_HGUKZ-2fSSLk87s_qsR5dM9ftTLXk1R1FbkUDa-OhgRvDpaHQGheKU1b-O8sYUNO_BOkJrfgiW5ADG0-HFHjmiJ2HpzPkoQE-X0OMkg?key=lmBFMXKQq2DciE8O8OstVA" alt=""></figure>



<p>We received no response, not even a reply to ask “Who is Theo Polya?”, the question used by both Weinstein and Brian in their Clubhouse discussion two months later to deflect engaging with our critique.</p>



<p>A few months after this email, I was contacted by Brandon Van Dyck shortly after he heard of my appearance on Wright’s podcast to record a follow-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88E2pp7xafo">interview</a> (later provocatively titled “The Eric Weinstein/Timothy Nguyen Affair”). By pure coincidence, Brian had reached out to Brandon at the same time, expressing an interest in being on Brandon’s show. Brandon and I took the opportunity to propose to Brian that he could have a conversation with me (either about Weinstein, his book <em>Losing the Nobel Prize</em>, or any other topic of his choosing). In response, Brian withdrew his self-invitation, saying he was “not interested”, as we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88E2pp7xafo&amp;t=4980s">discussed</a> in our interview. The dodging continued when Michael Shermer and I publicly invited both Brian and Eric Weinstein for a discussion with me on Michael’s podcast (<a href="https://x.com/IAmTimNguyen/status/1706363756299563078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1706363756299563078%7Ctwgr%5E18eddeb15fb70f561beaae1b214254eb0cfea785%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F16ryy7c%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse">here</a> and <a href="https://x.com/michaelshermer/status/1706455867925602789">here</a>), after Michael was unsuccessful in asking Brian privately to participate. Again, no response.</p>



<p>It’s one thing to be unwilling to speak to critics. Casting aspersions on them to avoid defending your position is another matter entirely. On other podcasts, Brian has claimed I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1VIur9mfS-A?si=fRONBXLeltdR70Hk&amp;t=2449">not acting in good-faith</a> and that I’m trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/Hz3waSvyUDg?si=xB4XA2EqTyy7rX0u&amp;t=5635">“bait” him</a>, which are just additional examples of how Brian is going after the messenger rather than sticking to the science. The simple truth is that he and Weinstein have refused every opportunity to address the criticisms of GU in order to keep the charade running. Brian’s criticism of my character is also difficult to process in light of Weinstein’s attack of me on Clubhouse and the attempted suppression of my work. It is an embarrassing state of affairs to see a distinguished professor of physics so obviously acting in bad-faith.</p>



<p>Finally, we get to Sabine Hossenfelder, a theoretical physicist with over 1.5 million followers on YouTube who has built a reputation for giving sharp no-nonsense scientific critiques. Her role in the GU affair is more complicated and, in my case, unfortunate. Until recently, Sabine had been dismissive of Weinstein’s work. However, a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiFYcuoK490&amp;vl=en">video</a> of hers (titled <em>Physicists are afraid of Eric Weinstein — and they should be</em>) paints a very different picture. In it, she waffles all over the place about her opinion of Weinstein’s work and how much time she’s spent looking at it. She’s inconsistent with her messaging, <a href="https://youtu.be/KiFYcuoK490?si=eEPbqjeYh6xg9VrH&amp;t=83">saying</a> that “she never looked into [Geometric Unity] in any detail” but clearly saying the <a href="https://youtu.be/mdu9KvLxHFg?si=55RPnltcqOzaMGzI&amp;t=386">opposite</a> in an older video. It honestly doesn’t interest me to micro-police how Sabine chooses to express her opinions – her statements have all the flair of entertainment and so cannot be taken too literally. The problem is that Sabine appears to be employing ambiguity to present two incompatible positions: on the one hand, she wants to play honest critic on scientific matters (“Eric’s theory is a waste of time”), but she also wants to claim that Weinstein and his bandwagon deserve credit for being contrarian. It’s this latter step where she’s acting dishonestly, as I will now explain.</p>



<p>Rewinding to July of 2021, I reached out to Sabine, whom I had recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX0nhdHCU60">interviewed</a> at Google, and I explained to her my frustration with the aforementioned Clubhouse episode (which she had watched). To my delight, she revealed she was speaking to Brian soon and would ask him about me. But when Sabine got back to me a few weeks later over Zoom, I was shocked by the message she brought. Sabine repeated and supported Brian’s claims that my co-author’s anonymity was the cause of Brian’s refusal to speak to me. She recounts that she has had to deal with anonymous trolls herself and that she doesn’t feel the need to respond to them. When I raised the fact that <em>I</em> wasn’t anonymous, she said that Brian deflected, noting that GU was Weinstein’s theory and that it wasn’t his prerogative to talk to me about it. When asked why he declined going on Brandon’s podcast to talk to me, his excuse was that it was insulting to be invited only to speak about Weinstein and not himself (contrary to what was offered to Brian and that Brian had in fact invited himself onto Brandon’s podcast). In summary, I got nowhere with Sabine talking to Brian on my behalf.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, I owed Sabine a tremendous debt of gratitude for hosting my blogpost in March 2021 that advertised my critique of GU. I had no public profile back then and her platform gave my work the reach and legitimacy it needed to get off the ground. Because of this, I kept Sabine’s confusing report about Brian to myself. I even <a href="https://x.com/IAmTimNguyen/status/1705617321388015865">met</a> Sabine in person at the HowTheLightGetsIn Festival in London 2023 and found her very agreeable and sincere in person. Nevertheless, I always had the suspicion that Sabine might really have been shielding Brian by gaslighting me. That intuition was confirmed in Sabine’s recent video in which she claims that Brian “deserves credit for not chickening out and standing for Eric” and that Curt’s explainer video of GU was “courageous”. Such words are baffling given our private conversation and her being qualified to understand the validity of my critique of GU hosted on her own blog. I now clearly see the situation for what it is. Sabine is just as guilty of grifting as Brian and Curt.</p>



<p>This incident is particularly unfortunate in Sabine’s case, as she has cultivated a reputation as a respected physics communicator and science writer known for her sharp critiques of theoretical physics. Regardless of one’s stance with her contrarian views, she has in the past offered many perspectives on the state of theoretical physics worthy of attention, both on her blog and her book <em>Lost in Math</em>. Thus, her most recent video concerning Weinstein reflects poorly on her not only because of the personal circumstances I’ve now disclosed but also due to its strong departure from reason: in it, she also labels the theoretical physics community a “f-cking hypocrisy” and “scam” by equating the quality of their work with that of Weinstein’s Geometric Unity. This claim is so outrageous that physicist Christian Ferko shortly afterwards made a detailed presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oipI5TQ54tA">debunking</a> this absurd false equivalence. It is a sad state of affairs to see Sabine undermine her own credibility by exploiting the sensationalism surrounding Weinstein and GU merely to incite outrage and air her grievances against academic and physics communities. And like Weinstein, she is willing to censor her critics rather than address them.<sup data-fn="40b141e3-7725-496a-b19e-421482b40630"><a href="#40b141e3-7725-496a-b19e-421482b40630" id="40b141e3-7725-496a-b19e-421482b40630-link">5</a></sup></p>



<h2>The Jury is Already In</h2>



<p>Scientific disagreements are intricate matters that require the attention of highly trained experts. However, for laypersons to be able to make up their own minds on such issues, they have to rely on proxies for credibility such as persuasiveness and conviction. This is the vulnerability that contrarians exploit, as they are often skilled in crafting the optics and rhetoric to support their case. Indeed, Weinstein and Hossenfelder’s strong personalities and their sowing of distrust in institutions enable them to persuade others of the correctness of their views when they deviate from those of experts. Thus, I include this section to show that even if one were to rely on social cues alone, there is in fact no controversy about the illegitimacy of Geometric Unity among those who are close to Weinstein or who are qualified to judge. The success of physics grifters has relied on the fact that they make more noise than those who have quietly moved on.</p>



<h2>Lex Fridman</h2>



<p>Let’s start with podcasting star Lex Fridman. Word got to Lex of my paper with Theo Polya when it was released and all three of us got onto a video call in March 2021 to discuss the situation. Lex proposed hosting us alongside Weinstein for a discussion of Geometric Unity on his podcast and we all agreed (Theo Polya was willing to reveal himself given his affinity for Lex’s podcast). The only question is whether Weinstein, who had already been on Lex’s show four times, would agree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two weeks later, when I got in touch with Lex via email, he disappointingly changed topics and said he did not discuss what we had proposed with Weinstein (or Joe Rogan). In hindsight, this was clearly not the case. Weinstein released his Geometric Unity paper on April 1, debuting it on Joe Rogan’s podcast and then on Brian Keating’s podcast the following day. Conspicuously, Weinstein did not appear on Lex’s podcast. On Rogan’s podcast, Rogan’s skepticism and pushback was full-on with his interview with Weinstein, noting “there has been some criticism” and not letting Weinstein off the hook from his obscurantism. Rogan certainly hadn’t read Sabine’s blog to become aware of my critique; Lex had tipped him off. Four years later, Weinstein has not returned to Lex’s show.</p>



<h2>Marcus du Sautoy</h2>



<p>Marcus is the Oxford mathematician who hosted Weinstein’s GU talk and who knows Weinstein well from their overlapping time in academia. I first met Marcus virtually in 2022 when I hosted him for a <a href="https://youtu.be/1wJ6LMqPm9I?si=WPAb8ekHlDDoxjPi&amp;t=3305">talk</a> at Google. During the Q&amp;A of that conversation, I asked Marcus, who has been conspicuously absent from the Geometric Unity saga since 2013, about Weinstein and his work (it was a carefully thought-out question as Marcus was initially unwilling to field a question about Weinstein during our preparation). Marcus’s reply shows a man distancing himself from Geometric Unity, stating he’s less qualified than others to assess it, a sharp U-turn from his glowing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/may/23/roll-over-einstein-meet-weinstein#:~:text=What%20are%20we%20to%20make,most%20intractable%20problems%20in%20physics%3F&amp;text=There%20are%20a%20lot%20of,universe%20is%20missing%2C%20for%20example.">comparison</a> of Weinstein with Einstein in 2013. More recently, I also met Marcus in person at the <a href="https://www.eafestival.com/2025-ea-festival-lineup">2025 East Anglia Festival</a>. Over lunch with Marcus and his wife, Weinstein’s name briefly came up, but Marcus offered no positive comments about him or his ideas, and our conversation continued.</p>



<h2>Economists, Computer Scientists, and Physicists</h2>



<p>Despite advocating against established institutions and credentialism, Eric Weinstein readily leverages visits to prestigious institutions to enhance his public image. One notable instance was his November 2021 <a href="https://x.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1459180900789501960">visit</a> to UChicago, where he presented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211111031144/https://economics.uchicago.edu/sites/economics.uchicago.edu/files/Welfare_Chicago_Draft.pdf">work</a> co-authored with his wife, Pia Malaney, applying gauge theory to economics. Unlike his Geometric Unity work, which lacked sufficient detail to merit serious attention (consisting only of a YouTube lecture and an inadequately written paper), this UChicago presentation was accompanied by a well-formatted paper containing significant technical details. This allowed me to quickly analyze the paper, write a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03460">rebuttal</a> (this time without an anonymous co-author), and upload it to arXiv.</p>



<p>Note that before this incident, the Malaney-Weinstein work received little attention due to its limited significance and impact. Despite this, Weinstein has <a href="https://youtu.be/QxnkGymKuuI?t=3665">suggested</a> that it is worthy of a Nobel prize and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFirZANoiHI">claimed</a> (with the support of Brian Keating) that it is “the most deep insight in mathematical economics of the last 25-50 years”. In that same podcast episode, Weinstein also makes the incendiary claim that Juan Maldacena stole such ideas from him and his wife. For those unable to judge the situation, I offer this appreciative reply from one of the economics professors at UChicago who sponsored Eric’s visit:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDBkh3lmYvEZVJDl-OhbvQA1u4-UCVaxAHP1xG-MpN31xWS_euHpCigkNHdPu53O8mY8qAseiAvBRRcSvD9oJnudAtwk8PqGaUxfxN8fHFW07zkhxC7bevc0fI-8fLk-RzonyRkg?key=lmBFMXKQq2DciE8O8OstVA" alt=""></figure>



<p>Has Weinstein responded to my economics rebuttal now that the anonymous Theo Polya is no longer an author? You already know the answer.</p>



<p>And in case you’re wondering, there’s also equivalent endorsement of my response to Geometric Unity. For instance, see my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd-0COLM8oc&amp;t=928s">interview</a> with computer scientist Scott Aaronson. There’s also Sean Carroll, who after his debate with Weinstein on Piers Morgan, confided to me that he directs everyone who asks him about Weinstein’s work to the rebuttal I published. Most recently, Christian Ferko has done an excellent job giving his own <a href="https://youtu.be/jz7Trp5rTOY?si=kpMFc7wJgefIoXyt&amp;t=1837">take</a> on the flaws of GU based on the groundwork laid out by my analysis.</p>



<p>Overall, the consistent theme is that the few professional scientists who have examined Weinstein’s work and are not influenced by audience capture have supported the critique I put forth. The fact that most scientists have ignored GU says less about a failing within the scientific establishment and more about the group of contrarians who continue to entertain Weinstein’s ideas.</p>



<h2>Conclusion: The Real Cost of the Grift</h2>



<p>When I wrote my critique of Geometric Unity, I thought I was simply engaging in math and physics. I never imagined it would take me on a journey of hypocrisy and censorship. To dismiss this story as mere internet drama is to overlook the troubling reality underneath it all: Eric Weinstein and several of our most prominent science communicators – nay, science <em>populists</em> – are willing to distort the truth to suit their own interests. Many eyes and ears tune into Hossenfelder, Keating, and Jaimungal, who frequently appear alongside distinguished scientists that are likely unaware of their involvement in the grift. While these popularizers are able to fulfill their audience’s needs to understand science, they simultaneously enable them to hold unconventional views that may contradict the very science they promote. That the three of them have done valuable work in making science accessible to the public is precisely what makes their conduct disconcerting.</p>



<p>As a former fan of Weinstein who became a critic, I wrote my rebuttal to Geometric Unity expecting a scientific debate. Instead, I received a grim lesson about the state of modern science communication: when personal brands and tribal loyalties become the main focus, scientific integrity is sacrificed. The unfortunate truth is that some of the most visible voices in science are more interested in being celebrated than in being correct. And in a world where public trust in expertise is already in peril, that is a betrayal we simply cannot afford.</p>


<ol><li id="4c352d1d-79df-4aea-9105-5366061e4738">The rebuttal as well as the attention it received through various podcasts and discussions have been compiled together <a href="http://www.timothynguyen.org/geometric-unity">here</a>. I would like to note that I found my way to Weinstein by initially being a fan of him and his podcast, until I realized, like many others have, that his rhetoric is mostly performative. My <a href="https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/episode/special-episode-interview-with-tim-nguyen-on-geometric-unity">interview</a> on <em>Decoding the Gurus</em> goes into this episode in detail. <a href="#4c352d1d-79df-4aea-9105-5366061e4738-link">↩︎</a></li><li id="5f5a9faf-dd45-4cf3-8a2c-613959c6204a">See <a href="https://youtu.be/YjsPb3kBGnk?si=V2N9ZEay69hNbjEm&amp;t=1755">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QCKCQNFsJUw?si=upCV9obE6dtHvwcM&amp;t=4936">here</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ifX_JnBfxTY?si=TWoVuol_M4jexLV8&amp;t=7850">here</a>. <a href="#5f5a9faf-dd45-4cf3-8a2c-613959c6204a-link">↩︎</a></li><li id="636785f9-94c8-4831-8051-8a3a00800328">It should be noted that all evidence suggests that Weinstein does know who Theo Polya is.

<p>Every year it was an incredible challenge to fit teaching Rust into lectures since you basically need all the concepts right from the start to understand a lot of programs. I never knew how to order things. The flip side was that usually when you understand all the basic components in play lots of it just fits together. i.e. there's some point where the interwovenness turns from a barrier into something incredibly valuable and helpful.

</h2>
<p>One thing I admire in a language is a strong vision. <a href="https://www.uiua.org/">Uiua</a>, for example, has a very strong vision: what does it take to eliminate all local named variables from a language? <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> similarly has a strong vision: explicit, simple language features, easy to cross compile, drop-in replacement for C.</p>
<p>Note that you don’t have to agree with a language’s vision to note that it <em>has</em> one. I expect most people to find Uiua unpleasant to program in. That’s fine. You are not the target audience.</p>
<p>There’s a famous quote by Bjarne Strousup that goes “Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.” Within Rust, too, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out: one with a clear vision, goals, focus. One that is coherent, because its features <em>cohere</em>. This post is about that language.</p>

</h2>
<p>Rust is hard to learn. Not for lack of trying—many, many people have spent person-years on improving the diagnostics, documentation, and APIs—but because it’s complex. When people first learn the language, they are learning many different interleaving concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>first class functions</li>
<li>enums</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
<li>generics</li>
<li>traits</li>
<li>references</li>
<li>the borrow checker</li>
<li><code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code></li>
<li><code>Iterator</code>s</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts interlock. It is very hard to learn them one at a time because they interact with each other, and each affects the design of the others. Additionally, the standard library uses all of them heavily.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a Rust program that does something non-trivial:<sup id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>I tried to make this program as simple as possible: I used only the simplest iterator combinators, I don't touch <code>std::mpsc</code> at all, I don't use async, and I don't do any complicated error handling.</p>
<p>Already, this program has many interleaving concepts. I'll ignore the module system and macros, which are mostly independent of the rest of the language. To understand this program, you need to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>recommended_watcher</code> and <code>map</code> take a function as an argument. In our program, that function is constructed inline as an anonymous function (closure).</li>
<li>Errors are handled using something called <code>Result</code>, not with exceptions or error codes. I happened to use <code>fn main() -&gt; Result</code> and <code>?</code>, but you would still need to understand Result even without that, because Rust does not let you access the value inside unless you check for an error condition first.</li>
<li>Result takes a generic error; in our case, <code>notify::Error</code>.</li>
<li>Result is an data-holding enum that can be either Ok or Err, and you can check which variant it is using pattern matching.</li>
<li>Iterators can be traversed either with a <code>for</code> loop or with <code>into_iter()</code>. <sup id="fr-2-1"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> <code>for</code> is eager and <code>into_iter</code> is lazy. <code>iter</code> has different ownership semantics than `into_iter.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to modify this program, you need to know some additional things:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>println</code> can only print things that implement the traits <code>Display</code> or <code>Debug</code>. As a result, <code>Path</code>s cannot be printed directly.</li>
<li><code>path.display()</code> returns a struct that borrows from the path. Sending it to another thread (e.g. through a channel) won't work, because <code>event.paths</code> goes out of scope when the closure passed to <code>recommended_watcher</code> finishes running. You need to convert it to an owned value or pass <code>event.paths</code> as a whole.
<ul>
<li>As an aside, this kind of thing encourages people to break work into "large" chunks instead of "small" chunks, which I think is often good for performance in CPU-bound programs, although as always it depends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>recommended_watcher</code> only accepts functions that are <code>Send + 'static</code>. Small changes to this program, such as passing the current path into the closure, will give a compile error related to ownership. Fixing it requires learning the <code>move</code> keyword, knowing that closures borrow their arguments by default, and the meaning of <code>'static</code>.
<ul>
<li>If you are using <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>, which is often recommended for beginners<sup id="fr-3-1"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>, your program will need to be rewritten from scratch (either to use Arc/Mutex or to use exterior mutability). For example, if you wanted to print changes from the main thread instead of worker threads to avoid interleaving output, you couldn't simply push to the end of an <code>all_changes</code> collection, you would have to use <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Vec&lt;Path&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> in order to communicate between threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <em>lot</em> of concepts for a 20 line program. For comparison, here is an equivalent javascript program:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span><span><span>fs</span></span> </span><span>=</span> <span><span>require</span></span><span>(</span><span><span>'</span>fs<span>'</span></span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>

</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>    <span>}</span></span>
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>  <span>}</span></span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>For this JS program, you need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>first class functions</li>
<li>nullability</li>
<li>yeah that's kinda it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm cheating a little here because <code>notify</code> returns a list of paths and <code>node:fs/watch</code> doesn't. But only a little.</p>
<p>My point is not that JS is a simpler language; that's debatable. My point is that you can do things in JS without understanding the whole language. It's very hard to do non-trivial things in Rust without understanding the whole core.</p>
<h2 id="rust-s-core-is-interwoven-on-purpose">Rust's core is interwoven on purpose<a href="#rust-s-core-is-interwoven-on-purpose" aria-label="Anchor link for: rust-s-core-is-interwoven-on-purpose"></a>
</h2>
<p>The previous section makes it out to seem like I'm saying all these concepts are bad. I'm not. Rather the opposite, actually. Because these language features were designed in tandem, they interplay very nicely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enums without pattern matching <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant.html">are very painful to work with</a> and pattern matching without enums <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/python-abc/">has very odd semantics</a></li>
<li><code>Result</code> and <code>Iterator</code>s are impossible to implement without generics (or duck-typing, which I think of as type-erased generics)</li>
<li><code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code>, and the preconditions to <code>println</code>, are impossible to encode without traits—and this often comes up in other languages, for example printing a function in clojure shows something like <code>#object[clojure.core$map 0x2e7de98a "clojure.core$map@2e7de98a"]</code>. In Rust it gives a compile error unless you opt-in with Debug.</li>
<li><code>Send</code> / <code>Sync</code> are only possible to enforce because the borrow checker does capture analysis for closures. Java, which is <em>wildly</em> committed to thread-safety by the standards of most languages, cannot verify this at compile time and so has to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html#synchronization">document synchronization concerns explicitly</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more interplays than I can easily describe in a post, and all of them are what make Rust what it is.</p>
<p>Rust has other excellent language features—for example the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/inline-assembly.html">inline assembly syntax</a> is a work of art, props to <a href="https://github.com/amanieu">Amanieu</a>. But they are not interwoven into the standard library in the same way, and they do not affect the way people <em>think</em> about writing code in the same way.</p>

<p>without.boats wrote a post in 2019 titled <a href="https://without.boats/blog/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">"Notes on a smaller Rust"</a> (and a follow-up <a href="https://without.boats/blog/revisiting-a-smaller-rust/">revisiting</a> it). In a manner of speaking, that smaller Rust <em>is</em> the language I fell in love with when I first learned it in 2018. Rust is a lot bigger today, in many ways, and the smaller Rust is just a nostalgic rose-tinted memory. But I think it's worth studying as an example of how well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality#Computer_science">orthogonal</a> features can compose when they're designed as one cohesive whole.</p>

          <p>As banks around the world <a href="https://archive.ph/asfc6">prepare</a> to replace many thousands of workers with AI, Australia's biggest bank is scrambling to rehire 45 workers after allegedly lying about chatbots besting staff by handling higher call volumes.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fsunion.org.au/Hub/Content/News_and_publications/Member_updates/2025/WIN-CBA-backflips-on-customer-service-job-cuts.aspx">statement</a> Thursday flagged <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-21/commonwealth-bank-reverses-job-cuts-decision-over-ai-chatbots">by Bloomberg</a>, Australia's main financial services union, the Finance Sector Union (FSU), claimed a "massive win" for 45 union members whom the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) had replaced with an AI-powered "voice bot."</p>
<p>The FSU noted that some of these workers had been with CBA for decades. Those workers in particular were shocked when CBA announced last month that their jobs had become redundant. At that time, CBA claimed that launching the chatbot supposedly "led to a reduction in call volumes" by 2,000 a week, FSU said.</p>
<p>But "this was an outright lie," fired workers told FSU. Instead, call volumes had been increasing at the time they were dismissed, with CBA supposedly "scrambling"—offering staff overtime and redirecting management to join workers answering phones to keep up.</p>
<p>To uncover the truth, FSU escalated the dispute to a fair work tribunal, where the union accused CBA of failing to explain how workers' roles were ruled redundant. The union also alleged that CBA was hiring for similar roles in India, Bloomberg noted, which made it appear that CBA had perhaps used the chatbot to cover up a shady pivot to outsource jobs.</p>
<p>While the dispute was being weighed, CBA admitted that "they didn’t properly consider that an increase in calls" happening while staff was being fired "would continue over a number of months," FSU said.</p>
<p>"This error meant the roles were not redundant," CBA confirmed at the tribunal.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Submission/commenting Rules:</h2>

<p>1) <strong>10 comment karma in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur">/r/Entrepreneur</a> to post</strong><br>
To lead a discussion in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur">/r/Entrepreneur</a>, we require a minimum of 10 comment karma within our subreddit. This is earned by contributing thoughtful comments to others' discussions. This policy not only helps reduce spam but ensures that you understand the community's dynamics—what types of posts resonate, and what might be overlooked or poorly received.</p>

<p>Our goal is to help your posts gain traction. Take some time to engage with the community and discover how we can best support you.</p>

<p>2) <strong>No Promotion</strong><br>
Posts and comments must NOT be made for the primary purpose of selling or promoting yourself, your company or any service.</p>

<p>Dropping URLs, asking users to DM you, check your profile, or comment for private resources will all lead to a permanent ban.</p>

<p>It is acceptable to cite your sources, however, there should not be an explicit solicitation, advertisement, or clear promotion for the intent of awareness.</p>

<p>3) <strong>No Personal Attacks</strong><br>
Constructive criticism of ideas, concepts, approaches, or plans is encouraged. Embracing reality, even when it is challenging, is a crucial aspect of business. However, personal attacks, hostility, or incitement to conflict are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated in this community.</p>

<p>If you encounter threats or harassment, please report them immediately. Avoid engaging with users who are harassing you or others.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Links Allowed as Supporting Material ONLY</strong><br>
This rule exists to foster meaningful discussion. If you wish to share links, they must be directly relevant, clearly described, and essential to the conversation. Your post should include sufficient context within Reddit to enable a productive dialogue.</p>

<p>5) <strong>No “How To Get Rich Quick” posts</strong><br>
This community is NOT for quick money schemes. Entrepreneurship is often a challenging and demanding journey, requiring effort, hard work, grit, and determination. Posts asking how to make $X, without a specific or reasonable idea, will not be tolerated, as they do not contribute meaningfully to the discussions in this subreddit.</p>

<p>6) <strong>Avoid unprofessional communication</strong><br>
As a professional subreddit, we expect all members to uphold a standard of reasonable decorum. Treat fellow entrepreneurs with the same respect you would show a colleague. While we don't have an HR department, that’s no excuse for aggressive, foul, or unprofessional behavior. NSFW topics are permitted, but they must be clearly labeled. When in doubt, label it.</p>

<p>AI-generated content is not acceptable to be posted. If your posts or comments were generated with AI, you may face a permanent ban.  </p>

<p>7) <strong>No free offerings threads</strong><br>
Our "Thank You Thursday" threads are designated for any promotions, offers, or discounts you wish to share with the community. Please refrain from posting free offerings outside of this weekly thread that is pinned to the top of the community. Any such posts made elsewhere will be removed.</p>

<p>8) <strong>Follow the <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Rules of Reddit</a></strong><br>
They apply everywhere on Reddit. Also consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/">Reddiquette</a> The latter isn't mandatory but might be used in considering the intent of your post.</p>

<p>9) <strong>Unsolicited Opinions and Duplicate Thoughts</strong><br>
Posts in Entrepreneur should be unique. If a duplicate post can be found on one or more similar subreddits or on a blog, then it's not a good fit for this subreddit.</p>

<p>Please refrain from using this community as your personal blog. There is no need to share opinions or use this space as a diary for daydreams, thoughts, or subjective reflections.</p>

<p>10) <strong>No Investment Solicitation</strong><br>
Posts about specific investments, such as cryptocurrency, are not permitted. Please refrain from soliciting, promoting, or offering any form of investment advice. There are other subreddits better suited for those discussions.</p>

</a></p><p>The OpenAI logo appears on a smartphone in front of a computer screen showing ChatGPT output, March 21, 2023, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)</p></div><div id="penci-post-entry-inner"><p data-start="516" data-end="726">Over the last three years, companies worldwide have invested between 30 and 40 billion dollars into generative artificial intelligence projects. Yet most of these efforts have brought no real business return.</p><p data-start="728" data-end="905">A new study from <a href="https://nanda.media.mit.edu/ai_report_2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT found</a> that 95 percent of enterprise organizations report zero measurable gains from the adoption of AI tools. Only a small group has seen strong benefits.</p><p data-start="907" data-end="1082">“Just five percent of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value,” the report said. In contrast, the vast majority showed no impact on revenue or earnings at all.</p><p data-start="1084" data-end="1280">Many companies rushed to test programs such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and other large language model platforms. Surveys show that over 80 percent of major firms have already explored or piloted them.</p><p data-start="1282" data-end="1499">Nearly 40 percent of companies reported deploying these systems at some level. But researchers found most use cases were limited to boosting individual productivity rather than improving a company’s overall profits.</p><p data-start="1501" data-end="1706">One major reason is that generative AI tools often fail to match real work processes. The report described “brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and poor alignment with day-to-day operations.”</p><p data-start="1708" data-end="1903">Unlike humans, most generative AI models cannot retain past feedback or build new reasoning ability over time. They also struggle to adapt to context or transfer lessons across different tasks.</p><p data-start="1905" data-end="2083">“Most GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time,” the study said. Without these traits, long-term integration remains costly and ineffective.</p><p data-start="2085" data-end="2281">The hype around generative AI led to high expectations in boardrooms. But the report suggests that many of the investments have not translated into better profits or meaningful cost savings yet.</p><p data-start="2283" data-end="2464">Some companies use AI for customer service, marketing, or writing assistance. While these tools can save time for workers, they rarely add direct earnings for the business itself.</p><p data-start="2466" data-end="2647">The report also downplayed fears that generative AI will cause sweeping job losses in the near term. Instead, its effect is more likely to be in reducing external costs for firms.</p><p data-start="2649" data-end="2849">“Until AI systems achieve contextual adaptation and autonomous operation, organizational impact will manifest through external cost optimization rather than internal restructuring,” the report said.</p><p data-start="2851" data-end="2992">This means businesses may cut expenses on outsourced tasks but are less likely to replace large groups of staff with machines anytime soon.</p><p data-start="2994" data-end="3174">That conclusion goes against common public belief that generative AI will replace millions of jobs quickly. Researchers argue the technology is far from reaching such capability.</p><p data-start="3176" data-end="3345">Experts say many failures come from misunderstanding what AI can and cannot do. A program may generate text or code quickly, but it cannot truly learn as humans learn.</p><p data-start="3347" data-end="3532">For instance, an employee can adjust based on new instructions, previous mistakes, and situational needs. A generative AI model cannot carry that memory across tasks unless retrained.</p><p data-start="3534" data-end="3719">Investors and executives still show strong interest in AI, hoping that ongoing advances will close these gaps. But the short-term outlook points to slower progress than many expected.</p><p data-start="3721" data-end="3899">The findings suggest that while the promise of AI is large, businesses should temper expectations. The technology is not yet ready to deliver across every industry or workflow.</p><p data-start="3901" data-end="4100">The report also highlights the need for smarter planning around adoption. Organizations may need to focus on narrow use cases where AI can bring immediate, measurable savings or productivity gains.</p><p data-start="4102" data-end="4300">This might include customer support scripts, coding aids, or document drafting, but not full company-wide transformation. Widespread integration is still considered premature and prone to failure.</p><p data-start="4302" data-end="4484">As one researcher noted, “AI is powerful at tasks, not strategy.” Companies that expect it to replace entire decision-making processes are setting themselves up for disappointment.</p><p data-start="4486" data-end="4663">For now, the business case for generative AI rests mainly on selective success stories. A handful of firms report large value, but most see only minor help with routine tasks.</p><p data-start="4665" data-end="4812">The lesson, according to the MIT study, is clear. Companies should see generative AI as a limited tool rather than a guaranteed engine of growth.</p><p data-start="4814" data-end="5008">While interest remains high, experts caution against chasing hype. Until the systems learn to adapt more like humans, profits from AI adoption are likely to remain out of reach for most firms.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/21/1122288/google-gemini-ai-energy/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/21/1122288/google-gemini-ai-energy/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44972808">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Google has just released a technical report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query. In total, the median prompt—one that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand—consumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.</p>  <p>It’s the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there’s been <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">a growing effort to understand its energy use</a>. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Earlier this year, <em>MIT Technology Review</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/energy-ai">published a comprehensive series on AI and energy</a>, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google’s new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.</p>  <p>The study focuses on a broad look at energy demand, including not only the power used by the AI chips that run models but also by all the other infrastructure needed to support that hardware.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“We wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,” said Jeff Dean, Google’s chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with <em>MIT Technology Review</em> about the new report.</p>  <p>That’s significant, because in this measurement, the AI chips—in this case, Google’s custom TPUs, the company’s proprietary equivalent of GPUs—account for just 58% of the total electricity demand of 0.24 watt-hours.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Another large portion of the energy is used by equipment needed to support AI-specific hardware: The host machine’s CPU and memory account for another 25% of the total energy used. There’s also backup equipment needed in case something fails—these idle machines account for 10% of the total. The final 8% is from overhead associated with running a data center, including cooling and power conversion.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This sort of report shows the value of industry input to energy and AI research, says Mosharaf Chowdhury, a professor at the University of Michigan and one of the heads of the <a href="https://ml.energy/leaderboard/?__theme=light">ML.Energy leaderboard</a>, which tracks energy consumption of AI models.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Estimates like Google’s are generally something that only companies can produce, because they run at a larger scale than researchers are able to and have access to behind-the-scenes information. “I think this will be a keystone piece in the AI energy field,” says Jae-Won Chung, a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan and another leader of the ML.Energy effort. “It’s the most comprehensive analysis so far.”</p>  <p>Google’s figure, however, is not representative of all queries submitted to Gemini: The company handles a huge variety of requests, and this estimate is calculated from a median energy demand, one that falls in the middle of the range of possible queries.</p> </div><div> <p>So some Gemini prompts use much more energy than this: Dean gives the example of feeding dozens of books into Gemini and asking it to produce a detailed synopsis of their content. “That’s the kind of thing that will probably take more energy than the median prompt,” Dean says. Using a reasoning model could also have a higher associated energy demand because these models take more steps before producing an answer.</p>  <p>This report was also strictly limited to text prompts, so it doesn’t represent what’s needed to generate an image or a video. (Other analyses, including <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">one in <em>MIT Technology Review</em>’s Power Hungry series</a> earlier this year, show that these tasks can require much more energy.)</p>  <p>The report also finds that the total energy used to field a Gemini query has fallen dramatically over time. The median Gemini prompt used 33 times more energy in May 2024 than it did in May 2025, according to Google. The company points to advancements in its models and other software optimizations for the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116337/ai-energy-use-optimism/">improvements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Google also estimates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the median prompt, which they put at 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide. To get to this number, the company multiplied the total energy used to respond to a prompt by the average emissions per unit of electricity.</p> 

 <p>Rather than using an emissions estimate based on the US grid average, or the average of the grids where Google operates, the company instead uses a market-based estimate, which takes into account electricity purchases that the company makes from clean energy projects. The company has signed agreements to buy over <a href="https://sustainability.google/operations/">22 gigawatts</a> of power from sources including solar, wind, geothermal, and advanced nuclear projects since 2010. Because of those purchases, Google’s emissions per unit of electricity on paper are roughly one-third of those on the average grid where it operates.</p>  <p>AI data centers also consume water for cooling, and Google estimates that each prompt consumes 0.26 milliliters of water, or about five drops.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The goal of this work was to provide users a window into the energy use of their interactions with AI, Dean says.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“People are using [AI tools] for all kinds of things, and they shouldn’t have major concerns about the energy usage or the water usage of Gemini models, because in our actual measurements, what we were able to show was that it’s actually equivalent to things you do without even thinking about it on a daily basis,” he says, “like watching a few seconds of TV or consuming five drops of water.”</p> </div><div><p>The publication greatly expands what’s known about AI’s resource usage. It follows recent increasing pressure on companies to release more information about the energy toll of the technology. “I’m really happy that they put this out,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI and climate researcher at Hugging Face. “People want to know what the cost is.”</p>  <p>This estimate and the supporting report contain more public information than has been available before, and it’s helpful to get more information about AI use in real life, at scale, by a major company, Luccioni adds. However, there are still details that the company isn’t sharing in this report. One major question mark is the total number of queries that Gemini gets each day, which would allow estimates of the AI tool’s total energy demand.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And ultimately, it’s still the company deciding what details to share, and when and how. “We’ve been trying to push for a standardized AI energy score,” Luccioni says, a standard for AI similar to the Energy Star rating for appliances. “This is not a replacement or proxy for standardized comparisons.”</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44972151">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has suggested firing junior workers because AI can do their jobs is "the dumbest thing I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Garman made that remark in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfocTxMzOP4">conversation</a> with AI investor Matthew Berman, during which he talked up AWS’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/aws_updated_kiro_pricing/">Kiro AI-assisted coding tool</a> and said he's encountered business leaders who think AI tools "can replace all of our junior people in our company."</p>
<p>That notion led to the “dumbest thing I've ever heard” quote, followed by a justification that junior staff are “probably the least expensive employees you have” and also the most engaged with AI tools.</p>

    

<p>“How's that going to work when ten years in the future you have no one that has learned anything,” he asked. “My view is you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it, just as much as you ever have.”</p>

        


        

<p>Naturally he thinks AI – and Kiro, natch – can help with that education.</p>
<p>Garman is also not keen on another idea about AI – measuring its value by what percentage of code it contributes at an organization.</p>

        

<p>“It’s a silly metric,” he said, because while organizations can use AI to write “infinitely more lines of code” it could be bad code.</p>
<p>“Often times fewer lines of code is way better than more lines of code,” he observed. “So I'm never really sure why that's the exciting metric that people like to brag about.”</p>
<p>That said, he’s seen data that suggests over 80 percent of AWS’s developers use AI in some way.</p>

        

<p>“Sometimes it's writing unit tests, sometimes it's helping write documentation, sometimes it's writing code, sometimes it's kind of an agentic workflow” in which developers collaborate with AI agents.</p>
<p>Garman said usage of AI tools by AWS developers increases every week.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/amazon_quietly_fixed_q_developer_flaws/">Amazon quietly fixed Q Developer flaws that made AI agent vulnerable to prompt injection, RCE</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/aws_custom_xeons_r8_instances/">AWS still cares enough about Intel to order up a fresh batch of custom Xeons</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/aws_updated_kiro_pricing/">AWS pricing for Kiro dev tool dubbed 'a wallet-wrecking tragedy'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/12/ibm_cloud_severity_one_outage/">IBM Cloud hit by Severity One incident with the same symptoms as other recent SNAFUs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The CEO also offered some career advice for the AI age, suggesting that kids these days need to learn how to learn – and not just learn specific skills.</p>
<p>“I think the skills that should be emphasized are how do you think for yourself? How do you develop critical reasoning for solving problems? How do you develop creativity? How do you develop a learning mindset that you're going to go learn to do the next thing?”</p>
<p>Garman thinks that approach is necessary because technological development is now so rapid it’s no longer sensible to expect that studying narrow skills can sustain a career for 30 years. He wants educators to instead teach “how do you think and how do you decompose problems”, and thinks kids who acquire those skills will thrive. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Water infrastructure often gets less attention and focus than other types of infrastructure. Both the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Highway_Administration" rel="">Federal Highway Administration</a><span> and the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy" rel="">Department of Energy</a><span> have annual budgets around $46 billion dollars. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development" rel="">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a><span> has an annual budget of $60 billion. The closest thing the federal government has to a department of water infrastructure, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation" rel="">Bureau of Reclamation</a><span>, has an annual budget of just $1.1 billion. Water in the US is generally both widely available and inexpensive: my monthly water bill is roughly 5% of the cost of my monthly electricity bill, and the service is far more reliable. And unlike, say, energy, water isn’t the locus of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/will-we-ever-get-fusion-power" rel="">exciting technological change</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/great-power-competition-surveying-global-electricity-strategies-ai" rel="">great power competition</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>But this might be changing. Rising demand for water in the arid southwest (which has experienced </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/climate/southwest-megadrought.html" rel="">decades of drought</a><span>) is creating </span><a href="https://udallcenter.arizona.edu/news/colorado-river-negotiations-2024" rel="">increasing concern</a><span> about water availability.

Google search interest for “water scarcity” has gradually risen over the last two decades.</span></p><p>Because water is such a critical resource, needed for everything from agriculture to manufacturing to artificial intelligence to sustaining basic human life, it's worth understanding how we use water, and how that use has changed over time.</p><p><span>Most of us probably remember learning about the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle" rel="">water cycle</a><span> in school. Water falls to the earth via precipitation — rain, snow, sleet — and flows into rivers, lakes, streams, and water-bearing geological strata called aquifers. From there, water continues to move: it goes back into the atmosphere via evapotranspiration, moves from streams and rivers into aquifers (and vice versa), and flows out into the ocean.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-171507861" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-does-the-us-use-water#footnote-1-171507861" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png" width="500" height="399.23747276688454" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:733,&quot;width&quot;:918,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:500,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SW_s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F538a4de2-4ec5-4cf7-954f-6c8aa35bf627_918x733.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Water cycle, via </span><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/water-cycle-png" rel="">USGS</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Altogether, the US receives about 5 trillion gallons of precipitation a day.

The remaining 2% is consumed by people in various ways.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png" width="1366" height="860" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:860,&quot;width&quot;:1366,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vnAM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9058cf7-c17f-4449-b41e-2334ee2e8dac_1366x860.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via USGS.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>We use water by tapping these various stores and flows.

of 2015, the year of the most recent </span><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1441/circ1441.pdf" rel="">USGS report</a><span> on US water consumption, the US used about 322 billion gallons of water each day, or 117 trillion gallons each year. 87% of this is freshwater, and the rest is saltwater, either from the ocean or from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brackish_water" rel="">brackish</a><span> coastal water like estuaries. 74% of all US water use is from surface sources like lakes and rivers, and 26% is from underground aquifers.</span></p><p>An important distinction when understanding water use is “consumptive” vs “non-consumptive” uses. Consumptive water use is when the water is consumed as part of the process: either it gets incorporated into whatever is being produced, evaporates back into the atmosphere, or is otherwise no longer available in fluid form. Non-consumptive water use is when the water is still available to use in fluid form after the process is completed, though perhaps at a higher temperature, or with some additional pollutants or impurities. The graph below shows total water use by category, broken out into consumptive and non-consumptive uses:</p><p><span>As of 2015, the largest user of water in the US is actually thermoelectric power plants — plants that use heat to produce steam to drive a turbine. Water is used in these plants to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_condenser" rel="">condense steam back to liquid water</a><span> so that it can be heated again and routed back through the turbine. Thermoelectric power plants make up 41% of total water use in the US. However, nearly all this (around 97%) use is non-consumptive. Historically thermoelectric power plants were built using “once-through” cooling systems: water would be drawn from some source, run through the cooling system, and then dumped back out into the same source at a slightly raised temperature. This water can be either fresh water or saltwater, and around 97% of the saltwater used in the US each year is used to cool coastal power plants.</span></p><p><span>Since the 1970s, most thermoelectric power plants have been built with recirculating cooling systems rather than once-through cooling systems. This is due to things like the Clean Water Act, which set limits on thermal discharge from power plants and made once-through cooling systems less attractive. Recirculating systems circulate the same water over and over again through the system. These systems use much less water overall, but a much greater fraction of the water they do use is consumed (it's lost to evaporation, typically via large cooling towers). As of 2012 about 43% of thermal power plants </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971" rel="">used once-through cooling</a><span>, but once-through cooling systems make up around 96% of all water used by thermoelectric power plants.</span></p><p>After power plants, the next largest use of water in the US is for irrigation: watering plants and crops. Altogether, irrigation makes up 37% of total US water use. Unlike thermoelectric power plants, most of this water (just over 60%) is consumptive use. What’s more, even the irrigation water that isn’t consumed may not be readily reused. While thermoelectric plants which typically dump their water back into the same river, lake, or ocean it was drawn from, much of the non-consumptive water used for irrigation seeps back into the ground, potentially far from where it was originally tapped. Depending on how water flows through the ground in a particular location, it could be centuries or even longer before that water reaches somewhere it can be easily retrieved.</p><p><span>Most water for irrigation is used for crops, though it’s hard to know exactly what fraction, as many states don’t break out irrigated cropland as a separate category.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-171507861" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-does-the-us-use-water#footnote-2-171507861" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> As of 2015, the US has around 63 million acres of irrigated land. This is around 20% of the US’s </span><a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2025/04/estimating-total-crop-acres-for-the-us-over-1998-2025.html" rel="">337 million acres of cropland</a><span>, but it’s responsible for around </span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use" rel="">54% of the value of US crops</a><span>. The largest water-using crop in the US is alfalfa (around 11.1 billion gallons per day), followed by orchards (10.9 billion), corn (10.4 billion), soybeans (5.1 billion), and rice (5 billion) (though if we lump all separate categories of corn together — sweet corn, silage, etc. —, it comes in at number one).</span></p><p><span>Another user of irrigation water is golf courses. The US has around </span><a href="https://www.ngf.org/full-shots/new-golf-facilities-in-the-u-s-report-now-available/" rel="">16,000 golf courses</a><span>, and collectively they use about a billion gallons of water a day, or around 0.3% of total US water use.</span></p><p>After irrigation, the next largest category of US water use is public utility supplied water for homes and businesses. Public water use totals to around 39 billion gallons a day, or 12% of total US water use. Most public water — 23.3 billion gallons, or around 60% — is for domestic use in homes. In addition to publicly supplied water for homes, another 3.3 billion gallons are self-supplied to homes via things like privately owned wells. An estimated 42 million people in the US use self-supplied water.</p><p><span>Average per-capita domestic water use in the US is 82 gallons per day. By comparison, German homes use around </span><a href="https://energyindemand.com/2022/03/26/understanding-our-real-water-use/" rel="">33 gallons per person per day</a><span>, UK homes use around </span><a href="https://www.ccw.org.uk/save-money-and-water/averagewateruse/" rel="">37 gallons</a><span>, and French homes use around </span><a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/news/french-drought-measures-how-much-water-do-household-appliances-use/115335" rel="">39 gallons</a><span>.</span></p><p>The next largest category of water use is industry, which uses about 14.8 billion gallons of water a day, or 4.5% of all US water use). Many industrial processes require large amounts of water, often either for cooling or as a way to carry and mix materials or chemicals. The chart below shows several US industries that use large amounts of water.</p><p><span>One of the largest water-using industries is forest products, particularly pulp and paper mills which require water for things like </span><a href="https://repository.gatech.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/28217569-3295-4692-8f4f-31ec80ce9b1e/content" rel="">rinsing the pulp</a><span> after it's been bleached. Forest product manufacturing in the US uses around 4 billion gallons of water a day. Other large industrial users of water are steelmaking (around 1.8 billion gallons per day), crude oil refining (around 270 million gallons a day), and semiconductor manufacturing (around 80 million gallons a day).</span></p><p><span>However, as with thermoelectric power plants, much of industrial water use is non-consumptive (though USGS doesn’t break out consumptive and non-consumptive separately for industrial use). In forest products, most of the water is returned to the source after it goes through the process, and only around </span><a href="https://www.ncasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NCASI_water_US_profile_infographic_print.pdf" rel="">12% of the water used is consumptive</a><span>. Similarly, </span><a href="https://www.fluencecorp.com/steel-industry-water-use/" rel="">only around 10%</a><span> of the water used for steel production is consumed.</span></p><p><span>Because of rising concern about water use of data centers, it's worth looking at them specifically. Per </span><a href="https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/lbnl-2024-united-states-data-center-energy-usage-report.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="">Lawrence Berkeley Lab</a><span>, in 2023, data centers used around 48 million gallons of water a day directly for cooling. Most of this water will </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/04/how_datacenters_use_water/" rel="">evaporate as part of the cooling process</a><span>, and is thus consumed. If you include indirect water use by including their share of water required for electricity consumption, this adds another 580 million gallons per day. However, as we’ve noted, most thermoelectric power plant water use is not consumptive. Taking this into account, actual water consumed by data centers is around 66 million gallons per day. By 2028, that’s estimated to rise by two to four times.</span></p><p>This is a large amount of water when compared to the amount of water homes use, but it's not particularly large when compared to other large-scale industrial uses. 66 million gallons per day is about 6% of the water used by US golf courses, and it's about 3% of the water used to grow cotton in 2023.</p><p><span>We can also think about it in economic terms. The 2.5 billion gallons per day required to grow cotton in the US created about </span><a href="https://www.cotton.org/news/releases/2024/cropest.cfm" rel="">six billion pounds of cotton in 2023</a><span>, worth around </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191505/cotton-production-value-in-the-us-since-2000/" rel="">$4.5 billion</a><span>. Data centers, by contrast, are critical infrastructure for technology companies worth many trillions of dollars. Anthropic alone, just one of many AI companies, is already making </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-nears-funding-170-billion-005055848.html" rel="">$5 billion dollars every year</a><span> selling access to its AI model.

Because public water mostly consists of water used in homes, I’ve also included self-supplied water used by homes. The maps below show public and self-supplied water use by state.</p><p>Because public and self-supplied water use is a function of population, this map is basically a population map. So let’s also look at public and self-supplied water use per capita.</p><p>There’s less variation here than I expected. The highest consuming states (Utah, Idaho) use only about two times the amount of water per capita as the lowest consuming states.</p><p>If we look at self-supplied water use specifically, we can see that it's highly regionally concentrated. In some areas of the country, self-supplied water makes up nearly all domestic water use, while in other areas of the country it's much less common.</p><p>The next largest category of water use is industrial. The map below shows industrial water use by county:</p><p>Industrial water consumption is concentrated in a very small number of locations: northern Indiana for steel production, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast for oil refining, and so on. 100 of the US’s 3200 counties are responsible for more than 70% of the US’s industrial water consumption, and 23% of US industrial water use is concentrated in just five counties.</p><p>How have patterns of water consumption changed over time? Overall water use peaked in 1980, and has trended downward since then.</p><p><span>Thermoelectric power use is down more than 37% from its peak, irrigation use is down 21%, industrial is down at least 43% (and probably more), and public plus self supplied domestic water use is down 12% in absolute terms and 22% in per-capita terms.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-171507861" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-does-the-us-use-water#footnote-3-171507861" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>Another trend from the 1950s through the 1970s was increased use of groundwater. Between 1950 and 1980 the annual volume of groundwater used in the US more than doubled, from 34 billion gallons per day to 83 billion gallons per day. Since then, groundwater use has been roughly constant (as of 2015, it’s at 82.3 billion gallons per day), even as surface water use has declined by nearly 30%. Groundwater is thus making up an increasingly large fraction of overall water use.</p><p>My overall takeaway is that you need to be careful when talking about water use: it’s very easy to take figures out of context, or make misleading comparisons. Very often I see alarmist discussions about water use that don’t take into account the distinction between consumptive and non-consumptive uses. Billions of gallons of water a day are “used” by thermal power plants, but the water is quickly returned to where it came from, so this use isn’t reducing the supply of available fresh water in any meaningful sense. Similarly, the millions of gallons of water a day a large data center can use sounds like a lot when compared to the hundreds of gallons a typical home uses, but compared to other large-scale industrial or agricultural uses of water, it's a mere drop in the bucket.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s also easy to go too far in the other direction. People sometimes invoke the idea that water moves through a cycle and never really gets destroyed, in order to suggest that we don’t need to be concerned at all about water use. But while water may not get destroyed, it can get “used up” in the sense that it becomes infeasible or uneconomic to access it. If we draw down aquifers that have spent hundreds or thousands of years accumulating water, the water isn’t “gone” in the sense that it's been chemically transformed back into hydrogen and oxygen, but much of it probably ends up in the atmosphere, the ocean, or other places not readily or cheaply retrievable. Outside of large-scale desalination of ocean water, we’re ultimately limited in how much fresh water we can use by the amount of precipitation we get, and while we currently use a very small fraction of total precipitation (around 6%), it’s not as if there’s no limit to how much naturally-produced fresh water is available.</p></div></div>]]></description>

While this constraint is less common with newer approaches, the systems surrounding the model may still impose constraints calling for image scaling.

Evidently, these agentic coding tools continue to lack sufficiently secure defaults, design patterns, or systematic defenses that minimize the possibility of impactful prompt injection.</p><h2 id="even-more-attacks">Even more attacks</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_3.gif" alt="Honey, I shrunk the payload on Genspark"><figcaption>Figure 3: Honey, I shrunk the payload on Genspark</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_4.gif" alt="Injection through the looking glass on Vertex AI Studio"><figcaption>Figure 4: Injection through the looking glass on Vertex AI Studio</figcaption></figure><p>We also successfully demonstrated image scaling attacks on the following:</p><ul><li>Vertex AI with a Gemini back end</li><li>Gemini’s web interface</li><li>Gemini’s API via the <code>llm</code> CLI</li><li>Google Assistant on an Android phone</li><li>Genspark</li></ul><p>Notice the persistent mismatch between user perception and model inputs in figures 3 and 4. The exploit is particularly impactful on Vertex AI Studio because the front-end UI shows the high-resolution image instead of the downscaled image perceived by the model.</p><p>Our testing confirmed that this attack vector is widespread, extending far beyond the applications and systems documented here.</p><h2 id="sharpening-the-attack-surface">Sharpening the attack surface</h2><p>These image scaling attacks exploit downscaling algorithms (or <a href="https://guide.encode.moe/encoding/resampling.html">image resampling algorithms</a>), which perform interpolation to turn multiple high resolution pixel values into a single low resolution pixel value.</p><p>There are three major downscaling algorithms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation">nearest neighbor interpolation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation">bicubic interpolation</a>. Each algorithm requires a different approach to perform an image scaling attack. Furthermore, these algorithms are implemented differently across libraries (e.g., Pillow, PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorFlow), with varying anti-aliasing, alignment, and kernel phases (in addition to <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/15/bilinear-down-upsampling-pixel-grids-and-that-half-pixel-offset/">distinct bugs</a> that historically have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11222">plagued model performance</a>). These differences also impact the techniques necessary for an image scaling attack. Therefore, exploiting production systems required us to fingerprint each system’s algorithm and implementation.</p><p>We developed a custom test suite and methodology to fingerprint downscaling algorithms across different implementations. Core components of this test suite include images with <a href="https://nicola.asuni.xyz/papers/20140923_STAG_ASUNI_TESTIMAGES.pdf">checkerboard patterns, concentric circles, vertical and horizontal bands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">Moiré patterns</a>, and <a href="https://www.imatest.com/imaging/sharpness/">slanted edges</a>. These would reveal <a href="https://guide.encode.moe/encoding/video-artifacts.html">artifacts</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_artifacts">ringing</a>, blurring, edge handling, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing">aliasing</a>, and <a href="https://www.imatest.com/docs/nyquist-aliasing/">inconsistencies in color</a> caused by the underlying downscaling algorithm. This typically provided a sufficient amount of information to determine the algorithm and implementation, enabling us to choose from one of our crafted attacks.</p><h2 id="nyquists-nightmares">Nyquist’s nightmares</h2><p>To understand why image downscaling attacks are possible, imagine that you have a long ribbon with an intricate yet regular pattern on it. As this ribbon is pulled past you, you’re trying to recreate the pattern by grabbing samples of the ribbon at regular intervals. If the pattern changes rapidly, you need to grab samples very frequently to capture all the details. If you’re too slow, you’ll miss crucial parts between grabs, and when you try to reconstruct the pattern from your samples, it looks completely different from the original.</p><p>In this analogy, your hand is the sampler, and if the sampling rate falls below a certain threshold (i.e., your hand isn’t fast enough), you cannot unambiguously reconstruct the pattern. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">This aliasing effect is a consequence of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem</a>. Exploiting this ambiguity by manipulating specific pixels such that a target pattern emerges is exactly what image scaling attacks do. Refer to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20fall_quiring_prepub.pdf">Quiring et al.</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p><h2 id="anamorpher-and-the-attackers-darkroom">Anamorpher and the attacker’s darkroom</h2><p>Currently, Anamorpher (named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphosis">anamorphosis</a>) can develop crafted images for the aforementioned three major methods. Let’s explore how Anamorpher exploits bicubic interpolation frame by frame.</p><p>Bicubic interpolation considers the 16 pixels (from 4x4 sampling) around each target pixel, using cubic polynomials to calculate smooth transitions between pixel values. This method creates a predictable mathematical relationship that can be exploited. Specifically, the algorithm assigns different weights to pixels in the neighborhood, creating pixels that contribute more to the final output, which are known as high-importance pixels. Therefore, the total <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> (brightness) of dark areas of an image will increase if specific high-importance pixels are higher luma than their surroundings.</p><p>Therefore, to exploit this, we can carefully craft high-resolution pixels and solve the inverse problem. First, we select a decoy image with large dark areas to hide our payload. Then, we adjust pixels in dark regions and push the downsampled result toward a red background using least-squares optimization. These adjustments in the dark areas cause the background to turn red while text areas remain largely unmodified and appear black, creating much stronger contrast than visible at full resolution. While this approach is most effective on bicubic downscaling, it also works on specific implementations of bilinear downscaling.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/image_scaling_figure_5.png" alt="How Anamorpher applies this technique on OpenCV’s implementation of bicubic interpolation"><figcaption>Figure 5: How Anamorpher applies this technique on OpenCV’s implementation of bicubic interpolation</figcaption></figure><p>Anamorpher provides users with the ability to visualize and craft image scaling attacks against specific algorithms and implementations through a front-end interface and Python API. In addition, it comes with a modular back end, which enables users to customize their own downscaling algorithm.</p><h2 id="mitigation-and-defense">Mitigation and defense</h2><p>While some downscaling algorithms are more vulnerable than others, attempting to identify the least vulnerable algorithm and implementation is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08690">not a robust approach</a>. This is especially true since image scaling attacks are not restricted to the aforementioned three algorithms.</p><p>For a secure system, we recommend not using image downscaling and simply limiting the upload dimensions. For any transformation, but especially if downscaling is necessary, the end user should always be provided with a preview of the input that the model is actually seeing, even in CLI and API tools.</p><p>The strongest defense, however, is to implement <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837">secure design patterns and systematic</a> defenses that mitigate impactful prompt injection beyond multi-modal prompt injection. Inputs, but especially text within an image, should not be able to initiate sensitive tool calls without explicit user confirmation. Refer to our <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/07/31/hijacking-multi-agent-systems-in-your-pajamas/#building-secure-mass">prior guidance on securing agentic systems</a>.</p><h2 id="now-what">Now what?</h2><p>Image scaling attacks may be even more impactful on mobile and edge devices where fixed image sizes are more frequently enforced and suboptimal downscaling algorithms are readily available within the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap#createScaledBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap,%20int,%20int,%20boolean)">default frameworks and tools</a>. Future work should examine the impact on these devices as well as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06256">additional attack surface introduced by voice AI</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Cloud services giant Fastly has released a report claiming AI crawlers are putting a heavy load on the open web, slurping up sites at a rate that accounts for 80 percent of all AI bot traffic, with the remaining 20 percent used by AI fetchers. Bots and fetchers can hit websites hard, demanding data from a single site in thousands of requests per minute.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I can only see one thing causing this to stop: the AI bubble popping</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="https://learn.fastly.com/rs/025-XKO-469/images/Fastly-Threat-Insights-Report.pdf">report</a> [PDF], Facebook owner Meta's AI division accounts for more than half of those crawlers, while OpenAI accounts for the overwhelming majority of on-demand fetch requests.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/01/tollbooth.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="tollbooth"></p><h2 title="The bargain between content makers and crawlers has broken down">Cloudflare creates AI crawler tollbooth to pay publishers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare_creates_ai_crawler_toll/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>"AI bots are reshaping how the internet is accessed and experienced, introducing new complexities for digital platforms," Fastly senior security researcher Arun Kumar opined in a statement on the report's release. "Whether scraping for training data or delivering real-time responses, these bots create new challenges for visibility, control, and cost. You can't secure what you can't see, and without clear verification standards, AI-driven automation risks are becoming a blind spot for digital teams."</p>
<p>The company's report is based on analysis of Fastly's Next-Gen Web Application Firewall (NGWAF) and Bot Management services, which the company says "protect over 130,000 applications and APIs and inspect more than 6.5 trillion requests per month" – giving it plenty of data to play with. The data reveals a growing problem: an increasing website load comes not from human visitors, but from automated crawlers and fetchers working on behalf of chatbot firms.</p>
<p>The report warned, "Some AI bots, if not carefully engineered, can inadvertently impose an unsustainable load on webservers," Fastly's report warned, "leading to performance degradation, service disruption, and increased operational costs." Kumar separately noted to The Register, "Clearly this growth isn't sustainable, creating operational challenges while also undermining the business model of content creators.&nbsp; We as an industry need to do more to establish responsible norms and standards for crawling that allows AI companies to get the data they need while respecting websites content guidelines."</p>
<p>That growing traffic comes from just a select few companies. Meta accounted for more than half of all AI crawler traffic on its own, at 52 percent, followed by Google and OpenAI at 23 percent and 20 percent respectively. This trio then has its hands on a combined 95 percent of all AI crawler traffic. Anthropic, by contrast, accounted for just 3.76 percent of crawler traffic. The Common Crawl Project, which slurps websites to include in a free public dataset designed to prevent duplication of effort and traffic multiplication at the heart of the crawler problem, was a surprisingly-low 0.21 percent.</p>

    

<p>The story flips when it comes to AI fetchers, which unlike crawlers are fired off on-demand when a user requests that a model incorporates information newer than its training cut-off date. Here, OpenAI was by far the dominant traffic source, Fastly found, accounting for almost 98 percent of all requests. That's an indication, perhaps, of just how much of a lead OpenAI's early entry into the consumer-facing AI chatbot market with ChatGPT gave the company, or possibly just a sign that the company's bot infrastructure may be in need of optimization.</p>

        


        

<p>While AI fetchers make up a minority of Ai bot requests – only about 20%, says Kumar – they can be responsible for huge bursts of traffic, with one fetcher generating over 39,000 requests per minute during the testing period. "We expect fetcher traffic to grow as AI tools become more widely adopted and as more agentic tools come into use that mediate the experience between people and websites," Kumar told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>Perplexity AI, which was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/perplexity_ai_crawlers_accused_data_raids/">recently accused</a> of using IP addresses outside its reported crawler ranges and ignoring robots.txt directives from sites looking to opt out of being scraped, accounted for just 1.12 percent of AI crawler bot and 1.53 percent of AI fetcher bot traffic recorded for the report – though the report noted that this is growing.</p>

        

<p>Kumar decried the practice of ignoring robots.txt notes, telling <em>El Reg</em>, "At a minimum, any reputable AI company today should be honoring robots.txt. Further and even more critically, they should publish their IP address ranges and their bots should use unique names. This will empower site operators to better distinguish the bots crawling their sites and allow them to enforce granular&nbsp; rules with bot management solutions."</p>
<p>But he stopped short of calling for mandated standards, saying that industry forums are working on solutions. "We need to let those processes play out.&nbsp; Mandating technical standards in regulatory frameworks often does not produce a good outcome and shouldn't be our first resort."</p>

</ul>
<p>It's a problem large enough that users have begun fighting back. In the face of bots riding roughshod over polite opt-outs like robots.txt directives, webmasters are increasingly turning to active countermeasures like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/09/anubis_fighting_the_llm_hordes/">the proof-of-work Anubis</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/18/ai_crawlers_sourcehut/">gibberish-feeding tarpit Nepenthes</a>, while Fastly rival Cloudflare has been testing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare_creates_ai_crawler_toll/">pay-per-crawl approach</a> to put a financial burden on the bot operators. "Care must be exercised when employing these techniques," Fastly's report warned, "to avoid accidentally blocking legitimate users or downgrading their experience."</p>
<p>Kumar notes that small site operators, especially those serving dynamic content, are most likely to feel the effects most severely, and he had some recommendations. "The first and simplest step is to configure robots.txt which immediately reduces traffic from well-behaved bots. When technical expertise is available, websites can also deploy controls such as Anubis, which can help reduce bot traffic." He warned, however, that bots are always improving and trying to find ways around "tarpits" like Anubis, as code-hosting site Codeberg <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/15/codeberg_beset_by_ai_bots/">recently experienced</a>. "This creates a constant cat and mouse game, similar to what we observe with other types of bots today," he said.</p>
<p>We spoke to Anubis developer Xe Iaso, CEO of Techaro. When we asked whether they expected the growth in crawler traffic to slow, they said: "I can only see one thing causing this to stop: the AI bubble popping.</p>

        

<p>"There is simply too much hype to give people worse versions of documents, emails, and websites otherwise. I don't know what this actually gives people, but our industry takes great pride in doing this."</p>
<p>However, they added: "I see no reason why it would not grow. People are using these tools to replace knowledge and gaining skills. There's no reason to assume that this attack against our cultural sense of thrift will not continue. This is the perfect attack against middle-management: unsleeping automatons that never get sick, go on vacation, or need to be paid health insurance that can produce output that superficially resembles the output of human employees. I see no reason that this will continue to grow until and unless the bubble pops. Even then, a lot of those scrapers will probably stick around until their venture capital runs out."</p>
<h3>Regulation – we've heard of it</h3>
<p><em>The Register</em> asked Xe whether they thought broader deployment of Anubis and other active countermeasures would help.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/09/shutterstock_anubis.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="anubis guards"></p><h2 title="Using proof of work to block the web-crawlers of 'AI' companies">Anubis guards gates against hordes of LLM bot crawlers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/09/anubis_fighting_the_llm_hordes/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>They responded: "This is a regulatory issue. The thing that needs to happen is that governments need to step in and give these AI companies that are destroying the digital common good existentially threatening fines and make them pay reparations to the communities they are harming. Ironically enough, most of these AI companies rely on the communities they are destroying.</p>
<p>"This presents the kind of paradox that I would expect to read in a Neal Stephenson book from the '90s, not CBC's front page. Anubis helps mitigate a lot of the badness by making attacks more computationally expensive. Anubis (even in configurations that omit proof of work) makes attackers have to retool their scraping to use headless browsers instead of blindly scraping HTML."</p>
<p>And who is paying the piper?</p>
<p>"This increases the infrastructure costs of the AI companies propagating this abusive traffic. The hope is that this makes it fiscally unviable for AI companies to scrape by making them have to dedicate much more hardware to the problem. In essence: it makes the scrapers have to spend more money to do the same work."</p>
<p>We approached Anthropic, Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Perplexity but none provided a comment on the report by the time of publication. ®</p>

	<p>For my <a href="https://osrd.fr/en/">day job</a>, I need to build and run a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> project.
However, because Docker <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26824">doesn’t play well with nftables</a> and I
prefer a rootless + daemonless approach, I’m using <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>.</p>
<p>Podman supports Docker Compose projects with two possible solutions: either by
connecting the official <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/">Docker Compose CLI</a> to a Podman socket, either by
using <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose">their own drop-in replacement</a>. They ship a
<a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html">small wrapper</a> to select one of these options. (The
wrapper has the same name as the replacement, which makes things confusing.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both options have downsides. When using the official Docker
Compose CLI, the classic builder is used instead of the newer <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/">BuildKit</a>
builder. As a result, some features such as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/build/#additional_contexts">additional contexts</a> are not
supported. When using the podman-compose replacement, some other features are
missing, such as <code>!reset</code>, <code>configs</code> and referencing another service in
additional contexts. It would be possible to add these features to
podman-compose, but that’s an endless stream of work (Docker Compose regularly
adds new features) and I don’t really see the value in re-implementing all of
this (the fact that it’s Python doesn’t help me getting motivated).</p>
<p>I’ve started looking for a way to convince the Docker Compose CLI to run under
Podman with BuildKit enabled. I’ve tried a few months ago and never got it to
work, but it seems like this recently became easier! The podman-compose wrapper
<a href="https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/1e7f810f714240f5d68f92baa1ab39ee53a249f5/cmd/podman/compose.go#L164">force-disables BuildKit</a>, so we need to use
directly the Docker Compose CLI without the wrapper. On Arch Linux, this can be
achieved by enabling the Podman socket and creating a new Docker context (same
as setting <code>DOCKER_HOST</code>, but more permanent):</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S docker-compose docker-buildx
systemctl --user start podman.socket
docker context create podman --docker host=unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock
docker context use podman
</code></pre>
<p>With that, <code>docker compose</code> just works! It turns out it automagically creates a
<code>buildx_buildkit_default</code> container under-the-hood to run the BuildKit daemon.
Since I don’t like automagical things, I immediately tried to run BuildKit
daemon myself:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S buildkit
systemctl --user start buildkit.service
docker buildx create --name local unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/buildkit/rootless
docker buildx use local
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>docker compose</code> uses our systemd-managed BuildKit service. But we’re not
done yet! One of the reasons I like Podman is because it’s daemonless, and
we’ve got a daemon running in the background. This isn’t the end of the world,
but it’d be nicer to be able to run the build without BuildKit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way around this: any Compose project can be turned into
a JSON description of the build commands called <a href="https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/">Bake</a>. <code>docker buildx bake --print</code> will print that JSON file (and the Docker Compose CLI will use Bake
files if <code>COMPOSE_BAKE=true</code> is set since v2.33). Note, Bake supports way more
features (e.g. HCL files) but we don’t really need these for our purposes (and
the command above can lower fancy Bake files into dumb JSON ones).</p>
<p>The JSON file is pretty similar to the <code>podman build</code> CLI arguments. It’s not
that hard to do the translation, so I’ve written <a href="https://github.com/emersion/bakah">Bakah</a>, a small tool which
does exactly this. It uses <a href="https://buildah.io/">Buildah</a> instead of shelling out to Podman (Buildah
is the library used by Podman under-the-hood to build images). A few details
required a bit more attention, for instance dependency resolution and parallel
builds, but it’s quite simple. It can be used like so:</p>
<pre><code>docker buildx bake --print &gt;bake.json
bakah --file bake.json
</code></pre>
<p>Bakah is still missing the fancier Bake features (HCL files, inheritance,
merging/overriding files, variables, and so on), but it’s enough to build
complex Compose projects. I plan to use it for <a href="https://codeberg.org/emersion/soju-containers">soju-containers</a> in the future,
to better split my Dockerfiles (one for the backend, one for the frontend) and
remove the CI shell script (which contains a bunch of Podman CLI invocations).
I hope it can be useful to you as well!</p>

<p dir="auto">DiffMem is a lightweight, git-based memory backend designed for AI agents and conversational systems. It uses Markdown files for human-readable storage, Git for tracking temporal evolution through differentials, and an in-memory BM25 index for fast, explainable retrieval. This project is a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploring how version control systems can serve as a foundation for efficient, scalable memory in AI applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">At its core, DiffMem treats memory as a versioned repository: the "current state" of knowledge is stored in editable files, while historical changes are preserved in Git's commit graph. This separation allows agents to query and search against a compact, up-to-date surface without the overhead of historical data, while enabling deep dives into evolution when needed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Git for AI Memory?</h2><a id="user-content-why-git-for-ai-memory" aria-label="Permalink: Why Git for AI Memory?" href="#why-git-for-ai-memory"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Traditional memory systems for AI agents often rely on databases, vector stores, or graph structures. These work well for certain scales but can become bloated or inefficient when dealing with long-term, evolving personal knowledge. DiffMem takes a different path by leveraging Git's strengths:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Current-State Focus</strong>: Memory files store only the "now" view of information (e.g., current relationships, facts, or timelines). This reduces the surface area for queries and searches, making operations faster and more token-efficient in LLM contexts. Historical states are not loaded by default—they live in Git's history, accessible on-demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Differential Intelligence</strong>: Git diffs and logs provide a natural way to track how memories evolve. Agents can ask "How has this fact changed over time?" without scanning entire histories, pulling only relevant commits. This mirrors how human memory reconstructs events from cues, not full replays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Durability and Portability</strong>: Plaintext Markdown ensures memories are human-readable and tool-agnostic. Git's distributed nature means your data is backup-friendly and not locked into proprietary formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Efficiency for Agents</strong>: By separating "surface" (current files) from "depth" (git history), agents can be selective—load the now for quick responses, dive into diffs for analytical tasks. This keeps context windows lean while enabling rich temporal reasoning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This approach shines for long-horizon AI systems where memories accumulate over years: it scales without sprawl, maintains auditability, and allows "smart forgetting" through pruning while preserving reconstructability.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DiffMem is structured as importable modules—no servers required. Key components:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Writer Agent</strong> (<code>writer_agent</code>): Analyzes conversation transcripts, identifies/creates entities, stages updates in Git's working tree. Commits are explicit, ensuring atomic changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Context Manager</strong> (<code>context_manager</code>): Assembles query-relevant context at varying depths (basic: core blocks; wide: semantic search; deep: full files; temporal: with git history).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Searcher Agent</strong> (<code>searcher_agent</code>): LLM-orchestrated BM25 search—distills queries from conversations, retrieves snippets, synthesizes responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>API Layer</strong> (<code>api.py</code>): Clean interface for read/write operations. Example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="from diffmem import DiffMemory

memory = DiffMemory(&quot;/path/to/repo&quot;, &quot;alex&quot;, &quot;your-api-key&quot;)

# Get context for a conversation
context = memory.get_context(conversation, depth=&quot;deep&quot;)

# Process and commit new memory
memory.process_and_commit_session(&quot;Had coffee with mom today...&quot;, &quot;session-123&quot;)"><pre><span>from</span> <span>diffmem</span> <span>import</span> <span>DiffMemory</span>

<span>memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>DiffMemory</span>(<span>"/path/to/repo"</span>, <span>"alex"</span>, <span>"your-api-key"</span>)

<span># Get context for a conversation</span>
<span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>memory</span>.<span>get_context</span>(<span>conversation</span>, <span>depth</span><span>=</span><span>"deep"</span>)

<span># Process and commit new memory</span>
<span>memory</span>.<span>process_and_commit_session</span>(<span>"Had coffee with mom today..."</span>, <span>"session-123"</span>)</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The repo follows a structured layout (see <code>repo_guide.md</code> for details), with current states in Markdown files and evolution in Git commits. Indexing is in-memory for speed, rebuilt on demand.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why This Works</h2><a id="user-content-why-this-works" aria-label="Permalink: Why This Works" href="#why-this-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DiffMem's git-centric design solves key challenges in AI memory systems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Reduced Query Surface</strong>: Only current-state files are indexed/searched by default. This minimizes noise in BM25 results and keeps LLM contexts concise—crucial for token limits. When history is needed, agents pull targeted diffs (e.g., <code>git diff HEAD~1 file.md</code>), not full archives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Scalable Evolution Tracking</strong>: Git handles 50+ years of changes efficiently. Agents can reconstruct past states (<code>git show &lt;commit&gt;:file.md</code>) without bloating active memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Developer-Friendly</strong>: No DB schemas or migrations—edit Markdown directly. Git provides free versioning, branching (e.g., monthly timelines), and collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Lightweight PoC</strong>: Runs in-process, minimal deps (gitpython, rank-bm25, sentence-transformers). Easy to hack on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prototype Status and Limitations</h2><a id="user-content-prototype-status-and-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Prototype Status and Limitations" href="#prototype-status-and-limitations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an early PoC—functional but not production-hardened. What's working:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Entity creation/update from transcripts.</li>
<li>Multi-depth context assembly.</li>
<li>Semantic/BM25 hybrid search.</li>
<li>Git-based temporal queries.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Known limitations:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No automatic git sync (manual pulls/pushes).</li>
<li>Basic error handling.</li>
<li>Index rebuilds on every init (add caching for production).</li>
<li>No multi-user concurrency locks.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">DiffMem points to a future where AI memory is as versioned and collaborative as code. Imagine:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Agent-Driven Pruning</strong>: LLMs that "forget" low-strength memories by archiving to git branches, mimicking neural plasticity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Collaborative Memories</strong>: Multi-agent systems sharing repos, with merge requests for "memory reconciliation."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Temporal Agents</strong>: Specialized models that query git logs to answer "how did I change?"—enabling self-reflective AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hybrid Stores</strong>: Combine with vector embeddings for semantic depth, using git as the "diff layer" over embeddings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Open-Source Ecosystem</strong>: Plugins for voice input, mobile sync, or integration with tools like Obsidian.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As AI agents become long-lived companions, git-like systems could make them evolvable without data silos. We're excited to see where the community takes this—perhaps toward distributed, privacy-first personal AIs.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is an R&amp;D project from Growth Kinetics, a boutique data solutions agency specializing in AI enablement. We're exploring how differential memory can power next-gen agents. We'd love collaborations, PRs, or honest feedback to improve it.</p>

<p>An empty type is synonymous with <code>d</code> for integers.</p>
<p>These format specifications only work on integers (<code>int</code>).</p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>These examples assume the following variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string = "Python"
</code></pre>

<p>These format specifications work on strings (<code>str</code>) and most other types (any type that doesn't specify its own custom format specifications).</p>
<h2>All objects</h2>
<p>The below modifiers are special syntaxes supported by all object types.
Some format specifications are also included to show how to mix and match these syntaxes with the <code>:</code> syntax.</p>

<p>An empty conversion field is synonymous with <code>!s</code>, unless a self-documenting expression is used.
When a self-documenting expression is used, an empty conversion field uses <code>!r</code>.</p>
