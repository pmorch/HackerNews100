<div><p>It’s anecdotal, I know, but my main <a href="https://bigtop.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entertainment business</a> revenue is down 50% over the past 3 months. Our main paid source of leads was Google Ads, which have served us well over the past 10 years or so – I think I know what I am doing in adwords by now. </p><p>Once per month I check the analytics, updating keywords and tweaking ad campaigns. Over the past year we increased our budget, and then I started looking at it once per week, running simultaneous campaigns with different settings, just trying to get SOMETHING. </p><p>Last month Google gave us a bonus – free money! This was 5x our monthly ad spend, to spend just when we needed it most – over the December holidays. I added another new campaign, updated the budgets for the existing ones. Still no change. The last week there was money to burn, left over from unused ad spend. I increased our budget to 10x. ZERO RETURN. </p><p>The money ran out. I am not putting more in. Where do we go from here? </p></div>



<h2>What is next</h2>



<p>Research shows that many young people are getting their information from short video platforms like TikTok and Instagram. We are trying ads on there. </p>



<p><br>Our customer base is comprised of 50% returning customers (I am proud of that statistic!). We have an email newsletter, we started sending them regularly over the past 2 months. Remember us? </p>



<div><p>We also plan to do some actual physical advertising – I am going to a market next weekend, doing a free show or two, handing out cards. </p><p>Also, we are branching out – I have some projects I want to make, related to the <a href="http://www.patreon.com/c/CircusScientist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Poi project</a>, and hopefully sell. We ordered supplies last week. </p><p>Right now, though – I’m broke. Anyone need a <a href="https://devsoft.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website or IOT project built</a>? I am AI assisted, very fast! </p></div>

                <p>Marketers are finding out the hard way that <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-adds-new-generative-ai-to-advertising-tools-details-2024-5" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">Meta's AI tools</a> can churn out some very strange ads.</p><p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that <a target="_blank" href="https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-about-ai-and-the-evolution-of-social-media/" data-track-click="{&quot;click_type&quot;:&quot;other&quot;,&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;outbound_click&quot;}" rel=" nofollow">the company's artificial intelligence</a> had become so advanced that advertisers would no longer need to create their own ads. Brands could simply hand over their bank accounts and campaign objectives and let the AI take the wheel.</p><p>Some marketers, however, haven't been pleased with the results when they let <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metas-bet-on-ai-is-bringing-back-advertisers-2023-1" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">Meta's AI</a> drive their ad campaigns.</p><p>Bryan Cano, head of marketing of the "elevated basics" clothing brand True Classic, was aghast when he noticed Meta had switched out his top-performing ad — an attractive millennial man in a matching fleece set, casually posing on a stool — with an AI-generated photo of a cheerful yet unnatural granny sitting in an armchair. True Classic typically targets its Meta ads to men ages 30 to 45.</p><p>The ad ran on Meta for three days before customers alerted True Classic to it, Cano told Business Insider. He said that while the direction Meta is taking with AI makes sense, he felt the generative-ads tool wasn't yet ready for prime time.</p>
              
            
              
            <p>"This doesn't just affect our relationship with customers, who were upset by this, but it could also damage relationships with wholesale customers and the relationships we have built with retailers," Cano said.</p><p>Tech companies, including Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, have heralded AI as a way for advertisers to speed up ad creation and <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-gmv-max-september-shop-ads-big-brand-pushback-2025-8" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">enhance the performance</a> of their campaigns. However, many advertisers are wary of ceding too much control to <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-boosts-ad-performance-but-some-advertisers-push-back-2023-11" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">black box systems</a>, particularly since consumers often have an <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brands-reject-ai-aerie-heineken-polaroid-marketing-2025-10" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">aversion to ads</a> that are obviously generated by AI. The AI granny is a comical example of what can happen when algorithms go unchecked.</p><p>True Classic isn't the only brand to have a chaotic Meta ad experience recently, thanks to AI.</p><p>European footwear brand Kirruna noticed Meta's AI had whipped up an ad featuring a model whose leg had twisted around completely the wrong way.</p>

            <p>Elsewhere, Meta generated an ad for the e-bike company Lectric, asking "What are the easiest eBikes to put in my trunk," which featured the trunk of a car. So far, so normal — except the car also appeared to be flying through clouds. Logan Young, Lectric's VP of digital marketing, said the company managed to catch the ad before it ran.</p><p>"We turn it all off, pretty much," Young said of Meta's AI-generated ad enhancements.</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that millions of advertisers are finding value and improved performance by using its Advantage+ creative tools.</p><p>"Advertisers who use our full image generation feature have the opportunity to review the generated images before running their ad. We are continuously improving our products and features based on advertiser feedback," the Meta spokesperson said.</p><p>Cano of True Classic said the AI granny ad hadn't surfaced as one of the selected ads in its campaign preview, which is why the brand was caught off guard.</p>

Advantage+ is the brand name for Meta's suite of <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-adds-new-generative-ai-to-advertising-tools-details-2024-5" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">AI-powered ad</a> products.</p><p>Three advertisers also said they'd encountered a problem where Meta automatically switched those toggles to "on," even when they'd explicitly turned them off — meaning they inadvertently spent their budgets on AI-generated ads they didn't intend to run.</p><p>Rok Hladnik, CEO of the marketing agency Flat Circle, which manages around $100 million in annual Meta ad spending for numerous direct-to-consumer brands, said he has encountered similar issues with Meta auto-generating bizarre ads. His company is now setting aside time two to three mornings a week to manually check that AI enhancements are switched off. The task takes up to an hour per account, he said.</p><p>"It randomly turns on, even for ads you've turned off for a second time," Hladnik said. "It's a complete mess."</p><p>Jonas Vonk, founder of the e-commerce business Yuzu Knives, said he became so frustrated by how toggles like the AI-creative feature can be hidden within Meta's settings that he created his own startup, AdsFlow, which helps surface them more clearly for ad buyers.</p><p>"You really have to dig for them, and switch them all off every time you run an ad," Vonk said of Meta's ad settings.</p><p>Pieter Van der Auwera, a marketing consultant who runs Meta ads for the Kirruna shoe brand, said the company has had to issue two refunds to customers who complained that the items they received weren't made of the material depicted in ads generated by Meta's AI. (Remarkably, the ad featuring the model with the backward leg did a good job of replicating the real boot, he added.)</p><p>Van der Auwera said an issue with AI-generated ads is that while Meta provides a preview of ads prelaunch, they need to be opened one by one to check, which can be a time suck when brands run hundreds of different versions.</p><p>"When I first heard about Meta AI, I was really hopeful and thought it would take away a lot of my work and make my work a lot faster so that I can do more for my clients," Van der Auwera said. "Now, I have more work than before."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<h2><a href="https://orib.dev/">orib.dev</a>: LLMS Are Not Fun</h2>

<p>I got into programming because it let me turn thought into
reality.  If I could reason precisely, then a computer could
carry out my thoughts unerringly. I could step away from tiring,
ambiguous human interaction for a while.</p>

<p>Over time, I warmed up to people.  The most fun I've had in
my career has been watching my colleagues improve. Handing them
projects just outside the range of their abilities, and giving
them an environment where they were unafraid to fail.</p>

<p>Today, I consult with several companies on all aspects of
building software.  Sometimes, that means thinking through
product direction and building a team to execute on it. 
Sometimes, it means designing system architecture and writing code.</p>

<p>I would not be doing my duty to my clients if I wasn't
able to guide them on the effective use of LLMs.  So I,
through gritted teeth, regularly use LLMs for projects.</p>

<p>Some people describe LLMs as the ultimate programming tool.
Others describe it as an extra machine teammate. It's a dark
parody of both.</p>

<p>LLMs are not fun.</p>

<p>For me, the joy of programming is understanding a problem
in full depth, so that when considering a change, I can follow
the ripples through the connected components of the system.</p>

<p>The joy of management is seeing my colleagues learn and
excel, carving their own paths as they grow. Watching them
rise to new challenges. As they grow, I learn from their
growth; mentoring benefits the mentor alongside the mentee.</p>

<p>Using LLMs undercuts both.</p>

<p>On the engineering side, using LLMs to write code is as fun as
hiring a taskrabbit to solve my jigsaw puzzles. And if you think
of LLMs as an extra teammate, there's no fun in managing them either.
Nurturing the personal growth of an LLM is an obvious waste of time.
Micromanaging them, watching to preempt slop and derailment, is
frustrating and rage-inducing.</p>

<p>I can make effective use of LLMs. It merely costs me my care
for my craft, and my joy in its practice.</p>

<p>A major link in Tesla’s 4680 battery supply chain has just snapped. South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;F Co. announced today that the value of its massive supply deal with Tesla has been slashed by over 99%, signaling a catastrophic drop in demand for the automaker’s in-house battery cells.</p>



<p>This is arguably the strongest evidence yet that Tesla’s 4680 program, and the vehicle that relies on it, the Cybertruck, is in serious trouble.</p>



<p>In early 2023, L&amp;F <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-lf-says-value-battery-material-supply-deal-with-tesla-cut-7386-2025-12-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a $2.9 billion contract</a> to supply high-nickel cathode materials directly to Tesla.</p>



<p>At the time, the industry saw this as a major move by Tesla to secure materials for its ramp-up of the 4680 battery cell, which Elon Musk had touted as the key to halving battery costs and enabling cheaper electric vehicles, a plan he later scrapped.</p>	
	



<p>Right now, Tesla’s Cybertruck is the only vehicle using the automaker’s own 4680 cells.</p>



<p>In a regulatory filing today, L&amp;F revealed that the contract’s value has been written down to just $7,386.</p>



<p>No, that is not a typo. $2.9 billion to roughly $7,400.</p>



<p>L&amp;F did not explicitly state the reason for the cut, citing only a “change in supply quantity,” but the dots are easy to connect. The high-nickel cathode was destined for Tesla’s 4680 cells, and the primary consumer of those cells is the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>We have been reporting on the Cybertruck’s demand issues for the better part of this year. In March, we noted that the truck was <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/06/tesla-now-offers-discounted-financing-on-cybertruck-as-the-truck-turns-out-to-be-a-flop/">turning out to be a flop</a> as Tesla began offering discounted financing to move inventory. By June, Tesla <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/05/tesla-goes-full-desperate-cybertruck-with-biggest-discount-yet/">became desperate</a>, launching 0% APR incentives as inventory piled up in lots across the US.</p>



<p>Despite a production capacity of 250,000 units per year at Giga Texas, the Cybertruck is currently selling at a run rate of roughly 20,000 to 25,000 units annually. We even saw Tesla <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/13/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-cybertruck/">discontinue the cheapest Cybertruck</a> in September because, frankly, no one wanted a gutted version of a truck that was already struggling to find buyers.</p>



<p>If Tesla isn’t building Cybertrucks, it doesn’t need 4680 cells. And if it doesn’t need 4680 cells, L&amp;F has no one to sell its cathode material to.</p>



<h3 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h3>



<p>This is not a good look Tesla’s 4680 program.</p>



<p>For years, we’ve been told that the 4680 cell was the “holy grail” that would allow Tesla to produce a $25,000 electric car. But five years after Battery Day, the cells are still reportedly difficult to manufacture at scale due to the dry electrode process, and their only application is a low-volume pickup truck that has become a commercial failure.</p>



<p>The math here is brutal. A 99% reduction in a supply contract basically means the contract was cancelled. It means Tesla is not ramping 4680 production; if anything, they might be winding it down.</p>




	<p>The ‘Cybercab’ is also supposed to be using the 4680 cells, but we will have to wait and see how that goes.</p>



<p>It’s also a vehicle program that could go the way of the Cybertruck. CEO Elon Musk is insisting that it will launch in early 2026 without a steering wheel, but Tesla has yet to solve level 4 autonomous driving.</p>



<p>If it does launch without a steering wheel, it will be a program even more limited in volume than the Cybertruck.</p>



<p><em>The battery supply situation and the critical minerals behind it are evolving fast, and China controls most of it. In <a href="https://zalkon.substack.com/p/china-is-running-out-of-some-crticial">a new Substack, I shared a full list</a> of the years of reserve remaining for each mineral.</em></p>

<p>Hey everyone, GOG Team here.<br></p>



<p>Today, Michał Kiciński, one of the co-founders of CD PROJEKT, and the co-founder of GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p>



<h2>Why GOG and Michal Kicinski are getting together</h2>



<p>We believe the games that shaped us deserve to stay alive: easy to find, buy, download, and play forever. But time is annoyingly good at erasing them. Rights get tangled, compatibility breaks, builds disappear, and a nostalgic evening often turns into a troubleshooting session. That’s the difference between “I’m playing today” (the game lives on) and “I’ll play someday” (the game dies).</p>



<p>As Michał put it: “GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control.”</p>



<p>GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.</p>



<p>This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.</p>



<h2>What it means for you</h2>



<p>First of all, DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever. Your library stays yours to enjoy: same access, same offline installers, same sense of ownership. Your data stays with GOG, and GOG GALAXY remains optional.</p>



<p>We’ll keep our relationship with CD PROJEKT. CD PROJEKT RED games will continue to be available on <a href="http://gog.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and upcoming titles from the studio will also be released on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a GOG Patron, or you donate to support the Preservation Program, those funds stay within GOG. Your support has been huge this year, and we think that with your help, we can undertake even more ambitious rescue missions in 2026 and 2027. We’ll have more to say about that sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>GOG will remain&nbsp; independent in its operations. We will continue building a platform that’s ethical, non-predatory, and made to last, while helping indie developers reach the world. We’re also committed to giving the community a stronger voice, with new initiatives planned for 2026.</p>



<p>Thanks for being the reason this all matters.</p>



<p>A lot of companies sell games. Fewer do the unglamorous work of making sure the games that shaped people’s lives don’t quietly rot into incompatibility.</p>



<p>Thanks for caring about this mission with us. We’ll keep you posted as we ship, and in the meantime, you can dig into the full FAQ for the detailed answers.</p>











<h2>FAQ</h2>


<div id="rank-math-faq">
<div id="faq-question-1767024478694">
<h3><strong>What is happening?</strong></h3>
<p>Michał Kiciński, the original co-founder of GOG and co-founder of CD PROJEKT, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT. GOG will continue operating as GOG, a distinct company, with the same mission to Make Games Live Forever.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1767024494514">
<h3><strong>What is GOG’s position in this?</strong></h3>
<p>To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1767024505630">
<h3><strong>Why is Michał Kiciński doing this?</strong></h3>
<p>Because he wants to preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG. In a PC market that keeps moving toward mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, he believes GOG’s approach is more relevant than ever: no lock-in, no forced platforms, sense of ownership. His goal is to keep supporting both gamers and developers, and strengthen GOG’s mission: preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1767024516030">
<h3><strong>Why is CD PROJEKT doing this?</strong></h3>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Over the past few months I've been chipping away at a small Redis-compatible key/value server called
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nickmonad/kv"><code>kv</code></a>. The goal is to have something (mostly) production-ready, while implementing
only a small subset of commands. The world doesn't necessarily need another key/value store, I'm just interested in
implementing it in Zig and learning about some new (to me) techniques for systems programming.</p>
<p>One of those techniques is static memory allocation during initialization. The idea here is that all memory is requested
and allocated from the OS <em>at startup</em>, and held until termination. I first heard about this while learning about
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, and they reference it explicitly in their development style guide dubbed "TigerStyle".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All memory must be statically allocated at startup. <strong>No memory may be dynamically allocated (or freed and reallocated)
after initialization.</strong> This avoids unpredictable behavior that can significantly affect performance, and avoids use-after-free.
As a second-order effect, it is our experience that this also makes for more efficient, simpler designs that are more
performant and easier to maintain and reason about, compared to designs that do not consider all possible memory usage
patterns upfront as part of the design.</p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">TigerStyle</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although, this isn't as straightforward as it might sound at first. The first question that comes to mind might be:
"How much memory do I allocate?" Of course, the answer depends on the system. If we're writing a server, how many
concurrent connections do we allow? How much space is each connection allowed to work with? How much data do we expect
to process at any given time? Are there limits in response size? Do we need all the data at once, or can it streamed in
some fashion?</p>
<p>These are all questions that depend on the nature of the system and the context in which it will operate. I believe
that going through the exercise of answering these questions is ultimately a good thing, as it seems to have a strong
possibility of resulting in more stable systems, and forces us to understand the nature of our program at a deeper level.<sup id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>On the language front, I feel like Zig is currently the best option out there for doing this with <em>relative</em> ease,
considering its design choices around explicit memory allocation and the <code>std.mem.Allocator</code> interface, which allows
the standard library to ship with a variety of different allocators.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how we can manage static allocation in <code>kv</code>, considering three areas of request handling in
sequence: connection handling, command parsing, and key/value storage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of this is pretty new to me, and I'm still wrestling with all these concepts. (And learning Zig!) I'm sure
there are better ways of handling this stuff. I'm presenting this as one possible implementation completed as a
learning exercise. I'll speak more about the trade-offs and where I think it can go further at the end of this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="connection-handling">Connection Handling</h2>
<p>The first thing we have to consider is how data comes into the system, which we'll maintain through the concept
of a <code>Connection</code>.</p>
<p>A connection represents the communication to a particular client that wants to access the key/value store.
Since we're using <code>io_uring</code> for asynchronous I/O, we have to keep some information around through the life-cycle of
a request, so the kernel can use it. The space for that information is what we'll statically allocate and re-use across
different connections as they come and go.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>const </span><span>Connection = </span><span>struct </span><span>{
</span><span>	</span><span>completion</span><span>: </span><span>Completion </span><span>= </span><span>undefined</span><span>,
</span><span>	</span><span>client</span><span>: </span><span>posix.socket_t </span><span>= </span><span>undefined</span><span>,
</span><span>	
</span><span>	</span><span>recv_buffer</span><span>: *</span><span>ByteArray</span><span>,
</span><span>	</span><span>send_buffer</span><span>: *</span><span>ByteArray</span><span>,
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Connections also must maintain something called a "completion". This detail is related to integration with <code>io_uring</code>,
the full details of which are outside the scope of this post. There are some good resources
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://unixism.net/loti/index.html">here</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/io_uring.7.html">here</a>.
I also took some inspiration from TigerBeetle's <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/522c0b9d15b112b20c57903987f140f1c16f627b/src/io/linux.zig">IO module</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During initialization, we create three pools: one for the Connection structs themselves, one for receive buffers
(requests), and one for send buffers (responses). When a request comes in to the server, a Connection is pulled
from a <code>std.heap.MemoryPool</code>, and then two buffers are associated with that <code>Connection</code>. The buffers are
implemented as <code>ByteArray</code> structs, which are in turn allocated as part of a <code>ByteArrayPool</code>. The <code>ByteArrayPool</code>
is custom and uses a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_list">free list</a> to keep track of which buffers are available
to reserve for a new connection.</p>

</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://nickmonad.blog/images/kv-connection-pool.png" alt="A diagram showing how the kv connection pool works. A connection has two buffers, one for receive and one for send. Each come from a separate pool."></p>
<p>At runtime, connections are created and destroyed (marked as available) using these pools and no actual allocation
needs to happen. If no <code>Connection</code> is available in the pool, the request is rejected and the client will have to try again.</p>
<p>This does mean that the server must be configured with an upper limit on the number of connections. Each connection
must also have a limit on how much data it can receive and send.</p>
<p>At first this might seem limiting, but in practice, it creates a more robust system. Databases in particular will
enforce a limit on the number of active connections for that exact reason! For a backend, networked system like <code>kv</code>,
I would say something like 1000 active connections is a pretty reasonable limit. For a public facing system you'd
likely want more. Of course, this should all be configurable by the user.</p>
<p>The <code>Config</code> struct given to the <code>ConnectionPool</code> represents these user-configured options. Note that the <code>Config</code>
struct has a method <code>.allocation()</code> which is computed after the options have been set. In this case,
the <code>connection_recv_size</code> and <code>connection_send_size</code> depend on other options, such as <code>config.key_count</code> and
<code>config.key_size_max</code>. We'll revisit those later.</p>
<p>Now that data can get into the system, the next step is to parse out Redis commands.</p>
<h2 id="command-parsing">Command Parsing</h2>
<p>In an attempt to be compatible with Redis (at least a very small subset of it), <code>kv</code> has to parse incoming commands
following the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/">Redis serialization protocol</a> ("RESP") format.</p>
<p>Here's an example of an incoming <code>GET key</code> command.</p>
<pre><code><span>*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n
</span></code></pre>
<p>I won't go into detail on how these commands are structured, the RESP document will do a much better job there.
Basically, what we're looking at is "Here's an array with 2 elements. The first element has 3 characters,
with the content <code>GET</code> and the second element has 3 characters, with the contenhttps://github.com/nickmonad/kvt <code>key</code>."</p>
<p>In order to parse this command, we need to look at the buffer that contains the request data, create some kind of
iterator over that buffer, and split each entry on the CRLF <code>\r\n</code> byte sequence. Here's the signature for <code>parse</code>,
the function that does just that.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>pub fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>: </span><span>Config</span><span>, </span><span>alloc</span><span>: </span><span>std.mem.Allocator</span><span>, </span><span>buf</span><span>: []</span><span>const u8</span><span>) !</span><span>Command
</span></code></pre>
<p>The allocator is used to create some book-keeping structure as we parse through the command. We need to create a list
of <code>[]const u8</code> slices that points into the whole buffer and then is given to a command's <code>parse()</code> function, once
we know the command. This has the benefit of being a "zero copy" approach to parsing. No request data needs to be copied,
only pointed to.</p>
<p>Zig's <code>std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator</code> is perfect for this kind of operation. During initialization, we ask for buffer
space from a general purpose allocator, and pass it to the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code>. This allocator works as "bump" allocator,
where each internal allocation happens in a linear fashion, up to the amount of available space. The trade-off here is
that memory allocated within the fixed buffer can't be free'd directly. Instead, the entire buffer is reset after use,
which simply resets an index back to <code>0</code>. (Just about as cheap as an operation can get!)</p>
<p>Since our server is single-threaded<sup id="fr-2-1"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> and processes one request at a time, we can re-use this <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code>
across every request. After the request is processed, the response is copied to a <code>Writer</code> object backed by the
connection's <code>send</code> buffer and the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> is reset for the next request.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickmonad.blog/images/kv-parsing-state.png" alt="A diagram showing how parsing state works in kv."></p>
<p>Knowing how much space to give the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> depends again on our system configuration. We need space for
the <code>ArrayList</code> of parsed command items, and space for any copied list items that are written back as a response during
command execution. Parsing must be able to support the largest possible command (a list <code>PUSH</code> of maximum size/length) and
copying has to support the largest possible response (again, a maximally sized list).</p>
<p>Copying has the extra consideration that we have to actually store the copied list items, which are duplicated when
read from the key/value store. During parsing, we just need to keep <em>slices</em> into the request buffer. For the copied
items, we need to keep a list of slices that point to the items, and the items themselves. As long as we give the
<code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> space, we can use it for all these (sub-)allocations.</p>

<p><img src="https://nickmonad.blog/images/kv-fixed-buffer-space.png" alt="A diagram showing how the Fixed Buffer Allocator is utilized in kv. The first section is the parse array, the second is the copy array, and the third is copy data."></p>
<p>The underlying <code>Store</code> will use the <code>FixedBufferAllocator</code> to allocate an <code>ArrayList</code> of fixed capacity
(determined by <code>config.list_length_max</code>) and then use the remaining space in the allocator for the copied data.</p>
<p>Hopefully all is clear so far! Now we can move on to the core of the system: key/value storage.</p>
<h2 id="key-value-storage">Key/Value Storage</h2>
<p>Perhaps obviously, the fundamental data structure in <code>kv</code> is a hash map, used to associate user provided keys with
user provided values.</p>
<p>Without looking too closely at the standard library, if you grab one of the provided hash map implementations,
it will accept a <code>std.mem.Allocator</code> and hold onto the allocator for the lifetime of the map. When a key/value pair
is added to the map, it will use that same allocator and request the appropriate amount of memory to store that data.
This won't work for our case though, since we need to control allocation prior to adding any data to the map.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Zig also provides an "unmanaged" version of a hash map. Generally, these unmanaged versions of data
structures in the standard library mean that an allocator is not held by the structure itself. It's up to us to provide
that allocator when needed. A cool trick we can play with an unmanaged map is ask it to ensure it has enough capacity
up front, and then "assume" that capacity during runtime when adding data to it. The hashing and internal details are
still handled by the map.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>var </span><span>map</span><span>: std.</span><span>StringHashMapUnmanaged</span><span>(Value) =</span><span> .empty</span><span>;
</span><span>try</span><span> map.</span><span>ensureTotalCapacity</span><span>(gpa, capacity);
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>ensure</code> operation can fail with <code>error.OutOfMemory</code>, which is OK during initialization. But, assuming this succeeds,
we no longer need to pass an allocator when we store data in the map.</p>
<pre data-lang="zig"><code data-lang="zig"><span>store.map.</span><span>putAssumeCapacity</span><span>(key, value);
</span></code></pre>
<p>This <em>could</em> in theory fail, in which case there would an assertion failure. It's ultimately up to us to check against
the map's available capacity before calling this function. But, again, no allocation is required.</p>
<p>Since the map itself doesn't do any allocation at runtime, we have to provide space for incoming keys and values. We'll
reuse the same <code>ByteArrayPool</code> implementation that we used for connection buffers. Basically, we have a big space
allocated for keys and values and the hash map just maintains an association of pointers from keys to values.
The key/value data isn't literally <em>stored</em> "in the map." The allocation that happens in <code>ensureTotalCapacity</code> is for
the internal book-keeping structure of the map, not for the user data.</p>
<h3 id="navigating-the-map">Navigating the map</h3>
<p>At the highest level, the primary challenge with storing keys and values in a statically allocated map is that we
could get poor utilization of the allocated space, especially when we need to support keys pointed at lists as values.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let's say our map is configured to allocate space for 5 keys and 5 values. If each key maps to one
value, we get perfect utilization. At the other extreme, if one key maps to a value containing a list of 5 elements,
we have to use all the allocated value space for this one key, preventing other keys from using any value space,
causing the map to be "biased". The store wouldn't be able to hold any more key/value pairs, even though there is
allocated memory "on the table."</p>
<p><img src="https://nickmonad.blog/images/kv-map-utilization.png" alt="A diagram showing three different possibilities of how allocated memory can be used in a static hash map."></p>
<p>Basically, the only way to mitigate this is to make sure there's enough allocated space for <em>every</em> key to hold a
list of maximum size. This definitely inflates the amount of space we have to allocate, but the alternative is a
system that doesn't support its configured properties. Every key must be <em>able</em> to store a list of maximum size,
even if they don't during actual use.</p>
<p>Another issue with static allocation in the context of a map is dealing with map deletions. Our
<code>std.StringHashMapUnmanaged</code> structure uses open-addressing and linear probing to place keys in the map when hash
collisions occur. Deletions are tricky because they can break the map's ability to know if a key is actually present
in the map. To handle this, a "tombstone" technique is used to mark a space as logically (but not physically) deleted
in order to preserve accurate lookups.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to figure out here, but it's my understanding that a map will have to periodically rehash the
keys in order to reclaim space if too many tombstones pile up. When this occurs is still a bit of mystery to me.
If it occurs when the map needs to grow to accommodate more key/value pairs, we'll never actually trigger that
condition in a static context. If it occurs at some other point, based on number of keys compared to capacity,
perhaps that could work. Or maybe, it's up to us to call <code>rehash()</code> whenever it appears there is no space left,
and try the operation again.</p>
<p>All of this considered, I think a custom map implementation is more appropriate for the context of static allocation.
This current implementation proves the concept, but definitely leaves room for improvement!</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-allocation-size">Revisiting allocation size</h2>
<p>Now that we have a method for statically allocating space for these three components (connections, parsing, and storage),
we can finally answer the first question: How much space do we allocate?</p>
<p>In this current iteration of <code>kv</code>, the answer can really only be determined after the fact, once configuration has
been set and all the allocations have been made. There are five options that can be configured by the user,
and two derived properties based on those options.</p>

<p>The <code>connection_recv_size</code> and <code>connection_send_size</code> properties of <code>Allocation</code> depend on some details of the
RESP protocol, but is mostly informed by our user configuration. In the interest of wrapping this post up,
I'll gloss over those details, and encourage you to check out <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nickmonad/kv/blob/master/src/config.zig"><code>src/config.zig</code></a>.</p>
<p>This <code>Config</code> struct doesn't directly specify <em>every</em> aspect of allocation, but it does provide the basis for it.
Something not listed in the <code>Config</code> struct directly is the "list item pool", part of the key/value <code>Store</code> struct.
When keys point to lists as values, there is a linked list backing that value in the hash map, and we need a pool of
structs to assist in the construction and iteration of that linked list.</p>
<p>With some reasonable configuration options set, let's see just how much memory we allocate!</p>
<pre data-lang="sh"><code data-lang="sh"><span>$</span><span> zig build run
</span><span>config
</span><span>  </span><span>connections_max</span><span> = 1000
</span><span>  </span><span>key_count</span><span>       = 1000
</span><span>  </span><span>key_size_max</span><span>    = 1024
</span><span>  </span><span>val_size_max</span><span>    = 4096
</span><span>  </span><span>list_length_max</span><span> = 50
</span><span>allocation
</span><span>  </span><span>connection_recv_size</span><span> = 206299
</span><span>  </span><span>connection_send_size</span><span> = 205255
</span><span>map</span><span> capacity = 2048, map size = 0, available = 1638
</span><span>total_requested_bytes</span><span> = 748213015
</span><span>ready!
</span></code></pre>
<p>Everything here is measured in bytes, so we're looking at approximately <code>750 MB</code> of memory for the given configuration.
<code>total_requested_bytes</code> is a feature of Zig's <code>std.heap.DebugAllocator</code>. The exact number of bytes will be different
on each run, although it will hover around that value. I think the reason for this is how Zig requests <em>pages</em> of
memory from the OS. It won't always be the same and the OS is very likely doing some fancy book-keeping of its own.</p>
<p>If you play around with the configuration options and see how <code>total_requested_bytes</code> changes, it might be
surprising just how much memory is allocated up-front, before any of it is actually used! For example, if we
double <code>val_size_max</code> to <code>8192</code> and <code>list_length_max</code> to <code>100</code>, we're looking at about <code>2.8 GB</code> of allocated memory.</p>
<p>In the context of modern servers, this isn't a lot, but it can quickly grow as we adjust these parameters.
Should we be asking ourselves: Is this inefficient? What if we don't use all that memory?</p>
<p>Like all good engineering decisions, we have to consider them in the context of the problem we're trying to
solve, and the guarantees we expect from our systems. With this design, ensuring that each request and each
key/value pair <em>can</em> utilize the maximum configured space, seems like a worthy trade-off to make.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Like most projects, this one took a lot longer than I expected! Trying to incorporate both <code>io_uring</code> and
static allocation was something I had never done before, but I'm pretty happy with the result.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to improving the internal hash map to better fit a static context, consider alternative
allocator implementations to improve memory utilization, and incorporate fuzz testing to find the limits of the system.</p>
<p>Checkout the code on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nickmonad/kv">GitHub</a>!</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<section>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, these limits can (and likely should) be configured at runtime by the user.
These aren't values that have to be set at compile time and enforced upon all users in every context,
although some might be. Again, it depends on <em>which</em> part of the system is using the memory.
The point is that once the program starts it will allocate memory, but after that, it does not. <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>Going with a single-threaded design simplifies a lot! Even though processing in <code>kv</code> is single-threaded,
it still enjoys the benefits of I/O concurrency via <code>io_uring</code>. The kernel handles writing responses back out to
clients and waiting for that operation to complete, so we don't have to worry (as much) about slow clients. <a href="#fr-2-1">↩</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>Maybe this isn’t a good idea</h2>
<p>Many people have had the same phone number for years—even decades at this point. These numbers aren’t just a way for people to get in touch because, stupidly, we have also settled on phone numbers as a means of authentication. Banks, messaging apps, crypto exchanges, this very website’s publishing platform, and even the carriers managing your number rely on SMS multifactor codes. And those codes <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/google-plans-to-stop-using-insecure-sms-verification-in-gmail/">aren’t even very secure</a>.</p>
<p>So losing access to your phone number doesn’t just lock you out of your phone. Key parts of your digital life can also become inaccessible, and that could happen more often now due to the fungible nature of eSIMs.</p>
<p>Most people won’t need to move their phone number very often, but the risk that your eSIM goes up in smoke when you do is very real. Compare that to a physical SIM card, which will virtually never fail unless you damage the card. Swapping that tiny bit of plastic takes a few seconds, and it never requires you to sit on hold with your carrier’s support agents or drive to a store. In short, a physical SIM is essentially foolproof, and eSIM is not.</p>
<p>Obviously, the solution is not to remove multifactor authentication—your phone number is, unfortunately, too important to be unguarded. However, carriers’ use of SMS to control account access is self-defeating and virtually guarantees people are going to have bad experiences in the era of eSIM. Enshittification has truly come for SIM cards.</p>
<p>If this future is inevitable, there ought to be a better way to confirm account ownership when your eSIM glitches. It doesn’t matter what that is as long as SMS isn’t the default. Google actually gets this right with Fi. You can download an eSIM at any time via the Fi app, and it’s secured with the same settings as your Google account. That’s really as good as it gets for consumer security. Between Google Authenticator, passkeys, and push notifications, it’s pretty hard to get locked out of Google, even if you take advantage of advanced security features.</p>
<p>We gave up the headphone jack. We gave up the microSD card. Is all this worthwhile to boost battery capacity by 8 percent? That’s a tough sell.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/">https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46420453">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I own more books than I can read. Not in a charming, aspirational way, but in
the practical sense that at some point I stopped knowing what I owned.
Somewhere around 500 books, memory stopped being a reliable catalog.</p>
<p>For years, I told myself I would fix this. Nothing elaborate, nothing worthy
of a startup idea. A spreadsheet would have been enough. I never did it, not
because it was hard, but because it was tedious.</p>
<figure><img src="https://balajmarius.com/images/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/part-of-my-personal-library.jpg" alt="Part of my personal library"><figcaption>Part of my personal library</figcaption></figure>
<p>The gap between intention and execution was small, but it was enough to keep the
project permanently parked in the someday pile.</p>
<p>By the end of 2025, I had been working with AI agents long enough that this
kind of project finally felt possible. Not because they made things more
impressive, but because they removed the part I always stalled on. Execution.</p>
<p>The bookshelf project is where I clearly understood what my role becomes once
execution stops being the bottleneck.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>I tried the obvious tools first. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/isbn-scan-book-info-ratings/id6463488866">ISBN scanner apps</a> failed on Romanian
editions, and <a href="https://goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> could not identify obscure publishers or antiquarian
finds. Anything even slightly nonstandard came back incomplete or wrong.
Partial data felt worse than no data at all, so every attempt ended the same
way: a few entries filled in, followed by abandonment.</p>
<p>What I needed was not a better app, but a way to tolerate imperfection without
the whole system falling apart.</p>
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Every project starts with bad data, and this one started with worse data. One
afternoon, I photographed every book I own: spines, covers, duplicates, and
the occasional blurry thumb. <strong>Four hundred and seventy photos in total</strong>. Once
the images were on my laptop, I opened Claude.</p>
<figure><img src="https://balajmarius.com/images/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/470-shots-one-afternoon.jpg" alt="470 shots, one afternoon"><figcaption>470 shots, one afternoon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first steps were mechanical. Renaming files. Converting <code>HEIC</code> to <code>JPG</code>. Then
I asked for something real: a script that sends each image to OpenAI's vision
API, extracts author, title, and publisher, normalizes names, resizes images
to avoid wasting tokens, and writes everything to a <code>JSON</code> file.</p>
<p>Claude wrote the script and ran it. It worked. Not perfectly, but well enough
to matter.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "id": "ZfEPBCMZDaCKm6k0NVJ8F",
  "title": "Simulacre și simulare",
  "author": "Jean Baudrillard",
  "publisher": "Colectia Panopticon",
  "source": "dataset/83.jpg",
},
</code></pre>
<p>Roughly 90 percent of the books came back correct. The failures were
predictable: poor lighting, damaged covers, unreadable spines. One novel was
confidently identified as a 1987 Soviet agricultural manual.</p>
<p>I fixed the rest by hand. That decision was not technical, it was judgment.
Ninety percent accuracy was enough. Chasing the remaining ten percent would
have meant days of edge cases for very little additional value. That was the
first moment where my role became clear.</p>
<p>Later, when I received a few books for Christmas, we added a second script that
runs the same pipeline for new additions. <em>Photo in, metadata and images out</em>.</p>
<h2>The covers</h2>
<p>With metadata sorted, covers were still missing. My photos showed spines, not
artwork, and I wanted a clean visual representation. Claude suggested using
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a>'s API to fetch covers, which mostly worked. Half the covers were
low quality or incorrect, and Romanian editions barely existed in the
database.</p>
<p>We iterated. Claude wrote a second pass, another model call that scored cover
quality and flagged bad matches. For flagged books, it fell back to Google
Images via <a href="https://serpapi.com/">SerpAPI</a>. That handled most cases. A few remained: antiquarian finds
and obscure Soviet boxing manuals that no database was ever going to have
clean assets for.</p>
<p>I opened Photoshop and fixed ten covers by hand. For a collection of 460
books, ten manual edits felt like a win.</p>
<h2>The shelf</h2>
<p>Once the data and covers were in place, the UI came next. The obvious solution
was a grid of covers. It was correct, and it was lifeless. I kept looking at
my physical bookshelf instead. What makes it interesting is not the covers,
but the spines. Different widths, uneven pressure, colors blending into a
single texture.</p>
<figure><img src="https://balajmarius.com/images/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/the-shelf-version-zero.jpg" alt="The shelf, version zero"><figcaption>The shelf, version zero</figcaption></figure>
<p>That was the thing I wanted to recreate.</p>
<p>Claude did not invent that idea. It executed it. It wrote a script to extract
dominant colors from each cover using color quantization, then computed
contrasting text colors for readability. The result was better, but still
wrong. Every book had the same width, and real books are not like that.</p>
<p><a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> had page counts. We mapped page count to spine width and added
slight variation to break the uniformity. At that point, it finally looked
like a bookshelf.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "id": "ZfEPBCMZDaCKm6k0NVJ8F",
  "title": "Simulacre si simulare",
  "author": "Jean Baudrillard",
  "backgroundColor": "#f0f0ff",
  "color": "#1f1f2e",
  "paddingLeft": 13,
  "paddingRight": 13,
  "height": 384,
  "cover": "/images/bookshelf/simulacre-si-simulare@2x.webp",
  "source": "dataset/83.jpg"
},
</code></pre>
<h2>The animation</h2>
<p>Visually, the shelf worked, but it felt static. A real shelf responds to
touch. When you run your finger along the spines, they tilt slightly. I asked
Claude for an animation, and it came back with a scroll based tilt using
<a href="https://motion.dev/">Framer Motion</a>.</p>
<p>It was close, but wrong. The movement snapped instead of flowing. I did not
know why, I just knew it felt off. That was enough.</p>
<figure><video src="https://balajmarius.com/images/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/scroll-animation.webm" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Scroll-based tilt animation</figcaption></figure>
<p>Claude explained the issue immediately. We were updating React state on every
scroll event, causing unnecessary re renders. The fix was to use motion values
and springs that animate outside React's render cycle. Two minutes later, it
was fixed. I spent the next few minutes scrolling back and forth, just
watching it move. This was the moment my caution dropped, not because the tool
was always right, but because the cost of trying ideas had collapsed.</p>
<h2>Killing good code</h2>
<p>That confidence had a downside. I started asking for things I did not need.
Infinite scroll seemed sensible. Why render 460 books at once? Claude
implemented it, and technically it worked. Memory stayed flat, and the DOM
updated correctly.</p>
<p>But scrolling broke. The container height desynced, the last books were
unreachable, and every attempted fix introduced new jank. The feature worked,
but the experience did not. So we removed it. Not because it was broken, but
because it was unnecessary. Four hundred and sixty books is not a scale
problem. Knowing when to delete working code is not something an AI can decide
for you.</p>
<h2>The stack view</h2>
<p>The shelf looked great on desktop, but on mobile, horizontal scrolling felt
cramped. I wanted an alternative layout: books lying flat, stacked vertically,
readable without tilting your head. I pointed Claude at the shelf
implementation and asked for a stack view.</p>
<figure><img src="https://balajmarius.com/images/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/stack-ui-on-mobile.jpg" alt="Stack UI on mobile"><figcaption>Stack UI on mobile</figcaption></figure>
<p>It read the code, inferred the patterns, and reused them: animation timing,
color extraction, scroll based opacity, the same data shape. It built the new
component and wired up a toggle between layouts. It worked without
explanation. That surprised me more than anything else.</p>
<h2>What I actually did</h2>
<p>Claude wrote all the code. So what did I do?</p>
<ul>
<li>I decided that 90 percent accuracy was enough.</li>
<li>I fixed the ten covers no API could find.</li>
<li>I rejected a grid because I wanted spines.</li>
<li>I deleted infinite scroll because I did not need it.</li>
<li>I kept scrolling the animation until it felt right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Claude handled implementation. I handled taste.</p>
<p>After years of false starts, my bookshelf finally exists. Four hundred and
sixty books, cataloged and displayed at <a href="https://balajmarius.com/bookshelf">bookshelf</a>. I almost
dismissed Claude Code as hype. Now, the times when I wrote everything by hand
feel distant, almost strange.</p>
<p>Execution keeps getting cheaper. Taste still does not.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you live in Germany, you have been treated like livestock by Deutsche Bahn (DB). Almost all of my friends have a story: they traveled with DB, got thrown out in the middle of the night in some cow village, and had to wait hours for the next train.</p><p>I have something better. I was kidnapped.</p><hr><p>December 24th, 2024. 15:30. Cologne Main Station, Platform 9 D-G.</p><p>I am taking the RE5 (ID 28521) to my grandmother’s house in Meckenheim. Scheduled departure: 15:32. Scheduled arrival in Bonn: 15:54. From there, the S23 to Meckenheim. A journey of 35 kilometers, or, in DB units, somewhere between forty-five minutes and the heat death of the universe.</p><p>I wanted to arrive early to spend more time with her. My father, who lives near Troisdorf, was supposed to join us later.</p><p>I board the train. It is twenty minutes late. I consider this early. At least the train showed up. In DB’s official statistics, a train counts as “on time” if it’s less than six minutes late.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Cancelled trains are not counted at all.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If a train doesn’t exist, it cannot be late.</p><p>The train starts moving. The driver announces there are “issues around Bonn.” He does not specify what kind. No one asks. We have learned not to ask. He suggests we exit at Cologne South and take the subway, or continue to Troisdorf and catch a bus from there.</p><p>I decide to continue to Troisdorf. My father can just pick me up there and we drive together. The plan adapts.</p><p>The driver announces the full detour: from Cologne South to Troisdorf to Neuwied to Koblenz. The entire left bank of the Rhine is unavailable. Only then I notice: the driver has been speaking German only. If you were a tourist who got on in Cologne to visit Brühl, thirteen minutes away, you were about to have a very confusing Christmas in Troisdorf.</p><p>A woman near me is holding chocolates and flowers. She is on the phone with her mother. “Sorry Mama, I’ll be late.” Pause. “Deutsche Bahn.” Pause. Her mother understood.</p><p>Twenty minutes later. We are approaching Troisdorf. I stand up. I gather my things. My father texts me: he is at the station, waiting.</p><p>The driver comes back on: “Hello everyone. Apparently we were not registered at Troisdorf station, so we are on the wrong tracks. We cannot stop.”</p><p>He says this the way someone might say “the coffee machine is broken.”</p><p>Silence. Laughter. Silence.</p><p>I watch Troisdorf slide past the window. Somewhere in the parking lot outside the station, my father is sitting in his car, watching his son pass by as livestock.</p><p>My father calls.</p><p>“The train couldn’t stop.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Next stop is Neuwied.”</p><p>“Neuwied?” Pause. “That’s in Rheinland-Pfalz.” Pause. “That’s a different <em>federal state</em>.”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>I was trying to travel 35 kilometers. I was now 63 kilometers from my grandmother’s house. Further away than when I started.</p><p>There are fifteen stations between Troisdorf and Neuwied. We pass all of them.</p><p>At some point you stop being a passenger and start being cargo. A cow transporter. Mooohhhhh. A cow transporter going to a cow village. (Germany has a word for this: Kuhdorf. The cows are metaphorical. Usually.) I reached this point around Oberkassel.</p><p>DB once operated a bus to Llucalcari, a Mallorcan village of seventeen people.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I wanted to take it home.</p><p>An English speaker near the doors is getting agitated. “What is happening? Why didn’t we stop?”</p><p>“We are not registered for this track.”</p><p>“But where will we stop?”</p><p>“Neuwied. Fifty-five minutes.”</p><p>“Fifty-five minutes.” He said it again, quieter. “I am being kidnapped.”</p><p>My seatmate, who had not looked up from his book in forty minutes, turned a page. “Deutsche Bahn.”</p><hr><p>I looked up my compensation.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> 1.50 EUR.

<p><strong>Volume 1<br>
</strong><strong>Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Cosmology<br>
</strong><strong>(224 pages)</strong></p>
<p>Feynman solicited topic input from the scientists and engineers at the Labs for the coming year. New discoveries were being made in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology at the time. This 1966-1967 lecture series focused on these subjects. This volume is unique since, as far as I can tell, Feynman did not lecture on this subject matter at CalTech. While much of the material is now dated, what remains is a look into the mind of Feynman as he worked to explain such topics as stellar evolution, nuclear synthesis, cosmology, “black stars” (aka black holes), and general relativity.</p>
<p>I inserted more current content from the web which relates to the 1966-67 lectures with recent experimental observations and discoveries. While this lecture series has been “eclipsed” by the tremendous theoretical and experimental advancements over the past 45 years, I am sure the reader(s) will find in these lectures the power of Feynman’s insight and ability to have fun with a new subject not touched on by him at CalTech in his “normal” class and research work. I trust others, more specialized in the topics of volume 1, can and will contribute to the additional information to further enrich the notes in the future. This editing will best be done when the notes are moved and dropped in a dynamic and editable platform, yet to be identified.</p>
<p>The Volume I subject matter was not part of his prior lecture activity, Feynman would talk with some of his CalTech colleagues who worked in the field of astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology about their work and theories. He would then come to the lecture literally with a (maybe 2 or 3) 3×5 cards and proceed to pour out 2 hours of theory and complex mathematical representations of the topic of the day. This was his genius and almost mystical in his ability to focus his thinking and presentation ability on the most important aspects of a given topic.</p>

<p><b></b><strong>Volumes 2<br>
</strong><strong>Relativity, Electrostatics, Electrodynamics, Matter-Wave Interaction<br>
(209 pages)</strong></p>
<p>Feynman reflected on how he could teach his original FLP’s volume 2 &amp; 3 differently and better than in his first pass through the subjects five years earlier. The attendees wanted him to lecture a couple years on the subject matter in the original FLP and essentially let him give his revised, enhanced, and expanded lectures. This then led more naturally into QED with a good foundation layer established. Feynman also tailored his lectures more to the level of his audience understanding they were not freshman and sophomore undergraduates but post graduate, doctorate level scientists, employed doing advanced research.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b></b><strong>Volume 3<br>
</strong><strong>More on Matter-Wave Interaction, Intro to Quantum Mechanics, Scattering Theory, Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum, Intro to Lie Group, SU 2 &amp; 3 “stuff”, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Pair Production<br>
(314 pages)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Feynman went on in greater detail to complete his lectures on wave-matter interaction. From there he started into quantum mechanics and his path history formulation. He extended his lectures to include Lie Group theory and the SU 2&amp;3 “Stuff”.</p>
<p>Feynman diagrams are discussed in Volume 3 at some length as he went deep into QED theory including such topics as quantum scattering. As better understood today, his diagrams represent a visual language of the complex physical processes at the particle interaction level. I have noted recently that with the power of new computers and new concepts the Feynman diagrams have, arguably, run their course. While this is possibly the case, I would assert that bypassing a fundamental understanding of the Feynman diagram concept makes it hard to understand what replaces them. This is like hand held calculators replacing the need to know the fundamental multiplication tables and being able to check what the calculator is telling you. I personally observed in a number of lectures where Feynman would self-check himself as he was working out the math because he could sense that if he kept going he would not get the right physics. This was his true genius at work. That was truly amazing to both watch and try to absorb in real time<b>. &nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b></b><strong>Volume 4<br>
</strong><strong>Molecular Biology<br>
(65 pages)</strong></p>
<p>The Molecular Biology lectures started out and then eventually died out as the year progressed. Feynman found the material challenging to get his head around before the lecture and, therefore, very time consuming. He apparently found a CalTech colleague, Seymour Benzer, who changed from physics to biophysics as a person who stimulated Feynman’s interest in this topic.</p>
<p>By consensus the lecture series ended early. Feynman was deep into his own parton theory which was his version of quark theory. He and Gell-Mann were collegial competitors in those days.</p>
<p>In preparing these notes for release I decided to include what notes I had of those lectures only to give evidence of Feynman’s interest to explore all the dimensions of science and nature. For those involved in the field these notes will not provide much informational value particularly with all the advancements on research and understanding of molecular biology. The value, I believe, for the reader is how Feynman thought through the subject matter and mentally organized it so he could lecture on it. That might aid teachers in this field to sharpen up their own presentation material. At the end of the volume are my un-transcribed real-time notes that I never got to but I decided to include for those who are into this field.</p>

<p><b></b><strong>Volume 5<br>
</strong><strong>Mathematical Methods/Techniques in Physics and Engineering<br>
(163&nbsp;pages)</strong></p>
<p>By some who have seen samples of my notes Volume 5 has been referred to as the “missing lectures” to the FLP “Red Books”. Feynman himself felt that he should have taught the mathematical methods first and then the physics since math <b>is&nbsp;</b><b>the</b> “language” of physics. Feynman was apparently talked out of starting with a course in math-physics. The attendees at the lab talked him into a year-long lecture on his approach to mathematics as the language of physics.</p>
<p>I note here also that the math lectures have been referred on the Reddit by someone as “sophomoric” since all physic students must take similar course work and presumably “master” math while learning the physics. In my own case I wanted to learn the physics and minimize the math, or better said, not confused by the physics because the math was too difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>This is how Feynman approached physics and how he taught himself, at an early age, by developing many shortcuts through the math; “Feynman diagrams” were one clear by product of his self learning process. He did not want to get bogged down and distracted from understanding the physics. This is why and how he got involved in the Manhattan Project; he was their math wizard.</p>
<p>One story he told of those days: Someone came running into him needing a quick answer to a nuclear decay process that was described by some expansion series like the Sum from 1 to infinity of 1/(1+n^2)[probably not the real one]. Feynman asked how accurately he wanted the answer and the person said 10% would do for now. Feynman said he took a few seconds and said the answer was 1.3 (or something like that); the person was amazed how fast he could give him that and asked how he did it. He said since you told me you only wanted the answer to 10%, it was only necessary to go to the second term in the series expansion and that was good enough for better than 10% accuracy. This story is emblematic of Feynman’s mathematical thinking which is not sophomoric. This is why he made such a contribution to the Manhattan project and ultimately QED. He did indeed “think different”.</p>
<p>In my own experience I found in my graduate studies that the some of the professors tended to focus more on the math rigor than in teaching the real physics. In Feynman’s world he “felt” the physics and used the math to express that “feeling” and understanding. Language does not necessarily express the essence of the content contained in the idea being described. One must understand both the power and limitations of the language used when discussing a subject. Words don’t always express what one wants to say; so it is for math and physics.</p>
<p><strong>Lecture Sidebars</strong><strong>:</strong> Another “feature”, or aspect, of the notes is my attempt to capture “side bar” topics. These special topics or thoughts (including some philosophical ones) added color and currency to the lectures as only Feynman could deliver. He was unconstrained in the lecture environment to take off on a sidebar and the attendees both enjoyed and encouraged him to do so.</p>

        <section>
            <p>Asking Gemini 3 to generate Brainf*ck code results in an infinite loop, akin amost to a DDoS attack:</p>
            <img src="https://teodordyakov.github.io/brainfuck-agi/bf.gif">
            <p>That is fascinating. So it made me wonder.
            Is Brainf*ck the ultimate test for AGI?
            I think so, and for 3 good reasons.
            </p>
            <h2>1. The Data Scarcity Problem</h2>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) thrive on sheer volume. To master JavaScript, an LLM has been trained on
                virtually every available line of open-source code—hundreds of millions of lines of code (LOC). By
                comparison, the amount of functional <strong>Brainf*ck</strong> code on the web is a statistical
                rounding error.</p>
            <p>We are talking about a <span>million times less training data</span>. Without the
                luxury of infinite patterns to copy, the model can't rely on mimicry; it has to understand the
                underlying logic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Anti-Literate Programming</h2>
            <p>Brainf*ck is the antithesis of modern software engineering. There are no comments, no meaningful variable
                names, and no structure. In many ways, looking at existing Brainf*ck code is actually
                <em>detrimental</em> to a novice. Consider this typical snippet:</p>

            <code>&gt;++++++++[&lt;+++++++++&gt;-]&lt;.&gt;++++[&lt;+++++++&gt;-]&lt;+.+++++++..+++.&gt;&gt;++++++[&lt;+++++++&gt;-]&lt;+
+.------------.&gt;++++++[&lt;+++++++++&gt;-]&lt;+.&lt;.+++.------.--------.&gt;&gt;&gt;++++[&lt;++++++++&gt;-
]&lt;+.</code>

            <p>Writing in this environment is akin to <span>zero-shot learning</span>. Success
                requires reasoning at a high level of abstraction based on the fundamental rules of the language and a
                precise mental model of semantics, rather than memorized syntax.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. The Repetition Problem</h2>
              <div>
            <p>As we saw earlier, asking a modern model for complex Brainf*ck code often results in the model falling into an infinite loop—spewing the same characters over and over. The minimalistic nature of the language results in highly repetitive structures in the code. This poses a unique challenge to the way LLMs work.</p>
            <p>An LLM is more likely to output what it has already seen based on previous tokens, and that pertains to its own output too. When some structure is repeated more than a couple of times, there is a likelihood that the model may learn that token <strong>X</strong> is the most likely output following <strong>itself</strong>. With every subsequent iteration, this increases the likelihood of outputting <strong>X</strong> in a self-fulfilling prophecy, resulting in the infinite loop.</p>
        </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p> <strong>So, is Brainf*ck the ultimate test for LLMs? You be the judge.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p>Only the engineers who work on a large software system can meaningfully participate in the design process. That’s because you cannot do good software design without an intimate understanding of the concrete details of the system. In other words, <strong>generic software design advice is typically useless</strong> for most practical software design problems.</p>
<h3>Generic software design</h3>
<p>What is generic software design? It’s “designing to the problem”: the kind of advice you give when you have a reasonable understanding of the <em>domain</em>, but very little knowledge of the existing <em>codebase</em>. Unfortunately, this is the only kind of advice you’ll read in software books and blog posts<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Engineers love giving generic software design advice for the same reason that all technical professionals love “talking shop”. However, you should be very careful about applying generic advice to your concrete day-to-day work problems<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re doing real work, concrete factors dominate generic factors</strong>. Having a clear understanding of what the code looks like right now is far, far more important than having a good grasp on general design patterns or principles. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>In large codebases, consistency is more important than “good design”. I won’t argue that point here, but I wrote about it at length in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases"><em>Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases</em></a>.</li>
<li>Real codebases are typically full of complex, hard-to-predict consequences. If you want to make your change safely, that typically constrains your implementation choices down to a bare handful of possibilities.</li>
<li>Large shared codebases never reflect a single design, but are always in some intermediate state between different software designs. How the codebase will hang together after an individual change is thus way more important than what ideal “north star” you’re driving towards.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world where you could rewrite the entire system at will, generic software design advice would be much more practical. Some projects are like this! But <strong>the majority of software engineering work is done on systems that cannot be safely rewritten</strong>. These systems cannot rely on “software design”, but must instead rely on internal consistency and the carefulness of their engineers.</p>
<h3>Concrete software design</h3>
<p>What does good software design look like, then?</p>
<p>In my experience, the most useful software design happens in conversations between a small group of engineers who all have deep understanding of the system, because they’re the ones working on it every day. These design discussions are often <strong>really boring</strong> to outsiders, because they revolve around arcane concrete details of the system, not around general principles that any technical person can understand and have an opinion on.</p>
<p>The kinds of topic being discussed are not “is DRY better than WET”, but instead “could we put this new behavior in subsystem A? No, because it needs information B, which isn’t available to that subsystem in context C, and we can’t expose that without rewriting subsystem D, but if we split up subsystem E here and here…“.</p>
<p>Deep philosophical points about design are rarely important to the discussion. Instead, the most critical contributions point out small misunderstandings of concrete points, like: “oh, you thought B wasn’t available in context C, but we recently refactored C so now we could thread in B if we needed to”.</p>
<h3>When generic software design is useful</h3>
<p>Generic software design advice is not useful for practical software design problems, but that doesn’t mean it’s totally useless.</p>
<p><strong>Generic software design advice is useful for building brand-new projects.</strong> As I argued above, when you’re designing a new feature in an existing system, concrete factors of the system dominate. But when you’re designing a <em>new system</em>, there are no concrete factors, so you can be entirely guided by generic advice.</p>
<p><strong>Generic software design advice is useful for tie-breaking concrete design decisions.</strong> I don’t think you should start with a generic design, but if you have a few candidate concrete pathways that all seem acceptable, generic principles can help you decide between them.</p>
<p>This is particularly true at the level of the entire company. In other words, <strong>generic software design advice can help ensure consistency across different codebases</strong>. This is one of the most useful functions of an official “software architect” role: to provide a set of general principles so that individual engineers can all tie-break their concrete decisions in the same direction<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Generic software design principles can also guide company-wide architectural decisions.</strong> Should we run our services in our own datacenter, or in the cloud? Should we use k8s? AWS or Azure? Once you get broad enough, the concrete details of individual services almost don’t matter, because it’s going to be a huge amount of work either way. Still, even for these decisions, concrete details matter a lot. There are certain things you just can’t do in the cloud (like rely on bespoke hardware setups), or that you can’t do in your own datacenter (like deploy your service to the edge in twelve different regions). If the concrete details of your codebase rely on one of those things, you’ll be in for a bad time if you ignore them when making company-wide architectural decisions.</p>
<h3>Architects and local minima</h3>
<p>Those are all good reasons to do generic software design. One bad reason companies do generic software design is that it just sounds like a really good idea to people who aren’t working software engineers. Once you’re doing it, the incentives make it hard to stop. Many tech companies fall into this local minimum.</p>
<p>Why not have your highest-paid software engineers spend their time exclusively making the most abstract, highest-impact decisions? You want your structural engineers to be drawing, not laying bricks, after all. I don’t know if structural engineering works like this, but I do know that software engineering doesn’t. In practice, <strong>software architecture advice often has to be ignored by the people on the ground</strong>. There’s simply no way to actually translate it into something they can implement, in the context of the current system as it exists.</p>
<p>However, for a practice that doesn’t work, “have your top engineers just do generic design” is surprisingly robust. <strong>Architects don’t have any skin in the game</strong><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, because their designs are handed off to actual engineering teams to implement. Because those designs can never be implemented perfectly, architects can both claim credit for successes (after all, it was their design) and disclaim failures (if only those fools had followed my design!)</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When working on large existing codebases, useful software design discussions are way, way more concrete than many people believe. They typically involve talking about individual files or even lines of code. You thus can’t do useful software design without being intimately familiar with the codebase (in practice, that almost always means being an active contributor).</p>
<p>Purely generic architecture is not <em>useless</em>, but its role should be restricted to (a) setting out paved paths for brand new systems, (b) tie-breaking decisions on existing systems, and (c) helping companies make broad technology choices.</p>
<p>In my opinion, formal “big-picture software architect” roles that spend all their time laying out the initial designs for projects are doomed to failure. They sound like a good idea (and they’re a good deal for the architect, who can claim credit without risking blame), but they provide very little value to the engineering teams that are tasked with actually writing the code.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that <strong>if you come up with the design for a software project, you ought to be responsible for the project’s success or failure</strong>. That would rapidly ensure that the people designing software systems are the people who know how to ship software systems. It would also ensure that the <em>real</em> software designers - the ones that have to take into account all the rough edges and warts of the codebase - get credit for the difficult design work they do.</p>

These are the moments where the work of Tor's anti-censorship team is more important than ever, to fulfill our mission of preserving connectivity between users in affected regions and the rest of the world.</p><p>In this blog post, we want to talk about what we've learned, how we've adapted, and what other internet users can do to keep Tor users connected.</p><h2>Iran</h2><p>In June, during the war between Iran and Israel, the censorship in <a href="https://filter.watch/english/2025/10/02/irans-stealth-blackout-a-multi-stakeholder-analysis-of-the-june-2025-internet-shutdown/">Iran intensified up to a point where internet was disconnected for few days</a>. Presumably to impede espionage-related communication while simultaneously consolidating political power.</p><h3>Monitoring the censorship landscape</h3><p>During this period, we were constantly monitoring the situation using our in-region vantage-point system. This vantage-point system is a network of monitoring locations inside Iran that provides more recent and accurate information about censorship than is available from public data.</p><p>One clear example is domain-fronting data. Domain-fronting is a technique that makes Tor traffic look like other popular, harder-to-block websites (like major cloud services). To determine which domain-fronting configurations perform best across the most locations, we deployed an automated testing tool that detects and reports the accessibility of the Snowflake broker and the Moat service for each domain-fronting configuration at each of our vantage points. This information is then aggregated by the log collector and subsequently used to monitor the domain-fronting configurations currently in use and to select the configurations to use in the future.</p><h3>Strengthening Snowflake</h3><p><a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">Snowflake</a> is the most used network traffic obfuscation tool in Iran. Over the past year we have been working on improving it to ensure that it remains strong and accessible to users.</p><p>We have upgraded the web extension to Manifest Version 3 (the latest browser extension standard), to be compatible with modern browsers. We improved the NAT checking logic which helps us figure out what kind of network setup each user has. This way, the proxies are more accurately assigned to the clients depending on their network capabilities. And  we enhanced the metrics reported by the standalone proxy, providing better tooling for proxy operators to assist what is happening with their proxies.</p><p>Under the hood we have created a staging server for Snowflake, so we have a robust infrastructure to stress test new features making sure they're fit for real deployment. This will help us bring big changes in the coming year to improve the efficiency of the protocol where networks are severely disrupted and to create better mechanisms to prevent censors from blocking Snowflake.</p><h3>Deploying Conjure</h3><p>Censorship agencies like those in Iran often attempt to block bridges by obtaining bridge information in bulk and then inputing the network address of these bridges to their censorship gateways to block them. That's why we developed Conjure.</p><p>Conjure is a pluggable transport designed to stay ahead of proxy-listing-based blocking by leveraging unused address space within cooperating ISP networks, thereby limiting the damage caused by blocking individual network addresses. Think of it like the act of generating temporary email addresses to avoid spam emails, by making sure the address is temporary and easy to regenerate, anything blocked at that address won't affect your ability to get new ones.</p><p>We are working on distributing Conjure in places with strong censorship. To make it hard for censors, we have improved Tor's implementation of Conjure by extending the protocols used both for bootstrapping the connection and transport the data. We added multiple registration methods (DNS and AMP-cache), making the bootstrap of the conjure connection more censorship-resistant and the connection will look as if the user is connecting to widely used service. We also integrated additional transports from upstream (DTLS and prefix) that makes the Tor traffic look like common protocols–meaning regular internet traffic.</p><h2>Russia</h2><p>Another region that has experienced many changes this year is Russia. With continued conflict and attrition, internet censorship has intensified, including increased allowlist-based censorship and address-block-based censorship.</p><p>Last year, we introduced WebTunnel as a new pluggable transport. We have seen this year how WebTunnel has become a key tool for users in Russia, thanks to its ability to blend into regular web traffic. As the severity of censorship in Russia has increased, WebTunnel has also received several fixes, such as SNI imitation and safe non-WebPKI certificate support with certificate-chain pinning to ensure it can withstand more kinds of censorship, including SNI allowlisting and the rapid blocking of distributed bridges.</p><p>Many of these improvements come from volunteers or are shaped by user feedback. Our community of users and supporters makes all this work possible and helps us stay ahead at Tor. Thanks to our Tor community team, we have first-hand insights into what works and what doesn't. This gives us access to the best information in the region. Additionally, through the community team's work with people on the ground, we receive support in testing and identifying the best technology for each censorship scenario.</p><h3>Experimenting with bridge distribution</h3><p>When we started distributing WebTunnel bridges in December they were a very useful tool to connect to Tor. They worked well for months, and Tor Browser users got them configured automatically over Connect Assist if they were located in Russia. However, in June, the Russian censors began listing most of our WebTunnel bridges, prompting us to shift strategies.</p><p>In recent history, our Telegram distributor has proven to be a useful tool in Russia, as the censor has a harder time extracting all the bridges from it. This is why we have now added support for WebTunnel in our Telegram distributor. We are always trying to meet our users where they are, and while Telegram might not be the safest place for your online communications, many users in Russia already uses it. And is not only useful for Russian users, but also for Iranian ones that are currently using webtunnel bridges distributed over Telegram.</p><p>All these fast changes of bridges distribution are possible thanks to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/making-connections-from-bridgedb-to-rdsys/">rdsys</a>, Tor's new bridge distribution system that we introduced last year. This year we kept improving rdsys adding a staging server, so we can stress-test it in a similar environments to the ones used in production. For our censored users that means that by the time new and updated anticensorship features arrive, we have already been able to fix many stability issues.</p><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><p>Supporting our users to continue fighting censorship is what our work is all about. Making it possible to connect to the Tor network on censored networks–whatever they are. Whether it is your university, your internet service provider, or your government trying to keep you from getting the information you are entitled to. Next year we'll start rolling out Conjure, keep improving WebTunnel,and prepare Snowflake for the next big censorship events.</p><p>You too can help us fight censorship today, by sharing your bandwidth and <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">running your own Snowflake</a>. The easiest way is to install a snowflake plugin in your browser to help others access the Tor network. And if you have a website <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/webtunnel/">consider running a webtunnel bridge</a>.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Z80-μLM: A Retrocomputing Micro Language Model</h2><a id="user-content-z80-μlm-a-retrocomputing-micro-language-model" aria-label="Permalink: Z80-μLM: A Retrocomputing Micro Language Model" href="#z80-μlm-a-retrocomputing-micro-language-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Z80-μLM is a 'conversational AI' that generates short character-by-character sequences, with quantization-aware training (QAT) to run on a Z80 processor with 64kb of ram.</p>
<p dir="auto">The root behind this project was the question: how small can we go while still having personality, and can it be trained or fine-tuned easily? With easy self-hosted distribution?</p>
<p dir="auto">The answer is Yes! And a 40kb .com binary (including inference, weights &amp; a chat-style UI) running on a 4MHz processor from 1976.</p>
<p dir="auto">It won't pass the Turing test, but it might make you smile at the green screen.</p>

<p dir="auto">Includes tools for generating training data with LLMs (Ollama or Claude API) and balancing class distributions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Trigram hash encoding</strong>: Input text is hashed into 128 buckets - typo-tolerant, word-order invariant</li>
<li><strong>2-bit weight quantization</strong>: Each weight is {-2, -1, 0, +1}, packed 4 per byte</li>
<li><strong>16-bit integer inference</strong>: All math uses Z80-native 16-bit signed arithmetic</li>
<li><strong>~40KB .COM file</strong>: Fits in CP/M's Transient Program Area (TPA)</li>
<li><strong>Autoregressive generation</strong>: Outputs text character-by-character</li>
<li><strong>No floating point</strong>: Everything is integer math with fixed-point scaling</li>
<li><strong>Interactive chat mode</strong>: Just run <code>CHAT</code> with no arguments</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Interaction Style</h2><a id="user-content-interaction-style" aria-label="Permalink: Interaction Style" href="#interaction-style"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The model doesn't understand you. But somehow, it <em>gets</em> you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your input is hashed into 128 buckets via trigram encoding - an abstract "tag cloud" representation. The model responds to the <em>shape</em> of your input, not the exact words:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="&quot;hello there&quot;  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]
&quot;there hello&quot;  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (same!)
&quot;helo ther&quot;    →  [bucket 23: 32, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (similar - typo tolerant)"><pre><code>"hello there"  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]
"there hello"  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (same!)
"helo ther"    →  [bucket 23: 32, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (similar - typo tolerant)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is semantically powerful for short inputs, but there's a limit: longer or order-dependent sentences blur together as concepts compete for the same buckets. "Open the door and turn on the lights" will likely be too close to distringuish from "turn on the door and open the lights."</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Small Responses, Big Meaning</h3><a id="user-content-small-responses-big-meaning" aria-label="Permalink: Small Responses, Big Meaning" href="#small-responses-big-meaning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A 1-2 word response can convey surprising nuance:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>OK</code> - acknowledged, neutral</li>
<li><code>WHY?</code> - questioning your premise</li>
<li><code>R U?</code> - casting existential doubt</li>
<li><code>MAYBE</code> - genuine uncertainty</li>
<li><code>AM I?</code> - reflecting the question back</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This isn't necessarily a limitation - it's a different mode of interaction. The terse responses force you to infer meaning from context or ask probing direct yes/no questions to see if it understands or not (e.g. 'are you a bot', 'are you human', 'am i human' displays logically consistent memorized answers)</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Input</strong>: 128 query trigram buckets + 128 context buckets</li>

<p dir="auto">The Z80 is an 8-bit CPU, but we use its 16-bit register pairs (HL, DE, BC) for activations and accumulators. Weights are packed 4-per-byte (2-bit each) and unpacked into 8-bit signed values for the multiply-accumulate.</p>
<p dir="auto">The 16-bit accumulator gives us numerical stability (summing 256 inputs without overflow), but the model's expressiveness is still bottlenecked by the 2-bit weights, and naive training may overflow or act 'weirdly' without QAT.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A problem I experienced when pursuing my PhD and submitting academic articles was that I had built solutions to problems that required dramatic scale to be effective and worthwhile. Responses to my publication submissions often claimed such problems did not exist; however, I had observed them during my time within industry, such as at Google, but I couldn’t cite it!</p>

<p>One problem that is only present at these mega-codebases is <em>massive binaries</em>. What’s the largest binary (ELF file) you’ve ever seen? I had observed binaries beyond 25GiB, including debug symbols. How is this possible? These companies prefer to statically build their services to speed up startup and simplify deployment. Statically including all code in some of the world’s largest codebases is a recipe for massive binaries.</p>

<p>Similar to the sound barrier, there is a point at which code size becomes problematic and we must re-think how we link and build code. For x86_64, that is the 2GiB “Relocation Barrier.”</p>

<p>Why 2GiB? 🤔</p>

<p>Well let’s take a look at how position independent code is put-together.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a simple example.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>far_function</span><span>();</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>far_function</span><span>();</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we compile this <code>gcc -c simple-relocation.c -o simple-relocation.o</code> we can inspect it with <code>objdump</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> objdump <span>-dr</span> simple-relocation.o

0000000000000000 &lt;main&gt;:
   0:	55                   	push   %rbp
   1:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   4:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    <span>$0x0</span>,%eax
   9:	e8 00 00 00 00       	call   e &lt;main+0xe&gt;
			a: R_X86_64_PLT32	far_function-0x4
   e:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    <span>$0x0</span>,%eax
  13:	5d                   	pop    %rbp
  14:	c3                   	ret
</code></pre></div>

<p>There’s a lot going on here, but one important part is <code>e8 00 00 00 00</code>. <code>e8</code> is the <code>CALL</code> opcode [<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_26.html">ref</a>] and it takes a <strong>32bit signed relative offset</strong>, which happens to be 0 (four bytes of 0) right now. <code>objdump</code> also lets us know there is a “relocation” necessary to fixup this code when we finalize it. We can view this relocation with <code>readelf</code> as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>
If you are wondering why we need <code>-0x4</code>, it’s because the offset is relative to the instruction-pointer which has already moved to the next instruction. The 4 bytes is the operand it has skipped over.</p>
</blockquote>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> readelf <span>-r</span> simple-relocation.o <span>-d</span>

Relocation section <span>'.rela.text'</span> at offset 0x170 contains 1 entry:
  Offset          Info           Type           Sym. Value    Sym. Name + Addend
00000000000a  000400000004 R_X86_64_PLT32    0000000000000000 far_function - 4
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is additional information embedded in the binary which tells the linker in susbsequent stages that it has code that needs to be fixed. Here we see the address <code>00000000000a</code>, and <code>a</code> is 9 + 1, which is the offset of the start of the operand for our <code>CALL</code> instruction.</p>

<p>Let’s now create the C file for our missing function.</p>



<p>We will now compile it and link the two object files together using our linker.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> gcc simple-relocation.o far-function.o <span>-o</span> simple-relocation
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s now inspect that same callsite and see what it has.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> objdump <span>-dr</span> simple-relocation

0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:
  401106:	55                   	push   %rbp
  401107:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
  40110a:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    <span>$0x0</span>,%eax
  40110f:	e8 07 00 00 00       	call   40111b &lt;far_function&gt;
  401114:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    <span>$0x0</span>,%eax
  401119:	5d                   	pop    %rbp
  40111a:	c3                   	ret

000000000040111b &lt;far_function&gt;:
  40111b:	55                   	push   %rbp
  40111c:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
  40111f:	90                   	nop
  401120:	5d                   	pop    %rbp
  401121:	c3                   	ret
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can see that the linker did the right thing with the relocation and calculated the relative offset of our symbol <code>far_function</code> and fixed the <code>CALL</code> instruction.</p>

<p>Okay cool…🤷 What does this have to do with huge binaries?</p>

<p>Notice that this call instruction, <code>e8</code>, only takes 32bits <strong>signed</strong> which means it’s limited to 2^31 bits. This means a callsite can only jump roughly 2GiB forward or 2GiB backward. The “2GiB Barrier” represents the total reach of a single relative jump.</p>

<p>What happens if our callsite is over 2GiB away?</p>

<p>Let’s build a synthetic example by asking our linker to place <code>far_function</code> <em>really really far away</em>. We can do this using a “linker script”, which is a mechanism we can instruct the linker how we would like our code sections laid out when the program starts.</p>

<div><pre><code>SECTIONS
{
    /* 1. Start with standard low-address sections */
    . = 0x400000;
    
    /* Catch everything except our specific 'far' object */
    .text : { 
        simple-relocation.o(.text.*) 
    }
    .rodata : { *(.rodata .rodata.*) }
    .data   : { *(.data .data.*) }
    .bss    : { *(.bss .bss.*) }

    /* 2. Move the cursor for the 'far' island */
    . = 0x120000000; 
    
    .text.far : { 
        far-function.o(.text*) 
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we now try to link our code we will see a “relocation overflow”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TIP</strong>
I used <code>lld</code> from <a href="https://lld.llvm.org/">LLVM</a> because the error messages are a bit prettier.</p>
</blockquote>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> gcc simple-relocation.o far-function.o <span>-T</span> overflow.lds <span>-o</span> simple-relocation-overflow <span>-fuse-ld</span><span>=</span>lld

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> referenced by simple-relocation.c
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> defined <span>in </span>far-function.o
</code></pre></div>

<p>When we hit this problem what solutions do we have?
Well this is a complete other subject on “code models”, and it’s a little more nuanced depending on whether we are accessing data (i.e. static variables) or code that is far away. A great blog post that goes into this is <a href="https://maskray.me/blog/2023-05-14-relocation-overflow-and-code-models">the following</a> by <a href="https://github.com/maskray">@maskray</a> who wrote <code>lld</code>.</p>

<p>The simplest solution however is to use <code>-mcmodel=large</code> which changes all the relative <code>CALL</code> instructions to absolute 64bit ones; kind of like a <code>JMP</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> gcc simple-relocation.o far-function.o <span>-T</span> overflow.lds <span>-o</span> simple-relocation-overflow

<p>There is no longer a sole <code>CALL</code> instruction, it has become <code>MOVABS</code> &amp; <code>CALL</code> 😲. This changed the instructions from 5 (opcode + 4 bytes for 32bit relative offset) to a whopping 12 bytes (2 bytes for <code>ABS</code> opcode + 8 bytes for absolute 64 bit address + 2 bytes for <code>CALL</code>).</p>

<p>This has notable downsides among others:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Instruction Bloat</em>: We’ve gone from 5 bytes per call to 12. In a binary with millions of callsites, this can add up.</li>
  <li><em>Register Pressure</em>: We’ve burned a general-purpose register, <code>%rdx</code>, to perform the jump.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Caution</strong>
I had a lot of trouble building a benchmark that demonstrated a worse lower IPC (instructions per-cycle) for the large <code>mcmodel</code>, so let’s just take my word for it. 🤷</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changing to a larger code-model is possible but it comes with these downsides. Ideally, we would like to keep our small code-model when we need it. What other strategies can we pursue?</p>

<p>More to come in subsequent writings.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/electronics/my-first-meshtastic-network.html">https://rickcarlino.com/notes/electronics/my-first-meshtastic-network.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46417676">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          
          <div><p>I first heard about <a href="https://meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meshtastic</a> from <a href="https://blog.noforeignland.com/off-grid-boat-communications-with-meshtastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a> that made the rounds on Hacker News.</p><p>
The author lived on a boat and used Meshtastic radios to stay in touch without cellular networks. Meshtastic allows you to send short text messages (around 200 characters) over long ranges without cell towers or satellites. It works by creating a mesh network of low-power LoRa devices that relay messages on behalf of peers. Because it uses license-free radio frequencies (in the ~915 MHz ISM band), no ham license is required.</p></div>

<h2>My First Radio</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224634.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224634.png"><br>
I ordered a pair of Heltec V3 LoRa radios (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG6XXSTW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ones I bought</a>), which are small devices based on the ESP32 microcontroller with a LoRa modem. These radios didn't come with GPS, which in hindsight I regret because Meshtastic can share your location if a GPS is present. I also picked up a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1CXG94J" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party antenna upgrade</a>, since the community warned that the cheap antennas bundled with these devices are nearly useless (yet another thing I learned in hindsight)</p>

<p>Out of the box, the devices had outdated firmware and wouldn't communicate with current Meshtastic apps. Fortunately, flashing the latest firmware was straightforward using the official <strong>Meshtastic Web Flasher</strong> (a browser-based tool at <a href="https://flasher.meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flasher.meshtastic.org</a>). By connecting the device via USB and using Chrome (which supports the WebSerial API), I flashed the newest Meshtastic firmware without installing any software.</p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224604.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224604.png"><br>
With fresh firmware, I could configure and manage the radios using the Meshtastic mobile app (available for Android/iOS) over Bluetooth. There's also a web client (<a href="https://client.meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client.meshtastic.org</a>) that works over USB or Wi-Fi. One quirk I learned: many Meshtastic devices can work over both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but you typically use one interface at a time for management. On my device, it was not possible to use both at the same time, which led to some confusion.</p>

<p>After setup, I had my two devices chatting with each other. Sending a message from one device would pop up on the other in a few seconds. Meshtastic uses a mesh protocol where every node repeats messages, so two devices in direct range will communicate one-to-one, and if more nodes are around they can hop messages further. I noticed that if I tried sending when only one device was on, the app would show <q>Waiting to be acknowledged...</q> and eventually <q>Maximum retransmission reached.</q> In other words, my message went nowhere because no other node heard it.</p>

<h2>First Contact</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224128.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224128.png"></p>

<p>Up to this point, I hadn't heard any traffic besides my own test messages. I suspected I was the only Meshtastic user in my immediate area (the far west suburbs of Chicago). I left one radio powered on and placed it by a second-story window facing toward the city. The next morning, I was surprised to see that it had logged messages from a handful of unknown nodes overnight.</p>

<p>Looking up the node identifiers online, I discovered a website called <a href="https://meshmap.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MeshMap</a> that shows public Meshtastic nodes on a map. Sure enough, some of the node names I saw appeared on a community mesh map of the Chicagoland area. A few even had labels referencing <q>ChiMesh</q>. There's an active group of Meshtastic enthusiasts in Chicago, <a href="https://chicagolandmesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicagoland Mesh</a>, and somehow my little device had picked up their transmissions from roughly 40-50 miles away. This was an early sign that mesh networking can extend beyond line-of-sight with the help of intermediate nodes.</p>

<h2>Joining a Local Community</h2>

<p>Excited by this discovery, I joined the Chicagoland Mesh (ChiMesh) Discord server and introduced myself. To my surprise, there was another member only a mile or two from my house. We coordinated a simple experiment: he sent a test message from his device at home, and I was able to receive it on mine. However, when I tried to reply, he never saw my message. It became clear that while I could <q>hear</q> the network, my transmission range was too short for others to hear me.</p>

<p>Community members quickly pointed to the antenna as the culprit. The stock rubber-duck antenna that came with my Heltec radio was likely low-quality. I switched to the high-gain antenna I bought and tried again. This time my messages started getting through. Antenna quality (and placement) makes a huge difference in radio range.</p>

<h2>Expanding the Network</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224246.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224246.png"><br>
My success rekindled interest among a couple of local makers. Some fellow members of my local makerspace had dabbled with Meshtastic earlier but stopped due to the lack of active users. With my second device to spare, we set it up as a relay node at the makerspace, which is a few miles from my house. Positioned near a roofline, this node acted like a little tower, rebroadcasting messages between my home and the other member's location.<br>
<img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224518.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224518.png"><br>
It took a bit of fiddling with placement and settings, but eventually we managed to pass messages between our homes via the makerspace node. It wasn't instantaneous or foolproof, but messages eventually hopped from my device to the relay and then to my friend's device, reaching farther than any single link could.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224347.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224347.png"><br>
To better understand and improve our coverage, we started playing with the <a href="https://site.meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meshtastic Site Planner</a>. This is a web tool that lets you simulate radio coverage on a map given a node's location, antenna, and power. Being in a river valley, our area has some challenging terrain that limits range. The planner helped confirm that putting a node on higher ground (a tall building) could dramatically extend reach.</p>

<p>In the coming months, we plan to upgrade to better antennas (perhaps an outdoor mounted one on a mast) and add more nodes at strategic spots. I'm also interested in experimenting with Meshtastic's other capabilities. For example, it can interface with sensors and send telemetry. A fun project idea is an off-grid weather station broadcasting its data over the mesh network.</p>

<h2>Continuing the Exploration</h2>

<p>Working with Meshtastic has been fun. It's impressive how a few inexpensive devices can form a communications network covering many miles. The system is limited, but within those constraints it feels magical to send a message into the ether and have it hop across a county line to a stranger.</p>

<p>Meshtastic isn't very useful alone, but as more people join, the mesh becomes stronger and more useful for everyone. If you're in the Illinois Fox Valley area and interested, feel free to reach out or drop by our makerspace meetup - we'd love to grow the network. And if you're elsewhere, consider looking up <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/community/local-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meshtastic groups in your region</a>. I hope to see you on the air.</p>

<time datetime="2025-08-02">Aug 2, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/programming">Programming</a>) 



<p>Instead of writing HTML like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>cool-thing</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Hello, World!
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>… you can write HTML like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>cool-thing</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Hello, World!
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>cool-thing</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>… and CSS like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="css"><span><span><span>cool-thing</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>display</span>: <span>block</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>font-weight</span>: <span>bold</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>text-align</span>: <span>center</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>filter</span>: drop-shadow(<span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0.5</span><span>em</span> <span>#ff0</span>);
</span></span><span><span>	<span>color</span>: <span>#ff0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div>
<cool-thing>
Hello, World!
</cool-thing>

<p>Browsers handle unrecognized tags by treating them as a generic element, with no effect beyond what’s specified in the CSS.
This isn’t just a weird quirk, but is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#htmlunknownelement">standardized behavior</a>.
If you include hyphens in the name, you can guarantee that your tag won’t appear in any future versions of HTML.</p>
<p>While you should use descriptive built-in tags if they exist, if it’s a choice between &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;,
making up your own tag provides better readability then using a bunch of class names.</p>
<p>As an example, if you have a bunch of nested tags:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>article</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>article-header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>article-quote</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>quote-body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>... a bunch more HTML ...
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Good luck trying to insert something inside of “article-heading” but after “article-quote” on the first try.
This problem vanishes if you use descriptive tag names — no &lt;/div&gt; counting required:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>main-article</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>article-header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>article-quote</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>quote-body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>... a bunch more HTML ...
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>quote-body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>article-quote</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;!-- here! --&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>article-header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>main-article</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div>
