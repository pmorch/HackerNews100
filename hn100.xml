<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Meta has reportedly broken up its Responsible AI (RAI) team as it puts more of its resources into generative artificial intelligence. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-breaks-up-its-responsible-ai-team"><em>The Information</em> broke the news</a> today, citing an internal post it had seen. </p><p>According to the report, most RAI members will move to the company’s generative AI product team, while others will work on Meta’s AI infrastructure. The company regularly says it wants to develop AI responsibly and even <a href="https://ai.meta.com/responsible-ai/">has a page</a> devoted to the promise, where the company lists its “pillars of responsible AI,” including accountability, transparency, safety, privacy, and more. </p><p><em>The Information</em>’s report quotes Jon Carvill, who represents Meta, as saying that the company will “continue to prioritize and invest in safe and responsible AI development.” He added that although the company is splitting the team up, those members will “continue to support relevant cross-Meta efforts on responsible AI development and use.” </p><p>Meta did not respond to a request for comment by press time.</p><p>The team already saw a restructuring earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-responsible-ai-team-2023-10"><em>Business Insider </em>wrote</a> included layoffs that left RAI “a shell of a team.” That report went on to say the RAI team, which had existed since 2019, had little autonomy and that its initiatives had to go through lengthy stakeholder negotiations before they could be implemented.</p><p>RAI was created to identify problems with its AI training approaches, including whether the company’s models are trained with adequately diverse information, with an eye toward preventing things like moderation issues on its platforms. Automated systems on Meta’s social platforms have led to problems like a Facebook translation issue that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/us-world/2017/10/24/16533496/facebook-apology-wrong-translation-palestinian-arrested-post-good-morning">caused a false arrest</a>, WhatsApp AI sticker generation that results in biased images <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/5/23946732/whatsapp-ai-sticker-guns-palestine-israel">when given certain prompts</a>, and Instagram’s algorithms <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752192/instagrams-recommendation-algorithms-promote-pedophile-networks-investigation">helping people find child sexual abuse materials</a>.</p><div><p>Moves like Meta’s and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638823/microsoft-ethics-society-team-responsible-ai-layoffs">similar one by Microsoft</a> early this year come as world governments race to create regulatory guardrails for artificial intelligence development. The US government entered into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870092/nvidia-ibm-adobe-white-house-ai-agreement-nonbinding">agreements with AI companies</a> and President Biden later directed government agencies to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23914507/biden-ai-executive-order-regulation-standards">come up with AI safety rules</a>. Meanwhile, the European Union has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23878784/uk-anti-trust-regulator-ai-principles">published its AI principles</a> and is still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23929273/eu-ai-act-generative-regulation-models">struggling to pass its AI Act</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p><span>Cool! I recently wrote my own user script to do the same thing. It's going to be very hard to patch or detect this, as updating video element props don't trigger DOM updates. They would have to either do lots of JS prototype trickery or check for playback rate when doing adblock detection. One thing to keep in mind here though since you're doing DOM lookups every time anything on the page changes, is that there could be some small overhead in page render time, and also that using fixed CSS classes means any small change to page code could break the checks. In case it's a problem in the future, checking .innerText is a hacky way to workaround it.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I mean I have premium but I still want them to get smacked down for this because Google made one of the endgame moves to drink verification can.<p>Ads are supposed to incidental, you run ads and if too many people block them because they suck then congrats sucks for you. If no one sees them then sucks for you. Most people put up with TV ads when they're not even hard to skip. And for some reason IG ads are well liked. Forcing them harder I think has to make us confront what we're really doing here and what we're gaining by all this. Just pay for premium sounds nice when you don't think about it. If there's no universe where someone might actually prefer the ads if they were the same price then we're kinda admitting they have literally zero value to the viewer.</p><p>And that paints a very different picture of advertising than "the grease of the economic wheel" ya know? And clearly all advertising isn't like this, like I paid to see the Lego movie, Barbie was fantastic. I watched a YT video of a woman showing her design process for a product she's selling and it was fascinating but it was also just an ad. But if YT are there to suck just so you'll pay for it to suck less than that's not mutually beneficial trade that's extortion.

Clearly I just want free shit.<p>I know it's crazy but what I actually want is an ad model where I don't feel the need to make it go away and might actually enjoy. An ad model where it doesn't have to interrupt me and force itself upon my eyes because it's actually content I would watch on my own.</p><p>Like take for example Fly.io's blog. It's is some of the best advertising for the service and is definitely why I use them today. Raymond Hettenger's python YT series is a fantastic ad for his consultancy. Wendy's Twitter was/is  hilarious. But its a weird dynamic because if the content is <i>good</i> you don't have to pay for it which seems silly because it's an ad all the same.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Infocom Z-code Interpreters</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a collection of Infocom's original Z-code interpreters for various home computers of the 1980s.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the interpreters are provided as assembly source code (for the 6502, Z-80, and so on). Some have compiled binaries as well. As with the Infocom game source code, what's available is what's available.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repo contains a small amount of internal documentation, mostly about how to create working floppy disks for each platform. It contains no personal or private communication, unless you count one footnote about a "straightforward" porting job.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Below I have documented all the directories and files, as best I understand them. Corrections and further details welcomed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Interesting tidbits:</p>
<p dir="auto">Many directories include a large "assembled printout" file (usually <code>.prn</code> or <code>.lst</code>). This is a text file containing the assembler output for a complete program, both hex bytes and opcodes. ("prn" because it is notionally formatted for a line printer.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>unix</code> directory contains a C implementation of DIP, the virtual machine used to implement Fooblitzky. The <code>atari</code> and <code>ibm</code> directories contain assembly implementations of same. <code>unix/foo.dat</code> is the game file in question; <code>unix/ediptst.sum</code> would be a test suite game.</p>
<p dir="auto">(Wikipedia refers to this as "GZIP - Graphical Zork Interpreter Program". I'm not sure what the origin of that name is. It doesn't appear in the Infocom source as far as I can tell. A couple of files refer to it as "GRIP" or the "G-machine". I'll stick with "DIP".)</p>
<p dir="auto">The architecture of DIP is unexplored territory (for my generation at least!) At a glance, it has version byte 1 and a serial number starting at byte 12 (rather than 18, as in the Z-machine). The game file appears to include graphical sprite data in high VM memory, rather than as external resources. The opcodes in the DIP interpreter are different. And so on.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>.pre</code> and <code>.pur</code> files concatenate to the original, except that in ziptest.pre, header byte 1 gets the "story file split" bit set and bytes 4-5 (himem) are $05FF. This is the usual way Z-code files are split for platforms that can't fit the whole game in memory at once.</p>

<p dir="auto">I tried to decode the pichex files. <code>dip.c</code> implies that images are made of 8-byte (8x8 pixel) blocks, and if you split the pichex files that way you get reasonable blocks. One would have to do additional work to figure out which blocks to tile together to make complete "icons" or sprites.</p>

<p>A day after OpenAI’s board of directors <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/11/17/sam-altman-out-at-openai/?sh=6f3c03c54691" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/11/17/sam-altman-out-at-openai/?sh=6f3c03c54691" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/11/17/sam-altman-out-at-openai/?sh=6f3c03c54691" aria-label="fired former CEO Sam Altman">fired former CEO Sam Altman</a> in a shock development, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=6aed1f6f3fc9" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=6aed1f6f3fc9" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=6aed1f6f3fc9" aria-label="investors">investors</a> in the company are plotting how to restore him in what would amount to an even more surprising counter-coup.</p>


<p>Venture capital firms holding positions in OpenAI’s for-profit entity have discussed working with Microsoft and senior employees at the company to bring back Altman, even as he has signaled to some that he intends to launch a new startup, four sources told <em>Forbes</em>.</p>

<p>Whether the companies would be able to exert enough pressure to pull off such a move — and do it fast enough to keep Altman interested — is unclear.</p>

<p>The playbook, a source told <em>Forbes</em> would be straightforward: make OpenAI’s new management, under acting CEO Mira Murati and the remaining board, accept that their situation was untenable through a combination of mass revolt by senior researchers, withheld cloud computing credits from Microsoft, and a potential lawsuit from investors. Facing such a combination, the thinking is that management would have to accept Altman back, likely leading to the subsequent departure of those believed to have pushed for Altman’s removal, including cofounder Ilya Sutskever and board director Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora.</p>

<p>Should such an effort not come together in time, Altman and OpenAI ex-president Greg Brockman were set to raise capital for a new startup, two sources said. “If they don’t figure it out asap, they’d just go ahead with Newco,” one source added.</p>
<p>OpenAI had not responded to a request for comment at publication time. Microsoft declined to comment.</p>
<p>At least one firm, Sequoia, was independently in contact with Microsoft to encourage it to work to restore Altman and Brockman, according to a source close to the firm. The firm would support Altman whichever option he chose, the source added.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-co-founder-altman-plans-new-venture?utm_campaign=OpenAI+Crisis+Update&amp;utm_content=2279&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1650" target="_blank" title="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-co-founder-altman-plans-new-venture?utm_campaign=OpenAI+Crisis+Update&amp;utm_content=2279&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1650" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-co-founder-altman-plans-new-venture?utm_campaign=OpenAI+Crisis+Update&amp;utm_content=2279&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1650" aria-label="reported">reported</a> that Altman was already meeting with investors to raise funds for such a project. One source close to Altman said that both options remained possible. “I think he truly wants the best outcome,” said the person. “He doesn’t want to see lives destroyed.”</p>

<p>A key player in any attempted reinstatement would be Microsoft, OpenAI’s key partner that has poured $10 billion into the company. CEO Satya Nadella was left surprised and “furious” by the ouster, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board?sref=YK080Hgh#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" title="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board?sref=YK080Hgh#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board?sref=YK080Hgh#xj4y7vzkg" aria-label="reported">reported</a>. Microsoft has sent only a fraction of that stated dollar amount to OpenAI, per a Semafor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" target="_blank" title="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" aria-label="report">report</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to the company as its CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired">suddenly fired by the board on Friday</a> with no notice, is “ambivalent” about coming back and would want significant governance changes.</p><p>Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him. Hours after he was axed, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and former board chairman, resigned, and the two have been talking to friends and investors about starting another company. A string of senior researchers <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/three-senior-openai-researchers-resign-as-crisis-deepens?rc=k5vrz1">also resigned</a> on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works.</p><div><p>Altman is “ambivalent” about coming back</p></div><p>OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, said in a statement shortly after Altman’s firing that the company “remains committed” to its partnership with the AI firm. However, OpenAI’s investors weren’t given advance warning or opportunity to weigh in on the board’s decision to remove Altman. As the face of the company and the most prominent voice in AI, his removal throws the future of OpenAI into uncertainty at a time when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23610427/chatbots-chatgpt-new-bing-google-bard-conversational-ai">rivals are racing to catch up</a> with the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT.</p><p>A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t respond to a request for comment about Altman discussing a return with the board. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment.</p><p>OpenAI’s current board consists of chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, former GeoSim Systems CEO Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner, the director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Unlike traditional companies, the board isn’t tasked with maximizing shareholder value, and none of them hold equity in OpenAI. Instead, their stated mission is to ensure the creation of “broadly beneficial” artificial general intelligence, or AGI.</p><p>Sutskever, who also co-founded OpenAI and leads its researchers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23966446/what-happened-to-sam-altman-open-ai">was instrumental in the ousting of Altman this week</a>, according to multiple sources. His role in the coup suggests a power struggle between the research and product sides of the company, the sources say.</p><div><form action="#"><div><h2>Command Line</h2><p> / <span>A newsletter from Alex Heath about the tech industry’s inside conversation.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-164299">

<div>
<p>I cannot for the life of me remember when it was or what it was but a fair few years ago I remember positioning a telescope to observe an asteroid as it silently and perhaps slightly eerily drifted between us and the Moon. I say eerily as this asteroid had the ability to cause widespread damage had it hit but of course we knew it posed no threat.&nbsp; I remember at the time thinking it was mind blowing that even today, we still use mathematics with roots (pardon the pun) centuries old to calculate the position of objects in our Solar System. We get to see evidence of this again on 12th December when something rare happens!</p>
<p>I have rather hinted to what I am referring, on 12th December, asteroid 319 Leona will pass directly in front of Betelgeuse, the red giant in the constellation of Orion whose name amusingly translates to armpit of the giant – now there’s a fact to amuse and astound your friends. To be able to calculate that a rock approximately 60 km across is going to pass directly in front of a star that is just over 650 light years away is really quite staggering.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps more excitingly if you live along a corridor from central Asia and southern Europe to Florida and Mexico then at around 01:17 UTC you have a chance – clouds permitting – to see it for yourself and you don’t need any telescope or equipment, just your eyes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Betelgeuse is the second brightest star in the constellation Orion and is a familiar favourite with its piercing red colour. It hit the news back in 2020 when it unexpectedly dimmed in the sky due to the star itself ejecting a cloud of dust. Next month it will fade for a few seconds due to the passage of Leona right in front of it. An event like this is quite rare where the light from a bright star is blocked (or occulted) by an asteroid happening every few decades at most.&nbsp; It will be fascinating to watch but is also scientifically useful giving us a chance to learn more about Betelgeuse and how it’s large convection cells behave, and to learn more about the orbit and shape of the asteroid too.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="451" height="640" src="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Orion.jpeg" alt="Image of Orion showing Betelgeuse upper left.

<p>Anyone out there wishing to observe the event needs to be warned though, the predictions are just that, there are a few uncertainties. The size and shape of the asteroid itself is still subject to debate. Typically we tend to assume asteroids are spherical unless we know otherwise but a previous occultation of Leona in September 2023 determined that it was more of ellipsoidal in shape measuring 80km by 55km. At its distance from Earth that means it will cover an area of sky 46 x 41 milliarcseconds which is a little more than the approximate 40 milliarcseconds for Betelgeuse.&nbsp; Taking this into account suggests Betelgeuse will be completely blocked from view and therefore blink out for a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Betelgeuse’s somewhat diffuse outer atmosphere may mean its apparent size is more like 50 milliarcseconds so it just fades instead. &nbsp; Until the event happens we will not know exactly how it will appear in the sky or exactly when. &nbsp; It’s a great opportunity to learn more about these two fascinating objets so head outside on 12th December around 01:00 UTC, wait and watch and hopefully you can witness one of natures rather more rare events.&nbsp;</p>

Launched in December 2018, the first cluster of three spacecraft (known as the Pathfinder Cluster) has been fully operational since February of 2019. The software-defined radio (SDR) payload on all three spacecraft can be tuned to a wide range of different frequencies (144MHz-15GHz) and switched between several different RF front end and antenna paths. The HE360 Signal of Interest (SOI) library is the list of signals that can be geolocated by the company’s spacecraft. Common SOIs include UHF GMRS/FRS Push-to-talk Radios, VHF Radios, Automatic Identification System (AIS) EPIRB Emergency Radio Beacons, Cellular Towers, Satellite Phone, X-band Maritime Navigation Radars, Ku-band VSAT Terminals. Tools developed in-house by HE360 efficiently process this data in an integrated signal-processing and geo-engine to calculate and deliver information about myriad emitter types from around the planet.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) Additionally, HawkEye 360 satellites can detect RF signals in the GPS bands, as well as other GNSS systems, e.g. GLONASS. If detected by all three spacecraft, the RF energy from a GNSS interference can be geolocated to its point of origin using an adaptation of the company’s existing geolocation techniques. Due to the global coverage of the constellation, geolocation of GNSS jamming or spoofing can be conducted over denied areas without exposing airborne or terrestrial sensors or personnel to hostile conditions. Unlike electro optical sensors, RF geolocation provides data day and night in all weather conditions.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) HE360 Spectrum Awareness products can support multiple applications and mission areas; including theater indications and warning, pattern of life analysis; maritime domain awareness; illegal fishing identification; border monitoring, mapping communications nodes; and disaster response.</p><p>(U) HE360 data and products are entirely unclassified, providing theater intelligence officers with an unprecedented ability to share RF geolocations with tactical echelons and partner nations. HE360 data is easily accessible via a web interface, and is interoperable “out of the box” with all GIS, C4ISR, and mobile device systems.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

            </span></p><p><span><span><span><span>DURHAM, N.C. – Nanoplastics interact with a particular protein that is naturally found in the brain, creating changes linked to Parkinson’s disease and some types of dementia.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In a Duke-led study appearing Nov. 17 in Science Advances, the researchers report that the findings create a foundation for a new area of investigation, fueled by the timely impact of environmental factors on human biology. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Parkinson’s disease has been called the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world,” said principal investigator, </span></span><a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/andrew.west"><span><span>Andrew West, Ph.D.,</span></span></a><span><span> professor in the </span></span><a href="https://pcb.duke.edu/"><span><span>Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology</span></span></a><span><span> at </span></span><a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/"><span><span>Duke University School of Medicine</span></span></a><span><span>. “Numerous lines of data suggest environmental factors might play a prominent role in Parkinson’s disease, but such factors have for the most part not been identified.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Improperly disposed plastics have been shown to break into very small pieces and accumulate in water and food supplies, and were found in the blood of most adults in a recent study. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Our study suggests that the emergence of micro and nanoplastics in the environment might represent a new toxin challenge with respect to Parkinson’s disease risk and progression,” West said. “This is especially concerning given the predicted increase in concentrations of these contaminants in our water and food supplies.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>West and colleagues in Duke’s </span></span><a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/"><span><span>Nicholas School of the Environment</span></span></a><span><span> and the </span></span><a href="https://chem.duke.edu/"><span><span>Department of Chemistry</span></span></a><span><span> at </span></span><a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/"><span><span>Trinity College of Arts and Sciences</span></span></a><span><span> found that nanoparticles of the plastic polystyrene -- typically found in single use items such as disposable drinking cups and cutlery -- attract the accumulation of the protein known as alpha-synuclein. West said the study’s most surprising findings are the tight bonds formed between the plastic and the protein within the area of the neuron where these accumulations are congregating, the </span></span><span><span><span>lysosome.</span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Researchers said the plastic-protein accumulations happened across three different models performed in the study - in test tubes, cultured neurons, and mouse models of Parkinson’s disease. West said questions remain about how such interactions might be happening within humans and whether the type of plastic might play a role.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“While microplastic and nanoplastic contaminants are being closely evaluated for their potential impact in cancer and autoimmune diseases, the striking nature of the interactions we could observe in our models suggest a need for evaluating increasing nanoplastic contaminants on Parkinson’s disease and dementia risk and progression,” West said. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The technology needed to monitor nanoplastics is still at the earliest possible stages and not ready yet to answer all the questions we have,” he said. “But hopefully efforts in this area will increase rapidly, as we see what these particles can do in our models. If we know what to look out for, we can take the necessary steps to protect ourselves, without compromising all the benefits we reap every day from plastics.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The study was funded by in part by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research and the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s initiative (ASAP-020527).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to West, study authors include Zhiyong Liu, Arpine Sokratian, Addison M. Duda, Enquan Xu, Christina Stanhope, Amber Fu, Samuel Strader, Huizhong Li, Yuan Yuan, Benjamin G. Bobay, Joana Sipe, Ketty Bai, Iben Lundgaard, Na Liu, Belinda Hernandez, Catherine Bowes Rickman, and Sara E. Miller.</span></span></span></span></p>

  <div id="post_body_1136625"><p>A lot of people ask me what the ideal cofounder looks
like.&nbsp; I now have an answer: Greg Brockman.</p>

<p>Every successful startup I know has at least one person&nbsp;who
provides the force of will to make the startup happen. &nbsp;I’d thought a lot
about this in the abstract while advising YC startups, but until OpenAI I
hadn’t observed up close someone else drive the formation of a startup.</p>

<p>OpenAI wouldn’t have happened without Greg. &nbsp;He commits
quickly and fully to things. &nbsp;I organized a group dinner early on to talk about
what such an organization might look like, and drove him home afterwards.&nbsp;
Greg asked me questions for the first half of the drive back to San Francisco,
then declared he was in, and started planning logistics for the rest of the
drive.</p>

<p>From then on he was fully in, with an average email response
time of about 5 minutes to anything.&nbsp; Elon and I were both busy with day
jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a
very high-latency connection.</p>

<p>He recruited the founding team. &nbsp;Greg is a world-class recruiter
(he plans every detail of interviews, heavily researches candidate’s
backgrounds, sends thoughtful and persistent followups, and so on), and&nbsp;I
now believe even more strongly that someone on the founding team has to be an
amazing recruiter.</p>

<p>He’s incredibly open to feedback.&nbsp; Large or small, he’s
always willing to hear it, never gets offended, and processes it very
quickly.&nbsp; I once suggested to him that he wasn't communicating a bold
enough vision for the organization, and&nbsp;the next time I heard him talk
about it (and every time since) it was&nbsp;a perfectly calibrated explanation
of how we were going to succeed at something that really mattered.&nbsp; Even
on non-traditional ideas, like when I suggested he co-lead the organization with
Ilya, he was always open-minded and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Greg also played the role of ‘non-technical cofounder’, which is
a misnomer because most people who know him will say something like “Greg is
the most productive engineer I know”.&nbsp; But he took on all the
non-technical roles at the beginning, defining the culture, making offers,
organizing offsites, letting everyone work out of his apartment, ordering
supplies, cleaning up after meals, etc.&nbsp; It's important to have someone
great in this role at a small startup—many people gloss over it.</p>

<p>Without someone dedicated to finding a solution to all problems,
no matter how difficult, eventually a large problem will come along and kill you while you’re
still weak.&nbsp; Founding teams need a Chief
Optimist to rally everyone to press on despite the difficulties, and it’s always hard on that
person because they can’t really lean on anyone else in the hardest times.</p>

<p>You for sure need great technical talent on a founding team, but
make sure you also have someone like Greg.&nbsp; If they’re the same person,
then you’ve hit the jackpot.</p></div>

                        <p>Northwestern University researchers have raised the standards again for perovskite solar cells with a new development that helped the emerging technology hit new records for efficiency.</p><p>The findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adk1633">published today (Nov. 17) in the journal Science</a>, describe a dual-molecule solution to overcoming losses in efficiency as sunlight is converted to energy. By incorporating first, a molecule to address something called surface recombination, in which electrons are lost when they are trapped by defects — missing atoms on the surface, and a second molecule to disrupt recombination at the interface between layers, the team achieved a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) certified efficiency of 25.1% where earlier approaches reached efficiencies of just 24.09%.</p><p>“Perovskite solar technology is moving fast, and the emphasis of research and development is shifting from the bulk absorber to the interfaces,” said Northwestern professor <a href="https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/ted-sargent.html">Ted Sargent</a>. “This is the critical point to further improve efficiency and stability and bring us closer to this promising route to ever-more-efficient solar harvesting.”</p><p>Sargent is the co-executive director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trienens-institute.northwestern.edu/">Paula M. Trienens Institute for Sustainability and Energy</a>&nbsp;(formerly ISEN) and a multidisciplinary researcher in materials chemistry and energy systems, with appointments in the department of chemistry in the&nbsp;<a href="https://weinberg.northwestern.edu/">Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences</a>&nbsp;and the department of electrical and computer engineering in the&nbsp;<a href="https://mccormick.northwestern.edu/">McCormick School of Engineering</a>.</p><p>Conventional solar cells are made of high-purity silicon wafers that are energy-intensive to produce and can only absorb a fixed range of the solar spectrum.</p><p>Perovskite materials whose size and composition can be adjusted to “tune” the wavelengths of light they absorb, making them a favorable and potentially lower-cost, high-efficiency emerging tandem technology.</p><p>Historically perovskite solar cells have been plagued by challenges to improve efficiency because of their relative instability. Over the past few years, advances from&nbsp;<a href="https://light.northwestern.edu/">Sargent’s lab</a>&nbsp;and others have brought the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to within the same range as what is achievable with silicon.</p><p>In the present research, rather than trying to help the cell absorb more sunlight, the team focused on the issue of maintaining and retaining generated electrons to increase efficiency. When the perovskite layer contacts the electron transport layer of the cell, electrons move from one to the other. But the electron can move back outward and fill, or “recombine” with holes that exist on the perovskite layer.</p><p>“Recombination at the interface is complex,” said first author Cheng Liu, a postdoctoral student in the Sargent lab, which is co-supervised by the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison&nbsp;Professor of Chemistry Mercouri Kanatzidis. “It’s very difficult to use one type of molecule to address complex recombination and retain electrons, so we considered what combination of molecules we could use to more comprehensively solve the problem.”</p><p>Past research from Sargent’s team has found evidence that one molecule, PDAI<sub>2</sub>, does a good job at solving interface recombination. Next they needed to find a molecule that would work to repair surface defects and prevent electrons from recombining with them.</p><p>By finding the mechanism that would allow PDAI<sub>2</sub> to work with a secondary molecule, the team narrowed in on sulfur, which could replace carbon groups — typically poor at preventing electrons from moving — to cover missing atoms and suppress recombination.</p><p>"In addressing the core inefficiencies found in inverted perovskite solar cells, which are predominantly due to nonradiative recombination losses, a new standard in solar cell efficiency is being set," said Northwestern professor Mercouri Kanatzidis. "This is a prime illustration of how the field of advanced materials chemistry can significantly enhance the energy conversion efficiency and longevity of emerging perovskite photovoltaic technologies."</p><p>Kanatzidis is a leading authority in the field of materials chemistry and sustainable energy solutions, with dual appointments in Weinberg’s department of chemistry and McCormick’s department of materials science and engineering.</p><p>"We are excited that our bimolecular strategy shows applicability to a range of perovskite compositions, including those that are promising for tandem solar cells," said Bin Chen, research assistant professor of chemistry and a co-author on the paper.</p><p>A recent paper by the same group published in Nature developed a coating for the substrate beneath the perovskite layer to help the cell work at a higher temperature for a longer period. This solution, according to Liu, can work in tandem with the findings within the Science paper.&nbsp;</p><p>While the team hopes their findings will encourage the larger scientific community to continue moving the work forward, they too will be working on follow-ups.</p><p>“We have to use a more flexible strategy to solve the complex interface problem,” Cheng said. “We can’t only use one kind of molecule, as people previously did. We use two molecules to solve two kinds of recombination, but we are sure there’s more kinds of defect-related recombination at the interface. We need to try to use more molecules to come together and make sure all molecules work together without destroying each other’s functions.”</p>

<h3>from the <i>you-both-serve-the-public.-try-that-out-sometime.</i> dept</h3>

<p>There’s nothing new about cop shops letting their tech providers write their press releases for them. Law enforcement officers <em>love</em> power but often think nothing of surrendering their autonomy to the providers of the snooping tools.</p>
<p>For years, Harris Corporation — the maker of Stingray devices — told cops what they could or couldn’t say about their use of the tech, tying them up (often <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/05/18/fbi-says-it-has-no-idea-why-law-enforcement-agencies-are-following-terms-stingray-non-disclosure-agreements/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/05/18/fbi-says-it-has-no-idea-why-law-enforcement-agencies-are-following-terms-stingray-non-disclosure-agreements/">with the help</a> of the FBI) with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/01/25/harris-stingray-nondisclosure-agreement-forbids-cops-telling-legislators-about-surveillance-tech/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/01/25/harris-stingray-nondisclosure-agreement-forbids-cops-telling-legislators-about-surveillance-tech/">non-disclosure agreements</a>. Ring — the biggest name in front-door surveillance — has given cops cameras to hand out in exchange for expanding its customer base and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/07/30/amazons-free-doorbell-cameras-only-cost-law-enforcement-agencies-their-dignity-autonomy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/07/30/amazons-free-doorbell-cameras-only-cost-law-enforcement-agencies-their-dignity-autonomy/">allowing Ring to man the PR front</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/09/07/police-chief-says-hell-decide-who-is-isnt-real-journalist/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/09/07/police-chief-says-hell-decide-who-is-isnt-real-journalist/">there’s nothing new</a> about so-called journalists <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/28/media-critic-calls-journalists-to-be-obedient-stenographers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/28/media-critic-calls-journalists-to-be-obedient-stenographers/">acting as stenographers</a> for cops. When something happens that suggests police misconduct, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/06/11/every-kill-good-kill-how-police-media-cooperate-to-disparage-dead/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/06/11/every-kill-good-kill-how-police-media-cooperate-to-disparage-dead/">some journalists do nothing more</a> than publish PD press releases and/or seek comment only from law enforcement PR reps or (vomits in mouth) police union representatives.</p>
<p>Perhaps its these years of underservice that has led to press outlets publishing full-page ads for tech providers, apparently without feeling they might be crossing ethical lines. That’s what’s being called out by the EFF in its post titled “<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/rise-police-advertiser" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/rise-police-advertiser">The Rise of the Police-Advertiser.</a>” Who exactly is being served when “journalists” add a couple of sentences to name brand heavy posts that unabashedly celebrate the products and the cops that claim these tech marvels pretty much pay for themselves?</p>

<p><em>In August, the Tulsa police department held a&nbsp;<a href="https://ktul.com/news/local/tulsa-police-to-hold-press-conference-about-success-of-flock-safety-devices">press conference</a>&nbsp;about how its new Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs), a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/flock-license-plate-reader-homeowners-association-safe-problems">controversial</a>&nbsp;piece of surveillance technology, was the policing equivalent of “turning the lights on” for the first time. In Ontario, California, the city put out a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontarioca.gov/press_releases/flock-cameras-assist-apprehension-burglary-suspect">press release</a>&nbsp;about how its ALPRs were a “vital resource.” In Madison, South Dakota,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2022/09/01/how-states-first-flock-safety-camera-busted-car-thieves-madison/">local news</a>&nbsp;covered how the city’s expenditure of $30,000 for ALPRs “paid off” twice in two days. &nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s go to the local piece (he said, living in South Dakota). Here’s an eagle-eye view of this so-called reporting, with the name brand of the tech central to piece highlighted:</p>

<p>Does that look like journalism to you? Flock flock flock flock flock flock flock. Six times, including the headline. This is an advertisement for Flock, published for free by KSFY and distributed by other local news sources who had to do nothing but credit KSFY for its original “reporting.” That’s six mentions of Flock and a couple of statements from a PD official who saw the plate readers hit twice and somehow decided this was newsworthy enough he should call the local station.</p>
<p>Or maybe Madison Police Chief Justin Meyer didn’t even have to place a call. Maybe all he needed to do was insert a few words into Flock’s PR boilerplate and email it to the nearest news agencies. That’s what Flock does: it writes most of the words and instructs cops to fill in the blanks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Flock Safety has distributed a&nbsp;<a href="https://flocksafety.showpad.com/share/v7QdbufyT5cXl2UQzowre">Public Information Officer Toolkit</a>, providing “resources and templates for public information officers.” A Flock draft press release states:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The ___ Police Department has solved [CRIME] with the help of their Flock Safety camera system. Flock Safety ALPR cameras help law enforcement investigate crime by providing objective evidence. [CRIME DETAILS AND STORY] ____ Police installed Flock cameras on [DATE] to solve and reduce crime in [CITY].</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This Mad Libs of a press release is an advertisement, and one Flock hopes your police departments will distribute so that they can sell more ALPRs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only hope some news outlet lets one of these hit the front page of their website with half-completed boilerplate. Sooner or later, someone from the cop PR department is going to send out an email blast that trumpets the success of [INSERT TECH PROVIDER] in solving [CRIME DETAILS AND STORY].</p>
<p>Flock isn’t alone. In addition to the previously mentioned Harris and Ring, ShotSpotter has its own PR wing that pretty much composes press releases for cops and pushes them to become unpaid brand ambassadors for a brand <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/08/23/investigation-shotspotters-practices-is-raising-questions-companys-angry-statement-really-doesnt-answer/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/08/23/investigation-shotspotters-practices-is-raising-questions-companys-angry-statement-really-doesnt-answer/">so controversial</a> it recently <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/19/shotspotter-attempts-to-memory-hole-itself-rebrands-as-soundthinking/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/19/shotspotter-attempts-to-memory-hole-itself-rebrands-as-soundthinking/">rebranded</a> as “SoundThinking.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://ir.shotspotter.com/annual-reports/content/0001564590-21-016134/0001564590-21-016134.pdf">yearly report</a>&nbsp;to the SEC filed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shotspotter-police-gunshot-technology-federal-grants-rcna13815">ShotSpotter</a>, an acoustic gunshot detection company, reports that their marketing team “leveraged our extremely satisfied and loyal customer base to create a significant set of new ‘success stories’ that show proof of value to prospects…. In the area of public relations, we work closely with many of our customers to help them communicate the success of ShotSpotter to their local media and communities.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ugly stuff. Not only does it damage the trustworthiness of journalistic outlets, it makes cops appear to be nothing more than pushers of tech company propaganda. None of this appears organic. And that’s because none of it is.</p>
<p>In both cases, the public is being screwed by entities they’d rather trust. The sad thing is neither of these entities appear to care they’re harming their relationship with the people they serve. Understaffed news desks are more than happy to simply republish garbage like this because it frees them up to handle stuff they actually care about. And cops are only too happy to do this because it means their tech supplier will be pleased with their obeisance and possibly shower them with freebies or preferential pricing.</p>

<p>On Friday, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-fires-ceo-sam-altman-citing-less-than-candid-communications/">fired CEO Sam Altman</a> in a surprise move that led to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-president-greg-brockman-quits-as-nervous-employees-hold-all-hands-meeting/">resignation</a> of President Greg Brockman and <a href="https://x.com/hellokillian/status/1725797467315486902?s=20">three senior scientists</a>. The move also blindsided key investor and minority owner Microsoft, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board#xj4y7vzkg">reportedly</a> making CEO Satya Nadella furious. As Friday night wore on, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/before-openai-ousted-altman-employees-disagreed-over-ai-safety">reports emerged</a> that the ousting was likely orchestrated by Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever over concerns about the safety and speed of OpenAI's tech deployment.</p>

<p>"This was the board doing its duty to the mission of the nonprofit, which is to make sure that OpenAI builds AGI that benefits all of humanity," Sutskever told employees at an emergency all-hands meeting on Friday afternoon, as reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/before-openai-ousted-altman-employees-disagreed-over-ai-safety">The Information</a>.</p>
<p>Since its founding, OpenAI has pursued the development of artificial general intelligence (or AGI), which is a hypothetical technology that would be able to perform any intellectual task a human can do, potentially replacing a large number of humans at their jobs.</p>
<p>Internally at OpenAI, insiders say that disagreements had emerged over the speed at which Altman was pushing for commercialization and company growth, with Sutskever arguing to slow things down. Sources <a href="https://x.com/karaswisher/status/1725702612379378120?s=20">told</a> reporter Kara Swisher that OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-gpt-4-turbo-larger-memory-lower-cost-new-knowledge/">Dev Day event</a> on November 6, with Altman front and center in a keynote pushing consumer-like products, was an "inflection moment of Altman pushing too far, too fast."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594?s=20">joint statement</a> released Friday night, Altman and Brockman said they were "shocked and saddened" by the board's actions. And they weren't the only ones shocked by the news, as tech insiders took to social media on Friday to share their reactions. Angel investor Ron Conway <a href="https://x.com/RonConway/status/1725759359748309381?s=20">wrote</a>, "What happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam &amp; Greg or all the builders in OpenAI."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>OpenAI has an <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure">unusual structure</a> where its for-profit arm is owned and controlled by a non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity. Prior to yesterday, that non-profit was controlled by a board of directors that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/these-are-the-people-that-fired-openai-ceo-sam-altman/">included</a> Altman, Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and three others who were not OpenAI employees: Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora; Tasha McCauley, an adjunct senior management scientist at RAND corporation; and Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Now, only Sutskever, D'Angelo, McCauley, and Toner remain.</p>

<h2>Surprise moves and turmoil</h2>
<p>According to the joint statement from Brockman and Altman, Altman's firing came as a complete surprise to the pair, and they laid out a rough timeline of what happened. On Thursday night, Altman was asked to attend a remote board meeting on Friday at noon. The next day, Brockman, who was Chairman of the OpenAI board, was not invited to this board meeting, where Altman was fired.</p>

<p>Around 30 minutes later, Brockman was informed by Sutskever that he was being removed from his board role but could remain at the company, and that Altman had been fired (Brockman declined, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-president-greg-brockman-quits-as-nervous-employees-hold-all-hands-meeting/">resigned</a> his role later on Friday). According to Brockman, the OpenAI management team was only made aware of these moves shortly after the fact, but former CTO (now interim CEO) Mira Murati had been informed on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Key questions remain about accusations made against Altman in the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition">OpenAI blog post</a> that announced his departure, where the board said that Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities." That has yet to be clarified by the company, but insiders say the move was mostly a power play that resulted from a cultural schism between Altman and Sutskever over Altman's <a href="https://x.com/karaswisher/status/1725733594310512775?s=20">management style</a> and drive for high-profile publicity. On September 29, Sutskever <a href="https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1707752576077176907?s=20">tweeted</a>, "Ego is the enemy of growth."</p>

<p>The schism is causing further turmoil on the inside. Three AI researchers loyal to Altman departed the company as well on Friday, resigning in reaction to the news: Jakub Pachocki, GPT-4 lead and OpenAI's director of research; Aleksander Madry, head of a team evaluating AI risk, and Szymon Sidor, an open source baselines researcher.</p>
<h2>Pushing back the "veil of ignorance"</h2>
<p>Rumors have already begun swirling about potential internal breakthroughs at OpenAI that may have intensified the slow/fast rift within the company, owing to Sutskever's role as co-lead of a "<a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment">Superalignment</a>" team that is tasked with figuring out how to control hypothetical superintelligent AI. At the APEC CEO Summit on Thursday, Altman <a href="https://x.com/thecaptain_nemo/status/1725743009629983215?s=20">said</a>, "Four times now in the history of OpenAI—the most recent time was just in the last couple of weeks—I’ve gotten to be in the room when we push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward. And getting to do that is like the professional honor of a lifetime."</p>

<p>The concern here not necessarily being that OpenAI has developed superintelligence, which experts say is unlikely, but that the new breakthrough Altman mentioned may have added pressure to a company that is fighting within itself to proceed safely (from its non-profit branch) but also make money (from its for-profit subsidiary). Altman also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-ceo-sam-altman-wants-to-build-ai-superintelligence/">recently said</a> that GPT-5, presumed to be a powerful successor to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/">alarm-causing GPT-4</a>, is now in development.</p>
<p>As news spread, some predictably shared quips on social media. X user shaurya <a href="https://x.com/shauseth/status/1725757968619278587?s=20">wrote</a>, "this is like the roman empire for people who do matrix multiplication." And AI futurist Daniel Jeffries <a href="https://x.com/Dan_Jeffries1/status/1725807257772872062?s=20">said</a>, "<span>The entire AI industry would like to thank the OpenAI board for giving us all a chance to catch up.</span>"</p>
<p>But not all reactions were doom and gloom. As Friday night wore on, some at OpenAI made forward-looking statements. Evan Morikawa, Engineering Manager at OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/E0M/status/1725721507161395415?s=20">wrote on X</a>, "For those wondering what’ll happen next, the answer is we’ll keep shipping. @sama &amp; @gdb weren’t micro-managers. The ✨ comes from the many geniuses here in research product eng &amp; design. There’s clear internal uniformity among these leaders that we’re here for the bigger mission."</p>
<p>Expect to hear more on the OpenAI board's side of the story as further details emerge.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Computer scientist and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/geoffrey-hinton-profile-ai">“godfather of AI”</a> Geoff Hinton says this about chatbots:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People say, It’s just glorified autocomplete . . . Now, let’s analyze that. Suppose you want to be really good at predicting the next word. If you want to be really good, you have to understand what’s being said. That’s the only way. So by training something to be really good at predicting the next word, you’re actually forcing it to understand. Yes, it’s ‘autocomplete’—but you didn’t think through what it means to have a really good autocomplete.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This got me thinking about what I do at work, for example in a research meeting.  I spend a lot of time doing “glorified autocomplete” in the style of a well-trained chatbot:  Someone describes some problem, I listen and it reminds me of a related issue I’ve thought about before, and I’m acting as a sort of FAQ, but more like a chatbot than a FAQ in that the people who are talking with me do not need to navigate through the FAQ to find the answer that is most relevant to them; I’m doing that myself and giving a response.</p>
<p>I do that sort of thing a lot in meetings, and it can work well, indeed often I think this sort of shallow, associative response can be more effective than whatever I’d get from a direct attack on the problem in question.  After all, the people I’m talking with have already thought for awhile about whatever it is they’re working on, and my initial thoughts may well be in the wrong direction, or else my thoughts are in the right direction but are just retracing my collaborators’ past ideas.  From the other direction, my shallow thoughts can be useful in representing insights from problems that these collaborators had not ever thought about much before.  Nonspecific suggestions on multilevel modeling or statistical graphics or simulation or whatever can really help!</p>
<p>At some point, though, I’ll typically have to bite the bullet and think hard, not necessarily reaching full understanding in the sense of mentally embedding the problem at hand into a coherent schema or logical framework, but still going through whatever steps of logical reasoning that I can.  This feels different than autocomplete; it requires an additional level of focus.  Often I need to consciously “flip the switch,” as it were, to turn on that focus and think rigorously.  Other times, I’m doing autocomplete and either come to a sticking point or encounter an interesting idea, and this causes me to stop and think.</p>
<p>It’s almost like the difference between jogging and running.  I can jog and jog and jog, thinking about all sorts of things and not feeling like I’m expending much effort, my legs pretty much move up and down of their own accort . . . but then if I need to <em>run</em>, that takes concentration.</p>
<p>Here’s another example.  Yesterday I participated in the methods colloquium in our political science department.  It was Don Green and me and a bunch of students, and the structure was that Don asked me questions, I responded with various statistics-related and social-science-related musings and stories, students followed up with questions, I responded with more stories, etc.  Kinda like the way things go here on the blog, but spoken rather than typed.  Anyway, the point is that most of my responses were a sort of autocomplete—not in a word-by-word chatbot style, more at a larger level of chunkiness, for example something would remind me of a story, and then I’d just insert the story into my conversation—but still at this shallow, pleasant level.  Mellow conversation with no intellectual or social strain.  But then, every once in awhile, I’d pull up short and have some new thought, some juxtaposition that had never occurred to me before, and I’d need to think things through.</p>
<p>This also happens when I give prepared talks.  My prepared talks are not super-well prepared—this is on purpose, as I find that too much preparation can inhibit flow.  In any case, I’ll often finding myself stopping and pausing to reconsider something or another.  Even when describing something I’ve done before, there are times when I feel the need to think it all through logically, as if for the first time.  I noticed something similar when I saw my sister give a talk once:  she had the same habit of pausing to work things out from first principles.  I don’t see this behavior in every academic talk, though; different people have different styles of presentation.</p>
<p>This seems related to models of associative and logical reasoning in psychology.  As a complete non-expert in that area, I’ll turn <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory">to wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The foundations of dual process theory likely come from William James. He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking: associative and true reasoning. . . . images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences, providing ideas of comparison or abstractions. He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as “only reproductive”. James believed that true reasoning could enable overcoming “unprecedented situations” . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds about right!</p>
<p>After describing various other theories from the past hundred years or so, Wikipedia continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds a bit different from what I was talking about above.  When I’m doing “glorified autocomplete” thinking, I’m still <em>thinking</em>—this isn’t automatic and barely conscious behavior along the lines of driving to work along a route I’ve taken a hundred times before—; I’m just thinking in a shallow way, trying to “autocomplete” the answer.  It’s pattern-matching more than it is logical reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  Just to be clear, I have a lot of respect for Hinton’s work; indeed, Aki and I included Hinton’s work in our brief review of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.columbia.edu/news/top-10-ideas-statistics-ai">10 pathbreaking research articles during the past 50 years of statistics and machine learning</a>.  Also, I’m not trying to make a hardcore, AI-can’t-think argument.  Although not myself a user of large language models, I respect <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/20/report-on-the-large-language-model-meeting-at-berkeley/">Bob Carpenter’s respect</a> for them.</p>
<p>I think that where Hinton got things wrong in the quote that led off this post was not in his characterization of chatbots, but rather in his assumptions about human thinking, in not distinguishing autocomplete-like associative reasoning with logical thinking.  Maybe Hinton’s problem in understanding this is that he’s just too logical!  At work, I do a lot of what seems like autocomplete—and, as I wrote above, I think it’s useful—but if I had more discipline, maybe I’d think more logically and carefully all the time.  It could well be that Hinton has that habit or inclination to always be in focus.  If Hinton does not have consistent personal experience of shallow, autocomplete-like thinking, he might not recognize it as something different, in which case he could be giving the chatbot credit for something it’s not doing.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, one thing that impresses me about Bob is that, when he’s working, he seems to always be on focus.  I’ll be in a meeting, just coasting along, and Bob will interrupt someone to ask for clarification, and I suddenly realize that Bob absolutely <em>demands</em> understanding.  He seems to have no interest in participating in a research meeting in a shallow way.  I guess we just have different styles.  It’s my impression that the vast majority of researchers are like me, just coasting on the surface most of the time (for some people, all of the time!), while Bob, and maybe Geoff Hinton, is one of the exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong>  Sometimes we really want to be doing shallow, auto-complete-style thinking.  For example, if we’re <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/06/13/world-premiere-performance-of-recursion-is-tonight/">writing a play</a> and want to simulate how some characters might interact.  Or just as a way of casting the intellectual net more widely.  When I’m in a research meeting and I free-associate, it might not help immediately solve the problem at hand, but it can bring in connections that will be helpful later.  So I’m not knocking auto-complete; I’m just disagreeing with Hinton’s statement that “by training something to be really good at predicting the next word, you’re actually forcing it to understand.”  As a person who does a lot of useful associative reasoning and also a bit of logical understanding, I think they’re different, both in how they feel and also in what they do.</p>

        <p>After a long and circuitous journey, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/three-things-know-about-louvres-history-180964326/">Louvre</a> has acquired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/lost-renaissance-masterpiece-worth-6-million-found-hanging-above-womans-hotplate-180973215/"><em>Christ Mocked</em></a>, a 13th-century work by the Florentine painter <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cimabue">Cimabue</a>. The 10- by 8-inch painting, now deemed a French “national treasure,” <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/lost-renaissance-masterpiece-worth-6-million-found-hanging-above-womans-hotplate-180973215/">hung unnoticed for years</a> above a hot plate in a 90-year-old French woman’s kitchen before experts identified it.</p>

<p>Dating to around 1280, the painting depicts Jesus before the crucifixion. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/16/style/cimabue-painting-louvre-scli-intl/index.html">CNN</a>’s Jack Guy, the owner, who was in her 90s, didn’t remember where the piece had come from and assumed it was a Greek religious icon.</p>

<p>Four years ago, when she began clearing out her home ahead of a move, she intended to throw out the painting, unaware of its true value, per the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/louvre-acquires-24m-painting-christ-mocked-rubbish-tip-cimabue-export-ban"><em>Guardian</em></a>’s Kim Willsher. Luckily, her family called in an expert to appraise items on the property. The unusual depiction of Christ caught the eye of the expert, who assumed it could be worth hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>Cimabue, born in Florence around 1240, is the pseudonym of the artist Cenni di Pepo. Many art historians think he was the teacher of&nbsp;the celebrated artist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giotto-di-Bondone">Giotto</a><em>. </em>Only about 15 known works by Cimabue exist today, making <em>Christ Mocked</em> an incredibly rare find. The painting is part of a diptych, which included eight scenes depicting the crucifixion and passion of Christ. Only two other works from the diptych are currently accounted for.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.artnet.com/news/eric-turquin-profile-2085629">Eric Turquin</a>, a Paris-based art specialist, was called in to help authenticate the 13th-century painting. “We could have no doubts on the [Cimabue] attribution since this picture is clearly part of the same [altarpiece],” Turquin told&nbsp;<a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/cimabue-27-million-1690672"><em>Artnet</em></a>’s Naomi Rea in 2019. According to Turquin, the painting had the same dimensions, style and hues as the two other surviving paintings that are part of the diptych.</p>

<p>When <em>Christ Mocked </em>went to auction in 2019, the London-based dealer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gazette-drouot.com/en/article/fabrizio-moretti-the-most-british-of-florentine-dealers/38447">Fabrizio Moretti</a> acquired it with an offer of €24.2 million ($26.8 million)—more than four times the estimate.</p>

<p>“I bought it on behalf of two collectors,” Moretti told ​​the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/arts/design/cimabue-painting-auction.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>’ Scott Reyburn following the auction. “It’s one of the most important old master discoveries in the last 15 years. Cimabue is the beginning of everything. He started modern art. When I held the picture in my hands, I almost cried.”</p>

<p>Soon after the sale, the French government declared <em>Christ Mocked </em>a “national treasure,” which kept it from leaving the country for 30 months. This decision was bad news for Moretti’s collectors. In that time, the Louvre was given the chance to raise the money to purchase the painting. Earlier this month, France’s minister of culture,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/en/Know-us/Organisation-du-ministere/Rima-Abdul-Malak-Minister-of-Culture">Rima Abdul Malak</a>, and the president and director of the Louvre,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/strawberry-painting-smashed-records-now-caught-legal-limbo-france-180980058/">Laurence des Cars</a>, announced their success.</p>

<p>“These acquisitions are the result of an exceptional mobilization of the Louvre museum, which allows to preserve in France works coveted by the greatest museums of the world and to make them accessible to all,” says France’s culture ministry in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/en/Press/Press-releases2/Entrance-of-two-National-Treasures-in-the-collections-of-the-Louvre-Museum">statement</a>.</p>

<p>The woman who originally owned the painting passed away just two days after the sale, leaving her three heirs to inherit her estate. The Louvre will display the newly acquired artwork along with Cimabue’s <a href="https://aflouvre.org/project/restoration-of-cimabues-la-maesta/"><em>Maestà</em></a> at an exhibition opening next spring.</p>

            <p><span>W</span>e all know to be careful about the details we share online, but the information we seek can also be revealing. Search for driving directions, and our location becomes far easier to guess. Check for a password in a trove of compromised data, and we risk leaking it ourselves.</p><p>These situations fuel a key question in cryptography: How can you pull information from a public database without revealing anything about what you’ve accessed? It’s the equivalent of checking out a book from the library without the librarian knowing which one.</p>
      
    <p>Concocting a strategy that solves this problem—known as private information retrieval—is “a very useful building block in a number of privacy-preserving applications,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Wu</a>, a cryptographer at the University of Texas, Austin. Since the 1990s, researchers have chipped away at the question, improving strategies for privately accessing databases. One major goal, still impossible with large databases, is the equivalent of a private Google search, where you can sift through a heap of data anonymously without doing any heavy computational lifting.</p><blockquote>
<p>It would be like having a librarian scour every shelf before returning with your book.</p>

          <p>Now, three researchers have&nbsp;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crafted</a>&nbsp;a long-sought version of private information retrieval and extended it to build a more general privacy strategy. The work, which received a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Paper Award</a>&nbsp;in June at the annual&nbsp;<a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Symposium on Theory of Computing</a>, topples a major theoretical barrier on the way to a truly private search.</p><p>“[This is] something in cryptography that I guess we all wanted but didn’t quite believe that it exists,” said&nbsp;<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinod Vaikuntanathan</a>, a cryptographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the paper. “It is a landmark result.”</p><p>The problem of private database access took shape in the 1990s. At first, researchers assumed that the only solution was to scan the entire database during every search, which would be like having a librarian scour every shelf before returning with your book. After all, if the search skipped any section, the librarian would know that your book is not in that part of the library.</p><p>That approach works well enough at smaller scales, but as the database grows, the time required to scan it grows at least proportionally. As you read from bigger databases—and the internet is a pretty big one—the process becomes prohibitively inefficient.</p>
          <p>In the early 2000s, researchers started to suspect they could dodge the full-scan barrier by “preprocessing” the database. Roughly, this would mean encoding the whole database as a special structure, so the server could answer a query by reading just a small portion of that structure. Careful enough preprocessing could, in theory, mean that a single server hosting information only goes through the process once, by itself, allowing all future users to grab information privately without any more effort.</p><p>For&nbsp;<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/wichs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Wichs</a>, a cryptographer at Northeastern University and a co-author of the new paper, that seemed too good to be true. Around 2011, he started trying to prove that this kind of scheme was impossible. “I was convinced that there’s no way that this could be done,” he said.</p><p>But in 2017, two groups of researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results</a>&nbsp;that changed his mind. They built the first programs that could do this kind of private information retrieval, but they weren’t able to show that the programs were secure. (Cryptographers demonstrate a system’s security by showing that breaking it is as difficult as solving some hard problem. The researchers weren’t able to compare it to a canonical hard problem.)</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="286" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=366&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Goldberg_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>SEARCHING IN THE DARK:</strong> From left: Wei-Kai Lin, Ethan Mook, and Daniel Wichs devised a new method for privately searching large databases. <em>Courtesy of Ian MacLellan and Khoury College of Computer Sciences/Northeastern University.</em></figcaption></figure>
          <p>So even with his hope renewed, Wichs assumed that any version of these programs that was secure was still a long way off. Instead, he and his co-authors—<a href="https://weikailin.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wei-Kai Lin</a>, now at the University of Virginia, and&nbsp;<a href="https://ethanmook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethan Mook</a>, also at Northeastern—worked on problems they thought would be easier, which involved cases where multiple servers host the database.</p><p>In the methods they studied, the information in the database can be transformed into a mathematical expression, which the servers can evaluate to extract the information. The authors figured it might be possible to make that evaluation process more efficient. They toyed with an idea from 2011, when other researchers had found a way to quickly evaluate such an expression by preprocessing it, creating special, compact tables of values that allow you to skip the normal evaluation steps.</p><p>That method didn’t produce any improvements, and the group came close to giving up—until they wondered whether this tool might actually work in the coveted single-server case. Choose a polynomial carefully enough, they saw, and a single server could preprocess it based on the 2011 result—yielding the secure, efficient lookup scheme Wichs had pondered for years. Suddenly, they’d solved the harder problem after all.</p><p>At first, the authors didn’t believe it. “Let’s figure out what’s wrong with this,” Wichs remembered thinking. “We kept trying to figure out where it breaks down.”</p>
          <p>But the solution held: They had really discovered a secure way to preprocess a single-server database so anyone could pull information in secret. “It’s really beyond everything we had hoped for,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://yuvali.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuval Ishai</a>, a cryptographer at the Technion in Israel who was not involved in this work. It’s a result “we were not even brave enough to ask for,” he said.</p><blockquote>
<p>Cryptographers have a long history of results that were initially impractical.</p>
</blockquote><p>After building their secret lookup scheme, the authors turned to the real-world goal of a private internet search, which is more complicated than pulling bits of information from a database, Wichs said. The private lookup scheme on its own does allow for a version of private Google-like searching, but it’s extremely labor-intensive: You run Google’s algorithm yourself and secretly pull data from the internet when necessary. Wichs said a true search, where you send a request and sit back while the server collects the results, is really a target for a broader approach known as homomorphic encryption, which disguises data so that someone else can manipulate it without ever knowing anything about it.</p><p>Typical homomorphic encryption strategies would hit the same snag as private information retrieval, plodding through all the internet’s contents for every search. But using their private lookup method as scaffolding, the authors constructed a new scheme which runs computations that are more like the programs we use every day, pulling information covertly without sweeping the whole internet. That would provide an efficiency boost for internet searches and any programs that need quick access to data.</p>
          <p>While homomorphic encryption is a useful extension of the private lookup scheme, Ishai said, he sees private information retrieval as the more fundamental problem. The authors’ solution is the “magical building block,” and their homomorphic encryption strategy is a natural follow-up.</p><p>For now, neither scheme is practically useful: Preprocessing currently helps at the extremes, when the database size balloons toward infinity. But actually deploying it means those savings can’t materialize, and the process would eat up too much time and storage space.</p><p>Luckily, Vaikuntanathan said, cryptographers have a long history of optimizing results that were initially impractical. If future work can streamline the approach, he believes private lookups from giant databases may be within reach. “We all thought we were kind of stuck there,” he said. “What Daniel’s result gives is hope.”</p><p><em>This article was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cryptographers-devise-an-approach-for-total-search-privacy-20231106/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally published</a>&nbsp;on the</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quanta Abstractions</a><em>&nbsp;blog.&nbsp;</em></p>

AI has, no question, potential to deeply change human experience, but even if it does, that will be mostly due to extreme optimization of existing processes, not likely the development of new modes of living.</p><p>And it's very, very, very far from getting there. All this hype over Generational AI is, sadly, more of a Marketing stunt than anything else. Generational AI don't bring any great innovation in what AI can achieve, only in how people perceive what AI already does. GPT's biggest achievement is to sound coherent, not to leap forward human knowledge in any meaning full way.

Consider that just 8 months after public launch, there have been congressional hearings in the US and a summit in London about whether this technology needs a non-proliferation agreement - and there's just been an emergency that requires jettisoning the project leader. The uncertainty is a bit alarming.<p>What is still very unclear is what removing Altman protects or preserves about the integrity of OpenAI and its work. The unexpected outcome is that by fragmenting OpenAI with firings and resignations, it will spread the core research know how more broadly, so if the firing were over an AI governance/safety concern, it might delay it a couple months, but could have the opposite effect.</p><p>It's not Altman himself, it's the instability in developing the tech that is the big deal. Personally, I suspect it's a bit of a valley palace intrigue gone wrong, where someone supported some of the upstream orchestration that resulted in this outcome, but as far as why this is important, it really is the tech.

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p>Some of us in the GTK team have spent the last month or so exploring the world of linux kernel graphics apis, in particular, dmabufs. We are coming back from this adventure with some frustrations and some successes.</p>
<h3>What is a dmabuf?</h3>
<p>A dmabuf is a memory buffer in kernel space that is identified by a file descriptor. The idea is that you don’t have to copy lots of pixel data around, and instead just pass a file descriptor between kernel subsystems.</p>
<p>Reality is of course more complicated that this rosy picture: the memory may be device memory that is not accessible in the same way as ‘plain’ memory, and there may be more than one buffer (and more than one file descriptor), since graphics data is often split into planes (e.g. RGB and A may be separate, or Y and UV).</p>
<h3>Why are dmabufs useful?</h3>
<p>I’ve already mentioned that we hope to avoid copying the pixel data and feeding it through the GTK compositing pipeline (and with 4k video, that can be quite a bit of data for each frame).</p>
<p>The use cases where this kind of optimization matters are those where frequently changing content is displayed for a long time, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Video players</li>
<li>Virtual machines</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
<li>Screencasting</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>In the best case, we may be able to avoid feeding the data through the compositing pipeline of the compositor as well, if the compositor supports <em>direct scanout</em> and the dmabuf is suitable for it.&nbsp; In particular on mobile systems, this may avoid using the GPU altogether, thereby reducing power consumption.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>GTK has already been using dmabufs since 4.0: When composing a frame, GTK translates all the render nodes (typically several for each widget) into GL commands, sends those to the GPU, and mesa then exports the resulting texture as a dmabuf and attaches it to our Wayland surface.</p>
<p>But if the only thing that is changing in your UI is the video content that is already in a dmabuf, it would be nice to avoid the detour through GL and just hand the data directly to the compositor, by giving it the file descriptor for the the dmabuf.</p>
<p>Wayland has the concept of subsurfaces that let applications defer some of their compositing needs to the compositor: The application attaches a buffer to each (sub)surface, and it is the job of the compositor to combine them all together.</p>
<p>With what is now in git main, GTK will create subsurfaces as-needed in order to pass dmabufs directly to the compositor. We can do this in two different ways: If nothing is drawn on top of the dmabuf (no rounded corners, or overlaid controls), then we can stack the subsurface above the main surface without changing any of the visuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png" alt="" width="525" height="675" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above.png 525w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-above-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 85vw, 525px"></a>This is the ideal case, since it enables the compositor to set up <em>direct</em> <em>scanout, </em>which gives us a zero-copy path from the video decoder to the display.</p>
<p>If there is content that gets drawn on top of the video, we may not be able to get that, but we can still get the benefit of letting the compositor do the compositing, by placing the subsurface with the video <em>below</em> the main surface and poking a translucent hole in the main surface to let it peek through.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png" alt="" width="625" height="675" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below.png 625w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/bbb-below-278x300.png 278w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></a>The round play button is what forces the subsurface to be placed below the main surface here.</p>
<p>GTK picks these modes automatically and transparently for each frame, without the application developer having to do anything. Once that play button appears in a frame, we place the subsurface below, and once the video is clipped by rounded corners, we stop offloading altogether. Of course, the advantages of offloading also disappear.</p>
<p>The graphics offload visualization in the GTK inspector shows these changes as they happen:</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-9664-1" width="840" height="660" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/webm" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm?_=1"><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm">https://blog.gtk.org/files/2023/11/offload-visualization.webm</a></video></p>
<p>Initially, the camera stream is not offloaded because the rounded corners clip it. The magenta outline indicates that the stream is offloaded to a subsurface below the main surface (because the video controls are on top of it). The golden outline indicates that the subsurface is above the main surface.</p>
<h3>How do you use this?</h3>
<p>GTK 4.14 will introduce a <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.GraphicsOffload.html">GtkGraphicsOffload</a> widget, whose only job it is to give a hint that GTK should try to <em>offload</em> the content of its child widget by attaching it to a subsurface instead of letting GSK process it like it usually does.</p>
<p>To create suitable content for offloading, the new <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4/class.DmabufTextureBuilder.html">GdkDmabufTextureBuilder</a> wraps dmabufs in GdkTexture objects. Typical sources for dmabufs are pipewire, video4linux or gstreamer. The dmabuf support in gstreamer will be much more solid in the upcoming 1.24 release.</p>
<p>When testing this code, we used the GtkMediaStream implementation for pipewire by Georges Basile Stavracas Neto that can be found in <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pipewire-media-stream">pipewire-media-stream</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libmks/">libmks</a> by Christian Hergert and Bilal Elmoussaoui.</p>
<h3>What are the limitations?</h3>
<p>At the moment, graphics offload will only work with Wayland on Linux. There is some hope that we may be able to implement similar things on MacOS, but for now, this is Wayland-only. It also depends on the content being in dmabufs.</p>
<p>Applications that want to take advantage of this need to play along and avoid doing things that interfere with the use of subsurfaces, such as rounding the corners of the video content. The <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.GraphicsOffload.html">GtkGraphicsOffload</a> docs have more details for developers on constraints and how to debug problems with graphics offload.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The GTK 4.14 release will have some interesting new capabilities for media playback. You can try it now, with the just-released 4.13.3 snapshot.</p>
<p>Please try it and let us know what does and doesn’t work for you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When people think of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/28/ftc-must-free-american-workers-consumers-entrepreneurs-non-compete-agreements-politics-labor-john-arensmeyer/" target="_self" rel="">noncompete agreements</a>, they usually think of corporate executives with knowledge of prized trade secrets, whose lavish pay packages often come with a condition that if they quit or get fired, they <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/23/doctors-hospitals-noncompete-ftc-proposed-rule/" target="_self" rel="">can’t go work for an industry rival</a>.</p><div>



<p>More and more, though, employers are requiring regular workers to sign those deals. About 1 in 5 American workers, nearly 30 million people, are bound by noncompete agreements,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/non-compete-clause-rulemaking#:~:text=Overview,from%20pursuing%20better%20employment%20opportunities." target="_self" rel="">according</a>&nbsp;to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>Horror stories about companies using noncompete agreements to trap workers in middling jobs or punish them for taking their skills elsewhere for better pay prompted New York legislators to pass a bill last June that would ban noncompete agreements.</p>



<p>Five months later, though, Gov. Kathy Hochul hasn’t said whether she intends to sign the legislation, which has come under a fierce attack by business groups.</p>



<p>The Public Policy Institute of the State of New York, an affiliate of the Business Council of New York, launched a $1 million ad campaign last month in an attempt to thwart the legislation. Some of the loudest opposition has come from Wall Street, where firms see noncompete agreements as important to protecting investment strategies and keeping highly-paid workers from walking out with valuable inside information.</p>



<p>Supporters of the ban say <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/15/heres-what-chros-actually-think-about-the-potential-ban-on-noncompetes/" target="_self" rel="">it would help people</a> like lighting designer Richard Tatum, a New York City resident who had signed a noncompete agreement and spent a year fighting a former employer in court after they sued him for getting another job shortly after they laid him off in 2009. He had a family to support and wasn’t moving or leaving his industry, he said.</p>



<p>“I felt I had no choice but to fight,” said Tatum, who now works for an event production company. He said he understands being fired during the financial meltdown. “But the fact that I had to spend a year fighting off my former employer was just wrong.”</p>



<p>A handful of states, including California, already ban noncompete agreements. Other states, including Minnesota and Oklahoma, have laws that void noncompete agreements if a person is laid off.</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-technology-politics-business-9fb699837e8bf8ecd9c70dcf27699dcf" target="_self" rel="">proposed a regulation</a>&nbsp;in January banning noncompete agreements, arguing that they hurt workers. President Joe Biden said at the time that the agreements “block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking better jobs and getting better pay and benefits in the same field.”</p>



<p>If signed by Hochul, a Democrat, the New York bill would only affect noncompete agreements signed after the law goes into effect. The legislation would not restrict nondisclosure agreements.</p>



<p>Hochul’s office said she’s still reviewing the legislation. She has until the end of the year to make a decision.</p>



<p>Business groups say the ban shouldn’t apply to certain industries and job levels, like top executives or partners in tech companies or law firms. They also said it could push employers to ship jobs to states like Florida and Texas that do not have similar laws.</p>



<p>“This bill poses a serious risk to innovation and job growth and, if enacted, could unravel the delicate balance between protecting business investment and fostering a competitive job market,” said Paul Zuber, the executive vice president for the Business Council of New York.</p>



<p>Advocates for the bill argue that striking noncompete agreements will actually be good for innovation.</p>



<p>State Senator Sean Ryan, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, pointed to Silicon Valley in California, a hub for tech companies.</p>



<p>“All the flexibility you see in that economy would have been dashed had they made it so you couldn’t go work for an emerging tech company,” Ryan said.</p>



<p>The bill, he added, would give employees more flexibility and agency when considering other employment opportunities.</p>



<p>Tatum, the lighting designer who reached a legal settlement with his former employer to keep working in his profession, said, “I just don’t think anyone like me should have to go through that again.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to the CEO Daily newsletter to get the CEO perspective on the biggest headlines in business. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/ceo-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=ceo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-wrapper" tabindex="-1">
            


<p>Welcome back, calibre users. It has been a year since calibre
6.0. The headline new feature is <b>notes for authors, series, tags, etc.</b>
calibre can now store notes with links, images and rich text formatting associated
with every author, series, publisher, tag, etc. The notes are searchable, browseable,
linkable and can be exported as standalone HTML files.
</p>

<p>To use the new <i>Notes</i> feature, right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on 
an author or tag in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and <i>Edit notes</i>.
</p>

<ul id="feature-list">
    <li>
        <span>Category notes</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            You can store notes associated with an author, publisher, series, et cetera,
            in your calibre library. To do so right click (or <code>Ctrl+click</code> on macOS) on
            an author or tag name in the <i>Tag browser</i> or <i>Book details</i> panel and
            choose <i>Edit notes</i>. Once you have created the note, a little pencil icon
            will show next to the name in the book details panel. You can click the
            pencil to view the note.
            </p>

            <p>
            You can browse and search through all notes in your library by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+N</code>
            or adding the <i>Browse notes</i> tool to the toolbar via <i>Preferences-&gt;Toolbars &amp; menus</i>.
            </p>

        <span>Audio EPUB books in the E-book viewer</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre has gained support for so called "Audio EPUB" books. Typically,
            these are books that have a pre-recorded voice reading the text. Freely downloadable
            examples of such books are available at: <a title="Read Beyond books" href="https://www.readbeyond.it/ebooks.html">Read Beyond books</a>.
            When reading such a book, clicking the <i>Read Aloud</i> button in the
            viewer will automatically use the embedded audio in the book to read the text
            aloud, marking the currently read sentence and showing progress. Note that
            this may not work on Linux because of issues with patented codecs, but works on
            Windows and macOS.
            </p>

        </div>

    </li>

    <li>
        <span>Store extra data files associated with any book</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            A long requested feature in calibre, was the ability to store "data" files associated with a book
            and have calibre manage them automatically. This is finally available. Extra data files can be
            added to a book by selecting the book, right clicking the <i>Add books</i> button and choosing
            <i>Add data files to selected book records</i>. You can also manage the data files by right clicking
            the <i>Edit metadata</i> button and choosing <i>Manage data files</i>. The data files are simple
            files stored in the <code>data</code> sub-folder inside the book's folder. A common use for such
            files is storing alternate covers or supplementary material associated with the book.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Managing data files" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/data-files.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/data-files-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>

        </div>
    </li>


    <li>
        <span>calibre's own private Recycle Bin</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre now has its own private Recycle Bin instead of using the
            operating system one. This means that it is now possible undo the
            deletion of a book with a single click, restoring all its files and
            metadata automatically. Indeed when you delete a book calibre will
            show an unobtrusive popup offering to undo the deletion for a few
            seconds. You can also browse recently deleted books by right
            clicking the <i>Remove books</i> button and choosing <i>Restore
            recently deleted</i>.
            </p>

            <p><a title="Restoring recently deleted books" href="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/undo-delete.webp"><img src="https://download.calibre-ebook.com/images/4/undo-delete-thumb.webp" alt="First"></a>
            </p>

        </div>
    </li>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>This is an appropriate time to throw out a big thank you to the calibre
community who have contributed selflessly of their energy and enthusiasm —
without which many of the features above would never have seen the light of
day.</p>

<p>Note that some of these features were actually introduced during the
lifetime of the 6.x series. This document describes new features as compared
to 6.0</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content--body"><div> <p>Ilya Sutskever, head bowed, is deep in thought. His arms are spread wide and his fingers are splayed on the tabletop like a concert pianist about to play his first notes. We sit in silence.</p>  <p>I’ve come to meet Sutskever, OpenAI’s cofounder and chief scientist, in his company’s&nbsp;unmarked office building on an unremarkable street in the Mission District of San Francisco to hear what’s next for the world-tilting technology he has had a big hand in bringing about. I also want to know what’s next for him—in particular, why building the next generation of his company’s flagship generative models is no longer the focus of his work.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Instead of building the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/14/1069823/gpt-4-is-bigger-and-better-chatgpt-openai/">next GPT</a> or <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1049061/dalle-openai-gpt3-ai-agi-multimodal-image-generation/">image maker DALL-E</a>, Sutskever tells me his new priority is to figure out how to stop an artificial superintelligence (a hypothetical future technology he sees coming with the foresight of a true believer) from going rogue.</p>  <p>Sutskever tells me a lot of other things too. He thinks <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/">ChatGPT</a> just might be conscious (if you squint). He thinks the world needs to wake up to the true power of the technology his company and others are racing to create. And he thinks some humans will one day choose to merge with machines.</p> 
 <p>A lot of what Sutskever says is wild. But not nearly as wild as it would have sounded just one or two years ago. As he tells me himself, ChatGPT has already rewritten a lot of people’s expectations about what’s coming, turning “will never happen” into “will happen faster than you think.”</p>  <p>“It’s important to talk about where it’s all headed,” he says, before predicting the development of artificial general intelligence (by which he means machines as smart as humans) as if it were as sure a bet as another iPhone: “At some point we really will have AGI. Maybe OpenAI will build it. Maybe some other company will build it.”</p> 
 <p>Since the release of its sudden <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/08/1068068/chatgpt-is-everywhere-heres-where-it-came-from">surprise hit, ChatGPT</a>, last November, the buzz around OpenAI has been astonishing, even in an industry known for hype. No one can get enough of this nerdy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/20/technology/openai-artifical-intelligence-value.html">$80 billion startup</a>. World leaders seek (and get) private audiences. Its clunky product names pop up in casual conversation.&nbsp;</p>  <p>OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, spent a good part of the summer on a weeks-long outreach tour, glad-handing politicians and speaking to packed auditoriums around the world. But Sutskever is much less of a public figure, and he doesn’t give a lot of interviews.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He is deliberate and methodical when he talks. There are long pauses when he thinks about what he wants to say and how to say it, turning questions over like puzzles he needs to solve. He does not seem interested in talking about himself. “I lead a very simple life,” he says. “I go to work; then I go home. I don’t do much else. There are a lot of social activities one could engage in, lots of events one could go to. Which I don’t.”</p>  <p>But when we talk about AI, and the epochal risks and rewards he sees down the line, vistas open up: “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering. There will be a before and an after.”</p> </div><div> <h3>Better and better and better</h3>  <p>In a world without OpenAI, Sutskever would still get an entry in the annals of AI history. An Israeli-Canadian, he was born in Soviet Russia but brought up in Jerusalem from the age of five (he still speaks Russian and Hebrew as well as English). He then moved to Canada to study at the University of Toronto with Geoffrey Hinton, the AI pioneer who went public with his <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/02/1072528/geoffrey-hinton-google-why-scared-ai/">fears about the technology he helped invent</a> earlier this year. (Sutskever didn’t want to comment on Hinton’s pronouncements, but his new focus on rogue superintelligence suggests they’re on the same page.)</p>  <p>Hinton would later share the Turing Award with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio for their work on neural networks. But when Sutskever joined him in the early 2000s, most AI researchers believed neural networks were a dead end. Hinton was an exception. He was already training tiny models that could produce short strings of text one character at a time, says Sutskever: “It was the beginning of generative AI right there. It was really cool—it just wasn’t very good.”</p>  <p>Sutskever was fascinated with brains: how they learned and how that process might be re-created, or at least mimicked, in machines. Like Hinton, he saw the potential of neural networks and the trial-and-error technique Hinton used to train them, called deep learning. “It kept getting better and better and better,” says Sutskever.</p>  <p>In 2012 Sutskever, Hinton, and another of Hinton’s graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky, built a neural network called AlexNet that they trained to identify objects in photos far better than any other software around at the time. It was deep learning’s Big Bang moment.</p> 

 <p>After many years of false starts, they had showed that neural networks were amazingly effective at pattern recognition after all. You just needed more data than most researchers had seen before (in this case, a million images from the ImageNet data set that Princeton University researcher <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/09/3988/put-humans-at-the-center-of-ai/">Fei-Fei Li</a> had been building since 2006) and an eye-watering amount of computer power.</p>  <p>The step change in compute came from a new kind of chip called a graphics processing unit (GPU), made by Nvidia. GPUs were designed to be lightning quick at throwing fast-moving video-game visuals onto screens. But the calculations that GPUs are good at—multiplying massive grids of numbers—happened to look a lot like the calculations needed to train neural networks.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nvidia is now a trillion-dollar company. At the time it was desperate to find applications for its niche new hardware. “When you invent a new technology, you have to be receptive to crazy ideas,” says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “My state of mind was always to be looking for something quirky, and the idea that neural networks would transform computer science—that was an outrageously quirky idea.”</p>  <p>Huang says that Nvidia sent the Toronto team a couple of GPUs to try when they were working on AlexNet. But they wanted the newest version, a chip called the GTX 580 that was fast selling out in stores. According to Huang, Sutskever drove across the border from Toronto to New York to buy some. “People were lined up around the corner,” says Huang. “I don’t know how he did it—I’m pretty sure you were only allowed to buy one each; we had a very strict policy of one GPU per gamer—but he apparently filled a trunk with them. That trunk full of GTX 580s changed the world.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>It’s a great story—it just might not be true. Sutskever insists he bought those first GPUs online. But such myth-making is commonplace in this buzzy business. Sutskever himself is more humble: “I thought, like, if I could make even an ounce of real progress, I would consider that a success,” he says. “The real-world impact felt so far away because computers were so puny back then.”</p>  <p>After the success of AlexNet, Google came knocking. It acquired Hinton’s spin-off company DNNresearch and hired Sutskever. At Google Sutskever showed that deep learning’s powers of pattern recognition could be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3215.pdf">applied to sequences of data</a>, such as words and sentences, as well as images. “Ilya has always been interested in language,” says Sutskever’s former colleague Jeff Dean, who is now Google’s chief scientist: “We’ve had great discussions over the years. Ilya has a strong intuitive sense about where things might go.”</p>  <p>But Sutskever didn’t remain at Google for long. In 2014, he was recruited to become a cofounder of OpenAI. Backed by $1 billion (from Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Y Combinator, and others) plus a massive dose of Silicon Valley swagger, the new company set its sights from the start on developing AGI, a prospect that few took seriously at the time.</p>  <p>With Sutskever on board, the brains behind the bucks, the swagger was understandable. Up until then, he had been on a roll, getting more and more out of neural networks. His reputation preceded him, making him a major catch, says Dalton Caldwell, managing director of investments at Y Combinator.</p> 
 <p>“I remember Sam [Altman] referring to Ilya as one of the most respected researchers in the world,” says Caldwell. “He thought that Ilya would be able to attract a lot of top AI talent. He even mentioned that Yoshua Bengio, one of the world's top AI experts, believed that it would be unlikely to find a better candidate than Ilya to be OpenAI's lead scientist."</p>  <p>And yet at first OpenAI floundered. “There was a period of time when we were starting OpenAI when I wasn’t exactly sure how the progress would continue,” says Sutskever. “But I had one very explicit belief, which is: one doesn’t bet against deep learning. Somehow, every time you run into an obstacle, within six months or a year researchers find a way around it.”</p> 
 <p>His faith paid off. The first of OpenAI’s GPT large language models (the name stands for “generative pretrained transformer”) appeared in 2016. Then came GPT-2 and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">GPT-3</a>. Then <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-armchair-future-ai-openai-deep-learning-nlp-gpt3-computer-vision-common-sense/">DALL-E</a>, the striking text-to-image model. Nobody was building anything as good. With each release, OpenAI raised the bar for what was thought possible.&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Managing expectations</h3>  <p>Last November, OpenAI released a free-to-use chatbot that repackaged some of its existing tech. It reset the agenda of the entire industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>At the time, OpenAI had no idea what it was putting out. Expectations inside the company couldn’t have been lower, says Sutskever: “I will admit, to my slight embarrassment—I don’t know if I should, but what the hell, it is true—when we made ChatGPT, I didn’t know if it was any good. When you asked it a factual question, it gave you a wrong answer. I thought it was going to be so unimpressive that people would say, ‘Why are you doing this? This is so boring!’”</p>  <p>The draw was the convenience, says Sutskever. The large language model under ChatGPT’s hood had been around for months. But wrapping that in an accessible interface and giving it away for free made billions of people aware for the first time of what OpenAI and others were building.</p>  <p>“That first-time experience is what hooked people,” says Sutskever. “The first time you use it, I think it’s almost a spiritual experience. You go, ‘Oh my God, this computer seems to understand.’”</p>  <p>OpenAI amassed 100 million users in less than two months, many of them dazzled by this stunning new toy. Aaron Levie, CEO of the storage firm Box, summed up the vibe in the week after launch when he tweeted: “ChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.”&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>That wonder collapses as soon as ChatGPT says something stupid. But by then it doesn’t matter. That glimpse of what was possible is enough, says Sutskever. ChatGPT changed people’s horizons.</p>  <p>“AGI stopped being a dirty word in the field of machine learning,” he says. “That was a big change. The attitude that people have taken historically has been: AI doesn’t work, every step is very difficult, you have to fight for every ounce of progress. And when people came with big proclamations about AGI, researchers would say, ‘What are you talking about? This doesn’t work, that doesn’t work. There are so many problems.’ But with ChatGPT it started to feel different.”</p>  <p>And that shift only started to happen a year ago? “It happened because of ChatGPT,” he says. “ChatGPT has allowed machine-learning researchers to dream.”</p>  <p>Evangelists from the start, OpenAI’s scientists have been stoking those dreams with blog posts and speaking tours. And it is working: “We have people now talking about how far AI will go—people who talk about AGI, or superintelligence.” And it’s not just researchers. “Governments are talking about it,” says Sutskever. “It’s crazy.”</p> 
</div><div> <h3>Incredible things</h3>  <p>Sutskever insists all this talk about a technology that does not yet (and may never) exist is a good thing, because it makes more people aware of a future that he already takes for granted.</p>  <p>“You can do so many amazing things with AGI, incredible things: automate health care, make it a thousand times cheaper and a thousand times better, cure so many diseases, actually solve global warming,” he says. “But there are many who are concerned: ‘My God, will AI companies succeed in managing this tremendous technology?’”</p>  <p>Presented this way, AGI sounds more like a wish-granting genie than real-world prospect. Few would say no to saving lives and solving climate change. But the problem with a technology that doesn’t exist is that you can say whatever you want about it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is Sutskever really talking about when he talks about AGI? “AGI is not meant to be a scientific term,” he says. “It’s meant to be a useful threshold, a point of reference.”</p>  <p>“It is the idea—” he starts, then stops. “It’s the point at which AI is so smart that if a person can do some task, then AI can do it too. At that point you can say you have AGI.”</p>  <p>People may be talking about it, but AGI remains one of the field’s most <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/15/1010461/artificial-general-intelligence-robots-ai-agi-deepmind-google-openai/">controversial ideas</a>. Few take its development as a given. Many researchers believe that major conceptual breakthroughs are needed before we see anything like what Sutskever has in mind—and some believe we never will.&nbsp;</p>  <p>And yet it’s a vision that has driven him from the start. “I’ve always been inspired and motivated by the idea,” says Sutskever. “It wasn’t called AGI back then, but you know, like, having a neural network do everything. I didn’t always believe that they could. But it was the mountain to climb.”</p>  <p>He draws a parallel between the way that neural networks and brains operate. Both take in data, aggregate signals from that data, and then—based on some simple process (math in neural networks, chemicals and bioelectricity in brains)—propagate them or not. It’s a massive simplification, but the principle stands.</p> </div><div> <p>“If you believe that—if you allow yourself to believe that—then there are a lot of interesting implications,” says Sutskever. “The main implication is that if you have a very big artificial neural network, it should do a lot of things. In particular, if the human brain can do something, then a big artificial neural network could do something similar too.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Everything follows if you take this realization seriously enough,” he says. “And a big fraction of my work can be explained by that.”</p>  <p>While we’re talking about brains, I want to ask about one of Sutskever’s posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Sutskever’s feed reads like a scroll of aphorisms: “If you value intelligence above all other human qualities, you’re gonna have a bad time”; “Empathy in life and business is underrated”; “The perfect has destroyed much perfectly good good.”</p>  <p>In February 2022 he <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1491554478243258368?lang=en">posted</a>, “it may be that today’s large neural networks are slightly conscious” (to which Murray Shanahan, principal scientist at Google DeepMind and a professor at Imperial College London, as well as the scientific advisor on the movie <em>Ex Machina</em>, replied: “... in the same sense that it may be that a large field of wheat is slightly pasta”).</p>  <p>Sutskever laughs when I bring it up. Was he trolling? He wasn’t. “Are you familiar with the concept of a Boltzmann brain?” he asks.</p>  <p>He's referring to a (tongue-in-cheek) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain">thought experiment</a> in quantum mechanics named after the 19th-century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, in which random thermodynamic fluctuations in the universe are imagined to cause brains to pop in and out of existence.</p>  <p>“I feel like right now these language models are kind of like a Boltzmann brain,” says Sutskever. “You start talking to it, you talk for a bit; then you finish talking, and the brain kind of—” He makes a disappearing motion with his hands. Poof—bye-bye, brain.</p>  <p>You’re saying that while the neural network is active—while it’s firing, so to speak—there’s something there? I ask.</p> </div><div> <p>“I think it might be,” he says. “I don’t know for sure, but it’s a possibility that’s very hard to argue against. But who knows what’s going on, right?”</p>  <h3>AI but not as we know it</h3>  <p>While others wrestle with the idea of machines that can match human smarts, Sutskever is preparing for machines that can <em>outmatch</em> us. He calls this artificial superintelligence: “They’ll see things more deeply. They’ll see things we don’t see.”</p>  <p>Again, I have a hard time grasping what this really means. Human intelligence is our benchmark for what intelligence is. What does Sutskever mean by smarter-than-human intelligence?</p>  <p>“We’ve seen an example of a very narrow superintelligence in AlphaGo,” he says. In 2016, DeepMind’s board-game-playing AI beat Lee Sedol, one of the best Go players in the world, 4–1 in a five-game match. “It figured out how to play Go in ways that are different from what humanity collectively had developed over thousands of years,” says Sutskever. “It came up with new ideas.”</p>  <p>Sutskever points to AlphaGo’s infamous Move 37. In its second game against Sedol, the AI made a move that flummoxed commentators. They thought AlphaGo had screwed up. In fact, it had played a winning move that nobody had ever seen before in the history of the game. “Imagine that level of insight, but across everything,” says Sutskever.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It’s this train of thought that has led Sutskever to make the biggest shift of his career. Together with Jan Leike, a fellow scientist at OpenAI, he has set up a team that will focus on what they call <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment">superalignment</a>. Alignment is jargon that means making AI models do what you want and nothing more. Superalignment is OpenAI’s term for alignment applied to superintelligence.</p>  <p>The goal is to come up with a set of fail-safe procedures for building and controlling this future technology. OpenAI says it will allocate a fifth of its vast computing resources to the problem and solve it in four years.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Existing alignment methods won’t work for models smarter than humans because they fundamentally assume that humans can reliably evaluate what AI systems are doing,” says Leike. “As AI systems become more capable, they will take on harder tasks.” And that—the idea goes—will make it harder for humans to assess them. “In forming the superalignment team with Ilya, we’ve set out to solve these future alignment challenges,” he says.</p> </div><div><p>“It’s super important to not only focus on the potential opportunities of large language models, but also the risks and downsides,” says Dean, Google’s chief scientist.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The company announced the project in July with typical fanfare. But for some it was yet more fantasy. OpenAI’s post on Twitter attracted scorn from prominent critics of Big Tech, including Abeba Birhane, who works on AI accountability at Mozilla (“so many grandiose sounding yet vacuous words in one blog post”); Timnit Gebru, cofounder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (“Imagine ChatGPT even more ‘super aligned’ with OpenAI techbros. *shudder*”); and Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face (“My alignment is bigger than yours”). It’s true that these are familiar voices of dissent. But it’s a strong reminder that where some see OpenAI leading from the front, others see it leaning in from the fringes.</p>  <p>But, for Sutskever, superalignment is the inevitable next step. “It’s an unsolved problem,” he says. It’s also a problem that he thinks not enough core machine-learning researchers, like himself, are working on. “I’m doing it for my own self-interest,” he says. “It’s obviously important that any superintelligence anyone builds does not go rogue. Obviously.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>The work on superalignment has only just started. It will require broad changes across research institutions, says Sutskever.&nbsp;But he has an exemplar in mind for the safeguards he wants to design: a machine that looks upon people the way parents look on their children. “In my opinion, this is the gold standard,” he says. “It is a generally true statement that people really care about children.” (Does he have children? “No, but I want to,” he says.)</p>  <p>My time with Sutskever is almost up, and I figure we’re done. But he’s on a roll and has one more thought to share—one I don't see coming.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Once you overcome the challenge of rogue AI, then what? Is there even room for human beings in a world with smarter AIs?” he says.</p>  <p>“One possibility—something that may be crazy by today’s standards but will not be so crazy by future standards—is that many people will choose to become part AI.” Sutskever is saying this could be how&nbsp;humans try to keep up. “At first, only the most daring, adventurous people will try to do it. Maybe others will follow. Or not.”</p>  <p>Wait, what? He’s getting up to leave. Would he do it? I ask. Would he be one of the first? “The first? I don’t know,” he says. “But it’s something I think about. The true answer is: maybe.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>And with that galaxy-brained mic drop, he stands and walks out of the room. “Really good to see you again,” he says as he goes.&nbsp; </p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>We <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> our “capped profit” structure in 2019, about three years after <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">founding</a> the original OpenAI Nonprofit.</p><p>Since the beginning, we have believed that powerful AI, culminating in AGI—meaning a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work—has the potential to reshape society and bring tremendous benefits, along with risks that must be safely addressed. The increasing capabilities of present day systems mean it’s more important than ever for OpenAI and other AI companies to share the principles, economic mechanisms, and governance models that are core to our respective missions and operations.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="overview" data-heading=""><p><h2>Overview</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>We founded the OpenAI Nonprofit in late 2015 with the goal of building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity. A project like this might previously have been the provenance of one or multiple governments—a humanity-scale endeavor pursuing broad benefit for humankind.</p><p>Seeing no clear path in the public sector, and given the success of other ambitious projects in private industry (e.g., SpaceX, Cruise, and others), we decided to pursue this project through private means bound by strong commitments to the public good. We initially believed a 501(c)(3) would be the most effective vehicle to direct the development of safe and broadly beneficial AGI while remaining unencumbered by profit incentives. We committed to publishing our research and data in cases where we felt it was safe to do so and would benefit the public.</p><p>We always suspected that our project would be capital intensive, which is why we launched with the goal of $1 billion in donation commitments. Yet over the years, OpenAI’s Nonprofit received approximately $130.5 million in total donations, which funded the Nonprofit’s operations and its initial exploratory work in deep learning, safety, and alignment.</p><p>It became increasingly clear that donations alone would not scale with the cost of computational power and talent required to push core research forward, jeopardizing our mission. So we devised a structure to preserve our Nonprofit’s core mission, governance, and oversight while enabling us to raise the capital for our mission:</p><ul><li>The OpenAI Nonprofit would remain intact, with its board continuing as the overall governing body for all OpenAI activities.<br></li><li>A new for-profit subsidiary would be formed, capable of issuing equity to raise capital and hire world class talent, but still at the direction of the Nonprofit. Employees working on for-profit initiatives were transitioned over to the new subsidiary. <br></li><li>The for-profit would be legally bound to pursue the Nonprofit’s mission, and carry out that mission by engaging in research, development, commercialization and other core operations. Throughout, OpenAI’s guiding principles of safety and broad benefit would be central to its approach.<br></li><li>The for-profit’s equity structure would have caps that limit the maximum financial returns to investors and employees to incentivize them to research, develop, and deploy AGI in a way that balances commerciality with safety and sustainability, rather than focusing on pure profit-maximization. <br></li><li>The Nonprofit would govern and oversee all such activities through its board in addition to its own operations. It would also continue to undertake a wide range of charitable initiatives, such as sponsoring a comprehensive <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/basic-income" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">basic income study, </a>supporting <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpts-are-gpts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economic impact research</a>, and experimenting with education-centered programs like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars-2021-final-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAI Scholars</a>. Over the years, the Nonprofit also supported a number of other public charities focused on technology, economic impact and justice, including the Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Index Fund, Black Girls Code, and the ACLU Foundation.</li></ul><p>In that way, the Nonprofit would remain central to our structure and control the development of AGI, and the for-profit would be tasked with marshaling the resources to achieve this while remaining duty-bound to pursue OpenAI’s core mission. The primacy of the mission above all is encoded in the operating agreement of the for-profit, which every investor and employee is subject to:<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><figure><p><img src="https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=10&amp;height=10&amp;quality=50" width="1940" height="926" alt="OpenAI investor disclaimer" loading="lazy" data-nuxt-img="" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=400 400w, https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=800 800w, https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=1000 1000w, https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=1400 1400w, https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=2000 2000w, https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=2600 2600w, https://images.openai.com/blob/142770fb-3df2-45d9-9ee3-7aa069acada1/image1.png?trim=0,0,0,0&amp;width=3200 3200w" aria-hidden="false"></p><figcaption><!--[--><!--]--></figcaption></figure></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="the-structure-in-more-detail" data-heading=""><p><h2>The structure in more detail</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>While investors typically seek financial returns, we saw a path to aligning their motives with our mission. We achieved this innovation with a few key economic and governance provisions:</p><ul><li>First, the for-profit subsidiary is fully controlled by the OpenAI Nonprofit. We enacted this by having the Nonprofit wholly own and control a manager entity (OpenAI GP LLC) that has the power to control and govern the for-profit subsidiary.</li><li>Second, because the board is still the board of a Nonprofit, each director must perform their fiduciary duties in furtherance of its mission—safe AGI that is broadly beneficial. While the for-profit subsidiary is permitted to make and distribute profit, it is subject to this mission. The Nonprofit’s principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors.</li><li>Third, the board remains majority independent. Independent directors do not hold equity in OpenAI. Even OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, does not hold equity directly. His only interest is indirectly through a Y Combinator investment fund that made a small investment in OpenAI before he was full-time.</li><li>Fourth, profit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped. All residual value created above and beyond the cap will be returned to the Nonprofit for the benefit of humanity.</li><li>Fifth, the board determines when we've attained AGI. Again, by AGI we mean a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work. Such a system is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI technology.<br></li></ul></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><figure><p><img src="https://images.openai.com/blob/f3e12a69-e4a7-4fe2-a4a5-c63b61f26ab7/org-structure.svg?width=10&amp;height=10&amp;quality=50" width="796" height="551" alt="OpenAI Org Structure" loading="lazy" data-nuxt-img="" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, (max-width: 1280px) 100vw, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 100vw" aria-hidden="false"></p><figcaption><!--[--><!--]--></figcaption></figure></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>We strive to preserve these core governance and economic components of our structure when exploring opportunities to accelerate our work.

We subsequently <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">extended</a> our partnership, expanding both Microsoft’s total investment as well as the scale and breadth of our commercial and supercomputing collaborations.</p><p>While our partnership with Microsoft includes a multibillion dollar investment, OpenAI remains an entirely independent company governed by the OpenAI Nonprofit.

From the beginning, they accepted our capped equity offer and our request to leave AGI technologies and governance for the Nonprofit and the rest of humanity. They have also worked with us to create and refine our joint safety board that reviews our systems before they are deployed.

As far as subjective understanding, we're getting into the nature of consciousness territory, but if it can perform the same tasks, it doesn't really impact the value.
