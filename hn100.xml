<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>Sideloading has been a hot topic for the last decade. Most recently, Google has <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/25/android-apps-developer-verification/">announced</a> further restrictions on the practice in Android. Many hundreds of comment threads have discussed these changes over the years. One point in particular is always made: “I should be able to run whatever code I want on hardware I own”. I agree entirely with this point, but within the context of this discussion it’s moot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I should be able to run whatever code I want on hardware I own”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Google restricts your ability to install certain applications they aren’t constraining what you can do with the hardware you own, they are constraining what you can do using the software they provide with said hardware. It’s through this control of the operating system that Google is exerting control, not at the hardware layer. You often don’t have full access to the hardware either and building new operating systems to run on mobile hardware is impossible, or at least much harder than it should be. This is a separate, and I think more fruitful, point to make. Apple is a better case study than Google here. Apple’s success with iOS partially derives from the tight integration of hardware and software. An iPhone without iOS is a very different product to what we understand an iPhone to be. Forcing Apple to change core tenets of iOS by legislative means would undermine what made the iPhone successful.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t take away from this that I am some stalwart defender of the two behemoths Apple and Google, far from it. However, our critique shouldn’t be of the restrictions in place in the operating systems they provide – rather, it should focus on the ability to truly run any code we want on hardware we own. In this context this would mean having the ability and documentation to build or install alternative operating systems on this hardware. It should be possible to run Android on an iPhone and manufacturers should be required by law to provide enough technical support and documentation to make the development of new operating systems possible. If you want to play Playstation games on your PS5 you must suffer Sony’s restrictions, but if you want to convert your PS5 into an emulator running Linux that should be possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lot of ink is spent on the "monoliths vs. microservices" debate, but the real issue behind
this debate is about whether distributed system architecture is worth the developer time and
cost overheads.  By thinking about the real operational considerations of our systems, we can
get some insight into whether we actually need distributed systems for most things.</p>
<p>We have all gotten so familiar with virtualization and abstractions between our software
and the servers that run it.  These days, "serverless" computing is all the rage, and even
"bare metal" is a class of virtual machine.  However, every piece of software runs on a
server.  Since we now live in a world of virtualization, most of these servers are a lot
bigger and a lot cheaper than we actually think.</p>
<h2 id="meet-your-server">Meet Your Server</h2>
<figure><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Microsoft-Azure-HPC-HBv3-Hosting-Node-2.jpg#center" width="70%">
</figure>

<p>This is a picture of a server used by Microsoft Azure with AMD CPUs.  Starting from the left,
the big metal fixture on the left (with the copper tubes) is a heatsink, and the metal boxes
that the copper tubes are attached to are heat exchangers on each CPU.  The CPUs are AMD's
third generation server CPU, each of which has the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>64 cores</li>
<li>128 threads</li>
<li>~2-2.5 GHz clock</li>
<li>Cores capable of 4-6 instructions per clock cycle</li>
<li>256 MB of L3 cache</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, this server has 128 cores with 256 simultaneous threads.  With all of the cores working
together, this server is capable of 4 TFLOPs of peak double precision computing performance. This
server would sit at the top of the top500 supercomputer list in early 2000. It would take until
2007 for this server to leave the top500 list.  Each CPU core is substantially more powerful than a
single core from 10 years ago, and boasts a much wider computation pipeline.</p>
<p>Above and below each CPU is the memory: 16 slots of DDR4-3200 RAM per socket.  The largest
capacity "cost effective" DIMMs today are 64 GB.  Populated cost-efficiently, this server can hold
<strong>1 TB</strong> of memory.  Populated with specialized high-capacity DIMMs (which are generally slower
than the smaller DIMMs), this server supports up to <strong>8 TB</strong> of memory total.  At DDR4-3200, with
a total of 16 memory channels, this server will likely see ~200 Gbps of memory throughput across
all of its cores.</p>
<p>In terms of I/O, each CPU offers 64 PCIe gen 4 lanes.  With 128 PCIe lanes total, this server is
capable of supporting 30 NVMe SSDs plus a network card.  Typical configurations you can buy will
offer slots for around 16 SSDs or disks. The final thing I wanted to point out in this picture is
in the top right, the network card.  This server is likely equipped with a 50-100 Gbps network
connection.</p>
<h4 id="the-capabilities-of-one-server">The Capabilities of One Server</h4>
<p>One server today is capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~gallatin/talks/euro2021.pdf">Serving video files at 400 Gbps</a> (now <a href="http://nabstreamingsummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-Streaming-Summit-Netflix.pdf">800 Gbps</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scylladb.com/2017/05/10/faster-and-better-what-to-expect-running-scylla-on-aws-i3-instances/">1 million IOPS on a NoSQL database</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/pgbench-performance-benchmark-postgresql-12-and-edb-advanced-server-12">70k IOPS in PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/nginx">500k requests per second to nginx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/build-linux-kernel-1.14.0">Compiling the linux kernel in 20 seconds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/x264-2.7.0">Rendering 4k video with x264 at 75 FPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Among other things.  There are a lot of public benchmarks these days, and if you know how your
service behaves, you can probably find a similar benchmark.</p>
<h4 id="the-cost-of-one-server">The Cost of One Server</h4>
<p>In a large hosting provider, OVHCloud, you can rent an HGR-HCI-6 server with similar specifications
to the above, with 128 physical cores (256 threads), 512 GB of memory, and 50 Gbps of bandwidth
for $1,318/month.</p>
<p>Moving to the popular budget option, Hetzner, you can rent a smaller server with 32 physical cores
and 128 GB of RAM for about €140.00/month.  This is a smaller server than the one from OVHCloud
(1/4 the size), but it gives you some idea of the price spread between hosting providers.</p>
<p>In AWS, one of the largest servers you can rent is the m6a.metal server. It offers 50 Gbps
of network bandwidth, 192 vCPUs (96 physical cores), and 768 GB of memory, and costs $8.2944/hour
in the US East region.  This comes out to $6,055/month.  The cloud premium is real!</p>
<p>A similar server, with 128 physical cores and 512 GB of memory (as well as appropriate NICs,
SSDs, and support contracts), can be purchased from the Dell website for about $40,000.  However,
if you are going to spend this much on a server, you should probably chat with a salesperson to
make sure you are getting the best deal you can.  You will also need to pay to host this server
and connect it to a network, though.</p>
<p>In comparison, buying servers takes about 8 months to break even compared to using cloud servers,
and 30 months to break even compared to renting.  Of course, buying servers has a lot of drawbacks,
and so does renting, so going forward, we will think a little bit about the "cloud premium" and
whether you should be willing to pay it (spoiler alert: the answer is "yes, but not as much as the
cloud companies want you to pay").</p>
<h2 id="thinking-about-the-cloud">Thinking about the Cloud</h2>
<p>The "cloud era" began in earnest around 2010.  At the time, the state of the art CPU was an
8-core Intel Nehalem CPU.  Hyperthreading had just begun, so that 8-core CPU offered a
whopping 16 threads.  Hardware acceleration was about to arrive for AES encryption, and
vectors were 128 bits wide. The largest CPUs had 24 MB of cache, and your server could fit a
whopping 256 GB of DDR3-1066 memory. If you wanted to store data, Seagate had just begun to
offer a 3 TB hard drive.  Each core offered 4 FLOPs per cycle, meaning that your 8-core
server running at 2.5 GHz offered a blazing fast 80 GFLOPs.</p>
<p>The boom in distributed computing rode on this wave: if you wanted to do anything that
involved retrieval of data, you needed a lot of disks to get the storage throughput you want.
If you wanted to do large computations, you generally needed a lot of CPUs. This meant that
you needed to coordinate between a lot of CPUs to get most things done.</p>
<p>Since that time began, the size of servers has increased a lot, and SSDs have increased available
IOPS by a factor of at least 100, but the size of mainstream VMs and containers hasn't increased
much, and we still use virtualized drives that perform more like hard drives than SSDs (although
this gap is closing).</p>
<h4 id="one-server-plus-a-backup-is-usually-plenty">One Server (Plus a Backup) is Usually Plenty</h4>
<p>If you are doing anything short of video streaming, and you have under 10k QPS, one server
will generally be fine for most web services.  For really simple services, one server could
even make it to a million QPS or so.  Very few web services get this much traffic - if you
have one, you know about it.  Even if you're serving video, running only one server for your
control plane is very reasonable.  A benchmark can help you determine where you are.
Alternatively, you can use common benchmarks of similar applications, or
<a href="https://specbranch.com/posts/common-perf-numbers/">tables of common performance numbers</a> to estimate how big of a
machine you might need.</p>
<h4 id="tall-is-better-than-wide">Tall is Better than Wide</h4>
<p>When you need a cluster of computers, if one server is not enough, using fewer larger servers
will often be better than using a large fleet of small machines.  There is non-zero overhead
to coordinate a cluster, and that overhead is frequently O(n) on each server.  To reduce this
overhead, you should generally prefer to use a few large servers than to use many small servers.
In the case of things like serverless computing, where you allocate tiny short-lived containers,
this overhead accounts for a large fraction of the cost of use.  On the other extreme end,
coordinating a cluster of one computer is trivial.</p>
<h4 id="big-servers-and-availability">Big Servers and Availability</h4>
<p>The big drawback of using a single big server is availability.  Your server is going to need
downtime, and it is going to break.  Running a primary and a backup server is usually enough,
keeping them in different datacenters.  A 2x2 configuration should appease the truly paranoid: two
servers in a primary datacenter (or cloud provider) and two servers in a backup datacenter will
give you a lot of redundancy.  If you want a third backup deployment, you can often make that
smaller than your primary and secondary.</p>
<p>However, you may still have to be concerned about <em>correlated</em> hardware failures.  Hard drives
(and now SSDs) have been known to occasionally have correlated failures: if you see one disk
fail, you are a lot more likely to see a second failure before getting back up if your disks
are from the same manufacturing batch.  Services like Backblaze overcome this by using many
different models of disks from multiple manufacturers.  Hacker news learned this the hard way
recently when the primary and backup server went down at the same time.</p>
<p>If you are using a hosting provider which rents pre-built servers, it is prudent to rent two
different types of servers in each of your primary and backup datacenters.  This should avoid
almost every failure mode present in modern systems.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-cloud-but-dont-be-too-cloudy">Use the Cloud, but don't be too Cloudy</h2>
<p>A combination of availability and ease of use is one of the big reasons why I (and most other
engineers) like cloud computers.  Yes, you pay a significant premium to rent the machines, but
your cloud provider has so much experience building servers that you don't even see most failures,
and for the other failures, you can get back up and running really quickly by renting a new
machine in their nearly-limitless pool of compute.  It is their job to make sure that you don't
experience downtime, and while they don't always do it perfectly, they are pretty good at it.</p>
<p>Hosting providers who are willing to rent you a server are a cheaper alternative to cloud
providers, but these providers can sometimes have poor quality and some of them don't understand
things like network provisioning and correlated hardware failures. Also, moving from one rented
server to a larger one is a lot more annoying than resizing a cloud VM. Cloud servers have a
price premium for a good reason.</p>
<p>However, when you deal with clouds, your salespeople will generally push you towards
"cloud-native" architecture.  These are things like microservices in auto-scaling VM groups with
legions of load balancers between them, and vendor-lock-in-enhancing products like serverless
computing and managed high-availability databases.  There is a good reason that cloud
salespeople are the ones pushing "cloud architecture" - it's better for them!</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that using cloud architecture is good because it lets you scale up
effortlessly. There are good reasons to use cloud-native architecture, but serving lots of people
is not one of them: most services can serve millions of people at a time with one server, and
will never give you a surprise five-figure bill.</p>
<h4 id="why-should-i-pay-for-peak-load">Why Should I Pay for Peak Load?</h4>
<p>One common criticism of the "one big server" approach is that you now have to pay for your peak
usage instead of paying as you go for what you use.  Thus, serverless computing or fleets of
microservice VMs more closely align your costs with your profit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since all of your services run on servers (whether you like it or not), someone
in that supply chain is charging you based on their peak load.  Part of the "cloud premium" for
load balancers, serverless computing, and small VMs is based on how much extra capacity your
cloud provider needs to build in order to handle <em>their</em> peak load.  You're paying for someone's
peak load anyway!</p>
<p>This means that if your workload is exceptionally bursty - like a simulation that needs
to run once and then turn off forever - you should prefer to reach for "cloudy" solutions, but if
your workload is not so bursty, you will often have a cheaper system (and an easier time building
it) if you go for few large servers.  If your cloud provider's usage is more bursty than yours,
you are going to pay that premium for no benefit.</p>
<p>This premium applies to VMs, too, not just cloud services. However, if you are running a cloud VM
24/7, you can avoid paying the "peak load premium" by using 1-year contracts or negotiating with
a salesperson if you are big enough.</p>
<p>Generally, the burstier your workload is, the more cloudy your architecture should be.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-be-cloudy">How Much Does it Cost to be Cloudy?</h4>
<p>Being cloudy is expensive.  Generally, I would anticipate a 5-30x price premium depending on what
you buy from a cloud company, and depending on the baseline. <em>Not 5-30%, a factor of between 5 and
30.</em></p>
<p>Here is the pricing of AWS lambda: $0.20 per 1M requests + $0.0000166667 per GB-second of RAM.  I
am using pricing for an x86 CPU here to keep parity with the m6a.metal instance we saw above.
Large ARM servers and serverless ARM compute are both cheaper.</p>
<p>Assuming your server costs $8.2944/hour, and is capable of 1k QPS with 768 GB of RAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1k QPS is 60k queries per minute, or 3.6M queries per hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each query here gets 0.768 GB-seconds of RAM (amortized)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacing this server would cost about $46/hour using serverless computing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The price premium for serverless computing over the instance is a factor of 5.5.  If you can keep
that server over 20% utilization, using the server will be cheaper than using serverless computing.
This is before any form of savings plan you can apply to that server - if you can rent those big
servers from the spot market or if you compare to the price you can get with a 1-year contract,
the price premium is even higher.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you compare to the OVHCloud rental price for the same server, the price premium of buying your
compute through AWS lambda is a factor of 25</strong></em></p>
<p>If you are considering renting a server from a low-cost hosting provider or using AWS lambda, you
should prefer the hosting provider if you can keep the server operating at 5% capacity!</p>
<p>Also, note that the actual QPS number doesn't matter: if the $8.2944/hour server is capable of 100k
QPS, the query would use 100x less memory-time, meaning that you would arrive at the same 5.5x
(or 25x) premium. Of course, you should scale the size of the server to fit your application.</p>
<h2 id="common-objections-to-one-big-server">Common Objections to One Big Server</h2>
<p>If you propose using the one big server approach, you will often get pushback from people who are
more comfortable with the cloud, prefer to be fashionable, or have legitimate concerns.  Use your
judgment when you think about it, but most people vastly underestimate how much "cloud
architecture" actually costs compared to the underlying compute.  Here are some common objections.</p>
<h4 id="but-if-i-use-cloud-architecture-i-dont-have-to-hire-sysadmins">But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Hire Sysadmins</h4>
<p>Yes you do.  They are just now called "Cloud Ops" and are under a different manager. Also, their
ability to read the arcane documentation that comes from cloud companies and keep up  with the
corresponding torrents of updates and deprecations makes them 5x more expensive than system
administrators.</p>
<h4 id="but-if-i-use-cloud-architecture-i-dont-have-to-do-security-updates">But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Do Security Updates</h4>
<p>Yes you do.  You may have to do fewer of them, but the ones you don't have to do are the easy ones
to automate.  You are still going to share in the pain of auditing libraries you use, and making
sure that all of your configurations are secure.</p>
<h4 id="but-if-i-use-cloud-architecture-i-dont-have-to-worry-about-it-going-down">But if I use Cloud Architecture, I Don't Have to Worry About it Going Down</h4>
<p>The "high availability" architectures you get from using cloudy constructs and microservices just
about make up for the fragility they add due to complexity.  At this point, if you use two
different cloud regions or two cloud providers, you can generally assume that is good enough to
avoid your service going down.  However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past,
and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your
individual servers.</p>
<p>Remember that we are trying to prevent <em>correlated</em> failures.  Cloud datacenters have a lot of
parts that can fail in correlated ways.  Hosting providers have many fewer of these parts.
Similarly, complex cloud services, like managed databases, have more failure modes than simple
ones (VMs).</p>
<h4 id="but-i-can-develop-more-quickly-if-i-use-cloud-architecture">But I can Develop More Quickly if I use Cloud Architecture</h4>
<p>Then do it, and just keep an eye on the bill and think about when it's worth it to switch.  This
is probably the strongest argument in favor of using cloudy constructs.  However, if you don't
think about it as you grow, you will likely end up burning a lot of money on your cloudy
architecture long past the time to switch to something more boring.</p>
<h4 id="my-workload-is-really-bursty">My Workload is Really Bursty</h4>
<p>Cloud away.  That is a great reason to use things like serverless computing.  One of the big
benefits of cloud architecture constructs is that the <em>scale down</em> really well.  If your workload
goes through long periods of idleness punctuated with large unpredictable bursts of activity, cloud
architecture probably works really well for you.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-cdns">What about CDNs?</h4>
<p>It's impossible to get the benefits of a CDN, both in latency improvements and bandwidth savings,
with one big server.  This is also true of other systems that need to be distributed, like backups.
Thankfully CDNs and backups are competitive markets, and relatively cheap. These are the kind of
thing to buy rather than build.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-microservices-and-monoliths">A Note On Microservices and Monoliths</h2>
<p>Thinking about "one big server" naturally lines up with thinking about monolithic architectures.
However, you don't need to use a monolith to use one server.  You can run many containers on one
big server, with one microservice per container.  However, microservice architectures in general
add a lot of overhead to a system for dubious gain when you are running on one big server.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>When you experience growing pains, and get close to the limits of your current servers, today's
conventional wisdom is to go for sharding and horizontal scaling, or to use a cloud architecture
that gives you horizontal scaling "for free."  It is often easier and more efficient to scale
vertically instead.  Using one big server is comparatively cheap, keeps your overheads at a
minimum, and actually has a pretty good availability story if you are careful to prevent correlated
hardware failures.  It's not glamorous and it won't help your resume, but one big server will serve
you well.</p>

<p>A while ago I treated you to a dissertation entitled “<a href="https://oikofuge.com/sun-set-british-empire/" data-type="link" data-id="https://oikofuge.com/sun-set-british-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does The Sun Set On The British Empire?</a>”, and concluded that it doesn’t. The UK’s widely scattered overseas territories, sparse though they are, mean that the sun is still always shining, somewhere in the world, over British territory.</p>



<p>The most important territories in maintaining this late-empire sunlight are the Pitcairn Islands, in the Pacific, and the British Indian Ocean Territory, in the Indian Ocean. To illustrate that, I offered the sunlight chart below, showing how Pitcairn and BIOT catch the sunlight when it’s dark in the UK.</p>

<p>In fact, as my map at the head of this post shows, BIOT is pivotal. There, I’ve plotted the distribution of light and darkness, across the globe, at 02:15 Greenwich Mean Time, during the June solstice of 2024.<strong><mark>*</mark></strong></p>



<p>And here’s the situation at the December solstice:</p>

<p>Just after the sun sets in Pitcairn, it’s dark over every British territory except BIOT.</p>



<p>I’m revisiting the situation because the UK government has announced plans to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which houses BIOT, to Mauritius. The announcement was made in October 2024, but the original agreement has now been contested by a new government in Mauritius. And the situation is further complicated by the fact that BIOT houses a large US military base on the island of Diego Garcia, so the new Trump administration also has a say in the process. (Meanwhile, the unfortunate Chagossians, evicted from their homeland in 1968 to make way for the military base, have so far been given no voice in the negotiations.)</p>



<p>The current proposal suggests that the military base would be maintained under a long-term lease agreement, in which case British sovereignty would be lost, and BIOT would cease to exist. At that point, the role of easternmost British territory would fall to the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs), in Cyprus.</p>



<p>The SBAs are worth a few paragraphs, both because they’re relatively obscure, and because their existence, as sovereign military territories, perhaps has some slight relevance to how the situation on Diego Garcia might play out, should the Trump administration raise strong objections to the current plan.</p>



<p>The SBAs came into existence when Cyprus gained its independence from the UK in 1960. Under the Treaty of Establishment, the UK retained sovereignty over about 250 square kilometres of the island, in two separate areas—the Western Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri, and the Eastern Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia. These have extremely complicated boundaries, designed to avoid Cypriot settlements while including British military establishments. The Eastern SBA contains three Cypriot enclaves—the towns of Ormideia and Xylotymbou, and the area surrounding the Dhekelia power station (which is crossed by a British road). It also features a long northward extension along the road to the village of Ayios Nikolaos, which now houses a signals intelligence unit.</p>



<p>And the whole border situation became even more complicated after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, which has left the island traversed by a UN buffer zone. British territory, including the Ayios Nikolaos road, forms part of the buffer zone. Elsewhere, the Turkish-controlled town of Kokkina has its very own buffer zone. Here’s an overview map, followed by some detail of the SBAs:</p>







<p>(Interestingly, the British military settlements within the SBAs are referred to as <em>cantonments</em>, a military term which, to me at least, has something of a colonial ring to it, given its association with British rule in India.)</p>



<p>The relevance, here, to the current situation of Diego Garcia, is because the UK government made plans to hand the SBAs back to Cyprus in 1974, but were persuaded to retain sovereignty by the USA, which valued access to signals intelligence in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as a convenient location from which to fly, among other things, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181011213916/https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/10/11/anastasiades-stays-mum-on-secret-us-base/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20181011213916/https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/10/11/anastasiades-stays-mum-on-secret-us-base/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U2 spy planes</a>. The difference, of course, is that the Cypriot government appears to have been compliant with that arrangement, whereas it seems unlikely, at time of writing, that the Mauritians would agree to such a deal.</p>



<p>We’ll see how it goes. Meanwhile, I’ve plotted another sunrise/sunset graph, showing how sunlight is handed off between the two key players in the absence of BIOT: </p>

<p>(For my sunlight calculation, I’ve plugged in the latitude and longitude of the easternmost part of the Eastern SBA—Ayios Nikolaos.)</p>



<p>It’s close—in June there’s less than an hour when it’s dark in both Pitcairn and the SBAs. But, if BIOT goes, when the sun sets on Pitcairn, it will also set on (what’s left of) the British Empire.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/07/14/ai-is-killing-the-web-can-anything-save-it">recent article</a>, The Economist didn’t mince words: “AI is killing the web.” Published last month, the piece raises urgent questions about how artificial intelligence is reshaping the internet as we know it: ChatGPT, Google, and its competitors are rapidly diverting traffic from publishers. Publishers are fighting&nbsp; to survive through lawsuits, partnerships, paywalls, and micropayments. It’s pretty bleak, but unfortunately I think the situation is far worse than it seems.</p>



<p>The article focuses mainly on the publishing industry, news and magazine sites that rely primarily on visits to their sites and selling ads. This is hardly new for the publishing industry. Televisions arrived in living rooms in the 60s disrupting print and radio media, in the late 90s and early 2000s the internet further devastated the print business, and social media was stealing attention well before the advent of AI. But it’s not just the publishing industry. There’s a much larger economy being disrupted by generative AI platforms.</p>



<p>For the past 25 years, online businesses have relied on people searching Google for information and clicking through to their sites to get the information. For example, a business that sells dirt bikes might create a comprehensive guide to winterize a cottage. People search for information on winterizing their cottage, click through to the dirt bike company’s guide, and are then exposed to the company’s brand, maybe join their email list, and maybe buy their products or services.</p>



<p>Now that ChatGPT and Google are serving the information up to people, there’s little reason to click through to the site. If you’ve used Google search lately, you’ll have noticed an AI blurb responding to your query before you even see a list of links. The result: less clicks on the links.</p>



<p>So the question follows, if fewer and fewer people are visiting your company site, what’s your incentive to produce and maintain high quality content?</p>



<p>Worse yet, ChatGPT and Google rely on the content produced by businesses to train their AI models. If businesses stop producing content, what happens to the answers provided by ChatGPT and Google?</p>



<p>Could AI companies be this short sighted?</p>



<p>In short: Yes. This is a gold rush mentality. And like any gold rush, there’s little attention paid to the long term. It’s get rich quick and we’ll deal with the consequences later. It’s a race to become the dominant force in AI with no attention paid to the sustainability of their fuel source: the content.</p>



<p>However, Google doesn’t fit this profile. They’ve needed businesses and publishers to produce content all along and they know they still do.</p>



<p>We, the public, have greatly benefited from the symbiotic relationship between businesses and Google. You ask Google for something and it responds with links to the best content. Businesses want those visitors to their sites and so they want to have the best content. Although Google’s results pages have gotten worse for the public and businesses in recent years (half a page of ads at this point), the situation has largely been a win-win-win for them, businesses, and the public. </p>



<p>Businesses produced and maintained quality content, Google rewarded the businesses with visitors while diverting some to their ads, and the public got the information they were searching for. Unfortunately this symbiotic relationship is breaking down. In their effort to stay relevant and compete with ChatGPT, Google is tearing up the contract they’ve had with publishers and businesses for the past 25 years.</p>



<p>Google knows this but they seem to be pretending that they don’t. In fact, it seems that they’re scared and they don’t know what else to do. They have no other option.</p>



<p>One solution here seems to be regulation. To many, it feels like an injustice that AI companies can scrape information from sites, combine it, and serve it up to their users. The bottom line is that if the content didn’t exist to train their models, the AI companies wouldn’t be able to produce an answer.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, lawsuits so far have been going in favor of AI companies. Copyright law doesn’t seem to be a fit here, so perhaps we need new laws. I doubt they’ll come quickly enough though. Google search is rolling out AI Mode right now: no more AI blurb with links underneath. Just a ChatGPT-like interface when you do a Google search. It seems we’re already well into this trap and there doesn’t seem to be an escape.</p>



<p>Then again, there’s definitely an economic bubble here. ChatGPT is not profitable despite billions in revenue. The infrastructure is very expensive to run. Perhaps the bubble will burst, the money will dry up, and it won’t be feasible to employ generative AI for general search. Google and its competitors will use it for other things of course, but not for search. It’s hard to see this happening though. The genie is out of the bottle.</p>

                        <h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This is a tutorial for the <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">Jujutsu</a> version control system.
It requires <strong>no previous experience with Git</strong> or any other version control system.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, most Jujutsu tutorials are targeted at experienced Git users, teaching them how to transfer their existing Git skills over to Jujutsu.
This tutorial is my attempt to fill the void of beginner learning material for Jujutsu.
If you are already experienced with Git, I recommend <a href="https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial">Steve Klabnik's tutorial</a> instead of this one.</p>
<p>This tutorial requires you to work in the terminal.
Don't worry, there's a chapter covering some terminal basics in case you're not 100% comfortable with that yet.
The commands I tell you to run will often only work on Unix-like operating systems like Linux and Mac.
If you're on Windows (and can't switch to Linux), consider using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">WSL</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-this-tutorial"><a href="#how-to-read-this-tutorial">How to read this tutorial</a></h2>
<p>The tutorial is split into <strong>levels</strong>, which are the top-level chapters in the sidebar.
The idea is that once you complete a level, you should probably put this tutorial away for a while and practice what you've learned.
Once you're comfortable with those skills, come back for the next level.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this:
If you're here because you need to collaborate with other people, you should complete the levels 1 and 2 right away.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the planned levels:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>1</strong></td><td>The bare minimum to get started. This is only enough for the simplest use cases where you're working alone. For example, students who track and submit their homework with a Git repository can get by with only this.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>2</strong></td><td>The bare minimum for any sort of collaboration. Students who are working on a group project and professional software developers need to know this. Going further is highly recommended, but you can take a break after this.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>3</strong></td><td>Basic problem solving skills like conflict resolution and restoring files from history. Without this knowledge, it's only a matter of time until you run into trouble. Completing this level is comparable to the skill level of the average software developer.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>4</strong></td><td>History rewriting skills. These will allow you to iterate toward a polished version history, which pays dividends long-term. Some projects require you to have these skills in order to meet their quality standards.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>5</strong></td><td>Productivity boosters, advanced workflows, lesser-known CLI functions and a little VCS theory. Completing this level means you have mastered Jujutsu.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>6</strong></td><td>Additional topics that only come up in specific situations: tags, submodules, workspaces etc. Consider skimming the list of topics and come back once you have an actual need for it.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Only a few levels are complete right now, the rest are on the way.</p>
<h2 id="reset-your-progress"><a href="#reset-your-progress">Reset your progress</a></h2>
<p>Throughout the tutorial, you will build an example repository.
Later chapters depend on the state of previous ones.
Losing the state of the example repo can therefore block you from making smooth progress.
This might happen for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You use the example repo for practice and experimentation.</li>
<li>You switch to a different computer or reinstall the OS.</li>
<li>You intentionally delete it to clean up your home directory.</li>
<li>The tutorial is updated significantly while you're taking a break.</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve this problem, there is a script which automates the task of resetting your progress to the <strong>start of any chapter</strong>.
To identify the chapter you want to continue with, the script expects a keyword as an argument.
Each chapter includes its precise reset command at the beginning, so you can easily copy-paste it.</p>

<a href="#admonition-always-be-careful-when-executing-scripts-from-the-internet"></a>
</div>

<p>The script is not complicated, you can verify that it's not doing anything malicious.
Basically, it's just the list of commands I tell you to run manually.
For convenience, it's included in the expandable text box below.
You can also download the script <a href="https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh">here</a> and then execute it locally once you have inspected it.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping me improve this tutorial!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-version-control-and-why-should-you-use-it"><a href="#what-is-version-control-and-why-should-you-use-it">What is version control and why should you use it?</a></h2>
<p>I will assume you're using version control for software development, but it can be used for other things as well.
For example, authoring professionally formatted documents with tools like <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>.
The source of this tutorial is stored in version control too!</p>
<p>What these scenarios have in common is that a large body of work (mostly in the form of text) is slowly being expanded and improved over time.
You don't want to lose any of it and you want to be able to go back to previous states of your work.
Often, several people need to work on the project at the same time.</p>
<p>A general-purpose backup solution can keep a few copies of your files around.
A graphical document editor can allow multiple people to edit the text simultaneously.
But sometimes, you need a sharper knife.
Jujutsu is the sharpest knife available.</p>
<h2 id="why-jujutsu-instead-of-git"><a href="#why-jujutsu-instead-of-git">Why Jujutsu instead of Git?</a></h2>
<p>Git is by far the most commonly used VCS in the software development industry.
So why not use that?
Using the most popular thing has undeniable benefits.
There is lots of learning material, lots of people can help you with problems, lots of other tools integrate with it etc.
Why make life harder on yourself by using a lesser-known alternative?</p>
<p>Here's my elevator pitch:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jujutsu is compatible with Git.</strong>
You're not actually losing <em>anything</em> by using Jujutsu.
You can work with it on any existing project that uses Git for version control without issues.
Tools that integrate with Git mostly work just as well with Jujutsu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jujutsu is easier to learn than Git.</strong>
(That is, assuming I did a decent job writing this tutorial.)
Git is known for its complicated, unintuitive user interface.
Jujutsu gives you all the functionality of Git with a lot less complexity.
Experienced users of Git usually don't care about this, because they've paid the price of learning Git already.
(I was one of these people once.)
But you care!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jujutsu is more powerful than Git.</strong>
Despite the fact that it's easier to learn and more intuitive, it actually has loads of awesome capabilities for power users that completely leave Git in the dust.
Don't worry, you don't have to use that power right away.
But you can be confident that if your VCS-workflow becomes more demanding in the future, Jujutsu will have your back.
This is not a watered-down "we have Git at home" for slow learners!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Jujutsu instead of Git as your first VCS does have some downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When talking about version control with peers, they will likely use Git-centric vocabulary.
Jujutsu shares a lot of Git's concepts, but there are also differences.
Translating between the two in conversation can add some mental overhead.
(solution: convince your peers to use Jujutsu 😉)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jujutsu is relatively new and doesn't cover 100% of the features of Git yet.
When you do run into the rare problem where Jujutsu doesn't have an answer, you can always fall back to use Git directly, which works quite seamlessly.
Still, having to use two tools instead of one is slightly annoying.
I plan to teach such Git features in this tutorial in later levels.
The tutorial should be a one-stop-shop for all Jujutsu users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The command line interface of Jujutsu is not yet stable.
That means in future versions of Jujutsu, some commands might work a little differently or be renamed.
I personally don't think this should scare you away.
Many people including me have used Jujutsu as a daily driver for a long time.
Whenever something <em>did</em> change, my reaction was usually:
"Great, that was one of the less-than-perfect parts of Jujutsu! Now it's even more intuitive than before!"
Consider <a href="#stay-up-to-date">subscribing to GitHub releases of this tutorial</a>.
You will be notified if new versions of Jujutsu change something in a way that's relevant to what you learned in this tutorial.</p>

</ul>
<p>Despite some downsides, I think the benefits are <strong>well worth it</strong>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A top official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanded the removal of YouTube videos of himself that were published by a physician and writer who has been critical of medical misinformation and public health officials in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Trump administration</a>, according to a YouTube notice that was seen by the Guardian.</p><p>Jonathan Howard, a neurologist and psychiatrist in New York City, received an email from YouTube on Friday night, which stated that Vinay Prasad, who is the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, had demanded the removal of six videos of himself from Howard’s YouTube channel.</p><p>Howard’s entire channel has now been deleted by YouTube, which cited copyright infringement.</p><p>The now-defunct channel contained about 350 videos of doctors and commentators, including Prasad, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, the secretary of health and human services, and Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the National Institutes of Health, which had been collected by Howard from their social media accounts, interviews and podcasts.</p><p>Creating the channel, Howard told Guardian in an interview, had been an attempt to “preserve” what these individuals had said during the early years of the pandemic, including comments that Howard said exaggerated the dangers of the Covid vaccine to children and – in some cases – minimized the risk of Covid infection, among other issues.</p><p>“These videos were nothing more than collections of what other doctors said during the pandemic, including doctors who are extremely influential and who are now the medical establishment,” he said.</p><p>The Guardian requested a comment from the office of public affairs at the department of health and human services, and attempted to reach Prasad through personal email addresses and by a listed mobile phone number. No one responded to the request for comment.</p><p>When YouTube notified Howard of the demand request, it included an email address for Prasad, which is identical to the email address that is linked to Prasad’s now inactive podcast, called Plenary Session.</p><p>Prasad, a former hematologist-oncologist at the University of California San Francisco, is now head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which makes him the chief vaccine regulator in the US. He was a vocal critic of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/top-us-vaccine-official-resigns-over-rfk-jrs-misinformation-and-lies-dr-peter-marks" data-link-name="in body link">Peter Marks, who previously led CBER and was widely respected for his role in Operation Warp Speed</a>, the initiative that developed, manufactured and helped distribute the Covid-19 vaccines. Marks was forced to resign by Kennedy.</p><p>Prasad has also been critical of the use of Covid boosters in young people and vaccine mandates, and has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/06/vinay-prasad-fda-vaccine-regulator-analysis-of-previous-contrarian-comments-covid-autism-mmr-shots/" data-link-name="in body link">defended cuts to health agencies and university research</a>.</p><p>“It’s really important to remember [Prasad’s] past words in order to gauge his current and future credibility, and that was the mission of my YouTube channel, to record what these doctors [Prasad and others] said,” Howard said.</p><p>Although the videos Howard collected were often only viewed “dozens” of times, Howard included them in his online articles that appeared on the Science Based Medicine blog. Now those video links are dead.</p><p>He noted that snippets of Prasad’s comments still appeared on anti-vaccine social media accounts, suggesting Prasad was directing his removal demand only at a critic and not anti-vaccine influencers. In the past, Prasad has complained about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV5c8mva9-s" data-link-name="in body link">censorship</a> by social media companies.</p><p>Howard has been quoted in the New York Times, the Guardian, and other publications and is the author of a forthcoming book Everyone Else Is Lying to You, which he said examines how the medical establishment, which has come into power in Trump’s second term, normalized “quackery” during the Covid pandemic and undermined public health.</p><p>“I had thought there was a policy that government officials shouldn’t censor opposing perspectives, but I must be mistaken,” said John Moore, a scientist and colleague who is familiar with Howard’s book and videos.</p><p>Howard told the Guardian he wanted to emphasize that he was not a victim, and that the ordeal of having his YouTube channel deleted was nothing compared with the dire situation facing scientists and researchers whose funding is being cut by public health institutions.</p><p>Prasad has had a rocky start in his FDA tenure. Jeremy Faust, a doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine whose Substack newsletter Inside Medicine is widely followed, once described Prasad as having two sides.</p><p>There was a 2010s Prasad who was a “rigorous and professorial cancer research methodology expert with hundreds of peer-reviewed publications, including well-reasoned analyses that often stood up against some slippery stuff from big pharma”. And there was the “2020s Prasad”, who Faust called “newly famous and admired by the Right … [a] hot-headed firebrand who when asked about how we should move forward from the lessons of Covid-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HZDNG9gO1Q" data-link-name="in body link">criticized</a> the pro-masking contingent saying, “I don’t believe in forgiveness because, in my opinion, these pieces of shit are still lying.”</p><p>Prasad <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/09/vinay-prasad-returns-fda-laura-loomer" data-link-name="in body link">briefly resigned this summer</a> after he was the subject of an attack by the rightwing activist Laura Loomer, and then returned to his post at the FDA. He reportedly had a significant role in the FDA’s decision to change rules around the Covid-19 vaccine, limiting its availability this fall to adults over 65 or those with certain medical conditions. Previously, Covid shots were recommended for everyone six months or older.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>

<p>High-level advice, control systems.</p>

<h2 id="chemistry-first">Chemistry First</h2>

<p><em>ADHD has a biological cause and drugs are the first-line treatment for good reasons. There is no virtue in trying to beat it through willpower alone.</em></p>

<p>The first-line treatment for ADHD is stimulants. Everything else in this post works best as a complement to, rather than as an alternative to, stimulant medication. In fact most of the strategies described here, I was only able to execute <em>after</em> starting stimulants. For me, chemistry is the critical node in the tech tree: the todo list, the pomodoro timers, etc., all of that was unlocked by the medication.</p>

<p>Some people can’t tolerate a specific stimulant. But there are many stimulant and non-stimulant drugs for ADHD. I would prefer to exhaust all the psychiatric options before white-knuckling it.</p>

<p>A lot of people don’t want to take medication for shame-based reasons. There is a lot of pill-shaming in the culture. You must learn to ignore it: we are automata, our minds are molecules in salt water.</p>

<h3 id="example-melatonin">Example: Melatonin</h3>

<p>As a motivating example for the “salt water automaton” view: I struggled with sleep hygiene for a long time. It felt like WW1: throwing wave after wave of discipline at it and always failing. I would set an alarm, for, say, 10pm, that said: it is time to go to bed. How many times did I obey it? Never. I was always doing something more important.</p>

<p>What fixed it? Melatonin. I have an alarm that goes off at 8pm to remind me to take melatonin. The point of the alarm is not, “now you must log off”, which is a very discipline-demanding task. The point of the alarm is simply: take this pill. It takes but a moment. Importantly, I’m not committing to anything other than taking a pill. Thirty, forty minutes later, I <em>want</em> to sleep. That is the key thing: the melatonin has changed my preferences. And then I don’t need willpower to close the sixteen Wikipedia tabs or whatever, because I <em>want</em> to sleep more than I want to scroll, or watch YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="internal-and-external-change">Internal and External Change</h3>

<p>The broader perspective here is that personal growth is a dialogue between internal changes and external changes.</p>

<p>Internal changes might come from medication, meditation, therapy, coaching, or practicing habits for a long enough time. External changes are the scaffolding around the brain: using a todo list, and using it effectively. Using a calendar. Clearing your desk so you don’t get distracted by things. Journaling, so that you can introspect and notice patterns: which behaviours leads to a good workday, and which behaviours lead to a day being wasted.</p>

<p>Are internal changes more important? Kind of. It’s more a back and forth, where internal changes unlock external changes which unlock further internal changes.</p>

<p>Here’s an example: you (having undiagnosed ADHD) try to set a schedule, or use a todo list, or clean your bed every day, but it doesn’t stick. So you get on medication, and the medication lets you form your first habit: which is using a todo list app consistently, checking it every morning. Then, with the todo list as a core part of your exocortex, you start adding recurring tasks, and forming other simple habits: you have a daily recurring task to make your bed, and so every morning when you check the todo list, you see the task, and make your bed, and in time, with your now-functioning dopamine system, you make a habit to make your bed every day, such that you no longer need to have that in the todo list.</p>

<p>So the timeline is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Internal change: starting medication unlocks…</li>
  <li>External change: using a todo list, which provides scaffolding (e.g. daily recurring tasks) for forming new habits, which unlocks</li>
  <li>Internal change: new habits formed (make bed, brush teeth in the morning)</li>
</ol>

<p>Taking Ritalin with no plan for what you will do today/tomorrow/this week doesn’t work. Dually, an ambitious todo list will sit idle if your brain won’t let you execute it. So personal growth comes from using <em>both</em> internal and external changes, like a ladder with alternating left-right steps.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p><em>A todo list is a neuroprosthesis that augments long-term memory for tasks.</em></p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.todoist.com/">Todoist</a> on my desktop and my phone. The pro plan is worth it. I don’t really think of it as an app, rather, it’s a cognitive prosthesis.</p>

<p>The todo list provides three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Memory:</strong> the list remembers things for me. I’m not at the mercy of my brain randomly pinging me that I forgot to do X or I want to someday do Y. The todo list remembers.</li>
  <li><strong>Order:</strong> the todo list lets you drag and drop tasks around, so you can figure out the ordering in which you’re going to do them.</li>
  <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> the todo list lets you break tasks down hierarchically and without limit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the most important is memory. The todolist is an action-oriented long term memory prosthesis.</p>

<p>This is especially useful for habit formation: my biggest blocker with forming habits was just remembered that I’d committed to doing something. If you think, i will make the bed every day, you might do it today, tomorrow, and by the third day you forget. You’re failing by simply forgetting to show up, which is a sad way to fail. By making something a recurring task on the todo list, it ensures I will see it. In a sense, the todo list turns many habits into one. You don’t need to remember “I will make my bed every day”, “I will floss my teeth every night”, etc., because the todolist remembers all those things for you. You only need to form a <em>single</em> habit: checking the todo list.</p>

<p>Analogously, I often fail to finish projects simply because I forget about them. I start reading a book, but I don’t write it down anywhere (say, in Goodreads) that “I’m reading this book” is something I have committed to. I leave the book on a table where it’s out of sight (and therefore out of mind) for all of my waking hours. I glance at it occasionally and think, oh, yeah, I was reading that book, and then I’m distracted by something else. And weeks later, when I’ve already started another book, I notice the first book, with the bookmark on page 20, abandoned.</p>

<p>The todolist prevents this failure mode: you create a project to represent reading the book, and that project is now tracked, and when you open the todo list, you can see it in the list of active projects.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-use-todoist">How I Use Todoist</h3>

<p>In Todoist, every task is part of a <a href="https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-projects-TLTjNftLM">project</a> (which really should just be called a list). My sidebar looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/notes-on-managing-adhd/sidebar.webp" width="300" alt="A screenshot of my Todoist sidebar, showing a list of projects described below."></p>

<p><strong>Tasks</strong> is the list for ad-hoc tasks. Mostly chores and things that don’t fit in elsewhere. Unload the dishwasher, reply to this email, etc. The only rule for this list is that everything in it must be scheduled.</p>

<p><strong>Groceries</strong> is self-explanatory.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas</strong> is the where every half-formed goal, intention, project idea etc. goes. “Go deeper into metta” and “learn how to use the slide rule” and “go penguin watching in Manly” and “write a journalling app” and “learn <a href="https://redex.racket-lang.org/">PLT Redex</a>”. I put these things here so that they don’t live in my brain. And occasionally I go through the list and promote something into an actual, active project.</p>

<p><strong>Blog</strong> is like the ideas list specifically ideas for blog posts.</p>

<p><strong>Reading List</strong> is for media I want to consume. This is divided into: fiction books, non-fiction books, technical books, blog posts, papers, games, films.</p>

<p><strong>Cycles</strong> is for recurring tasks. This one is divided into sections by period: daily, weekly, and above. The daily recurring tasks are things like “take vitamin D”, “meditate”, and the inbox-clearing task.</p>

<p><strong>Projects</strong> is a container for actual projects: an objective which takes multiple tasks to accomplish. Why lift projects into lists? Why not just use a top-level task to represent the project’s objective, and nested subtasks to represent the execution steps of the project? Because having the project in the sidebar is one mechanism I use to ensure I don’t forget about it. Every time I glance at the todo list, I can see the list of active projects. I can notice if something has not been worked on for a while, and act on it. Otherwise: out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>

<p><em>The difficulty class of the tasks you can perform declines throughout the day.</em></p>

<p>There are many metaphors for the concept of mental energy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">Spoon theory</a>, for example. The usual metaphor is that “mental energy” is like a battery that is drained through the day, in greater and lesser quantities, and is replenished by sleep.</p>

<p>To me, energy is less like a battery and more like voltage. Some machines require a threshold voltage to operate. Below that voltage they don’t just operate slower, they don’t operate at all. Analogously, different categories of activity have different threshold voltages. For me, it’s like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Things I am averse to, the things I intuitively want to put off because they bring up painful emotions, are high-voltage.</li>
  <li>Creative, open-ended work is high-voltage to start, but once you get started, keeping it going is medium-voltage.</li>
  <li>Simple chores like cleaning, throwing clothes in the washing machine, etc. are low-voltage.</li>
</ol>

<p>And when I wake up I have the highest possible voltage, and throughout the course of the day the voltage declines. And that’s the key difference from spoon theory: spoons are fungible across time, voltage is not. For each category of activity, there is a span of the day when I can action it.</p>

<p>When I wake up, I do my morning routine, get some quick wins, and then I try to tackle the thing I dread the most, as early in the morning as possible, because that’s the time of day when I have the most energy and self-control. I get that done and I move on.</p>

<p>(Another reason to do the dreaded tasks first: if you put it off to, say, late morning, well, why not put it off again? And again and again. And then it’s 7pm and you can’t even think about the task, and it’s late, and I don’t have energy, so I couldn’t even do it if I wanted to, so let’s do it tomorrow.)</p>

<p>And then, when I have removed that burden, I work on projects. The creative, generative, intellectual things. The things that move some kind of needle, and aren’t just pointless chores.</p>

<p>And when I run out of energy to create, I read.</p>

<p>And when I run out of energy to read, I clean and go to the gym and do the other things.</p>

<p>And when the sun goes down everything starts to unravel: I have zero energy and the lazy dopamine-seeking behaviour comes out. So I take melatonin, and try to be in bed before the instant gratification monkey seizes power.</p>

<h2 id="procrastination">Procrastination</h2>

<p><em>Typology of procrastination, approaches.</em></p>

<p>In my ontology there are three types of procrastination:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ADHD Procrastination:</strong> you want to do the task, but can’t because of distraction/hyperactivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Anxious Procrastination:</strong> you know you have to do the task, but you don’t want to, because it triggers difficult emotions.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision Paralysis Procrastination:</strong> you <em>don’t know</em> how to execute the task, because it involves a decision and you have difficulty making the decision.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adhd-procrastination">ADHD Procrastination</h3>

<p>This is the easiest kind to address. The solution is pharmacological treatment for ADHD + having a productivity system and some tricks.</p>

<h3 id="anxious-procrastination">Anxious Procrastination</h3>

<p>This one is harder. The good thing is you know, cognitively, what you have to do. The hard part is getting over the aversion.</p>

<p>In the short term, the way to fix this is to do it scared. Accept the anxiety. Asking for help also works, sometimes you just need someone in the room with you when you hit send on the email. You can also use techniques like CBT to rationally challenge the source of the anxiety and maybe overcome it.</p>

<p>In the long term: write down the things you procrastinate one due to anxiety, and find the common through-line, or the common ancestor. By identifying the emotional root cause, you can work on fixing it.</p>

<h3 id="decision-paralysis-procrastination">Decision Paralysis Procrastination</h3>

<p>And this is the hardest, because you don’t know, cognitively, what the right choice is, and also you probably have a lot of anxiety/aversion around it. Many things in life are susceptible to this: you have set of choices, there’s good arguments for/against each one, and you have a lot of uncertainty as to the outcomes. And so you ruminate on it endlessly.</p>

<p>I don’t have a good general solution for this.</p>

<p>Talking to people helps: friends, therapists, Claude. This works because thinking by yourself has diminishing returns: you will quickly exhaust all the thoughts you will have about the problem, and start going in circles. Often people will bring up options/considerations I would never have thought of. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, that’s all it takes: someone mentions an option you had not considered and you realize, oh, it was all so simple.</p>

<p>One thing to consider is that <em>thinking in your head</em> is inherently circular, because you have a limited working memory, and you will inevitably start going in circles. Writing things down helps here. Treat the decision, or the emotions behind it, like an object of study, or an engineering problem. Sit down and write an essay about it. Name the arguments, number the bullet points, refer back to things. Make the thoughts into real, physical, manipulable entities.</p>

<h2 id="introspection">Introspection</h2>

<p><em>Journaling is good for detecting maladaptive patterns and tracking your progress.</em></p>

<p>I keep a hierarchical journal in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Hierarchical because I have entries for the days, weeks, months, and years. The directory tree looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>Journal/
  Daily/
    YYYY/
      MM/
        YYYY-MM-DD.md
  Weekly/
    YYYY/
      YYYY-WW.md
  Monthly/
    YYYY/
      YYYY-MM.md
  Yearly/
    YYYY.md
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the morning I finish yesterday’s journal entry, and begin today’s. Every Sunday I write the review of the week, the first of each month I write the review of the previous month, the first of each year I review the past year. The time allotted to each review is in inverse proportion to its frequency: so a monthly review might take an hour while a yearly review might take up a whole morning.</p>

<p>The daily reviews are pretty freeform. Weekly and above there’s more structure. For example, for the weekly reviews I will write a list of the salient things that happened in the week. Then I list on what went well and what went poorly. And then I reflect on how I will change my behaviour to make the next week go better.</p>

<p>Journaling is a valuable habit. I started doing it for vague reasons: I wasn’t sure what I wanted to get out of it, and it took a long time (and long stretches of not doing it) until it became a regular, daily habit. I’ve been doing it consistently now for three years, and I can identify the benefits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The main benefit is that to change bad patterns, you have to notice them. And it is very easy to travel in a fix orbit, day in, day out, and not notice it. Laying it out in writing helps to notice the maladaptive coping mechanisms. Reading back over the journal entries helps you notice: when an event of type X happens, I react with Y.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today’s journal entry is a good default place for writing ad-hoc notes or thoughts. Often I wanted to write something, but didn’t know where I would file it (how do you even file these little scraps of thought?) and from not knowing where to put it, I would not do it. Nowadays I just begin writing in the journal. Later, if it is valuable to file it away, I do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating a journal entry in the morning is a good opportunity to go over the goals and priorities for the day and explicitly restate them to myself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final benefit is retrospection: I can look at the past and see how my life has changed. And this is often a positive experience, because the things that worried me didn’t come to pass, the things I used to struggle with are now easy, or at least easier.</p>

    <p>There’s a paradox with productivity: when you grind executive function enough, things that you used to struggle with become quotidian. And so what was once the ceiling becomes the new floor. You no longer feel proud that you did X, Y, Z because that’s just the new normal. It’s like the hedonic treadmill. You might feel that you never get to “productive”. Journaling helps to combat this because you can see how far you’ve come.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p><em>Manage time at the macro level with calendars, at the micro level with timers.</em></p>

<p>To manage time, you need a calendar (macro) and a timer (micro).</p>

<h3 id="macro">Macro</h3>

<p>At the macro level, I use the calendar very lightly. Mostly for social things (to ensure I don’t forget an event, and that I don’t double-book things). I also use it to schedule the gym: if the goal is to lift, say, five times a week, I schedule five time blocks to lift. Lifting is special because it has a lot of temporal constraints:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I lift exactly <em>n</em> times per week.</li>
  <li>I lift at most once a day.</li>
  <li>I lift in the evening, which potentially clashes with social things.</li>
  <li>There are adjacency constraints, e.g. doing shoulders the day before chest is bad.</li>
  <li>There is at least one rest day which has to be scheduled strategically (e.g. to have maximal distance between successive deadlift sessions).</li>
</ol>

<p>But outside these two categories, my calendar is empty.</p>

<p>The calendar might be useful to you as a self-binding device. If you keep dragging some project along because you “haven’t made time” for it: consider making a time block in the calendar, and sticking to it. Creating a calendar event is, literally, making time: it’s like calling <code>malloc_time()</code>.</p>

<p>Some people use the calendar as their entire todo list. I think this kind of works if your todo list is very coarse grained: “buy groceries” and “go to the dentist”. But I have a very fine-grained todo list, and putting my tasks in the calendar would make it overwhelming.</p>

<p>Another problem with calendars is they are too time-bound: if I make a calendar block to do something, and I don’t do it, the calendar doesn’t know it. It just sits there, forgotten, in the past. In a todo list, everything gets dragged along until I explicitly complete it. Along the same lines, the calendar is not good for collecting vague ideas and plans for things you want to do in the future, while todo lists are ideal for this.</p>

<h3 id="micro">Micro</h3>

<p>The problem with todo lists is that they’re timeless: there is no sense of urgency. You look at the list and think, I could do the next task now, or in five minutes, or in an hour. There’s always <em>some</em> time left in the day. Or tomorrow. You need a way to manufacture urgency.</p>

<p>If you have ADHD you’ve probably heard of the Pomodoro method, tried it, and bounced off it. The way it’s framed is very neurotypical: it’s scaffolding around <em>doing</em>, but ADHD people often have problems with the doing itself. And so the scaffolding is kind of pointless.</p>

<p>The method works well in three kinds of contexts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Overcoming Aversion:</strong> when you have a large number of microtasks, each of which takes a few seconds to a few minutes, but the number of them, and the uncertainty factor, makes the sum seem a lot larger. A classic example for me is having to reply to like ten different people. Realistically, each person can be handled in 15s. One or two might require a couple of minutes to compose a longer reply. But often I will avoid those tasks like the plague and drag them across the entire day.</p>

    <p>The pomodoro method works here because you’re basically trading (up to) 25m of pain for an entire day’s peace and quiet. So you get all the annoying little tasks together, start a timer, and go through them. And usually you’re done in maybe ten minutes. And you feel <em>really</em> good after, because all those annoying little tasks are done.</p>

    <p>It really is amazing what a little bit of fake urgency can do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Starting:</strong> sometimes the problem is just starting. It is very trite, but it’s true. You have something you <em>want to want</em> to do, but don’t <em>want</em> to do. I want to want to read this book, to learn this topic, to write this blog post, to work on this software project. But I don’t <em>want</em> to do it. The pomodoro method helps you start.</p>

    <p>You’re not committing to finishing the project. You’re not committing to months or weeks or days or even hours of work. You’re committing to a half hour. And if you work just that half hour: great, promise kept. 30m a day, over the course of a single month, is 15h of work. And often I start a 30m timer and end up working four hours, and maybe that’s a good outcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stopping:</strong> dually, sometimes the problem is stopping. If you’re trying to advance multiple projects at the same time, if you hyperfocus on one, it eats into the time you allocated for the others. And more broadly, spending too much time on one project can derail all your plans for the day. Maybe you meant to go to the gym at 6pm but you got so stuck in with this project that it’s 8:30pm and you’re still glued to the screen. So the gym suffers, your sleep schedule suffers, etc.</p>

    <p>Actually stopping when the pomodoro timer goes off can prevent excessive single-mindedness.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the five-minute break at the end of the pomodoro block is useful. It’s a time to get up from the computer, unround your shoulders, practice mindfulness, essentially, all those little things that you want to do a few times throughout the day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>

<p>Stratagems, tricks.</p>

<h2 id="task-selection">Task Selection</h2>

<p><em>To select the next task, pick either the shortest or the most-procrastinated task.</em></p>

<p>I don’t like the word “prioritize”, because it has two subtly different meanings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Weak prioritization” means to sort a list of tasks by some unspecified criterion, that is, to establish an order where some things are prior to another.</li>
  <li>“Strong prioritization” is to sort a list <em>specifically</em> by importance.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Weak prioritization” is something everyone should do: it takes a moment to go over the todo list and drag the tasks into more or less the order in which you will do them. This keeps the most relevant tasks near the top, which is where your eyes naturally go to.</p>

<p>“Strong prioritization” is a terrible job scheduling algorithm. Importance alone is not good enough.</p>

<p>Consider the case where you have a very important task A which takes a long time to finish, and a less important task B which takes 5m to finish. For example, writing an essay versus replying to an email. Which should you do first? I would execute B first, because doing so in turn unblocks B’s successor tasks. If you reply to the email and then get to work on task A, the other person has time to read your email and reply to you. And the conversation moves forward while you are otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>Of course, the pathological version of this is where you only action the quick wins: all the minute little chores get done instantly, but the big tasks, requiring long periods of concentration, get postponed perpetually.</p>

<p>My task-selection algorithm is basically: do the shortest task first, with two exceptions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stalled tasks get a priority bump. If I created a task weeks ago, or if I’ve been postponing in for many days in a row, it has to be done now.</li>
  <li>Content-dependence: if I’m working on a particular project, I’d rather focus on tasks from that project, rather than from the global todo list.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="visual-field-management">Visual Field Management</h2>

<p><em>To remember something, put it in your visual field. Dually: to forget, get it out of sight.</em></p>

<p>Out of sight, out of mind. The corollary: to keep something in mind, put it in your visual field; to keep it out, leave it out.</p>

<p>My desk is very spartan: there’s a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard, and a few trinkets. My desktop is empty. There are no files in it. The dock has only the apps I use frequently. And at a higher level, I try to keep the apartment very clean and orderly. Because everything that’s out of place is a distraction, visual noise. That’s the negative aspect: the things I remove.</p>

<p>The positive aspect, the things I keep in my visual field: most of the time, I have two windows open on my computer the todo list occupies the left third of the screen, the right two-thirds are occupied by whatever window I have open at the time, e.g.:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/notes-on-managing-adhd/desktop.webp" alt="A screenshot of my desktop, showing Todoist on the leftmost one-third of the screen, and Emacs on the rightmost two-thirds of the screen."></p>

<p>And so at a glance, I can see:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What I’m currently working on.</li>
  <li>What I will work on next.</li>
  <li>The list of active projects, so that I don’t forget they exist.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="project-check-ins">Project Check-Ins</h2>

<p><em>Keep in regular contact with long-running projects.</em></p>

<p>A common failure mode I have is, I will fail to finish a project because I forget I even started it. Or, relatedly: I will let a project drag on and on until enough time has passed that my interests have shifted, the sun has set on it, and it is now a slog to finish.</p>

<p>One reason I do this is that creative/intellectual work often requires (or feels like it requires) long stretches of uninterrupted time. So I procrastinate working on something until I can find such a chunk of time. Which never comes. Time passes and the project begins to slip the moorings of my attention, as other new and shiny things arrive.</p>

<p>And sometimes I will pick the project back up after months or years, and I have lost so much context, it’s impossible to know what I even intended. And then you procrastinate even more, because you don’t want to feel the guilty of picking up a project and realizing it has become strange and unfamiliar to you.</p>

<p>One way to combat this is to make regular project checkins. This could be a daily or few-times-a-week recurring task on Todoist that just says “spend 30m on this project”.</p>

<p>You don’t even have to work on the thing: just allocate fifteen minutes to hold the project in your mind and nothing else. If it’s creative writing, you might open the Word document and just look at it. If it’s a programming project: read the Jira board and look at the code again. Don’t write anything. Just read the code. You will likely come up with a few tasks to do, so write those down. Think. Plan. Build up the structures in your mind, refresh the caches. If you can do, do, otherwise, plan, and if you can’t even do that, read.</p>

<p>When you’re doing this regularly, when you’re in regular contact with the project, when the shape of it is clear in your mind, you will have the tasks on the top of your mind, you will no longer feel that you need a giant empty runway of time to work on it, you will be able to work on it in shorter chunks.</p>

<p>To manage long-term creative work, keep in regular contact. That doesn’t mean work on them every day, but maybe <em>look</em> at them every day.</p>

<p>The <a href="#timers">pomodoro method</a> works here. Set a timer for just 25m to keep in touch with the project.</p>

<h2 id="centralize-your-inboxes">Centralize Your Inboxes</h2>

<p><em>Bring all tasks, broadly defined, into one todo list.</em></p>

<p>Life is full of inboxes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>DMs on Twitter, iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Discord, etc.</li>
  <li>Twitter bookmarks</li>
  <li>Browser bookmarks</li>
  <li>Your Downloads folder.</li>
  <li>Messages in my myGov inbox.</li>
  <li>The physical mailbox in my apartment.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are inboxes because they fill up over time and need action to empty. You can also think of them as little domain-specific task lists. “Centralizing your inboxes” means moving all these tasks from their silos into the one, central todo list.</p>

<p>For example, I have a daily task called “catch up” to clear the digital inboxes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go through all my communication apps (email, Discord, Twitter DMs etc) and triage the unread conversations: if something needs replying to, I either reply immediately or make a task to reply later so I don’t forget.</li>
  <li>File the contents of my Downloads folder.</li>
  <li>Go through Twitter/browser bookmarks and turn them into tasks (e.g., if I bookmark an article, the task is to read the article).</li>
</ol>

<p>In this way I mostly manage to stay on top of comms.</p>

<h2 id="inbox-zero">Inbox Zero</h2>

<p><em>All inboxes should be at zero.</em></p>

<p>You have probably heard of inbox zero. It sounds like LinkedIn-tier advice. But if you struggle with comms, with replying to people in a timely manner (or at all), inbox zero is a good strategy. There are two reasons, briefly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inbox zero has no false negatives: if an inbox is empty, you know you’ve handled everything.</li>
  <li>Important communications have a way of “camouflaging” themselves among irrelevance.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, like everything: before you make it into a habit, it feels incredibly time-consuming and labour-intensive. But once you make it into a habit, it’s almost effortless.</p>

<p>So, I will give you an example. I come in to work, and read four emails. Three could’ve been archived outright, one needed a reply from me. And I said, oh, I’ll get to it in a second. And then I got distracted with other tasks. And throughout the day I kept glancing at the email client, and thinking, yeah, I will get to it. Eventually I got used to those four emails: they are the “new normal”, and what’s normal doesn’t require action. I would think: if those emails are there, and I already looked at them, then it’s probably fine. At the end of the day I looked at the inbox again and saw, wait, no, one of those emails was actually important. That’s the failure mode of inbox greater-than-zero: the important stuff hides among the irrelevant stuff, such that a quick glance at the todo list doesn’t show anything obviously wrong. Dually, with inbox zero, if you see a single email in the inbox, you know there’s work to do.</p>

<p>Inbox zero removes ambiguity. If there’s <em>anything</em> in the inbox, you know, unambiguously, you have a task to complete. If there is nothing in the inbox, you know, unambiguously, there is nothing to do. Inbox zero frees you from false negatives, where you think you’ve handled your correspondence but there’s some important email, camouflaged among the trivial ones, that has not been replied to.</p>

<p>A problem with doing inbox zero is most communication apps (like Discord, Slack, iMessage etc.) don’t have a concept of an inbox, just the read/unread flag on conversations. Since there’s no separation between the inbox and the archive, it takes more discipline to ensure every conversation is replied to.</p>

<h2 id="inbox-bankruptcy">Inbox Bankruptcy</h2>

<p><em>If an inbox is overwhelmed, archive it in a recoverable way.</em></p>

<p>By the time I started to become organized I’d already accumulated thousands of bookmarks, unread emails, files in my downloads folder, papers in my physical inbox, etc. It would have been a Herculean effort to file these things away. So I didn’t. All the disorganized files, I wrapped them up in a folder and threw them in my <code>Attic</code> folder. Emails? Archived. Bookmarks? Exported to HTML, archived the export, and deleted them from the browser.</p>

<p>Ideally you should do this once, at the start.</p>

<p>And by archiving things rather than deleting them, you leave open the possibility that as some point in the future, you might be able to action some of those things. Triage the old bookmarks, sort your filesystem, etc.</p>

<h2 id="do-it-on-your-own-terms">Do It On Your Own Terms</h2>

<p><em>Bring aversion-causing tasks into an environment that you control.</em></p>

<p>If you’re averse to doing something, for emotional reasons, one way to overcome the aversion is to do it as much as possible on your own terms.</p>

<p>An example: you have to fill out some government form. You’re averse to it because you worry about making a mistake. And just the thought of opening the form fills you with dread. So, take the boxes in the form, and make a spreadsheet for them. If fonts/colours/emojis/etc. if that makes it feel more personal, or like something you designed and created. Then fill out the form in the spreadsheet. And then copy the values to the form and submit.</p>

<p>This helps because instead of performing the task in this external domain where you feel threatened, you’re performing the task in your own domain, in your own terms.</p>

<p>Another example: you have an email you have to reply to, and you’re anxious about it. Just opening the email client gives you a bad feeling. Instead, try composing the email elsewhere, say, in a text editor. The change of environment changes the emotional connotation: you’re not replying to an email, you’re writing a text. You might even think of it as a work of fiction, a pseudoepigraphy.</p>

<h2 id="replace-interrupts-with-polling">Replace Interrupts with Polling</h2>

<p><em>Turn off notifications, check comms as an explicit task.</em></p>

<p>“Interrupts” means notifications, which arrive at unpredictable and often inconvenient times. “Polling” means manually checking the source of the notifications for things to action.</p>

<p>The obvious benefit of replacing interrupts with polling is you don’t get interrupted by a notification. The less obvious benefit is that when notifications are smeared throughout the day, it is easy for them to fall through the cracks. Something comes in when you’re busy, and you swipe it away, and forget about it, and realize days later you forgot to respond to an important message. Polling is focused: you’ve chosen a block of time, you’re committed to going through the notifications systematically. Instead of random islands of interruptions throughout the day, you have a few short, focused blocks of going through your notifications. Often I get an email while I’m on my phone and think, well, I can’t reply, typing on mobile is horrible, I’m on a train, etc. Polling usually happens at my desk so I have no excuses: I’m in the right environment and in the right mental state.</p>

<p>This is so trite. “Put your phone on Do Not Disturb and silence notifications”. And yet it works. For a long time I resisted this because I aspire to be the kind of person who gets a message and replies within minutes. But I didn’t notice how much notifications were impairing my focus until one day I accidentally put the phone/desktop on DND and had a wonderfully productive, distraction-free day.</p>

<h2 id="accountability-buddy">Accountability Buddy</h2>

<p><em>Get someone to sit next to you while you work.</em></p>

<p>If you’re struggling to work on something, work next to another person. Set a timer and tell them what you’re going to accomplish and when the timer ends tell them how you did. Just being around other people can make it easier to overcome aversion. This is why coworking spaces are useful.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a person around, you might try <a href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate</a>. It works for <a href="https://parconley.com/focusmate/">some people</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’ll start a conversation with Claude, lay out my plans for the day, and update Claude as I do things. If I’m stuck, or if I need help overcoming procrastination, I can ask Claude for help, and it’s easier to do that in an on-going thread because Claude already has the necessary context, so I don’t have to describe what I’m struggling with <em>ab initio</em>.</p>

<h2 id="plan-first-do-later">Plan First, Do Later</h2>

<p><em>Separate planning from action, so if you get distracted while acting, you can return to the plans.</em></p>

<p>Separating planning from doing can be useful. Firstly because planning/doing require different kinds of mental energy. When you’re too tired to do, you can often still plan. Secondly because by separating them you can look back and see how useful the plan was, how much you stuck to it, and then get better at planning.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and most importantly, because for ADHD people doing can be a source of distractions that impair other tasks. From <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108593.Driven_to_Distraction"><em>Driven to Distraction</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first item on the list referred to a cough drop. As I read it, I asked her about it.</p>

  <p>“Oh,” she answered, “that is about a cough drop someone left on the dashboard of our car. The other day I saw the cough drop and thought, I’ll have to throw that away. When I arrived at my first stop, I forgot to take the cough drop to a trash can. When I got back into the car, I saw it and thought, I’ll throw it away at the gas station. The gas station came and went and I hadn’t thrown the cough drop away. Well, the whole day went like that, the cough drop still sitting on the dashboard. When I got home, I thought, I’ll take it inside with me and throw it out. In the time it took me to open the car door, I forgot about the cough drop. It was there to greet me when I got in the car the next morning. […]</p>

  <p>It was such a classic ADD story that I’ve come to call it the “cough drop sign” when a person <strong>habitually has trouble following through on plans on a minute-to-minute, even second-to-second, basis</strong>. This is not due to procrastination per se as much as it is due to <strong>the busyness of the moment interrupting or interfering with one’s memory circuits</strong>. You can get up from your chair, go into the kitchen to get a glass of water, and then in the kitchen forget the reason for your being there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>

<p>When I notice a micro-task like this, my instinct is not to do it, but to put it in the todo list. <em>Then</em> I try to do it immediately. And if I get distracted halfway through, it’s still there, in the todo list.</p>

<p>A practical example is something I call the apartment survey. When I clean the apartment, I start by walking around, noticing everything that needs fixing, and creating a little task for it. Even something as simple as “move the book from the coffee table to the bookshelf”. But I don’t start anything until the survey is done. And when the survey is done, I execute it. And if I get distracted halfway through cleaning the apartment, I have the tasks in the list to go back to.</p>

<h2 id="derailment">Derailment</h2>

<p><em>Introspect to find the things that ruin your productivity and avoid them.</em></p>

<p>Through <a href="#introspection">introspection</a> you can discover the behaviours that derail your productivity.</p>

<p>Lifting in the morning derails the day. Cardio is fine, but if I lift weights in the morning, the rest of the day I’m running on -40 IQ points. The most cognitively demanding thing I can do is wash the dishes. I’m not sure what the physiology is: maybe it’s exhaustion of the glycogen stores, or fatigue byproducts floating around in my brain, or the CNS is busy rewiring the motor cortex. The point is that I try to do the cognitively-demanding things in the morning and lift in the evening.</p>

<p>Motion also does this. I suppose it’s the H in ADHD: hyperactivity. I used to be a big pacer: put on headphones, pace my room back and forth daydreaming for hours and hours. Some days I would pace so much my legs were sore. To think, I have to be in motion. But sometimes I’ve thought enough, and it’s time to do.</p>

<p>Music, too, derails me. If I start listening to music very soon I start pacing the room and it’s over. Music is almost like reverse methylphenidate: it makes me restless, mentally hyperactive, and inattentive.</p>

<p>So, to be productive I have to not move too much, and be in silence, and not have fried my brain with exercise.</p>

<h2 id="using-ocd-to-defeat-adhd">Using OCD to Defeat ADHD</h2>

<p><em>If being organized makes you feel good, spend more on organizing your productivity system.</em></p>

<p>In a sense, having a really complex productivity system is like trying to use OCD to defeat ADHD, to use high neuroticism to defeat low conscientiousness. There’s an element of truth to that, sure (see mastery of drudgery).</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: you have to play to your strengths. You have to. If you are very OCD and you like order and systems and planning but you struggle with doing, then, yeah, it might work, for you, to spend more energy on the trappings of productivity (ensuring your todo list is properly formatted, organized, etc.) if that bleeds over into making it easier to do the real, meaningful things.</p>

<p>For example: I like emojis in my todo list. The chores have a 🧼 emoji, the comms tasks have an ✉️ emoji. That kind of thing. Makes it easy to see at a glance what kind of things I have to do, to group them by category. But Todoist doesn’t support emoji icons on tasks, unlike Notion, so adding the emojis takes a bit more effort: I have to open <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> and search for the emoji I want and paste it into the task title. It adds a little friction each time I create a task, but the benefit is I enjoy using the todo list more.</p>

<h2 id="the-master-of-drudgery">The Master of Drudgery</h2>

<p><em>Avoid spending too much productive time on worthless chores.</em></p>

<p>A productivity antipattern: indulging too much in “quick wins”.</p>

<p>There’s this running joke, or meme, online, about the kind of person who has this huge, colossal productivity system, but they get nothing done. They have five todo list apps and everything is categorized and indexed and sorted, but their material output is zero. They complete a hundred tasks a day and when you interrogate what those tasks are they are “brush my teeth” or “reorganize my bookshelf”. There’s a lot of truth to that.</p>

<p>Every task falls into one of two categories: the quick wins, and everything else. Life is not made of quick wins. Creative, generative, open-ended work requires long periods of focused work. A lot of unpleasant, aversion-causing things have to be done. But the quick wins are infinite: there’s always some micro-chore to do around the house, for example.</p>

<p>I don’t have advice specifically on avoiding this. But you should notice if you’re doing it and course-correct.</p>

<h2 id="thrashing">Thrashing</h2>

<p><em>Don’t let procrastiation on one task derail everything else.</em></p>

<p>A bad failure mode I have is: I have a task <em>T</em> that I have to do, but I can’t, because of some kind of aversion. But when I try to work on other things, the alarms are going off in my head, telling me to work on <em>T</em> because you’ve been putting this off for so long and life is finite and the years are short and all that. The end result is that because one thing is blocked, everything grinds to a halt. It’s a very annoying state to be in.</p>

<p>And I don’t have a perfect solution, but I try to manage it but applying a sense of proportionality, “render unto Caesar” etc. You can’t ignore <em>T</em> forever, dually, you probably won’t solve it in the next ten minutes. But you can timebox <em>T</em>: allocate some block of time every day to try to advance it, or at least to work around it, e.g. to ask a friend for help, for example. And the rest of the day you can dedicate to moving other things forward.</p>

<h2 id="put-travel-in-the-calendar">Put Travel in the Calendar</h2>

<p><em>Calculate travel time ahead of time to avoid being late.</em></p>

<p>I am chronically late. So if I have a calendar event like a party at someone’s home, I will go on Google Maps and measure the travel time (from my home or wherever I’m likely to be) to the destination, and make a time block for that. e.g., if it takes 30m to go to the dentist and back, this is what my calendar looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/notes-on-managing-adhd/travel.webp" alt="A screenshot of my calendar, showing an event to go to the dentist, bookended by two events to travel to and from the dentist." width="300"></p>

<p>This ensures I leave my home on time. If it’s something especially important I often add 15m to the travel block as a buffer.</p>



<p><em>Use tools that are effective and you like.</em></p>

<p>What productivity app should I use? Reminders? Linear? Todoist? A bullet journal?</p>

<p>Use something that feels good and works. That’s all. Personally I use Todoist. A lot of people think todo list apps are commodities, but when you have an app open for 98% of your screentime, the little subtleties really add up. I’ve tried using Reminders, Linear, as my todo lists, and building my own. My productivity always suffers and I always go back to Todoist.</p>

<p>One app is better than two: the more disjoint things you have to pay attention to, the worse it is.</p>

<p>If you’re a software engineer I strongly advise against building your own, which is a terrible form of procrastination for creative types.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>It appears that it was US military communications doctrine to not send the exact same message twice using different encryption ("none" counting as one type of encryption), and the term of art for changing a message to avoid that was indeed "paraphrase".</p>
<p>I managed to dig up a US Army document on Cryptology from roughly that era that appears to discuss paraphrasing. The document in question is <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/friedman-documents/publications/FOLDER_238/41748889078809.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Department of the Army Technical Manual TM 32-220</a><sup>(pdf)</sup>, dated 1950, titled "BASIC CRYPTOGRAPHY". It apparently supersedes previous documents TM-484 from March 1945 and TM 11-485 from June 1944. It would probably be more ideal to look at them, since they are closer to the time you are interested in, but I was not able to find them online.</p>
<p>Here's what this declassified manual had to say about "paraphrasing", from Chapter 7, in the section Fundamental Rules of Cryptographic Security, section 84, subsection b, rule 3 (titled "Text of messages")</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Never repeat in the clear the identical text of a message once
sent in cryptographic form, or repeat in cryptographic form  the text
of a message once sent in the clear. Anything which  will enable an
alert enemy to compare a given piece of plain  text with a cryptogram
that supposedly contains this plain  text is highly dangerous to the
safety of the cryptographic  system. Where information must be given
out for publicity,  or where information is handled by many persons,
the plain text version should be very carefully <em>paraphrased</em> before
distribution, to minimize the data an enemy might obtain  from an
accurate comparison of the cryptographic text with  the equivalent,
original plain text. <strong>To <em>paraphrase</em> a message  means to rewrite it so
as to change its original wording as  much as possible without
changing the meaning of the message. This is done by altering the
positions of sentences in  the message, by altering the positions of
subject, predicate,  and modifying phrases or clauses in the sentence,
and by  altering as much as possible the diction by the use of
synonyms and synonymous expressions.</strong> In this process, deletion  rather
than expansion of the wording of the message is  preferable, because
if an ordinary message is <em>paraphrased</em>  simply by expanding it along
its original lines, an expert can  easily reduce the <em>paraphrased</em>
message to its lowest terms, and  the resultant wording will be
practically the original message.  It is very important to eliminate
repeated words or proper  names, if at all possible, by the use of
carefully selected  pronouns; by the use of the words "former,"
"latter," "first-mentioned," "second-mentioned"; or by other means.
After  carefully <em>paraphrasing</em>, the message can be sent in the other
key or code.</p>
<p>(b) Never send the literal plain text or a <em>paraphrased</em>
version of  the plain text of a message which has been or will be
transmitted in cryptographed form except as specifically provided  in
appropriate regulations</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(emphasis mine)</em></p>
<p>In fact the allies would have have known intimately about how this was possible, because this is one of the ways they ended up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine#Breaking_Enigma" rel="noreferrer">decrypting the stronger German Enigma cipher</a>. Captured machines using simpler ciphers were used to break those simpler ciphers. The fact that the Germans were encrypting the <em>exact same messages</em> in both ciphers meant the allies could know (for those messages) what both the unencrypted and encrypted messages were, which allowed them to decrypt the stronger cyphers as well, or quickly figure out what today's code was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was
German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically
introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of
key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied
cryptologists to succeed.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://algassert.com/post/2500">https://algassert.com/post/2500</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45082587">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2001, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0112176">quantum computers factored the number 15</a>.
It’s now 2025, and quantum computers haven’t yet factored the number 21.
It’s sometimes claimed this is proof there’s been no progress in quantum computers.
But there’s actually a much more surprising reason 21 hasn’t been factored yet, which jumps out at you when contrasting the operations used to factor 15 and to factor 21.</p>

<p>The circuit (the series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">quantum logic gates</a>) that was run to factor 15 can be seen in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0112176#page=15">Figure 1b of “Experimental realization of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://algassert.com/assets/2025-08-30-why-no-factor-21/factor15.png"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important cost here is the number of entangling gates.
This factoring-15 circuit has 6 two-qubit entangling gates (a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate">CNOT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_logic_gates#Relative_phase_gates">CPHASE</a> gates).
It also has 2 Toffoli gates, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toffoli_gate#/media/File:Qcircuit_ToffolifromCNOT.svg">each decompose into 6 two-qubit entangling gates</a>.
So there’s a total of 21 entangling gates in this circuit.</p>

<p>Now, for comparison, here is a circuit for factoring 21.
Sorry for rotating it, but I couldn’t get it to fit otherwise.
Try counting the Toffolis:</p>

<p><img src="https://algassert.com/assets/2025-08-30-why-no-factor-21/factor21.svg"></p>

<p><em>(<a href="https://algassert.com/assets/2025-08-30-why-no-factor-21/factor21.qasm">Here’s an OPENQASM2 version of the circuit</a>, so you can test it produces the right distribution if you’re inclined to do so.)</em></p>

<p>In case you lost count: this circuit has 191 cnot gates and 369 Toffoli gates, implying a total of 2405 entangling gates.
That’s 115x more entangling gates than the factoring-15 circuit.
<strong>The factoring-21 circuit is more than one hundred times more expensive than the factoring-15 circuit.</strong></p>

<p>When I ask people to guess how many times larger the factoring-21 circuit is, compared to the factoring-15 circuit, there’s a tendency for them to assume it’s 25% larger.
Or maybe twice as large.
The fact that it’s <em>two orders of magnitude more expensive</em> is shocking.
So I’ll try to explain why it happens.</p>

<p><em>(Quick aside: the amount of optimization that has gone into this factoring-21 circuit is probably unrepresentative of what would be possible when factoring big numbers.
I think a more plausible amount of optimization would produce a circuit with 500x the cost of the factoring-15 circuit… but a 100x overhead is sufficient to make my point.
Regardless, special thanks to Noah Shutty for running expensive computer searches to find the conditional-multiplication-by-4-mod-21 subroutine used by this circuit.)</em></p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-100x-come-from">Where does the 100x come from?</h2>

<p>A key background fact you need to understand is that the dominant cost of a quantum factoring circuit comes from doing a series of conditional modular multiplications under superposition.
To factor an $n$-bit number $N$, Shor’s algorithm will conditionally multiply an accumulator by $m_k = g^{2^k} \pmod{N}$ for each $k &lt; 2n$ (where $g$ is a randomly chosen value coprime to $N$).
Sometimes people also worry about the frequency basis measurement at the end of the algorithm, which is crucial to the algorithm’s function, but from a cost perspective it’s irrelevant.
(It’s negligible due by <a href="https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/35889/is-qft-qubit-recycling-compatible-with-zeckendorfs-fibonacci-representation-of">an optimization called “qubit recycling”</a>, which I also could have used to reduce the qubit count of the factoring-21 circuit, but in this post I’m just counting gates so meh).</p>

<p>There are three effects that conspire to make the factoring-15 multiplications substantially cheaper than the factoring-21 multiplications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All but two of the factoring-15 multiplications end up multiplying by 1.</li>
  <li>The first multiplication is always ~free, because its input is known to be 1.</li>
  <li>The one remaining factoring-15 multiplication can be implemented with only two CSWAPs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s consider the case where $g=2$.
In that case, when factoring 15, the constants to conditionally multiply by would be:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print([pow(2, 2**k, 15) for k in range(8)])
[2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>First, notice that the last six constants are 1.
Multiplications by 1 can be implemented by doing nothing.
So the factoring-15 circuit is only paying for 2 of the expected 8 multiplications.</p>

<p>Second, notice that the first conditional multiplication (by 2) will either leave the accumulator storing 1 (when its control is off) or storing 2 (when its control is on).
This can be achieved much more cheaply by performing a controlled xor of $1 \oplus 2 = 3$ into the accumulator.</p>

<p>Third, notice that the only remaining multiplication is a multiplication by 4.
Because 15 is one less than a power of 2, multiplying by 2 modulo 15 can be implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift">circular shift</a>.
A multiplication by 4 is just two multiplications by 2, so it can also be implemented by a circular shift.
This is a <em>very rare property</em> for a modular multiplication to have, and here it reduces what should be an expensive operation into a pair of conditional swaps.
(If you go back and look at the factoring-15 circuit at the top of the post, the 2 three-qubit gates are being used to implement these two conditional swaps.)</p>

<p>You may worry that these savings are specific to the choice of $g=2$ and $N=15$.
And they are in fact specific to $N=15$.
But they aren’t specific to $g=2$.
They occur for all possible choices of $g$ when factoring 15.</p>

<p>For contrast, let’s now consider what happens when factoring 21.
Using $g=2$, the multiplication constants would be:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;  print([pow(2, 2**k, 21) for k in range(10)])
[2, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to be a lot more expensive.</p>

<p>First, there’s no multiplications by 1, so the circuit has to pay for every multiplication instead of only a quarter.
That’s a ~4x relative cost blowup vs factoring 15.
Second, although the first-one’s-free trick does still apply, proportionally speaking it’s not as good.
It cheapens 10% of the multiplications rather than 50%.
That’s an extra ~1.8x cost blowup vs factoring 15.
Third, the multiplication by 4 and 16 can’t be implemented with two CSWAPs.
The best conditionally-multiply-by-4-mod-21 circuit that I know is the one being used in the diagram above, and it uses 41 Toffolis.
These more expensive multiplications add a final bonus ~20x cost blowup vs factoring 15.</p>

<p><em>(Aside: multiplication by 16 mod 21 is the inverse of multiplying by 4 mod 21, and the circuits are reversible, so multiplying by 16 uses the same number of Toffolis as multiplying by 4.)</em></p>

<p>These three factors (multiplying-by-one, first-one’s-free, and multiplying-by-swapping) explain the 100x blowup in cost of factoring 21, compared to factoring 15.
And this 100x increase in cost explains why no one has factored 21 with a quantum computer yet.</p>



<p>Another contributor to the huge time gap between factoring 15 and factoring 21 is that the 2001 factoring of 15 was done with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_quantum_computer">NMR quantum computer</a>.
These computers were known to have inherent scaling issues, and in fact it’s debated whether NMR computers were even properly “quantum”.
If the 2001 NMR experiment doesn’t count, I think the actually-did-the-multiplications runner-up is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08852#page=2">2015 experiment done with an ion trap quantum computer</a> (<a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2673">discussed by Scott Aaronson at the time</a>).</p>

<p>Yet another contributor is the overhead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction">quantum error correction</a>.
Performing 100x more gates requires 100x lower error, and the most plausible way of achieving that is error corection.
Error correction requires redundancy, and could easily add a 100x overhead on qubit count.
Accounting for this, I could argue that factoring 21 will be ten thousand times more expensive than factoring 15, rather than “merely” a hundred times more expensive.</p>

<p>There are papers that claim to have factored 21 with a quantum computer.
For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13855">here’s one from 2021</a>.
But, as far as I know, all such experiments are guilty of using optimizations that imply the code generating the circuit had access to information equivalent to knowing the factors (as explained in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7007">“Pretending to factor large numbers on a quantum computer” by Smolin et al</a>).
Basically: they don’t do the multiplications, because the multiplications are hard, but the multiplications are what make it factoring instead of simpler forms of period finding.
So I don’t count them.</p>

<p>There is unfortunately a trickle of bullshit results that claim to be quantum factoring demonstrations.
For example, I have a <a href="https://sigbovik.org/2025/proceedings.pdf#page=146">joke paper in this year’s sigbovik proceedings that cheats in a particularly silly way</a>.
More seriously, I enjoyed <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf">“Replication of Quantum Factorisation Records with an 8-bit Home Computer, an Abacus, and a Dog”</a> making fun of some recent egregious papers.
I also recommend Scott Aaronson’s post <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4447">“Quantum computing motte-and-baileys”</a>, which complains about papers that benchmark “variational” factoring techniques while ignoring the lack of any reason to expect them to scale.</p>

<p>Because of the large cost of quantum factoring numbers (that aren’t 15), factoring isn’t yet a good benchmark for tracking the progress of quantum computers.
If you want to stay abreast of progress in quantum computing, you should be paying attention to the arrival quantum error correction (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687">surface codes getting more reliable as their size is increased</a>) and to architectures solving core scaling challenges (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15633">lost neutral atoms being continuously replaced</a>).</p>

    <p>We all know the current US President is one hell of an orator and often assures us that he has “the best words”:</p>

<p>I went to an Ivy League school. I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.</p>

<p>The man knows words. Says so right there. While some might view his non-sequitur ramblings as the nascent stages of dementia or an unfiltered ADHD brain launching into successive short (at times racist) bullet-point diatribes based on the last word or phrase he said like a cursed game of word association, the President asserts this is not the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I do the weave. You know what the weave is? I’ll talk about, like, nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together. And it’s like - and friends of mine that are, like, English professors - they say, it’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5107714/breaking-down-former-president-donald-trumps-rambling-linguistic-style">The Weave</a>” re-entered my consciousness this week after I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ds1Cz-LpA">a quick snippet of an Oval Office event</a> where Trump says the (“radical left-wing”) CBO projects tariffs will reduce the deficit by $4 trillion USD. I was skeptical –<a href="https://youtu.be/ab9yLd3OjSw">and for good reason</a>– but I tuned in. What shocked me was not the complete lack of specifics about the CBO projection, but rather the actual reason for the Oval Office meeting: a FIFA event? Wow.</p>

<p>For awhile now, I’ve clued into the cyclical pattern of his speeches, little snippets of “the best words” and talking points assembled like a ransom note cut from a magazine. I often wondered if it’s possible to diagram “the weave”. The “branching” narratives Trump uses made me think a git-graph-style visualization was apropos. So I grabbed a transcript and got to work.</p>
<p>For my first attempt, I used <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html">Mermaid.js’ GitGraph Diagram</a> which worked well but only supports horizontal charts. As I sat with it I realized I wanted a chronological list of statements that read like a transcript. I repurposed the Mermaid’s GitGraph DSL and made a web component called <code>&lt;git-graph&gt;</code> to help me visualize and document Trump’s derailing trains of thought from the above event.</p>

<p>By my count in that four-minute address there were ten distinct themes or “branches”, most of which are common grievances or rhetorical themes found in nearly all Trump speeches. I used “cherry-picking” to model callbacks to a previous statement (e.g. “the stock market is up”) that seem to reverberate into later trains of thought, a quintessential feature of the weave.</p>
<p>Four minutes of the weave was about all I could handle but I think this visualization models what I experience when trying to follow along to the President’s speeches. One or two phrases on a topic, then jumping to a new topic, weaving in a (sometimes unrelated) point from a previous topic to make the thought appear more cohesive and linear, then driving deep down an inconsequential topic. When he talks so long about ten different topics at a time, I’d forgive you for thinking he said something salient. But when you break it down you see it for what it is: a mishmash of talking points.</p>

<div><p>Go Beato, go! </p><p>For 15+ years, Saving Country Music has been on the warpath against the completely ludicrous intellectual property regime that disallows even a small snippet of music to be featured in a podcast without draconious repercussions, including removing episodes, and deleting entire accounts, while not offering any reasonable alternative solutions to the issue. </p><p>On YouTube videos, creators can freely filch copyrighted photos and other people’s videos virtually free of ramifications. You can take an entire 2 1/2 hour film, impose it over a background, and upload it to YouTube, and usually avoid any problems. But feature a barely audible 8 1/2-second clip of music underneath audio dialogue, and you could have your entire podcast career evaporate overnight. </p><p>Music labels have been leaving major opportunities to promote their catalogs and performers on the table with their punitive copyright claims that make it impossible to feature music on music podcasts and other platforms. And instead of trying to build a system where perhaps there’s more reasonable revenue sharing or other opportunities for artists and songwriters through these podcast platforms to promote their music, it’s the punitive measures of record labels that eliminate these opportunities in lose/lose scenarios. </p><p>Music video podcaster Rick Beato with his massive 5 million-plus subscriber base finally got fed up with it, and posted a rant on Tuesday, August 19th about this, and, it’s a thing of beauty. </p><p><em>“I hate making these videos, but I really need to because it seems the only thing that ever gets done is when you talk about this stuff,”</em> Beato starts off. But one of the nauseating things about this issue is that we’ve been talking about it for going on two decades, and still nothing is getting done about it. Saving Country Music posted about this issue <strong><a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/music-remains-sidelined-from-immense-podcast-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">in 2024</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://savingcountrymusic.com/music-being-left-on-the-sidelines-of-the-podcast-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">in 2020</a></strong>, and as far back as 2010, with no real movement on the issue. </p><p>Luckily though, Rick Beato has a much bigger bullhorn, though he has brought up the issue before to no avail, though not in such a dedicated and forceful manner. </p><p>Beato’s specific beef is with Universal Music Group, who is the most notorious actor for bringing these heavy handed claims against song clip uses that clearly fall under the fair use clauses of American copyright law, let alone are being brought against a guy who operates a massive music platform that promotes artists. But since there’s rarely humans making any of these decisions and it’s automated by bots, they don’t understand these claims are against Universal Music’s best interests. </p><p><em>“I’m doing interviews with people and playing the music that they either wrote or recorded, or they produced,”</em> Beato explains. <em>“You need to play people music to talk about it. That is the definition of fair use. These are interviews with people about their careers. Why are these record labels wanting to take down content about artist that have records on their label? What sense does that make?”</em> <br><em><br>“Give it a rest,”</em> he continues. <em>“My God. If I didn’t fight these three claims, my channel would get taken down with my 2,000 videos. Is that ridiculous? It’s ridiculous to me. And they’re for interviews.”</em></p></div>

<div><p>People continue to ask, “Why doesn’t Saving Country Music has a podcast?” Because what’s the point of having a music podcast when you can’t feature music? In fact, after over a decade of refusing to start one, I finally did, music free. What happened? About a dozen episodes in, someone took out a claim, and not only were all the episodes deleted, so was the entire account, even though no music even appeared on any of the episodes. I was given absolutely no recourse to fight whatever false claim had been made. </p><p>For the record, Saving Country Music’s <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/22c3jmmYIz8y4OfVQLTcNS?si=737ab19922384772" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Country History X</a></strong> podcast remains live. But it’s been difficult to pursue it, knowing it could summarily disappear at any moment. People have lost thousands of episodes and videos over this issue. Meanwhile, you can use extended song clips on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. It has become an excellent way to promote songs and artists. These networks facilitate this music sharing, and credit the artists for their work. </p><p>The music industry continues to so colossal fail the artists and catalogs they represent, and the fans they’re supposed to serve with this current system of how podcasts are handled. If everything changes today thanks to the Rick Beato rant, it would still be 15 years too late. But at least it would happen. The powers that be in the music industry need to recognize that the power base in media is moving to podcasting, and they need to make music available to podcasters in a way that’s fair to all parties. </p><p>In fact in some respects we’re moving backwards on this issue. A couple of years ago, Spotify did offer the ability for podcasters to embed full songs in episodes. But they’ve since discontinued that program. </p><p>Let’s do this. It’s well beyond the time to solve this problem. You aren’t screwing podcasters. You’re screwing artists who could be using podcasts to help promote their music. Hopefully Rick Beato’s rant finally reaches the right ears. </p><p>– – – – – – –</p></div>

  <p><span>August 30, 2025</span>

  </p>


  <p>I got a Kobo in 2016 after borrowing my mom's old one for a year before that. It probably is responsible for getting me reading again after high school. I used to be an avid reader, the sort of kid who would have to be told to put down the book and go to sleep, and who would then creep slowly to the bookshelf to pick it up again without arousing suspicion after the light had been turned out. I think I slowed my reading for fun as the work load of school increased, and stopped when moving every four months for internships in university. Having something small and portable that I could load books onto changed that and got my momentum going again. I now loosely grade how much I'm thriving by how much I'm reading, as an indirect indicator of how not burnt out I am.</p><p>It fared me quite well, but I had a few issues with it. Library books would randomly not work on it, even if they would show up on, for example, the Libby app on my phone. It also came with a way to sync articles to it via Pocket, but it always required a little too much forethought for me: I had to remember to find and save articles beforehand in order to then read them later. There were some services to do this automatically via RSS but the syncing process itself was just slow enough that I found myself rarely doing it. Also, Mozilla has now killed Pocket as a service. In the middle of writing this, they announced support for Instapaper instead, but it has the same workflow issues for me. My partner reads on her phone, but something about reading on a screen grates on me after a while, and makes it too easy to jump to something else.</p><p>So I was intrigued when I heard about the Minimal Phone, an Android phone with an epaper display. It wasn't the first epaper Android device I'd seen—I've seen reviews saying the Boox Palma is actually pretty great—but it was the idea of this being an actual <em>phone</em> that can take a sim card that really get me interested. What if I could read the news and blogs on what looks like paper while commuting, without having the forethought of downloading or syncing something? I might otherwise spend that time staring into space or looking at nothing on Bluesky. I'd probably rather be reading a bit of a book, or other longer-form writing. So I ordered one as a gift to myself.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/mp.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/mp.jpg"></a></p><p>The MP01</p></div><p>I figured I might be a good fit for this device. I don't really watch videos on my phone. I send messages a bit, but not urgently. Most of the time I'm at or near a full keyboard anyway. I take some photos, but not that many any more. I feel like the photo winds changed for me sometime in university and I now feel weird posting Nice Photos to social media. Who are those for, really? I now send quick photos directly to friends mostly, and they don't have to be print quality or anything. They just have to be visible.</p><p>With that in mind, I went in treating it like an experiment. I still have my Kobo that has its annoyances but works. I still have a fully functional Pixel 8 phone. I don't <em>need</em> this to work. At worst, this could just be an alternate ereader for me. So when it arrived mid-July, I started testing it full-time to see how it'd go, with my normal phone in my bag just in case.</p><p>Overall, I actually really like it! I absolutely would not recommend this device to everyone—I'll get into why later—but it's been working pretty well for <em>me.</em></p><h2> How the Minimal Phone works</h2><p>This phone is around the same size of my Pixel 8. It's just a tad shorter and just a tad wider. I don't really feel the shortness, but I do feel the wideness a bit, which makes it more comfortable to read on. The bottom third of the height is taken up by a physical keyboard, and the top two thirds are an epaper display.</p><p>It's just Android under there, with a black-and-white epaper display. It comes with a few launchers, and I use one that works like a pretty traditional launcher, but comes with some built in icon choices that look sharp on the display.</p><p>There's a side button between the phone's volume keys that you can tap to flash the display to clear ghosting. I don't find myself doing this often—ghosting is not that bad—but if you press and hold it, it opens the display settings. <em>This</em> is something I do all the time.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/settings.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/settings.jpg"></a></p><p>The quick display settings screen, which you get to by pressing and holding the button between the volume keys.</p></div><p>From the settings screen, you can turn on and off the light on the display and on the keyboard, and also change the display light's colour temperature. I mostly leave those off; I only need those if I'm outside after dark, and the controls are big enough that I can turn them on easily enough in low light.</p><p>The most important setting is the refresh rate at the bottom. The slowest setting has the slowest refresh rate, but the highest quality visuals: always showing nice shades of grey, and with less ghosting but more flashing as it updates. The fastest setting (which, to be clear, is still not very fast) has much less flashing, a little more ghosting, and dithers pure black and white rather than showing any shades of grey. The middle setting, "hybrid" mode, is a combination of the two: it uses the faster setting while things are moving onscreen, and then updates to the slower, higher quality render when movement stops. I generally keep the phone in this hybrid mode, except for a few specific cases.</p><p>The keyboard feels pretty good, and it's a comfortable size to type on with two thumbs. I can't really one-handed type on this phone; it's a tad too wide for that, but the width is worth it for easier reading. I really appreciate them including the keyboard here, as the display looks great but is definitely not all that responsive, so typing would be a lot more frustrating without this.</p><h2> The great parts</h2><p>This thing is <em>so</em> nice to read on.</p><p>I hate reading on screens. Something about dark mode especially messes with my eyes, but even without that, I've never enjoyed reading articles on my phone. Too easy to get distracted, the minor eye strain... This device though, the epaper display looks great. It's not especially high resolution or anything, but I could spend a long time reading on this without issue. I just spent two flights (Toronto to Vancouver and back again) just reading books on this, and I'd do it again. It's really crisp and visible in the sun too.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/reading.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/reading.jpg"></a></p><p>A page of a book in the Libby app.</p></div><p>It's super easy to queue up library book holds and read them all from the phone. I have had zero issues with that. Being able to add new things on-the-go has also made it really easy to grab another book on the spot once I finish one. I definitely have found myself reading more books this past month and a half.</p><p>I also now am more likely to read people's blogs on an RSS reader than scroll through social media. I wasn't setting out to fully purge social media or anything, but I certainly feel a little more fulfilled after reading something that someone has clearly put time and effort into.</p><p>Possibly as a consequence of the display technology, I also generally get 2 days of usage out of a charge. Most days I finish with 70% battery remaining, letting me go another day with some buffer room. On some really low usage days, I could maybe even go more, but already this is great. On a high usage day, I'll maybe end with 50%, which is still fine by me.</p><p>This is secondary, by far, but I also feel now that I can fully turn off autocorrect, as this phone has a physical keyboard. Most of the time (with important caveats), I don't make typos. So I no longer have to suffer through autocorrect changing programming terms (which I still type a lot of), changing my capitalization, or doing its own insane capitalization (why would it format "city Hall" with just one capital? Commit to capitals or no capitals, don't do this awkward mix!)</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/theverge.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/theverge.jpg" width="600"></a></p><p>An article on The Verge. Hey, it was the top post in the feed when I took the photo!</p></div><p>As another minor note, the fingerprint reader is actually quite fast. When it remembers my fingerprints, it's super reliable. ("What do you mean, <em>when</em> it remembers?" I'll get into it later, there's a pretty bad bug here. But in regular usage, it really does work well.)</p><p>Everything else this phone does, it does a little worse than a normal phone, but not so much worse that it's a problem. I assume it would be a lot worse at watching videos but I never really did that much on my old phone anyway. So on the whole, this phone works really well where I want it to, and generally gets out of my way for the usual stuff. I keep using it without really worrying about it.</p><p>The camera, once set up properly, is pretty passable. Well, the selfie camera is in a super awkward spot, but I don't really find myself using it anyway. But other photos look decent enough that I'm not embarrassed to send them to people!</p><div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/cat.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/cat.jpg"></a></p><p>My cat Pigeon looking out the window.</p></div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/leaves.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/leaves.jpg"></a></p><p>Toronto in the summer.</p></div></div><div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/selfie.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/selfie.jpg"></a></p><p>The selfie camera is a little sketchy, I wouldn't rely on it.</p></div>  <div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/wizard.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/wizard.jpg"></a></p><p>Phil Wizard breaking on Kits Beach in Vancouver.</p></div></div><h2> Growing pains</h2><p>Even though I do really like this thing, and am continuing to use it as my primary device, there are a lot of rough edges. This device is made by, primarily, two people (although they've been adding more developers in the past few weeks), so naturally there will be a lot of rough edges. You have to be willing to accept that if you're going to use this phone. They do make updates, but the pace is slow, and they are definitely bogged down by customer support and shipping/manufacturing logistics, so you need to not bank on fixes happening quickly.</p><p>There's a double-tap-to-wake feature that you can't turn off, and it takes a sec once locked to stop responding to inputs. Consequently, I now put this in my pocket with the display facing out, which is opposite of what I used to do, in order to prevent accidentally disturbing it in my pocket. Doing that, I haven't had issues, but it's an adjustment you have to make for this phone right now.</p><p>There are a few things you'll probably need to do to the device to make it work well for you. One of them involves the camera. By default, the camera super aggressively denoises its photos, resulting in images that look like they came off of my flip phone from 2008. However, if you use the Open Camera app, switch it to use the Camera 2 API, it then lets you turn off noise reduction in the settings. The resulting images look much crisper, and do have noise, but a tasteful—dare I say aesthetic?—amount of noise. There is no Pixel-style HDR in these photos, but now that that look is everywhere, the resulting photos are... kind of refreshing.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/lexi.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/lexi.jpg"></a></p><p>Taking a photo of fast a moving subject is quite hard on this thing due to the refresh rate of the screen. But then again, doesn't a photo like this capture the moment better? This is my aunt's cat Lexi.</p></div><p>The phone also uses something called Duraspeed to aggressively turn off background apps. This works well in general, but it also can stifle some notifications that you <em>do</em> want, and also can affect background audio. I know some people fully turn Duraspeed off, but I've just turned it off for my messaging apps and my music/podcast apps. I've had no notification or background process related issues since doing so.</p><p>I also found that the backlight was way too bright, and I didn't really want any lights on most of the time anyway. I found that when opening the display settings, it'd turn all the lights back on. But if I save a preset, then it'd stick. You can do that by changing the settings, and then pressing and holding on the wrench icon to save it to your custom preset.</p><p>Finally, the hybrid refresh mode needs things to stop moving in order to lock in on a higher quality render. That means animated ads are somehow even more annoying than they normally are. Thankfully, Firefox for Android lets you install addons, such as uBlock Origin, to deal with that.</p><h2> Bugs</h2><p>The most annoying bug is that this phone will occasionally restart and forget your fingerprint, forcing you to enter your PIN. I don't know why this happens. I can go for a few weeks with it working fine, and then it'll just forget. I can still get in with the PIN, so it's not locking me out, but there's really never a good time to re-set up a fingerprint, and typing a PIN on the onscreen display is slow and cumbersome. This is the bug I hope gets fixed the most.</p><p>Another bug has something to do with the screen refresh rate, and something to do with responding to keyboard input. If you're on a slower refresh rate and are typing quickly, sometimes it misses keypresses, and you have to go back and fix things. This is also quite annoying, but doesn't seem to happen on the highest screen refresh rate. As a workaround, when I'm sending messages, I switch to the fastest refresh setting. This one-or-the-other approach isn't great though (I still want photos sent to me in messaging apps to look nice!), so I'd love to see that improved over time.</p><p>I also <em>have</em> to use the phone in the lowest refresh rate for Google Maps in order to see the streets on the map. The color scheme is just too low contrast for the high refresh rate's dithering. The hybrid setting doesn't work either: your location on the map is always slightly moving and so it never locks in and renders a higher-quality image. Arguably, this is a problem with Google Maps because they don't have a high contrast mode. Surely that would have accessibility benefits beyond just this weird device!</p><div><p><a href="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/maps.jpg"><img src="https://www.davepagurek.com/content/images/2025/08/maps.jpg" width="600"></a></p><p>Google Maps when in hybrid or fast mode. Where did the streets go??</p></div><p>There's a software update that the Minimal team has been working on for almost two months that will apparently address the fingerprint forgetting issue, make double-tap-to-wake optional, significantly increase the refresh rate on the fast refresh mode, and let you save per-app refresh rate settings. That'll address some of my problems for sure! But it also hasn't shipped yet. To use this device is an exercise in patience, and being accepting of imperfections.</p><h2> Feature Requests</h2><p>None of these are dealbreakers for me, but here's what I'm hoping to see in the future:</p><ul><li>I feel like the vibration on the phone is a tad aggressive. Not every vibration is, though—Facebook Messenger notifications feel like the right level. I'd love to be able to adjust the cap for vibration intensity!</li><li>I would love emoji search in the keyboard. But I also don't use that many different emoji or symbols, and by now the ones I do use are in the recents list, so it's fine. But the one time I need to use a weird one, it'd be nice to have!</li><li>I wish the hybrid refresh mode would work well with camera apps. As it is, I think too much of the screen is updating at once, so it flashes a large part of the display every frame, making it really hard to see. If I put the phone in fast mode, there's no flashing, which is great! But then when I take a photo and tap on the thumbnail to see it, I have to switch back to hybrid or slow mode to see a clearer, non-dithered version. This is a little annoying, and I feel could be improved, but then again I'm not really using this to take a lot of photos anyway.</li></ul><h2> Concluding the experiment</h2><p>It's been more than a month, and despite not everything being perfect, I'm going to continue using this phone. I do occasionally switch to my Pixel 8 though. I use my Pixel 8 for running for its better waterproofing. When I needed to get actual good, postable photos from SIGGRAPH two weeks ago, I just used my Pixel 8. When seeing LCD Soundsystem last weekend, rather than worry about weirdness with the Ticketmaster app, I just took my Pixel 8. But I've used normal boarding passes for airplanes on my MP01, and I regularly go out without a backup phone. I do mostly rely on my partner to do Google Maps navigation since that's a little bit smoother, although in a pinch I can still use it myself (and the Transit app is a little better in hybrid mode.)</p><p>Basically, I use the right tool for the job, and this phone doesn't have to be that tool for all jobs. But it turns out I don't need my phone to do all that many jobs, and it's maybe a good thing for it to be doing less of them.</p><p>There are enough quirks that I wouldn't automatically recommend this experience. But if you know what you're getting into and have the right expectations, this is a really great little device!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en-GB">
  <p>This is not the usual type of content you will have come to expect from Piccalilli, but I feel like this topic, specifically, is an important aspect of our work to cover because as I see it, making or encouraging your development staff to use AI tools in their work is extremely short-sighted and risky.</p>
<p>I want to support that stance with some conversations I’ve had with people actually <strong>doing the work</strong> and their mostly less than favourable experiences.</p>
<p>I asked this across question social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your boss encouraging you to/making you use AI tools for development?</p>
<p>I’m thinking about working on a piece about that on
Piccalilli.</p>
<p>It’s sensitive for sure, so more than happy for people to be anonymised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason I asked was because — as you can imagine — I speak with <em>a lot</em> of developers on a day-to-day basis. A lot of the time in my personal network, these are very experienced, senior developers, but I’m hearing the same stories from juniors too. It boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My boss is making/encouraging me to use AI every day and during every part of my work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had an urge to explore this further — making sure I wasn’t in an echo chamber — and, yeh, you’re probably not going to enjoy what I discovered.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-dig-in-allow-me-to-set-some-ground-rules-and-facts">Before we dig in, allow me to set some ground rules and facts<a href="#before-we-dig-in-allow-me-to-set-some-ground-rules-and-facts"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>If you’re a fan of AI companies/tools, this article is not a personal attack on your preference</li>
<li>This article does not de-value the good stuff you might feel like you’re doing with AI</li>
<li>All participants are completely anonymised for their privacy and protection</li>
<li>I have re-worked some of the responses to assist with point 3</li>
<li>Any opinions are mine unless specified</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-my-conversations">What I learned from my conversations<a href="#what-i-learned-from-my-conversations"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>I’ve had several conversations with developers and designers working across the industry for this piece, all with varying experience levels.</p>
<p>I spoke with a developer working in the science industry who told me, “I saw your post on Bluesky about bosses encouraging AI use. Mine does but in a really weird way. We’re supposed to paste code into ChatGPT and have it make suggestions about structure, performance optimisations”</p>
<p>I pressed further and asked if overall this policy is causing problems with the PR processes.</p>
<p>In reference to their boss, “It’s mostly frustrating, because they completely externalise the review to ChatGPT. Sometimes they just paste hundreds of lines into a comment and tell the developer to check it. Especially the juniors hit problems because the code doesn’t work anymore and they have trouble debugging it.”</p>
<p>“If you ask them technical questions it’s very likely you get a ChatGPT response. Not exactly what I expect from a tech lead.”</p>
<p>Immediately, I thought their boss has outsourced their role to ChatGPT, so I asked if that’s the case.</p>
<p>“Sounds about right. Same with interview questions for new candidates and we can see a lot of the conversations because the company shares a single ChatGPT account.”</p>
<p>I asked for further details and they responded, “People learned to use the chats that disappear after a while.”</p>
<p>That’s pretty horrifying, I’ve got to say. Not just some of it, but <em>all of it</em>. Maybe I’m sensitive because I am people’s boss and couldn’t fathom outsourcing my responsibilities to a technology that <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-11-20-large-language-models-pose-risk-science-false-answers-says-oxford-study">often gets things completely wrong</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s move on to another conversation I had with with a team lead in an agency. Something <a href="https://set.studio/">I have a lot of experience with</a>!</p>
<p>“My company is pushing AI tools across the company in branding, copywriting, design, stock photo creation and of course development. They want to be the ‘first AI agency’ and are basically telling us to get on board or you’re not a fit here any longer.”</p>
<p>Pretty harrowing stuff. This isn’t much of a surprise to me though so far because unfortunately, a reasonable portion of agencies will do everything to cut corners on a project to increase profits.</p>
<p>It’s been that way forever and it’s fundamentally why — understandably — organisations don’t trust agencies. A lot of my work is <em>building</em> that trust in the sales process to counter that.</p>
<p>I asked how their agency is currently billing clients and whether it’s retainers or fixed-fees.</p>
<p>“We have production clients who are on an overall fixed fee and monthly retainer clients whose contracts are set by the number of hours they want to buy.”</p>
<p>Seems like a pretty standard agency setup to me. I wanted to dig deeper on the culture though, so I asked, in reference to “<em>…telling us to get on board or you’re not a fit here any longer</em>” is causing fear amongst their colleagues.</p>
<p>They responded, “I would definitely say it’s causing some fear that they aren’t good enough / falling behind if they aren’t using it regularly.”</p>
<p>“The managers like to quote ‘AI won’t replace you, but a developer using AI would’ as a way to motivate certain team members to use the tools”</p>
<p>Sounds more like a threat to me than a motivation. I asked if their managers are effectively threatening to replace people, not on board with AI and if that worries them.</p>
<p>“In a way yeah but I don’t think they could directly get rid of them for that reason, more potentially make it uncomfortable so they’d leave.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a great feeling to have and to be honest, I think it’s a wider worry about the industry as a whole, as I feel a lot of agencies will be jumping on the AI train.”</p>
<p>“…I do worry about some of my team members and the direction of the company overall — I’m struggling to find the same motivation I had 12-18 months ago”</p>

<p>AI use and a culture of encouraging staff to use it isn’t isolated to this one agency. I spoke with a designer at another agency and they said, “Yes I work at a small digital agency and we’re being encouraged to use tools. Not particularly for image generation (outside of ideation or mood-boarding), but more for summaries, research and some copywriting.”</p>
<p>“I was very vocal about it at the beginning and think I managed to get a bit of a reputation for being difficult for my views,  so I’ve yielded a little bit on certain tools, but still [I’m] very clear about what I think is appropriate for clients and almost certainly make sure we disclose when we use it.”</p>
<p>Even though AI tools seemingly aren’t directly used for the creative design output, they’re being used during the creative ideation process which for me, as an agency founder is terrifying, especially with some of the non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) I’ve signed over the years.</p>
<p>I also can’t fathom using AI for copywriting either.</p>

<p>I also spoke with a software engineer for a huge, global retailer whose organisation is conducting a big push to leverage AI. AI has now become a requirement there. I asked if the organisation has provided correspondence that people’s jobs will be at risk if they’re not on board.</p>
<p>“Thankfully I have not seen any wind of it. There is a lot of discussion about how to embrace it [AI] and how we can help the next wave of engineers coming in from colleges to be ready for the transformations that will happen to the way we work.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure as the tech matures and we adopt specific tools organisation-wide, those discussions may happen. Right now we are still piloting different tools and figuring out what does and doesn’t work for the organisation.”</p>
<p>I asked if this was more of a pragmatic process, rather than a rushed, reactive process.</p>
<p>“I think it’s being done with a sense of urgency to embrace new technologies and how they can help us but not to the point where the average engineer would feel overly pressured or threatened by the push.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been enjoying my journey into how to leverage AI but I think for newer engineers or engineers looking to climb the ladder, like myself, it inherently adds pressure to be an earlier adopter and be one to spread knowledge early.”</p>
<p>I asked if there had been any disasters.</p>
<p>“Thankfully nothing in my area and I’m sure any team would try to keep those slip ups under wraps. I will say that in my personal experience little edge case bugs are more prevalent and no matter how careful I am and reread all code over and over I still manage to miss stuff when I don’t manually type it.”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty proud of raising solid PRs with low rates of bugs reported, but these last two sprints, I’ve had a few things slip past me due to the change of workflow. I’m sure this is something a mindful engineer won’t struggle with for long as we adjust to the new way of working.”</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at one more because I’m aware this article is getting <em>very long</em>. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>I had a developer reach out about AI very much being forced in their organisation.</p>
<p>“The CTO at my previous job tried Claude Code and really liked it so he said that all the devs had to use Claude Code in our work for generating code, generating tests, debugging, and validating design.”</p>
<p>“If we asked him a question on something he would tell us to ask Claude first. I never found Claude useful. It couldn’t debug anything and I didn’t like how carefully I’d have to comb through the code it generated to find the subtle bugs it would inject. The design validation was basically just telling us what we wanted to hear, which the CTO loved”</p>
<p>This is the thing about AI tools. They are by design going to honour your prompt, which often results in your AI tool agreeing with you, even if you’re wrong.</p>
<p>I asked this person if their boss was effectively off-loading their responsibilities to AI too. I also asked about more information about design validation.</p>
<p>“He was trying to off-load responsibilities to Claude but Claude never gave us a good answer so it would just add an extra layer of back-and-forth to solving the problem.”</p>
<p>“Design validation is looking for possible performance, security, or concurrency issues in the design of our system. Claude would always have some generic answer that didn’t fit our specific circumstances so it was taken as validation that our design was good”</p>
<p>Again, AI tools will validate you, <em>even if you’re wrong</em>.</p>
<p>“I think the fact that Claude didn’t have anything real to say about our designs was taken as validation that the design was good.”</p>
<p>“There was an assumption that if the design had an issue then Claude would catch that and say something relevant to it. I don’t think he ever considered the possibility that Claude wasn’t saying relevant things because it couldn’t do that. It would only be able to regurgitate generic advice you find on the internet about good software design”</p>
<p>A lot of design critique is based in analytical, creative and soft skills, along with lots of experience. AI is completely incapable of doing all of that.</p>
<p><em>LLM</em> is an acronym for <em>large language model</em> and that is exactly what these tools <em>are</em> — language processing systems. So am I surprised that Claude is just regurgitating generic design advice? No.</p>
<p>These tools are incapable of <em>creating</em> and <em>analysing</em>. They are only capable of pattern matching and regurgitating what has been fed into them during the training process.</p>
<p>Remember when Google’s AI summaries were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o">encouraging people to add glue to their pizza sauce</a>, for example? Yeh, that was a Reddit joke comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/1a19s0/my_cheese_slides_off_the_pizza_too_easily/">which has now been removed</a> but it’s a good example of AI regurgitating what it has learned without to capability of determining the fact that comment was a <em>joke</em>.</p>
<p>Regurgiting, not creating. It’s what these tools do.</p>
<h2 id="some-advice-for-navigating-all-of-this">Some advice for navigating all of this<a href="#some-advice-for-navigating-all-of-this"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>I’d say my overarching advice, based on how difficult tech recruitment is right now, is to sadly <em>play along</em>. But — and I cannot stress this enough — make sure you <strong>document everything</strong>.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is <strong>every single time</strong> AI tools cause problems, slow-downs and other disappointing outcomes, document that outcome and who was responsible for that decision. Make sure you document your opposition and professional advice too.</p>
<p>In fact, away from AI, I’d recommend documenting this stuff in general. It’ll be vital if you ever find yourself in a disciplinary and/or tribunal situation. You don’t know where the code your tool spat out <em>came from</em> either. Documenting <em>who is responsible</em> helps to protect you, individually, if litigation is raised against your organisation. If it is not your decision to use these tools, <strong>make that known</strong>, officially.</p>
<p>It’s quite clear we’re in a bubble with AI, or at best, a hype cycle. For example <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/">95% of generative AI pilots failed in a recent report from MIT</a> and even when <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">developers thought AI was making them faster, it was actually making them slower in another study</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/openai-chatgpt-700-million-users.html">Billions are being poured into this technology</a> but big tech companies — the so-called “magnificent 7” (cringe) — can afford those losses, generally. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericwbailey.website/post/3lxf4ujam5s2o">Ethics from decision makers are clearly not even a factor any more in these organisations too</a>.</p>
<p>My worry is that — as always — workers will be the ones to suffer as the bubble/hype cycle bursts. What I’m directly advising you to do is <strong>protect your interests right now</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up<a href="#wrapping-up"><span>permalink</span></a></h2>
<p>To everyone who I spoke to and haven’t featured in this article, I’m sorry for excluding your input. This article is <em>very long</em> already. Just know, the conversation we had was incredibly useful in producing this article and I really enjoyed talking to you. Thank you.</p>
<p>This article has been really hard to write, I’m not going to lie. I really enjoyed my conversations but quietly, I was hoping I was wrong with my theory that AI tools were being forced, rather than being used on merit.</p>
<p>It’s so typical of the tech industry to jump on a shiny new thing, completely forgetting how much harm it causes, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250827031206/https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/raine-vs-openai-et-al-complaint.pdf">ChatGPT teaching someone how to more effectively commit suicide</a> (<em>extreme</em> content warning on that link). Let’s not forget how much content was stolen in the first place — and continues to be “scraped” — to train models too. <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2025-february/openai-sued-data-scraping-canada/">Legal cases have rightly been raised</a>.</p>
<p>I would say I’m very much an AI-sceptic. That’s not a position from refusing to try AI tools though. <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/how-im-using-ai/">We’ve tried these tools for quite a while</a> and after that extended period, found them to be more often than not, a complete hindrance, albeit quite useful in certain contexts. Your mileage may vary though! <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/our-principles-on-ai/">We know our position</a> and that’s what’s important to us.</p>
<p>Regardless of your opinion of AI, forcing the usage of it is almost certainly going to end in disaster. Just be prepared for that disaster and protect yourself is my overall advice.</p>
