<h3>Pressemitteilung</h3>


<p>18. Juni 2024</p>




<p>Ende 2019 begann die zuvor unauffällige Galaxie SDSS1335+0728 plötzlich heller zu leuchten als je zuvor. Um den Ursachen auf den Grund zu gehen, haben Astronomen Daten von mehreren Weltraum- und Bodenobservatorien, darunter das Very Large Telescope (VLT) der Europäischen Südsternwarte (ESO), verwendet, um die Helligkeitsschwankungen der Galaxie nachzuverfolgen. In einer heute veröffentlichten Studie kommen sie zu dem Schluss, dass sie bisher noch nie beobachtete Veränderungen in einer Galaxie sehen – wahrscheinlich das Ergebnis des plötzlichen Erwachens des massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in ihrem Zentrum.</p>
<p>„<em>Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie beobachten eine weit entfernte Galaxie seit Jahren, und sie schien immer ruhig und inaktiv zu sein</em>“, sagt Paula Sánchez Sáez, eine Astronomin der ESO in Deutschland und Hauptautorin der Studie, die zur Veröffentlichung in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> angenommen wurde. „<em>Plötzlich zeigt ihr [Kern] dramatische Veränderungen in der Helligkeit, die sich von allen typischen Ereignissen, die wir bisher gesehen haben, unterscheiden.</em>“ Genau das ist mit SDSS1335+0728 passiert, das nun als „aktiver galaktischer Kern“ (AGN) eingestuft wird – eine helle, kompakte Region, die von einem massereichen Schwarzen Loch angetrieben wird – nachdem es sich im Dezember 2019 dramatisch aufgehellt hatte <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Einige Phänomene, wie Supernova-Explosionen oder das durch Gezeitenkräfte verursachte Auseinanderbrechen von Sternen, bei denen ein Stern einem Schwarzen Loch zu nahe kommt und auseinandergerissen wird, können dazu führen, dass Galaxien plötzlich heller leuchten. Diese Helligkeitsschwankungen dauern jedoch in der Regel nur einige Dutzend oder höchstens einige Hundert Tage an. SDSS1335+0728 wird auch heute noch heller, mehr als vier Jahre, nachdem zum ersten Mal beobachtet wurde, dass sie „aufleuchtet“. Weiterhin sind die in der Galaxie, die sich 300 Millionen Lichtjahre entfernt im Sternbild Jungfrau befindet, festgestellten Schwankungen anders als alle bisher beobachteten und weisen die Astronomen auf eine andere Erklärung hin.</p>
<p>Das Team versuchte, diese Helligkeitsschwankungen mithilfe einer Kombination aus Archivdaten und neuen Beobachtungen von mehreren Standorten, darunter dem X-Shooter-Instrument am VLT der ESO in der chilenischen Atacama-Wüste, zu verstehen <a href="#2">[2]</a>. Beim Vergleich der vor und nach Dezember 2019 aufgenommenen Daten stellten sie fest, dass SDSS1335+0728 jetzt viel mehr Licht im ultravioletten, optischen und infraroten Wellenlängenbereich abstrahlt. Die Galaxie begann im Februar 2024 auch mit der Aussendung von Röntgenstrahlen. „Dieses Verhalten ist beispiellos“, sagt Sánchez Sáez, die auch mit dem Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS) in Chile verbunden ist.</p>
<p>„<em>Die naheliegendste Erklärung für dieses Phänomen ist, dass wir beobachten, wie der [Kern] der Galaxie anfängt, (...) Aktivität zu zeigen</em>“, sagt die Co-Autorin Lorena Hernández García vom MAS und der Universität Valparaíso in Chile. „<em>Wenn das stimmt, wäre dies das erste Mal, dass wir die Aktivierung eines massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in Echtzeit beobachten.</em>“</p>
<p>Massereiche Schwarze Löcher – mit Massen, die über hunderttausend Mal größer sind als die unserer Sonne – existieren im Zentrum der meisten Galaxien, einschließlich der Milchstraße. „<em>Diese Giganten schlafen normalerweise und sind nicht direkt sichtbar</em>“, erklärt der Co-Autor Claudio Ricci von der Diego-Portales-Universität, ebenfalls in Chile. „<em>Im Fall von SDSS1335+0728 konnten wir das Erwachen des massereichen Schwarzen Lochs beobachten, das sich plötzlich das in seiner Umgebung vorhandene Gas einverleibte und sehr hell wurde.</em>“</p>
<p>„<em>Dieser Prozess (...) wurde noch nie zuvor beobachtet</em>“, sagt Hernández García. In früheren Studien wurde zwar berichtet, dass inaktive Galaxien nach mehreren Jahren aktiv werden, doch dies ist das erste Mal, dass der Prozess selbst – das Erwachen des Schwarzen Lochs – in Echtzeit beobachtet wurde. Ricci, der auch mit dem Kavli-Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik an der Peking-Universität in China verbunden ist, fügt hinzu: „<em>Das könnte auch bei unserem eigenen Sgr A*, dem massereichen Schwarzen Loch (...) im Zentrum unserer Galaxie, passieren</em>“, aber es ist unklar, wie wahrscheinlich dies ist.</p>
<p>Es sind noch weitere Beobachtungen erforderlich, um alternative Erklärungen auszuschließen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, dass wir ein ungewöhnlich langsames Ereignis der Gezeitenstörung oder sogar ein neues Phänomen beobachten. Wenn es sich tatsächlich um ein Ereignis der Gezeitenstörung handelt, wäre dies das längste und schwächste Ereignis dieser Art, das jemals beobachtet wurde. „<em>Unabhängig von der Art der Schwankungen liefert [diese Galaxie] wertvolle Informationen darüber, wie Schwarze Löcher wachsen und sich entwickeln</em>“, sagt Sánchez Sáez. „<em>Wir gehen davon aus, dass Instrumente wie [MUSE am VLT oder die Instrumente am zukünftigen Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)] entscheidend zum Verständnis beitragen werden [warum die Galaxie heller wird].</em>“</p>
<h3>Endnoten</h3><p><a name="1"></a>[1] Die ungewöhnlichen Helligkeitsschwankungen der Galaxie SDSS1335+0728 wurden vom Zwicky-Transient-Facility-Teleskop (ZTF) in den USA entdeckt. Anschließend stufte der von Chile aus geleitete Algorithmus Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) SDSS1335+0728 als aktiven Galaxienkern ein.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a>[2] Das Team sammelte Archivdaten von den NASA-Satelliten Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) und Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), dem Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), dem Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) und dem eROSITA-Instrument auf dem Spektr-RG-Weltraumobservatorium von IKI und DLR. Neben dem VLT der ESO wurden die Nachbeobachtungen mit dem Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR), dem W. M. Keck Observatory und dem Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory und dem Chandra X-ray Observatory der NASA durchgeführt.</p>

<p>Die Europäische Südsternwarte (ESO) befähigt Wissenschaftler*innen weltweit, die Geheimnisse des Universums zum Nutzen aller zu entdecken. Wir entwerfen, bauen und betreiben Observatorien von Weltrang, die Astronominnen und Astronomen nutzen, um spannende Fragen zu beantworten und die Faszination der Astronomie zu wecken, und wir fördern die internationale Zusammenarbeit in der Astronomie. Die ESO wurde 1962 als zwischenstaatliche Organisation gegründet und wird heute von 16 Mitgliedstaaten (Belgien, Dänemark, Deutschland, Frankreich, Finnland, Irland, Italien, den Niederlanden, Österreich, Polen, Portugal, Schweden, der Schweiz, Spanien, der Tschechischen Republik und dem Vereinigten Königreich) sowie dem Gastland Chile und Australien als strategischem Partner unterstützt. Der Hauptsitz der ESO und ihr Besucherzentrum und Planetarium, die ESO Supernova, befinden sich in der Nähe von München in Deutschland, während die chilenische Atacama-Wüste, ein wunderbarer Ort mit einzigartigen Bedingungen für die Himmelsbeobachtung, unsere Teleskope beherbergt. Die ESO betreibt drei Beobachtungsstandorte: La Silla, Paranal und Chajnantor. Am Standort Paranal betreibt die ESO das Very Large Telescope und das dazugehörige Very Large Telescope Interferometer sowie Durchmusterungsteleskope wie z. B. VISTA. Ebenfalls am Paranal wird die ESO das Cherenkov Telescope Array South betreiben, das größte und empfindlichste Gammastrahlen-Observatorium der Welt. Zusammen mit internationalen Partnern betreibt die ESO auf Chajnantor APEX und ALMA, zwei Einrichtungen zur Beobachtung des Himmels im Millimeter- und Submillimeterbereich. Auf dem Cerro Armazones in der Nähe von Paranal bauen wir „das größte Auge der Welt am Himmel“ – das Extremely Large Telescope der ESO. Von unseren Büros in Santiago, Chile, aus unterstützen wir unsere Aktivitäten im Land und arbeiten mit chilenischen Partnern und der Gesellschaft zusammen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Slack's engineering team recently published <a href="https://slack.engineering/balancing-old-tricks-with-new-feats-ai-powered-conversion-from-enzyme-to-react-testing-library-at-slack/" target="_blank">how it used a large language model (LLM) to automatically convert 15,000 unit and integration tests</a> from <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/" target="_blank">Enzyme</a> to <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/" target="_blank">React Testing Library (RTL)</a>. By combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformations and AI-powered automation, Slack's innovative approach resulted in an 80% conversion success rate, significantly reducing the manual effort required and showcasing the potential of AI in streamlining complex development tasks.</p>

<p>This transition was prompted by Enzyme's <a href="https://dev.to/wojtekmaj/enzyme-is-dead-now-what-ekl" target="_blank">lack of support for React 18</a>, necessitating a significant shift to maintain&nbsp;compatibility with the latest <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a> version. The conversion&nbsp;tool's adoption rate at Slack reached approximately 64%, saving considerable developer time of at least 22% of 10,000 hours. While this figure represents a significant saving, Sergii Gorbachov, senior software engineer at&nbsp;Slack, speculates that, in reality, the figure is probably much higher:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's important to note that this 22% time saving represents only the documented cases where the test case passed. However, it's conceivable that some test cases were converted properly, yet issues such as setup or importing syntax may have caused the test file not to run at all, and time savings were not accounted for in those instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team initially attempted to automate the conversion using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) transformations, aiming for 100% accuracy. However, the complexity and variety of Enzyme methods led to a modest success rate of 45% in automatically converting code. One factor contributing to the low success rate is that correct conversion depends on contextual information regarding the rendered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" target="_blank">Document Object Model</a> (DOM) under test, to which the AST conversion has no access.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2024/06/slack-automatic-test-conversion/en/resources/1Slack-AST-Representation-1717931855564.png" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/3000x4000/filters:quality(85)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2024/06/slack-automatic-test-conversion/en/resources/1Slack-AST-Representation-1717931855564.png" rel="share"><br>

<p>Next, the team attempted to perform the conversion using <a href="http://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>'s&nbsp;LLM, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude" target="_blank">Claude</a> 2.1. Despite efforts to refine prompts, the conversion success rates varied significantly between 40% and 60%. Gorbachov notes that "the outcomes ranged from remarkably effective conversions to disappointingly inadequate ones, depending largely on the complexity of the task."</p>

<p>Following the unsatisfactory results, the team decided to observe how human developers approached converting the unit tests. They noticed that human developers had access to a broad knowledge base on React, Enzyme and RTL, and they combined that knowledge with access to context on the rendered React element and the AST conversions provided by the initial version of the conversion tool.</p>

<p>Slack's engineers then adopted a hybrid approach, combining the AST transformations with LLM capabilities and mimicking human behaviour. By feeding the rendered React component under test and the conversions performed by the AST tool into the LLM as part of the prompt and creating a robust control mechanism for the AI, they achieved an 80% conversion success rate, demonstrating the complementary nature of these technologies.</p>

<p>Claude 2.1 is an LLM model <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/11/anthropic-announces-claude-2-1/" target="_blank">announced in November 2023</a> by Anthropic. It included a 200K token context window, significant reductions in rates of model hallucination, and system prompts and allowed for the use of tools. Anthropic <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/anthropic-claude-ai/" target="_blank">has since introduced the Claude 3 family models</a> consisting of three distinct models, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning" target="_blank">multimodal capabilities</a>, and improved contextual understanding.</p>

<p>An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node in the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. A syntax tree focuses on the structure and content necessary for understanding the code's functionality. ASTs are commonly used in compilers and interpreters to parse and analyze code, enabling various transformations, optimizations, and translations during compilation.</p>

<p>Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Where it goes after that remains largely unknown. But a new <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation">ESA Discovery</a> study reported in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48674-7">Nature Communications</a>&nbsp;has proven the concept of monitoring floating plastic litter using satellites.</p>

		<p>The quantity of plastic floating on the sea surface is rarely high enough to generate a detectable signal from space. Plastics and other floating debris have to accumulate into dense patches of at least tens of metres in area to be detectable using existing satellites.</p><p>These patches of floating litter are called ‘slicks’, ‘streaks’ or ‘litter windrows’. They are often filament-shaped, resulting from the presence of convergence current lines on the sea surface.</p><p>Detecting such litter windrows is indicative of high pollution at a particular place and time. But could such scattered and short-lived patches of litter provide sufficiently useful data for global monitoring of plastic pollution?</p>	</div>

		<p>“We didn’t know if the abundance of litter windrows was enough to draw maps, or to reveal trends over time,” notes Andrés Cózar, from the <a href="https://www.uca.es/?lang=en">University of Cádiz</a>, co-director of the project.</p><p>To find out ESA Discovery funded a consortium of space companies and research institutes from six countries. Using a six-year historical series of 300 000 satellite images, the team scanned the entire Mediterranean Sea every three days, at a spatial resolution of 10 metres, on the hunt for windrows.</p><p>They relied on the multispectral imaging <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2">Sentinel-2</a>&nbsp;satellites of Europe’s <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus">Copernicus programme</a>, which while not designed for litter detection, have a somewhat limited capability for plastic detection.</p>	</div>

		<p>“Searching for litter aggregations of metres in size on the ocean surface is like looking for needles in a haystack,” explains Manuel Arias, from the Institute of Marine Sciences, <a href="https://www.csic.es/en">CSIC</a>, in Spain, the other project co-director.</p><p>Automation was what made the project possible, harnessing supercomputers and advanced search algorithms. The team found thousands of litter windrows, most more than a kilometre long – and some reaching 20 km in length. The result was the most complete map of marine litter pollution to date.</p><p>“Litter detections with a non-specialised satellite allowed us to identify the most polluted areas and their major changes over weeks and years,” comments Andrés Cózar. “Litter is injected into the Mediterranean Sea as the rainstorms rage.”</p>	</div>

		<p>A key element of this work has been in understanding the significance of the litter windrow structures in the context of marine monitoring, being mainly associated with land-based litter emissions in the preceding days.</p><p>This makes them especially useful for surveillance and management of the problem. In the paper the team assess the effectiveness of action plans against marine litter around Rome, identify a pollution hotspot related to shipping through the Egypt’s Suez Canal and put forward satellite data for guiding cleanup operations in Spain’s Bay of Biscay.</p><p>Manuel Arias explains: “The tool is ready to be used in other world regions, which I am convinced will teach us much about the littering phenomenon, including identification of sources and the pathways to the ocean.”&nbsp;</p>	</div>

		<p>Andrés Cózar adds: “There is still room for improvement. The sensor used in our proof was not designed to detect plastic. Detection capability would be enormously improved if we put observation technology into orbit tailored for ocean plastics.”</p><p>The ability to monitor marine litter pollution in this way also holds broader promise. The deployment of a sensor specifically dedicated to detect and identify floating objects one metre in size could also be useful for tasks such as oil spill monitoring, loss of cargo or even search and rescue at sea.</p><p>Paolo Corradi, overseeing the project for ESA Discovery, comments: “The importance of these results and the applicability of this methodology can indeed be extended in a wider sense to the monitoring and characterisation of generic floating matter accumulations. This could be the more general target of a dedicated small satellite mission, which would collect the interest of a large scientific community, while addressing the need for large scale monitoring of marine litter pollution.”</p><p>“ESA Discovery is our funding programme to ensure our Agency is ready for tomorrow, looking into future ways we might make use of space,” comments Dietmar Pilz, ESA Director of Technology, Engineering and Quality. “The potential detection of marine plastic litter has been a topic of interest for a number of years within ESA Discovery. I am pleased to see this work has resulted in such a landmark scientific paper, exploiting the incredible value of the data from Europe’s Copernicus satellites.”</p>	</div>

<h2>The End of the Privacy of Digital Correspondence</h2>



<p>The EU Commission proposes to oblige providers to search all private chats, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content – generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). The result: Mass surveillance by means of fully automated real-time surveillance of messaging and chats and the end of privacy of digital correspondence. </p>



<p>Other aspects of the proposal include ineffective network blocking, screening of personal cloud storage including private photos, mandatory age verification resulting in the end of anonymous communication, appstore censorship and excluding minors from the digital world. </p>



<h2 id="chatcontrol20"><strong>Chat control 2.0 on every smartphone</strong></h2>



<p>On 11 May 2022<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/proposal-regulation-laying-down-rules-prevent-and-combat-child-sexual-abuse_en">the European Commission presented a proposal</a> which would make chat control searching <em>mandatory</em> for all e-mail and messenger providers</strong> and would even apply to so far securely end-to-end encrypted communication services. Prior to the proposal a public consultation had revealed that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12726-Child-sexual-abuse-online-detection-removal-and-reporting-/public-consultation_en">a majority of respondents, both citizens and stakeholders, opposed imposing an obligation to use chat control.</a> Over 80% of respondents opposed its application to end-to-end encrypted communications.</p>



<p>Currently a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/">regulation</a> is in place <em>allowing</em> providers to scan communications voluntarily (so-called “Chat Control 1.0”). So far only some unencrypted US communications services such as GMail, Facebook/Instagram Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, iCloud email and X-Box apply chat control voluntarily (more details <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-12/BOSE%20transparency%20report%20Dec%202022.pdf">here</a>). As a result of the mandatory Chat Control 2.0 proposal, the Commission expects a 3.5-fold increase in scanning reports (by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2022:0209:FIN:EN:PDF">354%</a>).</p>



<p>Parliament has positioned itself almost unanimously against indiscriminate chat control. With supporters and opponents of mandatory chat control irreconcilably opposed in the EU Council and no common position in sight, the EU Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=COM(2023)777&amp;lang=en">proposed</a> a two-year extension of voluntary chat control 1.0 in November 2023 – see <a href="#timeline">timeline</a> and <a href="#documents-chatcontrol1">documents</a>. A victim of child sexual abuse and <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/meta-facebook-defends-error-prone-chat-control-csam-scanner-algorithms-in-court/">Pirate MEP Patrick Breyer have filed lawsuits</a> to stop the indiscriminate scanning by US big tech companies.</p>

<h3 id="epmandate">Changes proposed by the European Parliament</h3>



<p>In November 2023, the European Parliament nearly unanimously adopted a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CSAR_LIBE-Verhandlungsmandat.pdf">negotiating mandate</a> for the draft law. With the Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer, the most determined opponent of chat control sat at the negotiating table. The result: Parliament wants to pull the following fangs out of the EU Commission’s extreme draft:</p>



<ol>
<li>We want to safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and <strong>remove the plans for blanket chat control</strong>, which violate fundamental rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material.</li>



<li>We want to <strong>safeguard trust in secure end-to-end encryption</strong>. We clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning, i.e. the installation of surveillance functionalities and security vulnerabilities in our smartphones.</li>



<li>We want to <strong>guarantee the right to anonymous communication</strong> and remove mandatory age verification for users of communication services. Whistleblowers can thus continue to leak wrong-doings anonymously without having to show their identity card or face.</li>



<li><strong>Removing instead of blocking:</strong> Internet access blocking ist to be optional. Under no circumstances must legal content be collaterally blocked.</li>



<li>We prevent the digital house arrest: <strong>We don’t want to oblige app stores to prevent young people under 16 from installing messenger apps, social networking and gaming apps</strong> ‘for their own protection’ as proposed. The General Data Protection Regulation is maintained.</li>
</ol>



<p>Parliament wants to protect young people and victims of abuse much more effectively than the EU Commission’s extreme proposal:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Security by design:</strong> In order to protect young people from grooming, Parliament wants internet services and apps to be secure by design and default. It must be possible to block and report other users. Only at the request of the user should he or she be publicly addressable and see messages or pictures of other users. Users should be asked for confirmation before sending contact details or nude pictures. Potential perpetrators and victims should be warned where appropriate, for example if they try to search for abuse material using certain search words. Public chats at high risk of grooming are to be moderated.</li>



<li>In order to <strong>clean the net</strong> of child sexual abuse material, Parliament wants the new EU Child Protection Centre to proactively search publicly accessible internet content automatically for known CSAM. This crawling could also be used in the darknet and is thus more effective than private surveillance measures by providers.</li>



<li>Parliament wants to oblige providers who become aware of clearly illegal material to <strong>remove it</strong> – unlike in the EU Commission’s proposal. Law enforcement agencies who become aware of illegal material would be obliged to report it to the provider for removal. This is our reaction to the case of the darknet platform Boystown, where the worst abuse material was further disseminated for months with the knowledge of Europol.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beware: This is only the Parliament’s negotiating mandate</strong>, which usually only partially prevails. Most EU governments continue to support the original chat control proposal of the EU Commission without significant compromises. However, many other governments prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority). As soon as the EU governments have reached an agreement in Council, Parliament, Council and Commission will start the so-called trilogue negotiations on the final version of the regulation. Patrick Breyer or his potential successor Anja Hirschel from the Pirate Party will again sit at the negotiating table to fight against chat control.</p>



<h2 id="councilpositions">Position of EU governments in Council</h2>



<p>Most EU governments continue to support the original extreme proposal of the EU Commission without making any significant improvements. Several other governments, however, prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority), so that proposed Council positions have already failed twice.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">The negotiations: A timeline</h3>



<p><strong>2020: The European Commission proposed “temporary” legislation allowing for chat control</strong></p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-300x158.png 300w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-768x403.png 768w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-600x315.png 600w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf">proposed “temporary” legislation</a> allows the searching of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This allows the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process, in part using error-prone “artificial intelligence”. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed (usually automatically and without human verification) to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified.</p>



<p><strong>6 July 2021: The European Parliament <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/" target="_blank">adopted the legislation allowing for chat control</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The European Parliament voted in favour for the ePrivacy Derogation, which allows for voluntary chat control for messaging and email providers. As a result of this some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls.</p>



<p><strong>9 May 2022: Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/destruction-of-digital-privacy-of-correspondence-lawsuit-filed-against-chat-control/">filed</a> a lawsuit against U.S. company Meta.</strong></p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1">case-law of the European Court of Justice</a> the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications <strong>violates fundamental rights and is prohibited </strong>(paragraph 177). Former judge of the European Court of Justice Prof. Dr. Ninon Colneric has extensively analysed the plans and <strong>concludes in a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf">legal assessment</a> that the EU legislative plans on chat control are not in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice and violate the fundamental rights of all EU citizens</strong> to respect for privacy, to data protection and to freedom of expression. On this basis the lawsuit was filed.</p>



<p><strong>11 Mai 2022: The Commission presented a proposal to make chat control mandatory for service providers.</strong></p>



<p>On 11 May 2022 the EU Commission made a second legislative proposal, in which <strong>the EU Commission obliges all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology in the absence of any suspicion. <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/">However, a representative survey conducted in March 2021 clearly shows that a majority of Europeans oppose the use of chat control&nbsp;</a></strong><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/"> (</a><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz">Detailed poll results here)</a><strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz">.</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-affect-you">How does this affect you?</h2>



<p>Messaging and chat control scanning:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>All of your chat conversations and emails</strong> will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically.</li>



<li>If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, <strong>your private or intimate photos</strong> may be viewed by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe.</li>



<li><strong>Flirts and sexting may be read</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for “child grooming” frequently falsely flag intimate chats.</li>



<li><strong>You can falsely be reported and investigated </strong>for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">80%</a> of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. Similarly in Ireland only <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">20%</a> of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”. Nearly <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/startseite-und-aktionen/aktuelles/detailansicht/polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik-2021/">40%</a> of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for “child pornography” target minors.</li>



<li>On your next <strong>trip overseas,</strong> you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy – with incalculable results.</li>



<li><strong>Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails. </strong>The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages.</li>



<li><strong>This is only the beginning</strong>. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops?</li>
</ul>



<p>Age verification:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can <strong>no longer set up anonymous e-mail or messenger accounts or chat anonymously</strong> without needing to present an ID or your face, making you identifiable and risking data leaks. This inhibits for instance sensitive chats related to sexuality, anonymous media communications with sources (e.g. whistleblowers) as well as political activity.</li>



<li><strong>If you are under 17, you will no longer be able to install the following apps from the app store</strong> (reason given: risk of grooming): Messenger apps such as Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram or Twitter, social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok or Facebook, games such as FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, dating apps, video conferencing apps such as Zoom, Skype, Facetime.</li>



<li>If you don’t use an appstore, compliance with the provider’s minimum age will still be verified and enforced. <strong>If you are under the minimum age of 16 years you can no longer use Whatsapp</strong> due to the proposed age verification requirements; the same applies to the online functions of the game FIFA 23. <strong>If you are under 13 years old you’ll no longer be able to use TikTok, Snapchat or Instagram.</strong></li>

<h2 id="WhatYouCanDo">What you can do</h2>



<p>Do you fear that this law would cause <strong>massive damage</strong> to fundamental rights and is the wrong approach?</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>What is important now is to <strong>increase pressure on the negotiators: </strong><br>Reach out to your government which is negotiating in Council. Contact your <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/REPRES_PERM/REPRES_PERM">government’s permanent representation</a> or your Ministry of the interior. <br>Politely tell them your concerns about chat control (<a href="#AdditionalInformation" data-type="internal" data-id="#AdditionalInformation">arguments here</a>). Experience shows that phone calls are more effective than e-mails or letters. The official name of the planned mandatory chat control law is “Proposal for a Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse”.</td></tr><tr><td>Talk about it! Inform others about the dangers of chat control. <strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/cwyRic7cC5zcfHk">Here, you can find tweet templates, share pics and videos</a></strong>. Of course, you can also create your own images and videos.</td></tr><tr><td>Generate attention on social media! Use the hashtags <strong>#chatcontrol</strong> and <strong>#secrecyofcorrespondence</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Generate media attention! </strong>So far very few media have covered the messaging and chat control plans of the EU. Get in touch with newspapers and ask them to cover the subject – online and offline.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask your e-mail, messaging and chat service providers!</strong> Avoid Gmail, Facebook Messenger, outlook.com and the chat function of X-Box, where indiscriminate chat control is already taking place. Ask your email, messaging and chat providers if they generally monitor private messages for suspicious content, or if they plan to do so.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="Myths">Debunking Myths</h2>



<p>When the draft law on chat control was first presented in May 2022, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_2976" target="_blank">EU Commission promoted the controversial plan with various arguments.</a> In the following, various claims are questioned and debunked:</p>



<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h5 id="at-5999710" role="button"><strong>1. “Today, photos and videos depicting child sexual abuse are massively circulated on the Internet. In 2021, 29 million cases were reported to the U.S. National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.”</strong></h5><p>To speak exclusively of depictions of child sexual abuse in the context of chat control is misleading. To be sure, child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) is often footage of sexual violence against minors (child sexual abuse material, CSAM). However, an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/TerminologyGuidelines_en.pdf" target="_blank">international working group of child protection institutions points out</a> that criminal material also includes recordings of sexual acts or of sexual organs of minors in which no violence is used or no other person is involved. Recordings made in everyday situations are also mentioned, such as a family picture of a girl in a bikini or naked in her mother’s boots. Recordings made or shared without the knowledge of the minor are also covered. Punishable CSEM also includes comics, drawings, manga/anime, and computer-generated depictions of fictional minors. Finally, criminal depictions also include self-made sexual recordings of minors, for example, for forwarding to partners of the same age (“sexting”). The study therefore proposes the term “depictions of sexual exploitation” of minors as a correct description. In this context, recordings of children (up to 14 years of age) and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) are equally punishable.</p></div>



<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h5 id="at-5999711" role="button"><strong>2. “In 2021 alone, 85 million images and videos of child sexual abuse were reported worldwide.”</strong></h5><div id="ac-5999711">
<p>There are many misleading claims circulating about how to quantify the extent of sexually exploitative images of minors (CSEM). The figure the EU Commission uses to defend its plans comes from the U.S. nongovernmental organization NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) and includes duplicates because CSEM is shared multiple times and often not deleted. Excluding duplicates, 22 million unique recordings remain of the 85 million reported.</p>



<p>75 percent of all NCMEC reports from 2021 came from Meta (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp). Facebook’s own internal analysis says that “more than 90 percent of [CSEM on Facebook in 2020] was identical or visually similar to previously reported content. And copies of just six videos were responsible for more than half of the child-exploitative content.” So the NCMEC’s much-cited numbers don’t really describe the extent of online recordings of sexual violence against children. Rather, they describe how often Facebook discovers copies of footage it already knows about. That, too, is relevant.</p>



<p>Not all unique recordings reported to NCMEC show violence against children. The 85 million depictions reported by NCMEC also include consensual sexting, for example. The number of depictions of abuse reported to NCMEC in 2021 was 1.4 million.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.missingkids.org/blog/2020/we-are-in-danger-of-losing-the-global-battle-for-child-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7% of NCMEC’s global SARs go to the European Union.</a></p>



<p>Moreover, even on Facebook, where chat control has long been used voluntarily, the numbers for the dissemination of abusive material continue to rise. Chat control is thus not a solution.</p>

The very configuration of the algorithms has a large impact on the number of SARs. Moreover, the increase shows that the circulation of CSEM cannot be controlled by means of chat control.</p></div>

To screen cloud storage, it is not necessary to mandate the monitoring of everyone’s communications. If you want to catch the perpetrators of online crimes related to child abuse material, you should use so-called honeypots and other methods that do not require monitoring the communications of the entire population.</p></div>

<h2 id="wrong-approach">Mass surveillance is the wrong approach to fighting “child pornography” and sexual exploitation</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scanning private messages and chats does not contain the spread of CSEM.</strong> Facebook, for example, has been practicing chat control for years, and the number of automated reports has been increasing every year, most recently reaching 22 million in 2021. </li>



<li><strong>Mandatory chat control will not detect the perpetrators</strong> who record and share child sexual exploitation material. Abusers do not share their material via commercial email, messenger, or chat services, but organize themselves through self-run secret forums without control algorithms. Abusers also typically upload images and videos as encrypted archives and share only the links and passwords. Chat control algorithms do not recognize encrypted archives or links. </li>



<li><strong>The right approach would be to delete stored CSEM where it is hosted online.</strong> However, <a href="https://ipexl.europarl.europa.eu/IPEXL-WEB/download/file/082d2908811d46d301814771a13101cb">Europol does not report</a> known CSEM material. </li>



<li><strong>Chat control harms the prosecution of child abuse</strong> by flooding investigators will millions of automated reports, most of which are criminally irrelevant. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="message-and-chat">Message and chat control harms everybody</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime. </strong>Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. <strong>No judge is required to order to such monitoring – contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications. </strong>According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place.</li>



<li><strong>The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed. </strong>Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/us/politics/edward-snowden-at-nsa-sexually-explicit-photos-often-shared.html?_r=0">reportedly</a> circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past. A Google engineer has been <a href="https://gawker.com/5637234/gcreep-google-engineer-stalked-teens-spied-on-chats">reported</a> to stalk minors.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day.</strong> According the Swiss Federal Police, <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">80%</a> of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach. Similarly in Ireland only <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">20%</a> of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”.</li>



<li><strong>Securely encrypted communication is at risk. </strong>Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Criminal justice is being privatized. </strong>In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates to more intrusive technologies and legislation</strong>. Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or “harmful content”. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="why-messaging-and-chat-control-harms-children-and-abuse-victims"><strong>Messaging and chat control harms children and abuse victims</strong></h2>



<p>Proponents claim indiscriminate messaging and chat control facilitates the prosecution of child sexual exploitation. However, this argument is controversial, even among victims of child sexual abuse. In fact messaging and chat control can hurt victims and potential victims of sexual exploitation:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Safe spaces are destroyed. </strong>Victims of sexual violence are especially in need of the ability to communicate safely and confidentially to seek counseling and support, for example to safely exchange among each other, with their therapists or attorneys. The introduction of real-time monitoring takes these safe rooms away from them. This can discourage victims from seeking help and support.</li>



<li><strong>Self-recorded nude photos of minors (sexting) end up in the hands of company employees</strong> and police where they do not belong and are not safe.</li>



<li><strong>Minors are being criminalized. </strong>Especially young people often share intimate recordings with each other (sexting). With messaging and chat control in place, their photos and videos may end up in the hands of criminal investigators. German crime statistics demonstrate that nearly <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/startseite-und-aktionen/aktuelles/detailansicht/polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik-2021/">40%</a> of all investigations for child pornography target minors.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the circulation of illegal material but </strong><strong>actually makes it more difficult to prosecute child sexual exploitation. </strong>It encourages offenders to go underground and use private encrypted servers which can be impossible to detect and intercept. Even on open channels, indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the volume of material circulated, as evidenced by the constantly rising number of machine reports.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>



<h3 id="Strengthening-the-capacity-of-law-enforcement"><strong>Strengthening the capacity of law enforcement</strong></h3>



<p>Currently, the capacity of law enforcement is so inadequate it often takes months and years to follow up on leads and analyse collected data. Known material is often neither analysed nor removed. Those behind the abuse do not share their material via Facebook or similar channels, but on the darknet. To track down perpetrators and producers, undercover police work must take place instead of wasting scarce capacities on checking often irrelevant machine reports. It is also essential to strengthen the responsible investigative units in terms of personnel and funding and financial resources, to ensure long-term, thorough and sustained investigations. Reliable standards/guidelines for the police handling of sexual abuse investgations need to be developed and adhered to.</p>



<h3 id="Addressing-not-only-symptoms"><strong>Addressing not only symptoms, but the root cause</strong></h3>



<p>Instead of ineffective technical attempts to contain the spread of exploitation material that has been released, all efforts must focus on preventing such recordings in the first place. Prevention concepts and training play a key role because the vast majority of abuse cases never even become known. Victim protection organisations often suffer from unstable funding.</p>



<h3 id="Fast-and-easily-available-support"><strong>Fast and easily available support for (potential) victims</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Mandatory reporting mechanisms at online services: </strong>In order to achieve effective prevention of online abuse and especially grooming, online services should be required to prominently place reporting functions on the platforms. If the service is aimed at and/or used by young people or children, providers should also be required to inform them about the risks of online grooming. </li>



<li><strong>Hotlines and counseling centers:</strong> Many national hotlines dealing with cases of reported abuse are struggling with financial problems. It is essential to ensure there is sufficient capacity to follow up on reported cases.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="Improving-media-literacy"><strong>Improving media literacy</strong></h3>



<p>Teaching digital literacy at an early age is an essential part of protecting for protecting children and young people online. The children themselves must have the knowledge and tools to navigate the Internet safely. They must be informed that dangers also lurk online and learn to recognise and question patterns of grooming. This could be achieved, for example, through targeted programs in schools and training centers, in which trained staff convey knowledge and lead discussions. Children need to learn to speak up, respond and report abuse, even if the abuse comes from within their sphere of trust (i.e., by people close to them or other people they know and trust), which is often the case. They also need to have access to safe, accessible, and age-appropriate channels to report abuse without fear.</p>

<p>“As with other types of content scanning (whether on platforms like YouTube or in private communications) scanning everything from everyone all the time creates huge risks of leading to mass surveillance by failing the necessity and proportionality test.

In these cases in particular, the client must retain the authority to decide which contents of the mandate may be disclosed to whom.

</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>“In the course of the initiative “Fighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content”, the European Union plans to abolish the digital privacy of correspondence. In order to automatically detect illegal content, all private chat messages are to be screened in the future. This should also apply to content that has so far been protected with strong end-to-end encryption. If this initiative is implemented according to the current plan it would enormously damage our European ideals and the indisputable foundations of our democracy, namely freedom of expression and the protection of privacy […]. The initiative would also severely harm Europe’s strategic autonomy and thus EU-based companies.</p>

</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>Experts from the police and academia are rather critical of the EU’s plan: on the one hand, they fear many false reports by the scanners, and on the other hand, an alibi function of the law. Daniel Kretzschmar, spokesman for the Federal Board of the Association of German Criminal Investigators, says that the fight against child abuse depictions is “enormously important” to his association. Nevertheless, he is skeptical: unsuspected persons could easily become the focus of investigations. At the same time, he says, privatizing these initiative investigations means “making law enforcement dependent on these companies, which is actually a state and sovereign task. “</p>



<p>Thomas-Gabriel Rüdiger, head of the Institute for Cybercriminology at the Brandenburg Police University, is also rather critical of the EU project. “In the end, it will probably mainly hit minors again,” he told WELT. Rüdiger refers to figures from the crime statistics, according to which 43 percent of the recorded crimes in the area of child pornographic content would be traced back to children and adolescents themselves. This is the case, for example, with so-called “sexting” and “schoolyard pornography “, when 13- and 14-year-olds send each other lewd pictures.</p>



<p>Real perpetrators, who you actually want to catch, would probably rather not be caught. “They are aware of what they have done and use alternatives. Presumably, USB sticks and other data carriers will then be increasingly used again,” Rüdiger continues.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://exectos.eu.org/">https://exectos.eu.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40725451">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			       <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>ExectOS aims to be a stable and flexible, general purpose operating system written from scratch. It is designed to be
modular, maintainable and compatible with existing software. It implements a brand new XT architecture and features own
native application interface. On the backend, it contains a powerful driver model between device drivers and the kernel,
that enables kernel level components to be upgraded without a need to recompile all drivers.</p>
<h2 id="xt-architecture">XT Architecture</h2>
<p>ExectOS is a preemptive, reentrant multitasking operating system that implements the XT architecture which derives from
NT™ architecture. It is modular, and consists of two main layers: microkernel and user modes. Its’ kernel mode has
full access to the hardware and system resources and runs code in a protected memory area. It consists of executive
services, which is itself made up on many modules that do specific tasks, a kernel and drivers. Unlike the NT™, system
does not feature a separate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) between the physical hardware and the rest of the OS. Instead,
XT architecture integrates a hardware specific code with the kernel. The user mode is made up of subsystems and it has been
designed to run applications written for many different types of operating systems. This allows us to implement any
environment subsystem to support applications that are strictly written to the corresponding standard (eg. DOS, or POSIX).
Thanks to that ExectOS will allow to run existing software, including Win32 applications.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completely free, Open Source and community-driven modern Operating System.</li>
<li>Native multiple architecture support. It runs on x86 and x86_64 and is portable to other architectures.</li>
<li>Hardware layer API allows for a single unified kernel. There is no need to maintain a separate kernel forks.</li>
<li>Uses a couple of ideas from other open source projects, but it’s our own ideas that really sets us apart and defines
ExectOS. The majority of code is original, not forked.</li>
<li>Modular design for better compatibility with existing software and drivers, enabling binaries to remain compatible even
when the core system is updated.</li>
<li>Own, XT drivers for commonly used devices as well as NT™ drivers compatibility layer for better hardware support.</li>
<li>Technical support directly from the architects and developers of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<ul>
<li>We believe, there is no ideal Operating System on the market. During ExectOS development, we try to bring most useful
features known from existing solutions, while keeping compatibility with NT™ architecture at desired level.</li>
<li>Some of our ideas differ greatly from other projects and it is much easier if we do not have to fight legacy code and
ideas.</li>
<li>We need the freedom to break things when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep the greatest advantages of the NT™ architecture, while implementing new features and technologies known from
other Operating Systems.</li>
<li>Flexibility where it makes sense to provide flexibility.</li>
<li>Be able to deliver features that other non-commercial Operating Systems consider too ambitious.</li>

  <p><em>[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]</em></p><p>On January 28, 2022, about an hour before dawn, the four-lane Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, collapsed without warning. Five vehicles, including an articulating bus, fell with the bridge, and another car drove off the abutment after the collapse, not realizing the bridge was gone. Although there were no fatalities, several people in the vehicles were seriously injured.  And this bridge had been listed as being in ‘poor condition’ for over a decade. Anyone who walked by the supports in the park below would have had reason to question its safety, as seen in this sadly prophetic tweet from 2018, four years before the collapse. So, why was it left open in this state?</p><p>While some initial findings were released earlier, the official NTSB report was delivered to the public this year in February, more than two years after the collapse and over a year after the replacement bridge was built and open. The report included the use of some really cool technology for the forensic study of structures and revealed systemic flaws in how we inspect, analyze, and prioritize repairs for bridges. In fact, the NTSB issued recommendations to basically every organization involved in this bridge from the bottom to the top, and they referenced that tweet that got so much attention. This is a crazy case study of how common sense can fall through the cracks of strained budgets and rigid oversight from federal, state, and city staff. And the lessons that came out of it aren’t just relevant to people who work on bridges. It's a story of how numerous small mistakes by individuals can collectively lead to a tragedy.  I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering. </p><p>The Fern Hollow Bridge was opened in 1973, replacing an aging arch bridge built at the beginning of the 20th century, crossing Frick Park and Fern Hollow Creek. The 1973 bridge used a  K-Frame design with continuous steel girders supporting the deck, each with two angled steel legs supported on concrete thrust blocks. At the time, the bridge’s design was celebrated because it blended well into its settings. It was featured on the cover of the 1974 edition of Prize Bridges by the American Institute of Steel Construction. And a big part of why it looked so harmonious with the park below was the type of steel used for the design. </p><p>The Fern Hollow bridge was fabricated from weathering steel, sometimes referred to by its genericized trademark, COR-TEN. And it was developed commercially right there in Pittsburgh by US Steel in the 1930s. Unlike most types of steel, whose rust can continually flake away, exposing more material to corrosion, the oxide layer on weathering steel (called its patina) is more stable and protective, shielding the underlying material against exposure to the elements. In that way, weathering steel acts kind of like aluminum, which protects itself from corrosion in a similar way. And, architecturally, it’s a nice material. You get this rustic look that can give structures a more comfortable and less obtrusive appearance. But weathering steel has a limitation: For a stable patina to form, the material has to stay mostly dry. If water pools or the steel is kept damp for extended periods, that patina of rust isn’t enough to protect the underlying steel, and it will continue to corrode. Corrosion of structural steel is called section loss by engineers, and it's easy to see why in these photos of the bridge.</p><p>What’s more alarming than what’s in those photos is where they came from: inspection reports of the bridge. It’s not that this deterioration somehow went unnoticed. The bridge supports were clearly visible from a popular walking trail. Between 2005 and 2021, this bridge was inspected a total of 14 times! In those reports, you get a clear and vivid story of its decline. First were the drainage problems. You can see in these images from multiple previous bridge inspections there were drainage grates on the roadway that were 100 percent clogged. Rainwater, and even worse, salty meltwater from the frequent snow that Pittsburgh sees each winter couldn’t follow the prescribed drainage paths off the deck and into the creek below. Instead, that water would leak through the bridge deck, dribbling over the structural steel, and pooling in portions of the legs where webbing and tie-plates could catch puddles of water, leaves, and debris.</p><p>The City was aware of the section loss due to these drainage problems for many years before the collapse. Nearly every inspection report noted problems with the drains and the accelerating corrosion that was resulting. In fact, in 2009, the cross-braces connecting each pair of legs were found to be failing, and steel cables were installed as a temporary retrofit until the framing could be replaced. These cables were lightly tensioned to add structural integrity to the bridge but were never meant to be a permanent solution. </p><p>You can see the ends of two of these cables in this now-infamous tweet from 2018. Of course, the more notable feature of this image is the fully separated steel cross-brace! That photo was taken about nine years after the temporary cables were installed. And they remained in place for the rest of the bridge's life, which ended up being only four more years. But the cross-bracing between the legs wasn’t the only place where corrosion was an issue. The legs themselves were also fabricated from weathering steel, and that steel was suffering, too. Since 2005, inspection reports marked them in fair to poor condition with areas where the steel had completely rusted through. By 2019, all four legs were given the worst assessment possible for an individual bridge element. According to the code, that should trigger a structural review to check whether the integrity is affected by the poor condition of a structural element, but it was never done. And that’s not all.</p><p>An important part of inspecting steel bridges is identifying members that are “fracture critical.” That’s engineering jargon, but the idea is actually pretty straightforward. It’s any piece of steel under tension that lacks redundancy. If it breaks, the bridge collapses. And these types of members get special attention because of their importance, so inspection teams identify them ahead of time to make sure they get a proper look. This drawing shows in green which elements of the bridge were considered to be fracture-critical. Notice that while the girders crossing the span are identified, the legs are not. And, at first glance, that might match your intuitions. Bridge piers, columns, and vertical supports usually don’t experience tension forces, right? They’re in compression. So if there’s a crack or break, the forces just squeeze it together, generally not that big a deal. But K-frame bridges are different. By splaying out the legs, there are loading conditions that can apply bending forces, putting part of each beam in tension. And, this particular bridge had another feature that was absolutely essential to its performance.</p><p>Each leg of the bridge was essentially an I-beam: a central web with a top and bottom flange. To simplify the foundation design, each leg had a “shoe”: a tapered end that would connect to the concrete block. It’s clear that the narrower section would have less strength, so larger stiffeners were added to each shoe to strengthen that portion of the leg. These are just steel plates welded to the web and flanges to increase the leg’s rigidity. And I built a little cardboard model to clarify this point. This particular stiffener, called the transverse tie plate, bridges the two flanges right where they taper down. And if I apply a compressive force on the leg, it’s easy to see what kind of force that tie plate experiences as a result. It’s tension. These tie plates were fracture-critical members of the bridge, but never identified as such, and so, even though it was clear they were deteriorating quickly over time, the inspectors never elevated the concerns to a priority level that might have spurred a more immediate response. But there was another opportunity to catch the problem.</p><p>In 2013, an inspector was concerned enough about the bridge's safety to recommend that it be reviewed for a load rating. Most bridges are designed to allow any legal load to pass over, but sometimes, either because of an old design or poor structural conditions, it's necessary to limit the weight of vehicles allowed. Engineers analyzed the bridge in 2014 and decided it could only handle 26 tons per vehicle, just over half of its previous rating. When NTSB reviewed that decision in hindsight, they found some pretty serious errors.</p><p>For one, the load rating for the bridge was based on a layer of about 3 inches of asphalt paving on top of the concrete road deck. In reality, the bridge had about double that amount. The City’s records of the removal and addition of pavement were poorly kept, so the engineering firm doing the load rating had no idea there was so much extra weight. For two, the engineers didn’t fully account for all the corrosion on the legs. This was partly because inspectors hadn’t cleaned off the rust to measure and report the actual thickness of the remaining steel. Even so, the engineers used a method that distributed the section loss from corrosion evenly along the entire leg, instead of applying it where it actually was, at the shoes and tie plates. That’s a pretty commonly-used simplification that usually generates conservative results (since the worst corrosion is rarely located at the most critical part of a structure), but again, that wasn’t the case for the Fern Hollow Bridge, and no one had recognized how important those tie plates really were.</p><p>And for three, those engineers made an incorrect assumption about how the bridge’s legs would buckle. A structural member under compression will buckle at different loads depending on how much restraint it has at the ends. This is something you learn in year one of engineering. If you keep a column from rotating at its ends, you substantially increase the amount of force it can withstand, and with the original cross-bracing between the legs, that would have been the case. But I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that steel cables don’t provide the same support as rigid members. Again, this is engineering 101: “You can’t push a rope.” The cables provided some restraint, but not in the same way that the original bracing could, so the load rating applied to the bridge ended up significantly overestimating its actual capacity. In fact, when NTSB updated the load rating with these errors fixed, they found that the bridge should have been limited to 3 tons, basically nothing for a bridge. In effect, this load rating exercise should have closed the bridge to traffic entirely. These structural issues were exactly what the process was meant to identify. But instead, the bridge stayed open to everyone except the largest of trucks,and here’s what happened, courtesy of NTSB’s animation team.</p><p>The transverse tie plate on the southwest leg, weakened by corrosion, failed first under tension, separating the flanges on the leg, and ultimately causing it to buckle. With no redundancy in the supports, the loads had nowhere to go, and so the rest of the bridge fell into the valley below. The articulated bus had both rear-facing and forward-facing cameras on it, which captured some truly harrowing footage of the event. Looking at the rear-facing camera, you can see the western portion of the bridge begin to fail. Keep an eye on the railing, and you can see the exact moment it starts. Once it started, there was no stopping it. Within two seconds, the front-facing camera shows that the collapse had propagated all the way to the eastern abutment, and the bridge fully failed.</p><p>Thankfully, the collapse happened during particularly inclement weather. School delays and generally poor conditions meant that traffic was lighter than normal, and the weather also likely kept folks away from the trail underneath. On a fair weather day during rush hour, it wouldn’t be uncommon for the eastbound lanes of the bridge to be fully occupied by heavy traffic, and the trail underneath to be populated with dog walkers, families, or even classes on field trips from nearby schools. The bridge also carried a large gas line, which was severed during the collapse, leading to a major leak and some evacuations, but they got it shut off in time. It really is remarkable that nobody was killed in a failure of this magnitude. But there were still multiple victims needlessly affected for the rest of their lives by the collapse, not to mention the overall erosion of trust in the organizations and engineering systems meant to keep the public safe.</p><p>By pure happenstance, President Biden was set to arrive in Pittsburgh on the very day of the collapse to speak in support of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, so he rearranged his trip to make some remarks at the site. One of the entities supported by the act is the National Highway Performance Program, which ultimately funded the replacement of the collapsed bridge. But at that time, no one understood the full scope of neglect and bad assumptions that led to the gradual, and then sudden, demise of the bridge. In those two years after Fern Hollow Bridge fell, the NTSB conducted numerous interviews with those involved, from the paving contractors to the inspectors to the bridge rating engineers. They performed 3D laser scanning of the bridge components to compare them to as-built conditions. They tested sections of steel for strength and durability. They reviewed all the previous records of the design, construction, and repairs. And they built a detailed finite-element model of the bridge to confirm that the gradual corrosion of one small structural element, the transverse tie plate on the southwest leg, initiated the collapse. And then they documented why it got to that point: the City of Pittsburgh just didn’t fix it.</p><p>This figure in the NTSB report tells the story as clearly as I think is possible. From 2005 onward, recommendations from inspection reports to repair parts of the bridge didn’t fall off the list. They just kept being repeated by each new inspection, year after year. Since 2007, every single inspection report that included recommendations said to repair the stiffener plates in the legs that were heavily corroded. These were Priority 2 recommendations, which means the timeframe to complete them is before the next inspection. But it was never done. They didn’t fix the drainage problems that were accelerating the corrosion, they didn’t apply the protective coatings that might have slowed it down, and they never analyzed the capacity of the legs after they were rated the worst possible condition a structural element can have. And, apparently, there was no mechanism to follow up on those recommendations by the state charged with overseeing the bridge inspection program. When there was finally a chance to recognize how deficient the structure really was through a new load rating, the engineers made a few bad assumptions, missed it by a mile, and left the bridge open, a ticking time bomb, for years. (Years, by the way, in which the City still didn’t address the recommendations from inspection reports.)</p><p>Due to the nature of the emergency, the site was cleaned up quickly, with a huge crane brought in to remove the bus, and building of the replacement bridge happened on a fast-track schedule. The new bridge uses a more conventional design: pre-stressed concrete girders on vertical piers. The formed stone texture on the columns certainly doesn’t blend into the park as well as the graceful and patinaed K-frame once did, but I doubt anyone involved in the project could stomach another structure built from weathering steel, given the circumstances. The new bridge might not win any awards for beauty, but it could win some for speed. After a colossal effort from the design and construction teams, it opened to limited traffic less than a year after the collapse in December of 2022, and by July the next year, it was fully operational. It would be almost a year later before the NTSB concluded why the previous bridge collapsed, not for the purpose of blame, but to issue recommendations to prevent something like this from recurring in the future. And unlike the recommendations from those inspection reports, many of the NTSB recommendations have already been put into practice.</p><p>They published a special report on weathering steel bridges to highlight the specific challenges of keeping them in good condition, and they identified several similar bridges that needed a closer look. The City of Pittsburgh quadrupled their spending on inspection, maintenance, and repairs. And they redid the load ratings on all the bridges they owned, resulting in one bridge being closed until it can be rehabilitated and two more having lane restrictions imposed. PennDOT released a technical bulletin to shore up their bridge inspection program. And even the federal government has implemented a process to identify, prioritize, and follow up on recommendations related to weathering steel bridges.</p><p>But as I read through those recommendations from the NTSB, one thing struck me: They all add up to more paperwork. And this is just my own personal opinion as someone who did this kind of work for nearly a decade (not on bridges, but other large infrastructure projects). We have these national inspection standards and procedures - huge documents that you could spend an entire career understanding. We have the Federal Highway Administration overseeing the program, state DOTs charged with carrying it out, individual bridge owners, like Pittsburgh, responsible for inspecting their own bridges, and then the private contractors who do most of the actual work. We have this huge machine with thousands of people, federal, state, and local involvement, and millions of dollars meant to keep the traveling public safe. And what did it do for us when a photo like this is all it would take any reasonable person to say: “This bridge needs to be fixed”?</p><p>This big machine, in a lot of cases, has all the work sectionalized out. The inspectors see the bridge up close, but they have no autonomy to do anything but document and give recommendations. It’s not their bridge. But the owners who are charged with the safety of their bridges just see a piece of paper. Each recommendation is just another one on the list of sometimes hundreds of action items, to sort and prioritize and try to find the budget to cover. All the NTSB recommendations feel a little bit like bandaids if the real source of the problem was that no one person in this whole machine had both a full appreciation of the bridge's condition and the authority to do something about it. And if that’s the case, I’m not sure any of those recommendations really fixes that problem. I don’t know what the answer is, and I’m still wrestling with trying to understand how something like this can fall through the cracks of the enormous system we’ve built for the sole purpose of trying to prevent it.</p><p>If you take a walk on the Tranquil Trail through Frick Park beside Fern Hollow Creek and look carefully, you can still see remnants of the old bridge. And I’m glad the City left them, because they’re a good reminder that design and construction are two parts of a three-part system for keeping people safe. Maintaining infrastructure is thankless work. Don’t get me wrong, it can be a really rewarding career. Inspections involve a lot of time out in the field seeing cool structures up close. And repair projects are often interesting challenges for contractors. But they’re not rewarding in the same way that designing and building new stuff can be. No one holds a press conference and cuts a big ribbon at the end of a bridge inspection or structural retrofit. Building a new structure is not just an achievement in its own right; it’s a commitment to take good care of it for its entire design life, and then to rehabilitate, or replace, or even close it when it’s no longer safe for the public. And I think this is the perfect case study to show that there’s more we could do to encourage and celebrate that kind of work as well. </p>

John, and the other whistleblowers who had the courage to stand with him, have woken up the government and the American people to the major safety crisis Boeing created and is responsible for. </p><p>“Boeing’s CEO Dave Calhoun had his own reckoning before the Senate subcommittee, acknowledging that he had never spoken to any of the whistleblowers. </p><p>“Calhoun in no uncertain terms was admonished by US Senators that turning a deaf ear on whistleblowers would not be tolerated and had to change immediately at Boeing.”</p><p>Barnett, 62, a quality control engineer at Boeing for 32 years, was found dead at a South Carolina hotel in March, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

<p>We have been training language models (LMs) for years, but finding valuable resources about the data pipelines commonly used to build the datasets for training these models is paradoxically challenging. It may be because we often take it for granted that these datasets exist (or at least existed? As replicating them is becoming increasingly difficult). However, one must consider the numerous decisions involved in creating such pipelines, as it can significantly impact the final model’s quality, as seen recently in the struggle of models aiming to replicate LLaMA (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1">LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models</a>). It might be tempting to think that now, with large models that can scale well, data is becoming more critical than modeling, since model architectures are not radically changing much. However, data has always been critical.</p>
<p>This article provides a short introduction to the pipeline used to create the data to train LLaMA, but it allows for many variations and I will add details about other similar pipelines when relevant, such as <strong>RefinedWeb</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116">The RefinedWeb Dataset for Falcon LLM: Outperforming Curated Corpora with Web Data, and Web Data Only</a>) and <strong>The Pile</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027">The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling</a>). This article is mainly based on the pipeline described in CCNet (<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.494/">CCNet: Extracting High Quality Monolingual Datasets from Web Crawl Data</a>) and LLaMA’s paper, both from Meta. CCNet was developed focusing on the data source that is often the largest one, but also the most challenging in terms of quality: <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a>.</p>
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>The entire pipeline of CCNet (plus some minor modifications made by LLaMA’s paper) can be seen below. It has the following stages: data source, deduplication, language, filtering, and the “is-reference” filtering which was added in LLaMA. I will go through each one of them in the sections below.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into it !</p>

<h2>Common Crawl</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_1-300x227.png" alt="" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_1-300x227.png 300w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_1-700x529.png 700w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_1-768x581.png 768w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_1.png 1330w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Common Crawl (or CC) data is the data coming from a <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">non-profit organization</a> of the same name that does massive crawling of websites and releases this archive under permissive terms. This is by no means an easy feat, consider the tasks of filtering spam, deciding which URLs to crawl, crawling massive amounts of data from different servers, data formats, etc. That’s why you should <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/donate/">consider donating</a> if you use it.</p>
<p>Common Crawl provides different archival formats that you can use and this format evolved over time. Nowadays they are available in 3 main different formats (besides the index): WARC, WAT, and WET.</p>
<h4>WARC/WAT/WET formats</h4>
<p><strong>WARC</strong>: the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/#WARC-Format">WARC format</a> is the largest one as it is the least processed version of the crawl process, it is the raw data and has a very clever format that records the HTTP response headers, so you can even get information about the server being used on each host. This format is seldom used for NLP as it is really huge and has data that is not used for LLMs training. However, this is the primary data format of CC so it is very rich and might be useful for multimodal datasets, that’s why I think that WARC and WAT (described below) might start to see more uses in the next years.</p>
<p><strong>WAT</strong> and <strong>WET</strong>: these are secondary data sources of CC as they are processed data. These two are the ones that are often used for training LMs and here is where different pipelines start to diverge as well. These formats contain different types of records with the WAT having more metadata than WET and also HTML tags content and links. WET is mainly only a textual format.</p>
<p>If you want to see real examples of WARC/WAT/WET, <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/#WARC-Format">take a look at this link</a> as I omitted examples here to keep things short, but they are very interesting formats that are worth a look if you want to use them or understand how to load and parse them.</p>
<p>Now, CCNet (<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.494/">CCNet: Extracting High Quality Monolingual Datasets from Web Crawl Data</a>) <strong>uses the WET</strong> format which is purely textual, and that is where we will focus, however, there are <strong>some other pipelines that use WAT</strong> with the argument that to extract high-quality textual data you have to go to WAT instead of WET (bypassing the CommonCrawl processing to extract text). One example of a pipeline that <strong>doesn’t use the WET</strong> files is The Pile (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027">The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling</a>), where they use <a href="https://github.com/miso-belica/jusText">jusText</a>. They mentioned that they can extract higher-quality text than using WET files.</p>
<p>You probably realized that we just started with CC and there are already multiple options to extract data from it. Another recent pipeline called <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb">RefinedWeb</a> (used in Falcon) also uses WARC directly and skip the CC pipeline for text extraction (the one which generates the WET files). RefinedWeb, however, uses <a href="https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">trafilatura</a> instead of jusText for text extraction.</p>
<h2>URL Filtering</h2>
<p>Although it is not mentioned in CCNet, many pipelines do URL filtering using public available blocklists of adult/violent/malware/etc websites. In RefinedWeb for example, they filter URLs <strong>using a blocklist of 4.6M domains and also use a word-based filtering of the URL</strong>. You can be very creative here and aggregate multiple blocklists from different sources.</p>
<h2>Deduplication<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_21-178x300.png" alt="" width="212" height="357" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_21-178x300.png 178w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_21-700x1180.png 700w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_21.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px"></h2>
<p>Let’s now talk about deduplication, which can be a controversial matter. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06499">In Deduplicating Training Data Makes Language Models Better</a> you can have an idea of what they found. There is, however, Pythia (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373">Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling</a>) that said that “<em>… deduplication of our training data <strong>has no clear benefit on language modeling performance</strong></em>.” [emphasis added]. Therefore I think it is still an open debate, but given excellent results from LLaMA, I wouldn’t leave deduplication aside for any new model, but we will probably see more works about it in the near future.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss now how deduplication works on CCNet. CC snapshots are big, if we look at the size of WET files for March/April 2023, <strong>WET is 8.7 TiB and WAT is 21.1 TiB</strong> (both compressed already!). The first thing that CCNet does is to break these WET snapshots into 5GB shards that are saved in JSON where each entry corresponds to a crawled web page.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4839"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Desmazieres-biblio-alphabet2-sm-206x300.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="399" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Desmazieres-biblio-alphabet2-sm-206x300.jpg 206w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Desmazieres-biblio-alphabet2-sm.jpg 686w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4839">Erik Desmazieres’s “La Bibliothèque de Babel”. 1997.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next step after sharding is paragraph normalization, as deduplication happens at the paragraph level. They normalize each paragraph by lower-casing it, replacing numbers with a placeholder, and removing all <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/cc_net/blob/main/cc_net/text_normalizer.py#LL10C1-L10C14">Unicode punctuation</a> (you can also replace them) and accent marks. Next, they compute the SHA1 of each paragraph and use the first 64 bits to deduplicate them. After that, there is the option to do deduplication by comparing among all shards or a fixed number of shards, more details in <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.494.pdf">their paper</a> if you are interested in this comparison.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that on the RefinedWeb dataset, they seem to be <strong>much more aggressive</strong> by employing fuzzy deduplication and using “strict settings” that led to the removal rates “far higher than other datasets have reported” (as a baseline, CCNet reported that duplicated data accounted for 70% of the text). This can certainly have a significant impact on dataset diversity.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of deduplication is described in CCNet paper: this step removes a lot of boilerplate (e.g. navigation menus, cookie warnings, and contact information). It also <strong>removes English content from pages in other languages</strong> and makes language identification which we will discuss next, more robust.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the process:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_dedup_v2-700x741.png" alt="" width="640" height="677" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_dedup_v2-700x741.png 700w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_dedup_v2-283x300.png 283w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_dedup_v2-768x813.png 768w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_dedup_v2.png 1065w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>As you can see, it starts by stripping spaces, then lower cases it and replaces the digits with a placeholder (e.g. zero). After that it removes (or replaces) Unicode punctuation, performs a SHA1 hashing, and uses the first 8 bytes for deduplication comparisons (paragraph level). Do not confuse the deduplication process with training data, this is done only to compute the final hash and deduplicate data, not to use this data to train the model.</p>
<p>Now, on RefinedWeb, they followed what was done in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446">Gopher</a> as well which is to remove repetitions before filtering for deduplication by removing any document with excessive line, paragraph, or n-gram repetitions. After that, they used a deduplication pipeline using MinHash (<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos598C/broder97resemblance.pdf">On the resemblance and containment of documents</a>) which they found to be very effective at removing SEO templates (placeholder SEO text repeated across websites, etc). They also did exact deduplication, but since CC is enormous, they did something similar to what was mentioned as an alternative in CCNet, where it is first sharded and deduplication happens at individual shard level.</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_3-222x300.png" alt="" width="222" height="300" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_3-222x300.png 222w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_3-700x948.png 700w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_3.png 752w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px"> Let’s take a look now at language identification, scoring, and filtering. In CCNet they employed <a href="https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html">fastText</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759">Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification</a>), which was trained with data from Wikipedia, Tatoeba, and SETimes. fastText supports 176 languages and reports a score for each one of them.</p>
<p>In CCNet, if the score for the most probable language is not higher than 0.5 (50%), they discard the web page, otherwise, the language is classified as being of the most probable language identified.</p>
<p>Note that although the LLaMA dataset filtered non-English data from the CC dataset, it was trained with other datasets that had other languages (e.g. Wikipedia). In my experience, LLaMA is impressively good at other languages as well (e.g. Portuguese).</p>
<p>RefinedWeb pipeline, just like CCNet, also employed fastText to identify languages. One important distinction here is that the RefinedWeb pipeline uses a different threshold of 0.65 instead of 0.5 and they have switched the order of deduplication and language identification, they do language identification before the deduplication, as opposed to CCNet which does the reverse.</p>
<h2>LM Filtering</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_5-204x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="338" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_5-204x300.png 204w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_5-700x1028.png 700w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_5-768x1128.png 768w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_5.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px">At this point, we have deduplicated data, and language was identified and filtered. It doesn’t mean, however, that the quality is good. That’s the reason why CCNet does another filtering step: they use the perplexity from a language model trained on the target domain language, as they found this score to be a relatively good proxy for quality. They train a 5-gram Kneser-Ney model on the Wikipedia of the same language as the target domain and then use these models to compute per-paragraph perplexity.</p>
<p>With the perplexities in hand, you need to find a threshold. What CCNet paper describes is that they computed 3 parts of equal size (head, middle, tail) from the distribution of perplexities of each language (as different languages showed very different perplexity distributions), however, there is an important excerpt from the paper that I quote below:</p>
<blockquote><p>(…) Some documents despite being valid text ends up in the tail because they have a vocabulary very different from Wikipedia. This includes blog comments with spokenlike text, or very specialized forums with specific jargon. We decided to not remove content based on the LM score because we think that some of it could be useful for specific applications. (…)</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that it really depends on your application, as you might be ending up removing important data by blind thresholding just using an LM trained on Wikipedia. In RefineWeb, they avoided using LM for filtering and relied only on simple rules and heuristics. They used a pipeline very similar to the one used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446">Gopher</a>, where outliers are filtered “..<em>. in terms of overall length, symbol-to-word ratio, and other criteria ensuring the document is actual natural language</em>“, they remark that this needs to be done per language as well, the usual issue with using heuristics too tied to the language characteristics.</p>
<h2>“Is reference” filtering</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_6-256x300.png" alt="" width="256" height="300" srcset="https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_6-256x300.png 256w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_6-700x819.png 700w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_6-768x899.png 768w, https://blog.christianperone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ccnet_6.png 858w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"> This section is not present in CCNet but it was used as an extra step in the LLaMA dataset so I decided to add it here as well. This step is also not very well described in LLaMA’s paper, but it seems that a simple linear classifier was trained (not sure with which features) to classify pages used as references in Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, then pages classified as non-reference were discarded.</p>
<p>I think that this step might look simple at first hand, but it can have a significant impact on dataset quality depending on the threshold used. It seems to me that for LLaMA’s dataset, the LM filtering was more conservative to avoid removing relevant data and then they added this extra step to deal with remaining quality issues, but this is me hypothesizing.</p>

<h2>Addendum: RefinedWeb diagram</h2>
<p>RefinedWeb paper has a very nice Sankey diagram of their pipeline:</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this article, the main goal was to give a brief overview of the steps and decisions you need to take before being able to train a large language model (LLM). There are obviously many other important aspects, such as proportions of different datasets (mixing), tokenization, etc. Given that CC dataset is usually the largest dataset in LLM training, I decided to focus on the pipelines that directly deal with this particular set before tokenization.</p>
<p>Many design decisions on data pre-processing pipelines are made with performance in mind, as we are dealing with large chunks of data from CC dataset. It seems to me that you can find a better balance by investing a little more of the computing budget on the data side, especially when you consider the cost of LLMs training. It is, however, very difficult to anticipate what would be the impact of different decisions taken in the data pipeline on LLMs after training, that’s why small experiments, manual data inspection, and exploratory data analysis are paramount to get an understanding of what is going on.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>every company has the dataset it deserves</strong>. It is a long-term investment that requires substantial experimentation, engineering effort, attention to detail, and good intuition to make bets under uncertainty. But it is an investment that pays off in the long run.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi has emerged as one of the most popular technologies for providing Internet access, but it is also frequently exploited by malicious actors to launch various attacks. With the deployment of wireless security mechanisms like WPA2/WPA3 and the adoption of other protective strategies such as Access Point (AP) isolation, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) protection, and rogue AP detection, off-path attackers (those unable to control the router) are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain confidential information of Wi-Fi users.</p>



<p>Our recent discovery in router firmware exposes a security flaw in routers’ Network Address Translation (NAT) mapping handling, which can be exploited by attackers to bypass TCP’s built-in randomization. This facilitates off-path TCP hijacking attacks, intercepting Wi-Fi TCP traffic. Our <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/exploiting-sequence-number-leakage-tcp-hijacking-in-nat-enabled-wi-fi-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research paper detailing the attack</a> has been accepted by NDSS 2024,</p>



<p>Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where an attacker and a victim client are connected to the same Wi-Fi network to access Internet services (for example, consider strangers connecting to the same Wi-Fi network of a coffee shop). For the attacker to hijack the TCP connection between the victim and the server offering common services such as social media or online finance, the attacker must detect the existence of the TCP connection first. Upon confirmation, the attacker then proceeds to infer the sequence and acknowledgment numbers of the ongoing bidirectional communication.</p>

<h2>Attack steps</h2>



<p>We’ve observed that routers often employ port preservation strategies during NAT and lack reverse path validation as required by <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFC 3704</a>, enabling attackers to deduce the source ports of other client connections. In the first step, following the method illustrated in Figure 2, the attacker can deduce the source port of other clients by altering the source port numbers specified in the forged SYN and SYN/ACK packets, then observing if it can receive the SYN/ACK sent by itself until identifying the correct port used by the victim client for subsequent attacks.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2.png"><img decoding="async" width="1006" height="1024" src="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2-1006x1024.png" alt="Figure 2 — Inferring the source port of the victim TCP connection." srcset="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2-1006x1024.png 1006w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2-295x300.png 295w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2-768x782.png 768w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2-624x635.png 624w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2-1320x1343.png 1320w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TCP-Hijacking-NAT-2.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2 — Inferring the source port of the victim TCP connection.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve found that most routers, for performance reasons, do not rigorously inspect the sequence numbers of TCP packets. Consequently, this introduces serious security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit by crafting forged reset (RST) packets to maliciously clear NAT mappings in the router. In the second attack step, the attacker proceeds to steal the sequence number (SEQ) and acknowledgment number (ACK) of the normal TCP connection between the victim client and the server, as depicted in Figure 3.</p>

<p>Once the attacker has obtained the source port, sequence number, and acknowledgment number used by the client connection, it can initiate TCP connection manipulation attacks. The TCP protocol is a critical foundational protocol of the Internet, carrying important network application protocols such as SSH, HTTP, and FTP. Therefore, hijacking attacks targeting TCP can be applied across various scenarios. For instance, SSH denial of service attacks, FTP private file downloads, and HTTP cache pollution, among others. Figure 4 illustrates the effect of an attacker poisoning a victim’s HTTP webpage.</p>

<h2>Empirical study</h2>



<p>We conducted tests on 67 mainstream routers from 30 different manufacturers, including 360, Aruba, ASUS, Amazon, Cisco Meraki, China Mobile, Comfast, D-Link, GL.iNet, Google, H3C, Huawei, IP-COM, iKuai, JdCloud, Linksys, Mercury, Netgear, Netcore, Ruijie, Skyworth, Tenda, TP-Link, Ubiquiti, Volans, Wavlink, WiMaster, Xiaomi, ZTE, pfSense, and others. Among these, we found that 52 routers from 24 manufacturers were susceptible to this attack. The test results are illustrated in Table 1.</p>

<p>Additionally, we conducted measurement studies on 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks and found that 75 (81%) of them were susceptible to this attack. Our case studies indicate that terminating SSH connections, downloading private files from FTP servers, and injecting false HTTP response packets on average took 17.5, 19.4, and 54.5 seconds, respectively, with success rates of 87.4%, 82.6%, and 76.1%. The detailed experimental results are shown in the paper.</p>



<h2>Mitigation</h2>



<p>We have registered the issue to the affected manufacturers by submitting vulnerability reports and contacting them via email. As of now, we have received a positive response from the OpenWrt community, confirming our findings and releasing patches to fix the vulnerability. Additionally, seven router vendors (namely TP-Link, Huawei, Xiaomi, 360, Mercury, Ubiquiti, and Linksys) have acknowledged our report and are actively working to fix their products. Furthermore, we have been assigned 10 CVE identifiers for different vendors. Other vendors are still investigating the vulnerability.</p>



<p>To mitigate this attack, we suggest three countermeasures:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Random port allocation:</strong> Routers should employ a random selection strategy when creating new NAT mappings.</li>



<li><strong>Reverse path validation:</strong> Following the recommendation of RFC 3704, strict mode is utilized to filter out spoofed packets. In our testing, routers from ASUS, Netgear, ZTE, Aruba, Cisco Meraki, TP-LINK, and Mercury default to this recommendation, thus enhancing defence against our attacks.</li>



<li><strong>TCP window checking:</strong> We advocate for routers to rigorously inspect the sequence and acknowledgment numbers of received packets. OpenWrt has already implemented this mitigation after our disclosure.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I wanted to explore different ways of communicating between different processes executing on the same machine, and doing so as fast as possible. We're focussing on high speed inter-process communication (IPC), but some of these approaches can be extended across a network. We'll do this exploration in Rust.</p>
<p>A reminder that since these are independent processes, most approaches you'd take within-process are unavailable to us. Rather than communicating between threads, or between asynchronous routines, these are techniques to shared data between different programs. They might not even both be written in Rust.</p>
<p>The code will mostly be snippets, but the full source is available <a href="https://github.com/3tilley/rust-experiments/tree/master/ipc">here</a>, with benchmark results at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem
</h2>
<p>We want to send a message ("ping") from one process to another, and when it's received reply with an acknowledgement ("pong"). This cycle gives us an opportunity to time how long it takes to round trip between two processes. Timing is complicated, and there is a note on it below but we'll run lots of cycles, and calculate average time from there.</p>
<p>We'll set up all the experiments as similarly as possible, with a producer process sending a ping, and a consumer processes replying with a pong. Performance profiling can lead one down a deep rabbit hole, but hopefully this experiment is simple enough that we'll be able to largely isolate the effect of the communication. Though I don't doubt keen-eyed readers will highlight optimisations missed, or operations outside the communication that are not as computationally-free as I've assumed.</p>
<p>Note that we're focussing on low-latency here, not high-throughput. Within High-Performance Computing they are related, but are focussed on different goals. As an example to illustrate the difference, imagine a piece of software that performs linear algebra tasks by outsourcing those computations to the GPU. For some problem sets (like training Neural Networks) the time taken to complete the training will be significantly faster on the GPU - the calculations performed per second (or throughput) will be much higher. However there is a cost to marshalling and shipping the data onto the GPU in the first place, and it will never be quicker to multiply two small matrices together like that.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-timing">A Note on Timing
</h2>
<p>We tend to assume that computers keep precise, and synchronised clocks. And compared to humans, they largely do. However when trying to measure very quick operations, there are limits to this. For starters, I'm working on a PC with a 4GHz processor. In order to measure something in single cycles, that means I need a clock capable of 0.25ns time resolution - or the time taken for light to travel roughly 10cm. Electrical signals move significantly slower than this, so for a clock outside the processor, even the time taken to sample the timer will dwarf the time taken to perform a few cycles of calculation.</p>
<p>Consider the clock attached to the coin battery on your motherboard. This allows the system to be disconnected from the mains, plugged back in and still know the current time. This is known as a Real Time Clock (RTC). These mostly run at 32.768&nbsp;kHz (2^15 Hz), only giving them a theoretical resolution of 30 µs - or about a hundred thousand clock cycles. What's more they are often configured to produce time at a resolution much lower than that - clearly that clock isn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>The traditional solution is to use a Time Stamp Counter or TSC. This is a processor register that keeps ticking up at the rate of the processor clock speed - so should offer sufficient resolution for our needs. Traditionally the x86 instruction RDTSC is used to read its value. However given the nature of modern CPUs with varying clockspeeds, hyperthreading, deep pipelines, and the fear of cache/timing attacks, it's more complicated than this. On Windows the Microsoft suggestion is to use the <code>QueryPerformanceCounter</code> function, and on Linux <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> - but note these are both system calls (more on those later). Their resolution is also hardware dependent, if you have a newer device (within 10 years) this may be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Precision_Event_Timer">HPET</a> , or it could be a modern incarnation of the TSC. Either way these benchmarks are going to yield different results on different hardware and different operating systems, even if the code ran similarly.</p>
<p><strong>Post takeaway</strong> - timing short-duration events is difficult. If in doubt, run enough iterations of your event such that the total completed time is in milliseconds, and then whatever timing source your benchmarking suite relies on should lead to an accurate result.</p>
<p>To learn about the pain of synchronising multiple clocks like this on a network, read or listen this incredible in-depth piece from Jane Street: https://signalsandthreads.com/clock-synchronization/</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking
</h2>
<p>This was an opportunity for me to try out <a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/divan">Divan</a> for benchmarking. It's a <strong>comfy bench</strong>marking tool, with the goal of being more ergonomic than <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion</a>.</p>
<p>I'll save offering judgment yet as I haven't used it a whole lot, but it seems to do what I need it to do. For each approach we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the consumer process, and wait for it to become available</li>
<li>Prepare data and open connections in both processes, and wait for them to complete</li>
<li>Start timing</li>
<li>Run the ping / pong cycle a number of times</li>
<li>Stop timer</li>
<li>Get an average time per operation</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately <code>divan</code> gives the tools for that, and allows us to annotate the benches with how many operations were executed, and then produce averages based on that (with some caveats). An example benchmark is here:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>divan</span><span>::</span><span>bench</span><span>]

</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="approach-1-pipes">Approach 1 - Pipes
</h2>
<p>This is the first thing that comes to mind to connect processes on the same machine. Like <code>cat | grep</code> we'll just connect <code>stdout</code> of the producer to <code>stdin</code> of the consumer, and vice-versa. This will work on Windows, Linux, and presumably MacOS.</p>
<p>The consumer process reads five bytes into an array from <code>stdin</code>, checks if they're equal to <code>ping</code> followed by a newline, and then responds appropriately. It'll also respond to <code>pong</code>.</p>

<p>The producer process is a little more complex as it has to create and handle consumer first, but pushes out a <code>ping</code> , waits for a response, and then panics if it's not <code>pong</code>.</p>

<p>Aside from some fiddly <code>ref mut</code> treatment for the pipes, this was pretty easy to write. With more complex data structures it might be annoying as some decision would have to be made on a delimiter between messages that wasn't just newlines, but it feels fairly extendable as well.</p>

<p>All in all, this was fairly simple. Currently ping is written to the socket, copied off, and then checked. Pong is then written back. There is a comment in the code highlighting this, but it's not clear to me whether the socket can be read without copying it to a local buffer. Given it's only 5 bytes, and a system call would be required either way, this is likely negligible.</p>
<p>The only other item of interest is that we can set TCP_NODELAY, which disables <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3761276/when-should-i-use-tcp-nodelay-and-when-tcp-cork">Nagle's algorithm</a>. Generally TCP waits briefly to build a packet large enough to be worth sending. Given that we are looking for fast transmission, it makes sense to disable this. Benchmarks with and without this setting are given. Spoiler - it didn't seem to change anything.</p>
<p>Implementation wise, it was slightly more complex than the previous case. A port to connect to had to be passed to the consumer, a connection established, but not too difficult. I felt comfortable writing this code, and I also liked that it could be split across a network if needed. For complex usecases I'd probably miss some HTTP niceties, but for firing packets back and forth this felt flexible and maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3-udp">Approach 3 - UDP
</h2>
<p>Naturally, the next approach was to try UDP. UDP is traditionally used in these contexts for a "fire and forget" mechanism. Unlike TCP the protocol doesn't offer a way of recovering lost or out of order packets. This can be an advantage, because it keeps the connection from getting too "chatty" but if consistency is important those layers need to be implemented manually - either in or out of band. We'll sidestep this discussion because we're running both processes on the same machine and using the loopback adapter, but note that it's still possible to lose packets this way. If the socket buffer is filled with more data than can be read off of it in the reading loop, it will be unapologetically dropped. Perhaps a demonstration for another post.</p>
<p>I'll just show the producer as the consumer is fairly similar.</p>

<p>Overall this worked ok, but it was significantly more fiddly for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As UDP is a broadcast protocol, it doesn't care whether anyone is listening. This means we have to spin up the consumer, connect to the producer, and confirm that they are connected. This could be done out of band, but I've just hacked it by sleeping for a period that seems long enough for the consumer to wake up and be prepared to receive instructions</li>
<li>The API was similar to the TCP API, but meant different things. Specifically the <code>connect</code> method doesn't guarantee any connection has been made, just that the program had bound itself to a remote address that may or may not subsequently fail, or just pump data into the ether. It takes an array of address like the TCP connect method, but it has no meaningful way of deciding whether an address is useful or not (as it doesn't get a handshake) so just takes the first one and binds to it. All of this is in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.connect">documentation</a> but it's not ergonomic. Maybe <code>bind</code> would be a better name, although that does have a specific meaning that may not be appropriate</li>
</ol>
<p>These UDP downsides are well known, and it's used where they don't matter as much, or the asynchronous nature is useful. It's also possible to attach multiple listeners, which isn't possible with TCP. One can see where this might be useful, and why UDP is ubiquitous in usecases like online gaming.</p>

<p>Shared memory is a known rapid way of sharing data between processes. One process allocates a block of memory, and passes that handle to another process. Each process is then free to read from or write to that block of memory independently. If your first instinct is to fear synchronisation and race conditions, you'd be absolutely correct. What's worse is that out of the box, Rust doesn't help us here, despite usually being very helpful with that kind of thing. We're on our own, and it's going to be <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<p>First of all we'll write the code that will execute in both the producer and consumer to create (or take) a handle to some shared memory, and then lay that out as the producer lock, the consumer lock, and a four byte buffer for us to exchange data.</p>

<p>This code was horrible to write, and took some time to get right. I'm almost certain there are still bugs in there. It was complicated because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to do all of our own synchronisation without much help. In some situations, you can imagine using a queue or messaging system to communicate out of band between the processes, letting them know when it's safe to read or write. Given our messages are so small though, this would kill all the performance we've gone to the effort of achieving</li>
<li>It's very low level. We have to marshal the bytes ourselves, and use a lot of unsafe to do so. This also exposes us to changes in the layout of structs that would lead to hard-to-find bugs</li>
<li>I came across several bugs. On the Windows implementation of the most featureful crate there is a minimum page size <a href="https://github.com/elast0ny/shared_memory/issues/107">bug</a> when allocating memory pages</li>
<li>It's not clear whether underlying memory can be easily resized. For our purposes this isn't a problem given we only have 8 bytes, but you can imagine this would quite quickly become an issue</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, unless I was absolutely sure I needed all of the shared memory performance, I wouldn't want to use code like this in Production. Other languages have shared memory frameworks to make things like this easier, but I wasn't able to find anything in Rust when I looked.</p>

<p>The time per operation is similar for most of the approaches, apart from using shared memory. With shared memory we can perform a ping-pong in under 200ns, or around 1000 processor cycles. I have to admit, I still found this a little disappointing. Moving a few bytes around should be faster than that, but I'm going to resist digging too deep yet. Preparing an environment with core-pinning and the correct thread priority is tricky, and given we have to do this with two concurrently running processes, it's even more difficult. Consider too that with hyper-threaded cores, should these processes run on different physical cores, or different logical cores? Do I have to disable Spectre/Meltdown type mitigations? Which memory cache level can we share? Having sunk a lot of hours similar situations before, I'm going to leave the log unflipped for now.</p>
<h2 id="system-calls">System calls
</h2>
<p>But why are all the other methods so slow - and not only that, but so similarly slow? Well Linux gives us the easiest tool to see what's happening <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html">strace</a>. <code>strace</code> allows us to run a command and see what system calls are made by that command. We can test this with the tcp runner, with 10 cycles of ping-pong. It generates a large amount of results, especially since I'm running this through <code>cargo</code>, but we can trim it down and see that in the heart of the execution there are system calls. Given I've only attached this to the producer process, and we can see that there are two systems calls per cycle (a read and a write), so for the whole cycle we require four system calls.</p>

<p>How expensive are system calls? Well I've used <code>strace -r</code> to show times per call, but given previous discussions about how calling a timer can affect times (it adds at least one syscall per line) I won't take those numbers as ironclad. Especially <code>strace</code> is pausing and unpausing the process. Roughly roughly speaking though we're looking at least a few microseconds per read or write. Four of those, and you can see why tcp struggles to do better than 10µs per operation. This is similar for all of the other approaches.</p>
<p>System calls on Linux are complex, and there are various mitigations, but having to wipe registers, validate, drop down into the kernel ring, get the output, and then undo those steps takes time. So if you really care about microseconds, try and avoid them in your hot loops.</p>
<p>For the shared memory approach we can see that after the mmap to create the block of shared memory, there are no calls in our loop, so we don't pay that cost.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
</h2>
<p>I was surprised at how similarly most things performed. I did a cursory investigation into Linux-specific approaches like dbus and Unix Domain Sockets, but they seemed to be in the same ballpark as the non-shared memory approaches. The only other thing to try would be memory-mapped files, but I thought I'd save that for when I wanted to try something similar with larger blocks of data.</p>
<p>If I had to do this in Production, for the majority of workloads I'd probably still use an HTTP / TCP connection. It's portable, reliable on message failure, and I could split it across machines if needs be. However for the cases where latency really matters, the maintenance overhead of using shared memory is worth it.</p>

<p dir="auto">RTranslator is an open-source (<a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries-and-models">almost</a>), free, and offline real-time translation app for Android.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Connect to someone who has the app, connect Bluetooth headphones, put the phone in your pocket and you can have a conversation as if the other person spoke your language.
</p></div>
<div dir="auto"><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/blob/v2.00/images/Conversation_image.png"><img src="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/raw/v2.00/images/Conversation_image.png" alt="Conversation mode"></a></p><p>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/blob/v2.00/images/TextTranslation_and_WalkieTalkie.png"><img src="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/raw/v2.00/images/TextTranslation_and_WalkieTalkie.png" alt="WalkieTalkie mode and Costs"></a></p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conversation mode</h3><a id="user-content-conversation-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Conversation mode" href="#conversation-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Conversation mode is the main feature of RTranslator. In this mode, you can connect with another phone that uses this app. If the user accepts your connection request:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">When you talk, your phone (or the Bluetooth headset, if connected) will capture the audio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The audio captured will be converted into text and sent to the interlocutor's phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The interlocutors' phone will translate the text received into his language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The interlocutors' phone will convert the translated text into audio and will reproduce it from its speaker (or by the Bluetooth headset of the interlocutor if connected to his phone).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All this in both directions.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Each user can have more than one connected phone so that you can translate conversations between more than two people and in any combination.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WalkieTalkie mode</h3><a id="user-content-walkietalkie-mode" aria-label="Permalink: WalkieTalkie mode" href="#walkietalkie-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If conversation mode is useful for having a long conversation with someone, this mode instead is designed for quick conversations, such as asking for information on the street or talking to a shop assistant.</p>
<p dir="auto">This mode only translates conversations between two people, it doesn't work with Bluetooth headsets, and you have to talk in turns. It's not a real simultaneous translation, but it can work with only one phone.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>In this mode, the smartphone microphone will listen in two languages (selectable in the same screen of the walkie talkie mode) simultaneously. <br>
The app will detect in which language the interlocutor is speaking, translate the audio into the other language, convert the text into audio, and then reproduce it from the phone speaker. When the TTS has finished, it will automatically resume listening.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Text translation mode</h3><a id="user-content-text-translation-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Text translation mode" href="#text-translation-mode"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p>This mode is just a classic text translator, but always useful.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">General</h3><a id="user-content-general" aria-label="Permalink: General" href="#general"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">RTranslator uses <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/no-language-left-behind/" rel="nofollow">Meta's NLLB</a> for translation and <a href="https://openai.com/index/whisper/" rel="nofollow">OpenAi's Whisper</a> for speech recognition, both are open-source (<a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries-and-models">almost</a>) and state of the art AIs, have excellent quality and run directly on the phone, ensuring absolute privacy and the possibility of using RTranslator even offline without loss of quality.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, RTranslator works even in the background, with the phone on standby or when using other apps (only when you use Conversation or WalkieTalkie modes). However, some phones limit the power in the background so in that case it is better to avoid it and keep the app open with the screen on.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's new in version 2.0</h3><a id="user-content-whats-new-in-version-20" aria-label="Permalink: What's new in version 2.0" href="#whats-new-in-version-20"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Google API's have been replaced by <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/no-language-left-behind/" rel="nofollow">Meta's NLLB</a> for translation and <a href="https://openai.com/index/whisper/" rel="nofollow">OpenAi's Whisper</a> for speech recognition. These AI models run directly on your phone, so now the app is totally free and with no configuration required!</p>
<p dir="auto">A classic text translation mode has been added.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bluetooth LE device search has been improved.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h3><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I have optimized the AI models a lot to minimize RAM consumption and execution time, despite this however to be able to use the app without the risk of crashing you need a phone with at least <strong>6GB of RAM</strong>, and to have a good enough execution time you need a phone with a fast enough CPU.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>If you have a pretty crappy phone (or if you want maximum speed) you can always use <a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/tree/v1.00">version 1.0 of RTranslator</a> (but since it uses Google APIs it's not free and needs some initial setup).
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Download</h3><a id="user-content-download" aria-label="Permalink: Download" href="#download"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To install the app, download the latest version of the app apk file from <a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/releases/">https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/releases/</a> and install it (ignore the other files, those will be downloaded automatically by the app on the first start).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/releases"><img alt="Get it on GitHub" src="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/raw/v2.00/images/get_it_on_github.png"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p>On the first launch, you will need to download the models for translation and speech recognition (1.2GB) and once done you can start translating.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported languages</h3><a id="user-content-supported-languages" aria-label="Permalink: Supported languages" href="#supported-languages"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The languages supported are as follows:</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Croatian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Swedish, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Privacy</h3><a id="user-content-privacy" aria-label="Permalink: Privacy" href="#privacy"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Privacy is a fundamental right. That's why RTranslator does not collect any personal data (I don't even have a server). For more information, read the <a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator/blob/v2.00/privacy/Privacy_Policy_en.md">privacy policy</a> (for now is the same privacy policy of RTranslator 1.0, but I will update it in the future).
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Libraries and models</h3><a id="user-content-libraries-and-models" aria-label="Permalink: Libraries and models" href="#libraries-and-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">RTranslator uses the following external libraries:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/niedev/BluetoothCommunicator">BluetoothCommunicator</a> (open-source): Used for Bluetooth LE communication between devices.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/niedev/GalleryImageSelector">GalleryImageSelector</a> (open-source): Used for selecting and cropping the profile image from the gallery.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime">OnnxRuntime</a> (open-source): Used as an accelerator engine for the AI models.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/google/sentencepiece">SentencePiece</a> (open-source): Used for tokenization of the input text for NLLB.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/identification" rel="nofollow">Ml Kit</a> (closed-source): Used for the identification of the language in the WalkieTalkie mode.
</p><p>
And the following AI models:</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb">NLLB</a> (open-source, but only for non-commercial use): The model used is NLLB-Distilled-600M with KV cache.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper</a> (open-source): The model used is Whisper-Small-244M with KV cache.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>I converted both models to onnx format and quantized them in int8 (excluding some weights to ensure almost zero quality loss), also I separated some parts of the models to reduce RAM consumption (without this separation some weights were duplicated at runtime consuming more RAM than expected).
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Donations</h3><a id="user-content-donations" aria-label="Permalink: Donations" href="#donations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an open-source and completely ad-free app, I don't make any money from it.</p>

<p><em>Nature</em> has retracted a 2002 paper from the lab of Catherine Verfaillie purporting to show a type of adult stem cell could, under certain circumstances, “contribute to most, if not all, somatic cell types.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature00870">Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow</a>,” has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1024602878849692040">controversial since its publication</a>. Still, it has been cited nearly 4,500 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – making it by far <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/">the most-cited retracted paper ever</a>.</p>



<p>In 2007, <em>New Scientist</em> reported on questions about <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325915-200-flawed-stem-cell-data-withdrawn/">data in the <em>Nature</em> paper</a> and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325964-600-fresh-questions-on-stem-cell-findings/">another</a> of Verfaille’s <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/98/9/2615/53471/Purification-and-ex-vivo-expansion-of-postnatal">articles in <em>Blood</em></a>. <em>Nature </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05812">published a correction</a> that year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The errors the authors corrected “do not alter the conclusions of the Article,” they wrote in the notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in Minneapolis, where Verfaillie worked when the <em>Nature</em> paper was published, in 2008 found the <em>Blood</em> paper <a href="https://archive.ph/20120712090732/http://jobs.chronicle.com/article/U-of-Minnesota-Panel-Says/41756/">contained falsified images</a>, but Verfaillie was not responsible for the manipulations. <em>Blood</em> <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/113/10/2370/24360/Reyes-M-Lund-T-Lenvik-T-Aguiar-D-Koodie-L">retracted the article</a> in 2009 at the request of the authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verfaillie moved to KU Leuven, where she is now an <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00048658">emeritus professor</a>. She has not responded to our request for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KU Leuven conducted an investigation of Verfaillie’s work in 2019-2020, after Elisabeth Bik posted questions about the data in her papers, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DF95522E3585E37663CAD1972E70BD#">the one from 2002 in <em>Nature</em></a>, on PubPeer. The <a href="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2020/ku-leuven-completes-research-on-possible-breach-of-research-integrity">university found</a> “no breach of research integrity in the publications investigated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik tweeted about the retraction:&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The notice mentions two image duplications Bik wrote about on PubPeer. Because the authors could not retrieve the original images, it states:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>the Editors no longer have confidence that the conclusion that multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) engraft in the bone marrow is supported.</p>



<p>Given the concerns above the Editors no longer have confidence in the reliability of the data reported in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the notice, most of the authors, including Verfaillie, agreed with the retraction. She now has four retractions, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dVerfaillie%252c%2bCatherine%2bM">our count</a>.</p>

<p>Daily consumption from Thursday through Sunday is seen falling by an average 6 gigawatts, a Bloomberg model shows.

<p>While more clean power is needed across Europe to reach climate goals, soaring renewables output and a lack of battery storage mean reactors sometimes have to be turned off during periods of low demand. It’s becoming increasingly common around weekends in France — which gets about two-thirds of its electricity from its atomic fleet — and also occurs in the Nordic region and Spain.</p>



<p>EDF halted its Golfech 2, Cruas 2 and Tricastin 1 nuclear plants, and plans to halt three others during the weekend. Some renewables producers will also have to curb generation to avoid paying a fee amid negative prices.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Conversational large language models are fine-tuned for both instruction-following and safety, resulting in models that obey benign requests but refuse harmful ones. While this refusal behavior is widespread across chat models, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, across 13 popular open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, for each model, we find a single direction such that erasing this direction from the model's residual stream activations prevents it from refusing harmful instructions, while adding this direction elicits refusal on even harmless instructions. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel white-box jailbreak method that surgically disables refusal with minimal effect on other capabilities. Finally, we mechanistically analyze how adversarial suffixes suppress propagation of the refusal-mediating direction. Our findings underscore the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. More broadly, our work showcases how an understanding of model internals can be leveraged to develop practical methods for controlling model behavior.

          Novel view reconstructions for <strong>(right) our method</strong>
          and <strong>(left) conventional</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting with
          random initializations. Our method, even with random initialization,
          faithfully reconstructs the scene (e.g.. buildings at the back and
          the ground texture) providing much higher quality renderings.
        </p>
      </div>

      

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
          While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural
          rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and
          splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to
          poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In
          this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample
          drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the
          physical representation of the scene---in other words, Markov Chain
          Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D
          Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin
          Dynamics (SGLD) update by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite
          the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as
          simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing
          these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the
          `cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that
          approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient
          use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the
          removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes,
          we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy
          control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to
          initialization.

As innovation in the field continues to move at a rapid pace, we believe that collaboration with the global AI community is more important than ever. Maintaining an open science approach and sharing our work with the community help us stay true to our goal of building AI systems that work well for everyone and bring the world closer together.</p><p>Today, we’re excited to share some of the most recent FAIR research models with the global community. We’re publicly releasing six research artifacts that focus on themes at the core of our work: innovation, creativity, efficiency, and responsibility. These releases include image-to-text and text-to-music generation models, a multi-token prediction model, and a technique for detecting AI-generated speech. By publicly sharing our early research work, we hope to inspire iterations and ultimately help advance AI in a responsible way. We can’t wait to see what the community builds with these latest releases and continue the important conversations we’re having with the open source community.</p><br></div></div><p>Meta Chameleon</p><div><p>As we shared in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09818" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>research paper</u></a> last month, Meta Chameleon is a family of models that can combine text and images as input and output any combination of text and images with a single unified architecture for both encoding and decoding. While most current late-fusion models use diffusion-based learning, Meta Chameleon uses tokenization for text and images. This enables a more unified approach and makes the model easier to design, maintain, and scale. The possibilities are endless—imagine generating creative captions for images or using a mix of text prompts and images to create an entirely new scene.</p><br></div></div><div><div><p>Today, we’re publicly releasing key components of our Chameleon 7B and 34B models under a research-only license. The models we’re releasing today were safety tuned and support mixed-modal inputs and text-only output to be used for research purposes. While we’ve taken steps to develop these models responsibly, we recognize that risks remain. At this time, we are not releasing the Chameleon image generation model. With the existing models we’re sharing today, we hope to encourage the research community to design new detection and mitigation strategies that will help scale generative modeling research in a responsible way.</p></div><a href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/chameleon-downloads/?gk_enable=chameleon_web_flow_is_live" data-ms-clickable="true" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;click_external&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_7_BH"></a></div><div><div><p>Most modern LLMs have a simple training objective: predicting the next word. While this approach is simple and scalable, it’s also inefficient. It requires several orders of magnitude more text than what children need to learn the same degree of language fluency.</p><p>In April, we proposed a new approach to build better and faster LLMs by using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19737" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>multi-token prediction</u></a>. Using this approach, we train language models to predict multiple future words at once—instead of the old one-at-a-time approach. This improves model capabilities and training efficiency while allowing for faster speeds. In the spirit of responsible open science, we’re releasing the pre-trained models for code completion under a non-commercial/research-only license. We hope this enables the research community to investigate our method and the trained models’ behaviors independently.</p><br></div><a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/multi-token-prediction" data-ms-clickable="true" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;click_external&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_8_1k"></a><div><p>Meta Joint Audio and Symbolic Conditioning for Temporally Controlled Text-to-Music Generation</p></div><div><p>Generative AI has enabled people to explore their creativity in new ways, such as by turning a text prompt into a clip of music. While existing text-to-music models like <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiocraft-musicgen-audiogen-encodec-generative-ai-audio/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>MusicGen</u></a> rely mainly on text inputs for music generation, our new model, Meta Joint Audio and Symbolic Conditioning for Temporally Controlled Text-to-Music Generation (JASCO), is capable of accepting various conditioning inputs, such as specific chords or beats, to improve control over generated music outputs. Specifically, we apply information bottleneck layers in conjunction with temporal blurring to extract relevant information with respect to specific controls. This allows the incorporation of both symbolic and audio-based conditions in the same text-to-music generation model.</p><p>Results suggest that JASCO is comparable to the evaluated baselines considering generation quality, while allowing significantly better and more versatile controls over the generated music. Today, we’re releasing the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10970" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>research paper</u></a> together with a sample page. Later this month, we’ll release inference code as part of the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>AudioCraft</u></a> repository under an MIT license and the pre-trained model under CC-BY-NC. We look forward to releasing the code and models in the future.</p><br></div><p>AudioSeal</p><div><p>Generative AI tools are inspiring people to share their creations with their friends, family, and followers on social media. As with all AI innovations, it’s important that we do our part to help ensure responsible use of these tools. Today, we’re releasing AudioSeal, which we believe is the first audio watermarking technique designed specifically for the localized detection of AI-generated speech, making it possible to pinpoint AI-generated segments within a longer audio snippet. AudioSeal revamps classical audio watermarking by focusing on the detection of AI-generated content rather than steganography. Unlike traditional methods that rely on complex decoding algorithms, AudioSeal’s localized detection approach allows for faster and more efficient detection. This design enhances the detection speed by up to 485 times compared to previous methods, making it highly suitable for large-scale and real-time applications. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio watermarking in terms of robustness and imperceptibility.</p><p>AudioSeal is being released under a commercial license. It’s just one of several lines of responsible research we’ve shared to help prevent the misuse of generative AI tools. We include similar watermarks in speech samples generated by <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-communication/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>SeamlessM4T v2</u></a>, our foundational translation model for text and speech, and <a href="https://audiobox.metademolab.com/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Audiobox</u></a>.

We worked with our <a href="https://hannahkirk.github.io/prism-alignment/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>external partners</u></a> to navigate these questions supporting the release of the PRISM dataset, which maps the sociodemographics and stated preferences of 1,500 diverse participants from 75 countries. The dataset maps each person’s preferences and fine-grained feedback to 8,011 live conversations with 21 different LLMs.</p><p>Meta advised on the compilation of the PRISM dataset by our external partners, by focusing conversations that center subjective and multicultural perspectives on topics where there is likely to be interpersonal and cross-cultural disagreement. Our paper demonstrates the usefulness of PRISM via three case studies of dialogue diversity, preference diversity, and welfare outcomes, showing that it matters which humans set alignment norms. While we hope this will serve as a community resource, we also want it to inspire broader participation in AI development and foster a more inclusive approach to technology design.</p></div><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HannahRoseKirk/prism-alignment" data-ms-clickable="true" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;click_external&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_b_pj"><div><p>Get the dataset from our external partners</p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="36" height="36" viewBox="0 0 36 36" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M21.9502 15.4645L13.7579 23.6569C13.3674 24.0475 12.7342 24.0475 12.3437 23.6569C11.9532 23.2664 11.9532 22.6333 12.3437 22.2427L20.536 14.0503H15.8792C15.3269 14.0503 14.8792 13.6026 14.8792 13.0503C14.8792 12.498 15.3269 12.0503 15.8792 12.0503H22.9502C23.5025 12.0503 23.9502 12.498 23.9502 13.0503V20.1214C23.9502 20.6737 23.5025 21.1214 22.9502 21.1214C22.398 21.1214 21.9502 20.6737 21.9502 20.1214V15.4645Z" fill="CurrentColor"></path></svg></div></a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16019" data-ms-clickable="true" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;click_external&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_c_HN"><div><p>Read the technical report</p><svg viewBox="0 0 36 36" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14.746 10H26V21.254L24.0301 21.2735L24.0297 13.377L11.4067 26L10 24.5933L22.6039 11.9894L14.746 11.9894V10Z" fill="CurrentColor"></path></svg></div></a></div><div><div><p>Measuring and improving geographical disparities in text-to-image generation systems</p></div><div><p>It’s important that text-to-image models work well for everyone and reflect the geographical and cultural diversity of the world. Improving these models requires new tools that enable researchers to gain a better understanding of where existing models may fall short. In order to address this goal, we’re detailing our recent research efforts and progress:</p><br><ul><li>We developed <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06198" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>automatic indicators</u></a> called “DIG In” to evaluate potential geographical disparities in text-to-image models. In addition, to understand how people in different regions vary in their perceptions of geographic representation, we conducted a large-scale annotation study. We collected more than 65,000 annotations and more than 20 survey responses per example covering appeal, similarity, consistency, and shared <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04457" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>recommendations</u></a> for improved automatic and human evaluations of text-to-image models.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Through this work, we learned that people utilize specific components within an image when perceiving geographic representation, rather than viewing the entire image holistically. As part of our collaborative approach at Meta FAIR, we mentored a team of graduate students at UMass Amherst on a <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/decomposed-evaluations-of-geographic-disparities-in-text-to-image-models/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>follow-up evaluation</u></a> that decomposes the previously introduced automatic indicators into foregrounded concepts and background representations.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Informed by the DIG In measurement work, we also explored methods of improving the diversity of outputs from text-to-image models. In this direction, we introduced the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04551" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>contextualized Vendi Score guidance</u></a>, which extends our previous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00158" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>feedback guidance work</u></a> and uses an inference-time intervention that guides state-of-the-art text-to-image latent diffusion models to increase the representation diversity of the generated samples while maintaining or improving the image quality and prompt-generation consistency.</li></ul></div><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/DIG-In" data-ms-clickable="true" data-ms="{&quot;creative&quot;:&quot;click_external&quot;}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-lnfb-mode="ie" id="u_0_d_ij"></a></div></div>]]></description>
