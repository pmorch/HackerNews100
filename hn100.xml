<p>Owners of Spotify's soon-to-be-bricked Car Thing device are begging the company to open-source the gadgets to save some the landfill. Spotify hasn't responded to pleas to salvage the hardware, which was originally intended to connect to car dashboards and auxiliary outlets to enable drivers to listen to and navigate Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it's bricking all purchased Car Things on December 9 and not offering refunds or trade-in options. On a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">support page</a>, Spotify says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We're discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings. We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify has no further guidance for device owners beyond asking them to reset the device to factory settings and “safely” get rid of the bricked gadget by “following local electronic waste guidelines.”</p>
<p>The company also said that it doesn’t plan to release a follow-up to the Car Thing.</p>
<h2>Early demise</h2>
<p>Car Thing came out to limited subscribers in October 2021 before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/02/spotify-car-thing-is-a-90-thing-that-plays-spotify-in-your-car/">releasing to the general public</a> in February 2022.</p>
<p>In its Q2 2022 earnings report released in July, Spotify revealed that it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/spotify-is-no-longer-making-its-car-thing-music-player/">stopped making Car Things. </a>In a chat with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/spotify-exits-short-lived-car-thing-hardware-play-as-reports-q2-maus-of-433m-offsetting-russia-exit-and-service-outage/">TechCrunch</a>, it cited "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep also told the publication that the devices would continue to “perform as intended,” but that was apparently a temporary situation.</p>
<p>Halted production was a warning sign that Car Thing was in peril. However, at that time, Spotify also cut the device’s price from $90 to $50, which could have encouraged people to buy a device that would be useless a few years later.</p>
<p>Car Thing's usefulness was always dubious, though. The device has a 4-inch touchscreen and knob for easy navigation, as well as support for Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and voice control. But it also required users to subscribe to Spotify Premium, which starts at $11 per month. Worse, Car Thing requires a phone using data or Wi-Fi connected via Bluetooth in order to work, making the Thing seem redundant.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In its Q1 2022 report, Spotify said that quitting Car Thing hurt gross margins and that it took a 31 million euro (about $31.4 million at the time) hit on the venture.</p>
<h2>Open source pleas</h2>
<p>Spotify's announcement has sent some Car Thing owners to online forums to share their disappointment with Spotify and beg the company to open-source the device instead of dooming it for recycling centers at best. As of this writing, there are over 50 posts on the <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=car%20thing">Spotify Community</a> forums showing concern about the discontinuation, with many demanding a refund and/or calling for open-sourcing. There are similar discussions happening elsewhere online, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/">like on Reddit</a>, where users have used phrases like "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1cyx5fs/comment/l5ckxkv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">entirely unnacceptable</a>" to describe the news.</p>
<p>A Spotify Community member going by AaronMickDee, for example, <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/With-Car-Thing-being-sunsetted-would-you-open-source-the-device/idi-p/6088742">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'd rather not just dispose of the device. I think there is a community that would love the idea of having a device we can customize and use for other uses other than a song playback device.</p>
<p>Would Spotify be willing to maybe unlock the system and allow users to write/flash 3rd party firmware to the device?</p></blockquote>
<p>A Spotify spokesperson declined to answer Ars' questions about why Car Thing isn't being open-sourced and concerns around e-waste and wasted money.</p>
<p>Instead, a company rep told Ars, in part: “The goal of our Car Thing exploration in the US was to learn more about how people listen in the car. <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-07-27/spotify-reports-second-quarter-2022-earnings/">In July 2022,</a> we announced we’d stop further production and now it’s time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." I followed up with Spotify's rep to ask again about making the device open source but didn't hear back.</p>
<p>At this point, encouraging customers to waste nearly $100 on a soon-obsolete device hasn't resulted in any groundbreaking innovations or lessons around "how people listen in the car." In their initial response, Spotify's rep pointed me to a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/?s=how+to+listen+to+spotify+in+the+car">Spotify site</a> that searches Spotify's newsroom for "how to listen to Spotify in the car." One of the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-08-26/how-to-listen-to-spotify-in-the-car/">top posts </a>is from 2019 and states that “if your car has an AUX or USB socket, using a cable is probably one of the fastest ways to connect by using your phone."</p>
<p>As for Spotify, using customer dollars for company-serving learning experiences isn't the best business plan. And for regular users, it's best to avoid investing in an unproven hardware venture from a software company.</p>
<p>As Redditor Wemie1420 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1cywpze/comment/l5ccejb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doesn’t feel great that there is literally no alternative other than trashing it. Feels like we’re being punished for supporting them. Dissuades me from buying anything Spotify puts out in the future. I feel like there would be some way to approach this without being like, 'yeah we’re done. Just throw it out it’s a waste of money now.'</p></blockquote>

    <span>2D Rigid Body Collision Resolution</span><br>
    <span>Part 1: Defining the problem</span><!--]--></h2><p><!--[-->From Mario bouncing off a Goomba to two cars bumping into each other in a racing
game, dealing with collisions is such an integral part of most video games that
we often take it for granted.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this series of blog posts, I want to show you what actually goes on behind the
scenes in a physics simulation like the one above.
While we're going to look at this through the lens video games, this post is
really about the actual math and physics of collisions.
Video games are just a nice way to contextualize these concepts and help make
things a little less abstract.<!--]--></p><div><p>A word about math</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->While these articles will involve a fair bit of math, please don't be discouraged
by that if you don't consider yourself to be a "math person".
I think this kind of thinking is harmful and actively prevents you from engaging
with topics that you might actually enjoy!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Many times, it's the math <em><!--[-->notation<!--]--></em> that makes things look more complicated
than they actually are because it's so information-dense and unfamiliar.
Most of the math in these articles will be fairly straight-forward arithmetic
but dressed up to look fancy!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This is something that's really dear to my heart.
I think too many people have this instinctive reaction of
<em><!--[-->"I'm not smart enough to understand this"<!--]--></em> whenever they see any kind of math
notation.
While I can definitely empathize with this, I encourage you to fight this
reaction because at some point it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><h2 id="before-we-start"><a href="#before-we-start"><!--[-->Before we start<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Let's set our expectations and define a few terms.<!--]--></p><h3 id="rigid-bodies"><a href="#rigid-bodies"><!--[-->Rigid bodies<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->The specific kind of physics simulation we are going to cover is called
<strong><!--[-->rigid body physics<!--]--></strong>.
A <strong><!--[-->rigid body<!--]--></strong> is a body that does not deform when subjected to forces.
This is an idealized model because true rigid bodies do not exist in the real
world; everything deforms on the molecular level even if this deformation
is not visible to the naked eye.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->For most physics simulations, trying to simulate this level of detail is not
only extremely difficult (if not flat out impossible) and computationally
expensive, it's also unnecessary.
As long as our bodies behave realistically, we're allowed to simplify as much
as we want.
Rigid bodies are one such simplification.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This might sound a little abstract at the moment but will hopefully start to
make sense as we work through our examples.<!--]--></p><h3 id="collision-detection-vs-collision-resolution"><a href="#collision-detection-vs-collision-resolution"><!--[-->Collision detection vs. collision resolution<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->In a video game engine, dealing with collisions can be broken down into two
distinct phases: <strong><!--[-->collision detection<!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[-->collision resolution<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Collision detection is about determining which bodies in our scene are
colliding.
This usually involves a bunch of geometry to check if two shapes are
intersecting or overlapping.
Depending on how many objects there are in our scene, this can be quite
computationally expensive and is usually heavily optimized.
The result of this step is then used in the collision resolution step.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Collision resolution is the process of figuring out what needs to happen to
two colliding bodies based on things like their current movement directions,
speeds, materials, and many other things.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this series of blog posts, we're only looking at the <strong><!--[-->collision resolution<!--]--></strong>
phase as this where all the interesting physics happens.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Ok, enough preamble. Let's get started!<!--]--></p><h2 id="what-are-we-trying-to-do"><a href="#what-are-we-trying-to-do"><!--[-->What are we trying to do?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Let's start out by trying to define the problem we're trying to solve.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Most games run in a big loop. In order to make things move on the screen, the
game engine needs to continually calculate the positions of the various objects
in the scene.
So on each iteration of the game loop, the position of each of object
gets updated a tiny amount based on its current <strong><!--[-->velocity<!--]--></strong>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction.
We can represent an object's current velocity with an arrow where the length of
the arrow represents the object's current speed and the direction the arrow
is pointing its travel direction.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the demonstration below, you can change the box's
<strong><!--[--><span>velocity</span><!--]--></strong> by dragging the <strong><!--[--><span>arrow</span><!--]--></strong> around.

In physics, this change in position is called <strong><!--[-->displacement<!--]--></strong> and is usually

continued with the next iteration of our game loop.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In this case, the physics engine would update each objects' positions as usual
based on its current <strong><!--[--><span>velocity</span><!--]--></strong>.
This would cause the objects to penetrate each other and eventually pass through

What are these laws?
Well, that's what the majority of this series of articles is going to be about!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To start, let's try defining what a collision is a little more rigorously.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Take a look at the scene below.
This scene shows two bodies on a specific frame of our game.
We can see that the bodies are touching, but are they <em><!--[-->colliding<!--]--></em>?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the last section we learned that two bodies are said to be colliding if
continuing to move them along their current velocities would cause them to
penetrate each other.
So, with the information we've been given, can we actually determine if the
scene above depicts a collision or not?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can't!
All we know is that the bodies are touching.
We haven't been given any information about their velocities.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To see why this matters, take a look at the demonstration below.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->You can change the velocities of the bodies by dragging the
<strong><!--[--><span>arrows</span><!--]--></strong> around.
The indicator tells you if the current configuration would lead to a

You can verify the result by playing the simulation.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->We can see that depending on the velocities of the bodies, the same scene can
either represent a collision or not.<!--]--></p><div><p>That doesn't look right</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->You might have noticed that the way the two boxes bounce off each other looks
a little strange.
This is because, in order to keep things simple for now, we're not yet
making the boxes spin when they hit each other.
Don't worry we'll add that in a later post, but let's try and keep the
complexity to a minimum for now.<!--]--></p><!--]--></div><h3 id="towards-a-definition"><a href="#towards-a-definition"><!--[-->Towards a definition<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->In order for two bodies to be colliding, two conditions have to be met:<!--]--></p><ol><!--[--><li><!--[-->The bodies' geometries have to be touching or overlapping<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->The bodies are still moving <em><!--[-->towards the collision<!--]--></em><!--]--></li><!--]--></ol><p><!--[-->Let's assume that point 1 is true for now and focus on point 2, instead.
What does it mean for two bodies to be moving "towards the collision"?
This seems like a pretty circular definition.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Instead of asking what it means to move towards the collision, let's ask what it
means to move <em><!--[-->away<!--]--></em> from the collision.
In fact, let's ignore collisions entirely for a moment.
What does it mean to move away from a <em><!--[-->surface<!--]--></em>?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->The image below shows a box sitting on the floor.
What direction would you have to move the box in order to move it away from the
floor?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->At first glance, this seems like a silly question.
Obviously, we'd have to move the box <em><!--[-->up<!--]--></em>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->However, there are an infinite number of directions that we could move the box!
As long as we are moving it <em><!--[-->generally<!--]--></em> upwards, we are increasing the distance
between the box and the floor.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Notice that while the box was moved the exact same distance in each
direction—that is, the length of the <strong><!--[--><span>arrows</span><!--]--></strong> is the
same—some of the boxes are clearly further away from the floor than others.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->So, are some of these directions more "up" than others?
Is there a direction that is <em><!--[-->most<!--]--></em> "up"?<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To explore this idea, let's play a little game.<!--]--></p><h3 id="surface-normals"><a href="#surface-normals"><!--[-->Surface normals<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->You are given a box sitting on the floor.
Your goal is to move the box so that its distance to the floor is as close as
possible to the total distance the box was moved.
It doesn't matter how far you move the box, just that these two distances are
as close to each other as possible.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To make things a little more challenging, the angle of inclination of the floor
is going to change every time you reset the game.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->I know, I know, Game of the Year material right here.
But hopefully you were able to figure out that the direction that maximizes the
distance between the box and the floor is the direction that is <em><!--[-->perpendicular<!--]--></em>
to the floor, which isn't necessarily straight up!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->This direction is called the <strong><!--[-->normal direction<!--]--></strong>, often referred to as simply
the <strong><!--[-->normal<!--]--></strong> of the surface.
The normal direction of a surface is always perpendicular to the surface.
It is the direction that points <em><!--[-->directly away<!--]--></em> from the surface.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Normal directions are represented with a <strong><!--[-->normalized vector<!--]--></strong>; that is, a
vector with length <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

To make it clear that a vector is normalized, we often add a little hat on top
of the variable like this <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>n</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hat{n}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If our surface is perfectly straight, the normal direction is the same
everywhere on the surface.
However, if the surface is curved, the normal direction will be different for
each point on the surface.
The easiest way to demonstrate this is with a circle.
If we stick with the idea that the normal direction points directly away from
a surface, then the normal direction for any point on the circle's circumference
is the direction from the center of the circle to that point.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->More generally, the <strong><!--[--><span>normal</span><!--]--></strong> direction for a point on a
surface is perpendicular to the <strong><!--[--><span>tangent</span><!--]--></strong> of the surface
at that point.<!--]--></p><!--[--><!--]--><p><!--[-->We saw earlier that it isn't necessary to move the box <em><!--[-->directly<!--]--></em> in the normal
direction in order to move it away from the floor.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What all these directions have in common, is that they all generally point in
the same direction as the surface normal.
We say that these directions have <em><!--[-->some component in the normal direction<!--]--></em>.
Let's take a closer look at what this means, exactly.<!--]--></p><h3 id="the-dot-product"><a href="#the-dot-product"><!--[-->The dot product<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->To calculate how much of one vector is pointing in the same direction as another
vector, we can use the <strong><!--[-->dot product<!--]--></strong> of the two vectors.
In our example, the two vectors are the direction we move the box and the
surface normal.
The dot product between two vectors <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>a</mi><mo>⃗</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vec{a}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> and

what this scalar <em><!--[-->represents<!--]--></em>.
Luckily, there is also a geometric interpretation of the dot product that can be
visualized nicely.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Say we have two vectors <strong><!--[--><span>a</span><!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[--><span>b</span><!--]--></strong> that

two vectors.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->To be precise, it's the <em><!--[-->absolute value<!--]--></em> of the scalar projection that gives us
the length of the shadow, since we will see in a moment that the scalar

Why are we suddenly talking about the <em><!--[-->unit vector in the direction of

What's our surface and its corresponding normal?
What we're looking for is called the <em><!--[-->collision normal<!--]--></em>.
Unfortunately, the way you calculate the collision normal depends on the shapes
(or geometries) of the colliding bodies, so I can't just show you a single
formula.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->What we're dealing with is called a <em><!--[-->vertex-edge collision<!--]--></em>.
In this type of collision, a point (or vertex) on one body collides with a
side (or edge) of another body.
We'll talk more about collision normals when we take a look at the forces that
act during the collision.
For now, you'll have to take my word that in a vertex-edge collision, the
collision normal is perpendicular to the edge.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In our example, the <strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> looks like this:<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If we label our bodies <strong><!--[-->a<!--]--></strong> and <strong><!--[-->b<!--]--></strong>, by convention, the collision normal

see later on that it plays an important part in calculating the forces that act
during the collision.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Using our understanding of the dot product, we can say that<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->if the relative normal velocity is <strong><!--[-->positive<!--]--></strong>, the bodies are already

As before, you can change the <strong><!--[--><span>velocities</span><!--]--></strong> of the boxes by
dragging the arrowheads.
The top right corner shows the <strong><!--[--><span>collision normal</span><!--]--></strong> and
<strong><!--[--><span>relative velocity</span><!--]--></strong> of the bodies.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->You can see that as soon as the angle between the

no longer colliding.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->So, finally, we can formally define what a collision is:<!--]--></p><div><p>Definition</p><!--[--><p><!--[-->A collision occurs when a point on one body touches a point on another body

We now have a formal definition of what a collision is, as well as the set of

Not bad at all!<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In the next post, we'll dive into the actual physics behind collisions.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.</p>
<p dir="auto">Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it <a href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Preview</h2><a id="user-content-preview" aria-label="Permalink: Preview" href="#preview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/blob/master/.assets/perplexica-preview.gif"><img src="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/raw/master/.assets/perplexica-preview.gif" alt="video-preview" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Local LLMs</strong>: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.</li>
<li><strong>Two Main Modes:</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Copilot Mode:</strong> (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.</li>
<li><strong>Normal Mode:</strong> Processes your query and performs a web search.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Focus Modes:</strong> Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>All Mode:</strong> Searches the entire web to find the best results.</li>
<li><strong>Writing Assistant Mode:</strong> Helpful for writing tasks that does not require searching the web.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Search Mode:</strong> Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Search Mode:</strong> Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.</li>
<li><strong>Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:</strong> Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit Search Mode:</strong> Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Current Information:</strong> Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in <a href="#upcoming-features">upcoming features</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)</h3><a id="user-content-getting-started-with-docker-recommended" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)" href="#getting-started-with-docker-recommended"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Clone the Perplexica repository:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git"><pre>git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Rename the <code>sample.config.toml</code> file to <code>config.toml</code>. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>OPENAI</code>: Your OpenAI API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>OLLAMA</code>: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as <code>http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER</code>. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code>. For other ports, adjust accordingly. <strong>You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>GROQ</code>: Your Groq API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>SIMILARITY_MEASURE</code>: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ensure you are in the directory containing the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file and execute:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000</a> in your web browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Non-Docker Installation</h3><a id="user-content-non-docker-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Non-Docker Installation" href="#non-docker-installation"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Clone the repository and rename the <code>sample.config.toml</code> file to <code>config.toml</code> in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.</li>
<li>Rename the <code>.env.example</code> file to <code>.env</code> in the <code>ui</code> folder and fill in all necessary fields.</li>
<li>After populating the configuration and environment files, run <code>npm i</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
<li>Install the dependencies and then execute <code>npm run build</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
<li>Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running <code>npm run start</code> in both the <code>ui</code> folder and the root directory.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation">installation documentation</a> for more information like exposing it your network, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ollama connection errors</h3><a id="user-content-ollama-connection-errors" aria-label="Permalink: Ollama connection errors" href="#ollama-connection-errors"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're facing an Ollama connection error, it is often related to the backend not being able to connect to Ollama's API. How can you fix it? You can fix it by updating your Ollama API URL in the settings menu to the following:</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows: <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code><br>
On Mac: <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code><br>
On Linux: <code>http://private_ip_of_computer_hosting_ollama:11434</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You need to edit the ports accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using as a Search Engine</h2><a id="user-content-using-as-a-search-engine" aria-label="Permalink: Using as a Search Engine" href="#using-as-a-search-engine"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open your browser's settings.</li>
<li>Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.</li>
<li>Add a new site search with the following URL: <code>http://localhost:3000/?q=%s</code>. Replace <code>localhost</code> with your IP address or domain name, and <code>3000</code> with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.</li>
<li>Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.</li>
</ol>

On Thursday, </span><em>Rolling Stone</em><span> published an equally brilliant story about how the video game “Cyberpunk 2077” helped him work through his battle with cancer. If you have the time, please check it out.</span></p><blockquote><p>In 2022, like many gamers, Gene Park booted up Cyberpunk 2077, the latest open-world RPG. The futuristic video game by the makers of The Witcher depicts a world full of neon lights and cybernetic enhancements, and it had recently received a big content update. Controller in hand, Park vividly recalls directing a digital Keanu Reeves to try and stop a murder, all while medical tubes protruded from his body. The tubes plugged into a port on his torso, and they were ready to pump chemicals inside. Unlike the digital augments that buffed his video game character, chemotherapy is corrosive in a way that makes the experience invasive, even as it was helping. Park likens it to having poison being poured into his heart.</p></blockquote><p><span>A new poll conducted by Harris for </span><em>The Guardian</em><span> found that the American public is widely misinformed about the economy. This is a pretty damning indictment of the news media, generally.</span></p><blockquote><p>Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer.</p><p>The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy, including:</p><ul><li><p>55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), has been growing.</p></li><li><p>49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year.</p></li><li><p>49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low.</p></li></ul><p>Many Americans put the blame on Biden for the state of the economy, with 58% of those polled saying the economy is worsening due to mismanagement from the presidential administration.</p></blockquote><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.readtpa.com/p/googles-ai-generated-search-results-9e1?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.readtpa.com/p/googles-ai-generated-search-results-9e1?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.laura-bassett.com/p/why-the-alito-flag-story-matters" rel="">“Why the Alito Flag Story Matters”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/23/24)</span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/new-hampshire-repeals-several-protections" rel="">“New Hampshire Legislature Repeals Several Protections Barring Trans Discrimination”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/23/24)</span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/private-equity-is-ruining-my-weekends" rel="">“Private Equity is Ruining My Weekends”</a><span> (</span></p><span>, </span><span>, 5/22/24) </span></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01468-9?utm_source=bluesky&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_JRNLS_AWA1_GL_PCOM_SMEDA_NATUREPORTFOLIO" rel="">“Harassment of scientists is surging — institutions aren’t sure how to help”</a><span> (</span><em>Nature</em><span>, Bianca Nogrady, 5/21/24)</span></p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

In the “mind” of Claude, we found millions of concepts that activate when the model reads relevant text or sees relevant images, which we call “features”.</p><p>One of those was the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge. We found that there’s a specific combination of neurons in Claude’s neural network that activates when it encounters a mention (or a picture) of this most famous San Francisco landmark.</p><p>Not only can we identify these features, we can tune the strength of their activation up or down, and identify corresponding changes in Claude’s behavior.</p><p>And as we <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that%20clamping%20the%20Golden%20Gate%20Bridge%20feature%2034M/31164353%20to%2010%C3%97%20its%20maximum%20activation%20value%20induces%20thematically%2Drelated%20model%20behavior">explain in our research paper</a>, when we turn up the strength of the “Golden Gate Bridge” feature, Claude’s responses begin to focus on the Golden Gate Bridge. Its replies to most queries start to mention the Golden Gate Bridge, even if it’s not directly relevant.</p><p>If you ask this “Golden Gate Claude” how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll. If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>For a short time, we’re making this model available for everyone to interact with. You can talk to “Golden Gate Claude” on <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> (just click the Golden Gate logo on the right-hand side). Please bear in mind that this is a research demonstration only, and that this particular model might behave in some unexpected—even jarring—ways.</p><p>Our goal is to let people see the impact our interpretability work can have. The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we’re beginning to understand how large language models really work. This isn’t a matter of asking the model verbally to do some play-acting, or of adding a new “system prompt” that attaches extra text to every input, telling Claude to pretend it’s a bridge. Nor is it traditional “fine-tuning,” where we use extra training data to create a new black box that tweaks the behavior of the old black box. This is a precise, surgical change to some of the most basic aspects of the model’s internal activations.</p><p><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html">As we describe in our paper</a>, we can use these same techniques to change the strength of <em>safety-related</em> features—like those related to dangerous computer code, criminal activity, or deception. With further research, we believe this work could help make AI models safer.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>This piece analyzes a covert Manhattan Project spin-off organization referred to here as the Manhattan-Rochester Coalition, and an obscure aerosol study in St. Louis, Missouri, conducted under contract by the U.S. military from 1953-1954, and 1963-1965. The military-sponsored studies targeted a segregated, high-density urban area, where low-income persons of color predominantly resided. Examination of the Manhattan-Rochester Coalition and the St. Louis aerosol studies, reveal their connections to each other, and to a vast military project that emerged from the Manhattan Project, that secretly tested humans, both alive and deceased, in an effort to develop and understand the health and environmental effects of weaponized radiation. Through this case study, the author explores how a large number of participants inside an organization will willingly participate in organizational acts that are harmful to others, and how large numbers of outsiders, who may or may not be victims of organizational activities, are unable to determine illegal or harmful activity by an organization. The author explains how ethical and observational lapses are engineered by the organization through several specific mechanisms, in an effort to disable critical analysis, and prevent both internal and external dissent. Through studying the process of complex organizational deviance, we can develop public policies that protect the public's right to know, and construct checks and methods to minimize the chance of covert projects that are contrary to societal norms.</p>

<p>Gordon Moore’s famous prediction about computing power must count as one of the most astonishingly accurate forecasts in history. But it may also have been badly misunderstood — in a way that now looks like a near-catastrophic missed opportunity. If we had grasped the details behind Moore’s Law in the 1980s, we could be living with an abundance of clean energy by now. We fumbled it. </p>



<p>A refresher on Moore’s Law: in 1965, electronics engineer Gordon Moore published an article noting that the number of components that could efficiently be put on an integrated circuit was roughly doubling every year. “Over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not increase,” he wrote. “There is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. That means, by 1975, the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum cost will be 65,000.” </p>



<p>That component number is now well into the billions. Moore adjusted his prediction in 1975 to doubling every two years, and the revised law has remained broadly true ever since, not only for the density of computer components but for the cost, speed and power consumption of computation itself. The question is, why? </p>



<p>The way Moore formulated the law, it was just something that happened: the sun rises and sets, the leaves that are green turn to brown, and computers get faster and cheaper. </p>



<p>But there’s another way to describe technological progress, and it might be better if we talked less about Moore’s Law, and more about Wright’s Law. Theodore Wright was an aeronautical engineer who, in the 1930s, published a Moore-like observation about aeroplanes: they were getting cheaper in a predictable way. Wright found that the second of any particular model of aeroplane would be 20 per cent cheaper to make than the first, the fourth would be 20 per cent cheaper than the second, and every time cumulative production doubled, the cost of making an additional unit would drop by a further 20 per cent. </p>



<p>A key difference is that Moore’s Law is a function of time, but Wright’s Law is a function of activity: the more you make, the cheaper it gets. What’s more, Wright’s Law applies to a huge range of technologies: what varies is the 20 per cent figure. Some technologies resist cost improvements. Others, such as solar photovoltaic modules, become much cheaper as production ramps up. </p>



<p>In a new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3UAE3Jp">Making Sense of Chaos</a>, the complexity scientist Doyne Farmer points out that both Moore’s Law and Wright’s Law provide a good basis for forecasting the costs of different technologies. Both nicely describe the patterns that we see in the data. But which one is closer to identifying the underlying causes of these patterns? Moore’s Law suggests that products get cheaper over time, and because they are cheaper they then are demanded and produced in larger quantities. Wright’s Law suggests that rather than falling costs spurring production, it’s mass production that causes costs to fall. </p>



<p>And therein lies the missed opportunity. We acted as though Moore’s Law governed the cost of photovoltaics. While there were of course subsidies for solar PV in countries such as Germany, the default view was that it was too expensive to be much use as a large-scale power source, so we should wait and hope that it would eventually become cheap. If instead we had looked through the lens of Wright’s Law, governments should have been falling over themselves to buy or otherwise subsidise expensive solar PV, because the more we bought, the faster the price would fall. </p>



<p>PV is now so cheap that the question is moot. Yet if we had acted more boldly 40 years ago, solar PV might have been cheap enough to put fossil fuels out of business at the turn of the millennium. </p>



<p>That, of course, presupposes that Wright’s Law really does apply. It might not. Perhaps technological progress depends more on a stream of results from university research labs, and cannot be rushed — in which case, patience is the relevant virtue and a huge splurge on new technologies would be a waste of money. </p>



<p>So — Moore’s Law, or Wright’s Law? Farmer and his colleagues Diana Greenwald and François Lafond turned to the second world war for data. After 1939, the US vastly expanded production of military hardware, from radar to blankets. We can be confident that this was because of the wartime needs of the US and its allies, not because President Roosevelt noticed that tank manufacturers were offering some great discounts. Across a large range of products, Farmer, Greenwald and Lafond found that Wright’s Law explained about half of the fall in production costs during the war. </p>



<p>As Farmer writes, “we can say with some confidence that increasing cumulative production can drive prices down, even if this is not the full story”. Buy more, and they get cheaper. </p>



<p>Wright’s Law isn’t magic, and although it seems to apply to many products, it is rare for the price declines on offer to be as spectacular as those for aeroplanes, solar PV and computer chips. Still, where the data suggest that Wright’s Law holds strongly, governments can drive down prices by subsidising production or demand, one way or another. The individual incentive, after all, is to be a late adopter. </p>



<p>Moore himself saw his own prediction as a challenge, and co-founded the chip manufacturer Intel. Ironically, Moore seems to have been more of a follower of Wright’s Law. Moore’s Law suggests that good things come to those who wait. Wright’s Law says that good things come to those who act.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spotify’s brief attempt at being a hardware company wasn’t all that successful: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings">stopped producing its Car Thing</a> dashboard accessory less than a year after it went on sale to the public. And now, two years later, the device is about to be rendered completely inoperable. Customers who bought the Car Thing are receiving emails warning that it will stop working altogether as of December 9th.</p><p>Unfortunately for those owners, Spotify isn’t offering any kind of subscription credit or automatic refund for the device — nor is the company open-sourcing it. Rather, it’s just canning the project and telling people to (responsibly) dispose of Car Thing.</p><p>“We’re discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings,” Spotify wrote in <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">an FAQ on its website</a>. “We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.”</p><p>The company is recommending that customers do a factory reset on the product and find some way of responsibly recycling the hardware.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>“We held a series of workshops with members of the construction industry on how we could reduce emissions from the sector,” said <a href="https://www.uselessgroup.org/">Professor Julian Allwood</a> from Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, who led the research. “Lots of great ideas came out of those discussions, but one thing they couldn’t or wouldn’t consider was a world without cement.”</p>
                <p>Concrete is made from sand, gravel, water, and cement, which serves as a binder. Although it’s a small proportion of concrete, cement is responsible for almost 90% of concrete emissions. Cement is made through a process called clinkering, where limestone and other raw materials are crushed and heated to about 1,450°C in large kilns. This process converts the materials into cement, but releases large amounts of CO₂ as limestone decarbonates into lime.</p>
                <p>Over the past decade, scientists have been investigating substitutes for cement, and have found that roughly half of the cement in concrete can be replaced with alternative materials, such as fly ash, but these alternatives need to be chemically activated by the remaining cement in order to harden.</p>
                <p>“It’s also a question of volume – we don’t physically have enough of these alternatives to keep up with global cement demand, which is roughly four billion tonnes per year,” said Allwood. “We’ve already identified the low hanging fruit that helps us use less cement by careful mixing and blending, but to get all the way to zero emissions, we need to start thinking outside the box.”</p>
                <p>“I had a vague idea from previous work that if it were possible to crush old concrete, taking out the sand and stones, heating the cement would remove the water, and then it would form clinker again,” said first author Dr Cyrille Dunant, also from the Department of Engineering. “A bath of liquid metal would help this chemical reaction along, and an electric arc furnace, used to recycle steel, felt like a strong possibility. We had to try.”</p>
                <p>The clinkering process requires heat and the right combination of oxides, all of which are in used cement, but need to be reactivated. The researchers tested a range of slags, made from demolition waste and added lime, alumina and silica. The slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute’s EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled.</p>
                <p>“We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well,” said Dunant. “And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.”</p>
                <p>The cement made through this recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the researchers say this has little effect on performance.</p>
                <p>The<a href="https://cambridgeelectriccement.com/"> Cambridge Electric Cement</a> process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say they could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents roughly a quarter of current annual cement production.</p>
                <p>“Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we’ve also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use,” said Allwood. “Concrete is cheap, strong and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it. We could dramatically reduce the amount of concrete we use without any reduction in safety, but there needs to be political will to make that happen.</p>
                <p>“As well as being a breakthrough for the construction industry, we hope that Cambridge Electric Cement will also be a flag to help the government recognise that the opportunities for innovation on our journey to zero emissions extend far beyond the energy sector.”</p>
                <p>The researchers have filed a patent on the process to support its commercialisation. The research was supported in part by Innovate UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Julian Allwood is a Fellow of St Catharine’s College, Cambridge.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PHP currently powers <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php">~75% of the websites</a> on the internet. It may not be the “sexy boi” of programming languages… but it has been an important actor since the internet's birth and our pulse to use it for sharing memes and cat images.
Starting today, in open beta, you’ll be able to run PHP fully in Wasmer and <a href="https://wasmer.io/products/edge">Wasmer Edge</a>.</p>
<p><em>But …why is running PHP in WebAssembly important?</em> Thanks to the properties of WebAssembly, we can safely restrict the resources that the program can access, and as such… we can run PHP safely without the overhead of OS or hardware virtualization.</p>
<p>The support for PHP in WebAssembly arrives after countless hours of work from the Wasmer team (Arshia and Amin in particular!) working to make PHP run flawlessly and as fast as possible.
<em>TL;DR: we got up to 3x faster speeds by enabling opcode caching inside WebAssembly, a feat never achieved before!</em></p>
<p>Bringing serverless-like scalability to any PHP app can unlock immense value, allowing you to run your PHP apps in the Edge and pay a fraction of the price that cloud providers charge.</p>
<p>This also means that you can run every PHP application out there with Wasmer without ever worrying that the app will break sandboxing and do harmful things they shouldn’t be able to.</p>
<p>You can now run the most popular PHP frameworks in Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Wasmer Edge support for custom filesystem volumes is on the way. The deployed apps that are using SQLite (such as Wordpress or Symfony), currently only store database changes memory, not yet permanently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To squeeze the max out of WebAssembly and PHP we have been able to enable opcode caching, allowing Wasmer to run WordPress without any modification, at 3x the speed… going from 600ms to a reasonable 200ms to render a basic blogpost page.</p>
<p><img src="https://wasmer.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.wasmer.io%2Fimages%2FScreenshot_2024-05-23_at_3.09.40_PM.original.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" alt="WebAssembly in PHP Wasm vs Native with opcode cache enabled"></p>
<p>Do you want to try it?</p>
<p>If normally you would do:</p>
<pre><code> php -S localhost:8000 .
</code></pre>
<p>You can now simply run it fully sandboxed via Wasmer with:</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run php/php --mapdir:/app:. -- /app -S localhost:8000
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also run wordpress locally easily. Just clone the Wordpress repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasmer-examples/wordpress-wasmer-starter">https://github.com/wasmer-examples/wordpress-wasmer-starter</a> and run <code>wasmer run . --net</code> on the root! Note: you’ll need Wasmer 4.3.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there you go… a fully functional PHP CLI running in your server, and fully sandboxed! You don’t have to worry anymore that the app will have access to your <code>/etc/passwd</code> or your precious bitcoins!</p>
<p>Welcome to the new frontier, where the software that we know and love can be compiled and run in a way that is fully sandboxed.</p>
<h2>Technical feats</h2>
<p>Getting PHP to work flawlessly in Wasm with Wasmer was not an easy feat. We solved many problems along the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>We found an obscure bug in our <code>longjmp</code>/<code>setjmp</code> implementation (required to have try/catch statements within PHP), where the stack was being overwritten and not properly restored</li>
<li>We discovered and fixed a bug slowing down outgoing HTTP calls by a 10x factor</li>
<li>We enabled PHP <code>opcache</code> by default, allowing up to 3x faster PHP times</li>
<li>Many small fixes on the filesystem virtualization layer and networking (oh, IPv6 our dear friend!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have followed our previous blogpost on running WordPress with Wasmer, you may have realized that we have had to do countless code adaptations (a.k.a. <em>hacks</em>) in WordPress to change its behavior and not trigger a blocking edge case. Namely, these are all the <em>hacks</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had to standardize calls to the <code>exit</code> function: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/9116a7ba25bb14cc50f1a18b81490929347c8462">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/9116a7ba25bb14cc50f1a18b81490929347c8462</a></li>
<li>We had to comment out any fetch calls: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/ef1550ba3cce4fb6882a738d8409aacbc09784f0">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/ef1550ba3cce4fb6882a738d8409aacbc09784f0</a></li>
<li>We served the static assets using the PHP interpreter (there’s code I’ve been more proud of than this one! <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/blob/main/app/hacks.php#L44-L150">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/blob/main/app/hacks.php#L44-L150</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As of today, none of those <em>hacks</em> are needed any longer.</p>
<p>The good news is that on the latest release of Wasmer, <strong>WordPress, Laravel, and Symfony run in Wasmer without any code modification</strong> whatsoever.</p>
<p>We are incredibly happy with this because running those frameworks successfully with no modifications required also means that Wasmer will likely be able to run every PHP program out there.</p>
<h2>But… how fast is it?</h2>
<p>Just running PHP at baseline speeds was not enough for our use case, we wanted to run it as fast as humanly possible in WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Thankfully for us, PHP has one module that makes its execution much faster: the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php">Zend Opcache</a>. The Opcode caching module works by optimizing and caching the bytecode that the PHP source is transformed into, thus saving time by not parsing the AST of the files that have already been processed.</p>
<p>Opcode caching can bring a 3x speed up to the number of requests an app can handle, so it seemed obvious to enable it on WebAssembly.</p>
<p>However, opcode caching (and Zend module loading) was disabled by default (as it requires <code>dlopen</code>, <code>dlsym</code>, and more support in Wasm, which is not available).</p>
<p>So we set on a unique quest: enabling opcode caching in PHP.</p>
<p>After some research, we found one novel way of doing it, and we were up for the races: we found a way to statically link it, and had to fix a bunch of things along the way… but we got it running at the end!</p>
<p>Here are the timings of WordPress without Opcache in Wasm: ~620ms</p>
<p>And the timings of WordPress with Opcache enabled in Wasm: ~205ms</p>
<p><strong>That’s a 3x speedup just by enabling Opcache!</strong></p>
<p>While doing the work, we also realized there are even further improvements that we can make to PHP to bring it close to native speeds. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Our work opens up even more avenues for projects that are currently relying on Emscripten to run PHP in the browser, such as the <a href="https://wordpress.org/playground/">WordPress playground</a>, allowing those projects to work with packages that can run both in the browser and in the Edge!</p>
<hr>
<p>But this is not all: we are working on a completely revolutionary approach to cold-starts that will supersede any other provider by a big factor (Cloudflare &amp; Fly.io, we are looking at you!)… exciting times are coming to the Edge market.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! Porter Cloud (<a href="https://porter.run/porter-cloud">https://porter.run/porter-cloud</a>) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, but we make it easy for you to migrate to AWS, Azure, or GCP when you're ready.</p><p>Like Heroku, Porter takes care of a lot of generic DevOps work for you (like setting up CI/CD, containerizing your applications, autoscaling, SSL certificates, setting up a reverse proxy) and lets you deploy your apps with a few clicks — saving you a lot of time while developing. However, as you probably know, there’s a downside: platforms like this become constraining if and when your app takes off and you need to scale. The time you saved while developing can get pretty expensive once you’re paying for a lot of users — and the platforms tend to try to keep you locked in!</p><p>Our idea is to give you the best of both worlds: use Porter Cloud for as long as it saves you time and development cost, but at any time you can press the “eject button” to migrate your app to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account as you please. We make it seamless to break out, so you’re no longer subject to the rigid constraints of a conventional PaaS. You can migrate in a few simple steps outlined here: <a href="https://docs.porter.run/other/eject">https://docs.porter.run/other/eject</a>.</p><p>A bit of background: we first launched on HN almost 3 years ago with our original product (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26993421">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26993421</a>, <a href="https://porter.run/">https://porter.run</a>), which deploys your applications to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account with the simple experience of a PaaS.</p><p>Since then, we’ve helped countless companies migrate from a PaaS to one of the big three cloud providers. Most of them had gotten started on a PaaS in the early days to optimize for speed and ease of use, but ultimately had to go through a painful migration to AWS, Azure, or GCP as they scaled and ran into various constraints on their original PaaS.</p><p>Interestingly, we learned that many companies that start on a PaaS are fully aware that they’ll have to migrate to one of the big three public clouds [1] at some point. Yet they choose to deploy on a PaaS anyway because outgrowing a cloud platform is a “champagne problem” when you’re focused on getting something off the ground. This, however, becomes a very tangible problem when you need to migrate your entire production infrastructure while serving many users at scale. It’s a “nice problem to have”, until it isn’t.</p><p>We’ve built Porter Cloud so that the next generation of startups can get off the ground as quickly as possible, with a peace of mind that you can effortlessly move to one of the tried and true hyperscalers when you are ready to scale.</p><p>We are excited to see what people build on Porter Cloud. If you’ve ever dealt with a migration from a PaaS to one of the big three cloud providers, we’d also love to hear about your experience in the comments. Looking forward to feedback and discussion!</p><p>[1] By “big three clouds” we mean the lower-level primitives of each cloud provider. We don’t mean their higher level offerings like AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, or Azure App Service, since those run into the same PaaS problems described above.</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>
