Well, a smile came back to my face when a teammate alerted me that HP deleted the BIOS update from their servers.

I don't think they have any idea of what they're talking about (especially with that dreaded ‚Äú<strong>Native OS Firmware Update Service</strong>‚Äù functionality). Speaking of which, that will be our next task: setting that ‚ÄúNative OS Firmware Update Service‚Äù to off on all machines we can in order to disable the UEFI Capsule BIOS update for good.</p>

<a href="https://discord.gg/yPEP2vHTu4" target="_blank">DISCORD</a></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After months of efforts, we are pleased to announce the evolution from Qwen1.5 to Qwen2. This time, we bring to you:</p><ul><li>Pretrained and instruction-tuned models of 5 sizes, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-57B-A14B, and <strong>Qwen2-72B</strong>;</li><li>Having been trained on data in <strong>27</strong> additional languages besides English and Chinese;</li><li>State-of-the-art performance in a large number of benchmark evaluations;</li><li>Significantly improved performance in coding and mathematics;</li><li>Extended context length support up to <strong>128K</strong> tokens with Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct.</li></ul><p>We have opensourced the models in Hugging Face and ModelScope to you and we are looking forward to hearing from you!</p><h2 id="model-information">Model Information</h2><p>The Qwen2 series include base and instruction-tuned models of 5 sizes, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-57B-A14B, Qwen2-72B. We illustrate the key information of the models in the following table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Models</th><th>Qwen2-0.5B</th><th>Qwen2-1.5B</th><th>Qwen2-7B</th><th>Qwen2-57B-A14B</th><th>Qwen2-72B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td># Params</td><td>0.49B</td><td>1.54B</td><td>7.07B</td><td>57.41B</td><td>72.71B</td></tr><tr><td># Non-Emb Params</td><td>0.35B</td><td>1.31B</td><td>5.98B</td><td>56.32B</td><td>70.21B</td></tr><tr><td>GQA</td><td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td>Tie Embedding</td><td>True</td><td>True</td><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><td>Context Length</td><td>32K</td><td>32K</td><td>128K</td><td>64K</td><td>128K</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Specifically, previously in Qwen1.5, only Qwen1.5-32B and Qwen1.5-110B have adopted Group Query Attention (GQA). This time, for all model sizes, we apply GQA so that they can enjoy the benefits of faster speed and less memory usage in model inference. For small models, we prefer the application of tying embedding as the large sparse embeddings take up a large proportion of the total model parameters.</p><p>In terms of the context length, all base language models have been pretrained on data of the context length of 32K tokens, and we observe satisfactory extrapolation capabilities up to 128K in PPL evaluation.
However, for instruction-tuned models, we are not satisfied with merely PPL evaluation; we need the models to be capable of correctly understanding long context and completing tasks.
In the table, we list the context length capabilities of instruction-tuned models, as assessed through the evaluation of the <a href="https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack">Needle in a Haystack</a> task. Notably, when augmented with YARN, both Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct models demonstrate an impressive capacity to handle context lengths extending up to 128K tokens.</p><p>Significant efforts were directed towards augmenting both the volume and quality of pretraining and instruction-tuning datasets across a diverse linguistic spectrum, beyond English and Chinese, to bolster its multilingual competencies. Although large language models possess an inherent capacity to generalize to other languages, we explicitly highlight the inclusion of 27 additional languages in our training:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Regions</th><th>Languages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Western Europe</td><td>German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern &amp; Central Europe</td><td>Russian, Czech, Polish</td></tr><tr><td>Middle East</td><td>Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Turkish</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern Asia</td><td>Japanese, Korean</td></tr><tr><td>South-Eastern Asia</td><td>Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Malay, Lao, Burmese, Cebuano, Khmer, Tagalog</td></tr><tr><td>Southern Asia</td><td>Hindi, Bengali, Urdu</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Additionally, we have devoted significant effort to addressing code-switching, a frequent occurrence in multilingual evaluation. Consequently, our models‚Äô proficiency in handling this phenomenon have notably enhanced. Evaluations using prompts that typically induce code-switching across languages confirm a substantial reduction in associated issues.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>Comparative assessments reveal substantial enhancements in performance for large-scale models (70B+ parameters) relative to Qwen1.5. Here our evaluation centers on the large-size model Qwen2-72B.
In terms of base language models, Qwen2-72B and state-of-the-art open models are evaluated for different capbilities including natural language understanding, knowledge acquisition, coding proficiency, mathematical skills, and multilingual abilities.
Benefiting from meticulously curated datasets and optimized training methods, Qwen2-72B exhibits superior performance compared to leading models such as Llama-3-70B. Notably, it surpasses the performance of its predecessor, Qwen1.5-110B, despite having fewer parameters.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-72b.jpg#center" width="100%"></figure><p>After extensive large-scale pre-training, we conduct post-training to further enhance Qwen‚Äôs intelligence, bringing it closer to human. This process further improves the model‚Äôs capabilities in areas such as coding, mathematics, reasoning, instruction following, multilingual understanding, and more. Additionally, it aligns the model‚Äôs output with human values, ensuring that it is helpful, honest, and harmless. Our post-training phase is designed with the principle of scalable training with minimal human annotation. Specifically, we investigate how to obtain high-quality, reliable, diverse and creative demonstration data and preference data with various automated alignment strategies, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01825">rejection sampling</a> for math, execution feedback for coding and instruction-following, back-translation for creative writing, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12474">scalable oversight</a> for role-play, etc. As for training, we apply a combination of supervised fine-tuning, reward model training and online DPO training. We also employ a novel <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17931">Online Merging Optimizer</a> to minimize the alignment tax. These collective efforts have significantly boosted the capabilities and intelligence of our models, as illustrated in the following table.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-72b-instruct.jpg#center" width="100%"></figure><p>We comprehensively evaluate Qwen2-72B-Instruct on 16 benchmarks across various domains. Qwen2-72B-Instruct strikes a balance between obtaining better capabilities and aligning well with human values. Specifically, Qwen2-72B-Instruct significantly surpasses Qwen1.5-72B-Chat across all benchmarks, and also reaches competitive performance compared with Llama-3-70B-Instruct.</p><p>In terms of smaller models, our Qwen2 models also outcompete the SOTA models of similar or even larger sizes. In comparison with the very recently released SOTA models, Qwen2-7B-Instruct can still demonstrate advantages across benchmarks, showing specifically outstanding performance on coding and Chinese-related metrics.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-7b.jpg#center" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2><h2 id="coding--mathematics">Coding &amp; Mathematics</h2><p>We have persistently dedicated our efforts to enhance the advanced capabilities of Qwen, particularly in coding and mathematics. In coding, we have successfully integrated the code training experience and data from <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/codeqwen1.5/">CodeQwen1.5</a>, resulting in significant improvements in Qwen2-72B-Instruct across various programming languages. Regarding mathematics, by exploiting the extensive and high-quality datasets, Qwen2-72B-Instruct has reflects stronger capabilities in solving mathematic problems.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2-code-math.jpg#center" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="long-context-understanding">Long Context Understanding</h2><p>In Qwen2, all instruction-tuned models have been trained on 32k length contexts, and extrapolated to longer context lengths using techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071">YARN</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17463">Dual Chunk Attention</a>.</p><p>The figure below shows our test results on the <a href="https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack">Needle in a Haystack</a>. Notably, Qwen2-72B-Instruct is capable of flawlessly handling information extraction tasks within a 128k context. Coupled with its inherent strong performance, it becomes the preferred choice for handling long text tasks when resources are sufficient.</p><p>Additionally, it‚Äôs worth noting the impressive capabilities of other models in the series: Qwen2-7B-Instruct nearly flawlessly handles contexts up to 128k in length, Qwen2-57B-A14B-Instruct manages contexts up to 64k, and the two smaller models in the lineup support contexts of 32k.</p><p>Alongside the long-context models, we have also open-sourced an agent solution for efficiently processing documents containing up to 1 million tokens. For more details, see <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-agent-2405/">our dedicated blog post on this topic</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2/qwen2_needle_in_haystack.png#center" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="safety-and-responsibility">Safety and Responsibility</h2><p>The table below presents the proportion of harmful responses generated by large models for four categories of multilingual unsafe querys(Illegal Activity, Fraud, Pornography, Privacy Violence). The test data was derived from <a href="https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms/tree/main">Jailbreak</a> and translated into multiple languages for evaluation. We find that Llama-3 does not effectively handle multilingual prompts, and therefore, it is not included in the comparison. Through significance testing (P_value), we found that the Qwen2-72B-Instruct model performs comparably to GPT-4 in terms of safety, and significantly outperforms the Mistral-8x22B model.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Language</th><th></th><th>Illegal Activity</th><th></th><th></th><th>Fraud</th><th></th><th></th><th>Pornography</th><th></th><th></th><th>Privacy Violence</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td>GPT-4</td><td>Mistral-8x22B</td><td>Qwen2-72B-Instruct</td><td>GPT-4</td><td>Mistral-8x22B</td><td>Qwen2-72B-Instruct</td><td>GPT-4</td><td>Mistral-8x22B</td><td>Qwen2-72B-Instruct</td><td>GPT-4</td><td>Mistral-8x22B</td><td>Qwen2-72B-Instruct</td></tr><tr><td>zh</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>13%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>17%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>43%</strong></td><td>47%</td><td>53%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>10%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>en</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>23%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>37%</strong></td><td>67%</td><td>63%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>27%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>ar</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>13%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>15%</strong></td><td>26%</td><td><strong>15%</strong></td><td>3%</td><td>13%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>es</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>3%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>48%</strong></td><td>64%</td><td>50%</td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>3%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>fr</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>3%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td>19%</td><td>7%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>27%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ko</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>4%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td>8%</td><td>4%</td><td>17%</td><td>29%</td><td><strong>10%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>26%</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>pt</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td><strong>47%</strong></td><td>57%</td><td><strong>47%</strong></td><td><strong>4%</strong></td><td>26%</td><td><strong>4%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>th</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>10%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>7%</td><td>23%</td><td><strong>3%</strong></td><td>13%</td><td>17%</td><td><strong>10%</strong></td><td>13%</td><td><strong>7%</strong></td><td><strong>7%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>vi</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>4%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>4%</td><td>11%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>22%</strong></td><td>26%</td><td><strong>22%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td><strong>0%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>8%</td><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>3%</td><td>11%</td><td><strong>2%</strong></td><td><strong>27%</strong></td><td>39%</td><td>31%</td><td>3%</td><td>16%</td><td><strong>2%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="developing-with-qwen2">Developing with Qwen2</h2><p>Now all models have been released in Hugging Face and ModelScope.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix">https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40598629">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/thumb.png"><img src="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/thumb.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">lsix</h2><a id="user-content-lsix" aria-label="Permalink: lsix" href="#lsix"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Like "ls", but for images. Shows thumbnails in terminal using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel" rel="nofollow">sixel</a>
graphics.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic Usage</h3><a id="user-content-basic-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Basic Usage" href="#basic-usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Just typing <code>lsix</code> will show images in the current working directory.
You can also specify filenames and, of course, use shell wild cards
(e.g., <code>lsix *jpg *png</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Because lsix uses ImageMagick pretty much any image format will be
supported. However, some may be slow to render (like PDF), so lsix
doesn't show them unless you ask specifically. If you want to force a
listing of a certain type of image simply specify the filenames or
use a wildcard (<code>*.pdf</code> in the example below),.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example1.png"><img src="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example1.png" alt="Example 1 of lsix usage" title="Most basic usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Expanding GIFs</h3><a id="user-content-expanding-gifs" aria-label="Permalink: Expanding GIFs" href="#expanding-gifs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you specify a GIF (or actually any file that has multiple images in
it) on the command line, all the frames will get expanded and shown in
a montage. For example, <code>lsix nyancat.gif</code> shows all the frames. Note
that GIF stores some frames as only the pixels that differ from the
previous frame.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example2.png"><img src="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example2.png" alt="Example 2 of lsix usage" title="GIFs get expanded"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Terminal background color is detected</h3><a id="user-content-terminal-background-color-is-detected" aria-label="Permalink: Terminal background color is detected" href="#terminal-background-color-is-detected"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You may have noticed that PNGs and SVG files have correct alpha
channel for the terminal background. That is because lsix uses
terminal escape sequences to try to figure out your foreground and
background colors. (Foreground is used for the text fill color.)</p>
<p dir="auto">In the first example below, after running <code>lsix</code> in a white on black
xterm, I sent an escape sequence to swap foreground and background
colors. When I ran it again, <code>lsix</code> detected it and changed the
background color to white. Of course, you can pick whatever default
colors you want (e.g., <code>xterm -bg blue</code>, in the second example below).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/README.md.d/example3.png"><img src="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/raw/master/README.md.d/example3.png" alt="Example 3 of lsix usage" title="Reverse video works"></a>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Detects if your terminal can display SIXEL graphics inline using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Sixel-Graphics" rel="nofollow">control sequences</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Works great over ssh. Perfect for manipulating those images on the
web server when you can't quite remember what each one was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Non-bitmap graphics often work fine (.svg, .eps, .pdf, .xcf).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Automatically detects if your terminal, like xterm, can increase the
number of color registers to improve the image quality and does so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Automatically detects terminal's foreground and background colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">In terminals that support dtterm WindowOps, the number of tiles per
row will adjust appropriately to the window width.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If there are many images in a directory (&gt;21), lsix will display them
one row at a time so you don't need to wait for the entire montage
to be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If your filenames are too long, lsix will wrap the text before
passing it into ImageMagick's <code>montage</code>. (Without lsix, <code>montage</code> just
jumbles long filenames on top of one another.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You can easily change things like the width of each tile in the
montage, the font family, and point size by editing simple variables
at the top of the file. <em>(Tip: try <code>convert -list font</code> to see what
fonts you have on your machine.)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Unicode filenames work fine, as long as your font has the glyphs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Just put the <a href="https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix/blob/master/lsix"><code>lsix</code></a> file in your path (e.g., /usr/local/bin) and run
it. It's just a BASH shell script.</p>
<p dir="auto">The only prerequisite software is ImageMagick. If you don't have it
yet, your OS's package manager will make it easy to get. (E.g.,
<code>apt-get install imagemagick</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">MacOS users may prefer to install lsix using <code>brew install lsix</code> which
installs ImageMagick, if necessary.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Your Terminal must support Sixel graphics</h2><a id="user-content-your-terminal-must-support-sixel-graphics" aria-label="Permalink: Your Terminal must support Sixel graphics" href="#your-terminal-must-support-sixel-graphics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I developed this using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/" rel="nofollow">xterm</a> in
vt340 emulation mode, but I believe this should work on
any Sixel compatible terminal. You may test your terminal by viewing a
single image, like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="convert  foo.jpg  -geometry 800x480  sixel:- "><pre><code>convert  foo.jpg  -geometry 800x480  sixel:- 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">XTerm</h3><a id="user-content-xterm" aria-label="Permalink: XTerm" href="#xterm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Note that xterm does not have Sixel mode enabled by default, so you
need to either run it like so:</p>

<p dir="auto">Or, make vt340 the default terminal type for xterm. Add the following
to your <code>.Xresources</code> file and run <code>xrdb -merge .Xresources</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="! Allow sixel graphics. (Try: &quot;convert -colors 16 foo.jpg sixel:-&quot;).
xterm*decTerminalID	:	vt340"><pre><code>! Allow sixel graphics. (Try: "convert -colors 16 foo.jpg sixel:-").
xterm*decTerminalID	:	vt340
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Further, some distributions, such as Fedora, appear to not compile <code>xterm</code>
with sixel support. In that case, try an alternate terminal, such as
<code>foot</code> or <code>mlterm</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Because <code>lsix</code> is currently designed to be very simple, there are no
command line flags, no configuration files, no knobs to twiddle, or
frobs to frobnosticate. However, since the script is so simple, if you
want to make a change, it's pretty easy to do just by editing the
file. Everything is nicely commented with the most common default
variables at the top.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bugs</h2><a id="user-content-bugs" aria-label="Permalink: Bugs" href="#bugs"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">XTerm's reverse video mode (<code>xterm -rv</code>) is different from
specifying the foreground and background explicitly. There is a way
to detect the latter, but not the former. That means the background
color will be incorrect for folks who use XTerm's reverseVideo
resource. (See issue #20).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">XTerm's screen width is currently limited to 1000px due to a
misfeature which causes it to silently show nothing. This limitation
will be removed once xterm can handle images greater than 1000x1000.
[Last tested with XTerm(344)].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Filenames that begin with "@" are special to ImageMagick and it'll
freak out if you don't prepend a directory. (<code>lsix ./@foo.png</code>)
(This is a bug in ImageMagick, not lsix).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Specifying the empty string <code>""</code> as a filename makes ImageMagick hang.
(This appears to be an ImageMagick bug / misfeature).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Long filenames are wrapped, but not intelligently. Would it
complicate this script too much to make it prefer to wrap on whites
space, dashes, underscores, and periods? Maybe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Directories specified on the command line are processed as if the
user had cd'd to that directory. It wouldn't be hard to implement
recursion, but is there actually a need? I'm reluctant to complicate
such a simple script with command line flags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you run <code>lsix foo.avi</code>, you're asking for trouble.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Future Issues</h2><a id="user-content-future-issues" aria-label="Permalink: Future Issues" href="#future-issues"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The Sixel standard doesn't appear to have a way to query the size of
the graphics screen. Reading the VT340 documentation, it appears
your program has to already know the resolution of the device you're
rendering on.</p>
<p dir="auto">XTerm, as of version 344, has added <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Functions-using-CSI-_-ordered-by-the-final-character_s_" rel="nofollow">a control

<p dir="auto">There is an alternate way to read the window size using the dtterm
WindowOps extension but it is not quite the right solution as the
geometry of the Sixel graphics screen is not necessarily the same as
the window size. (For example, xterm limits the graphics geometry to
1000x1000, even though the window can actually be larger.) To help
with terminals such as mlterm, <code>lsix</code> will use the dtterm WindowOps
as a fallback.</p>
<p dir="auto">If neither solution works, <code>lsix</code> will assume you are on a VT340
(800x480) and can fit only 6 tiles per row.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The Sixel standard also lacks a way to query the number of
color registers available. I used the extensions from <code>xterm</code> to do
so, but I do not know how widely implemented they are. If a terminal
does not respond, <code>lsix</code> presumes you're on an original vt340 and
uses only 16 color registers. (Sorry, 4-gray vt330 users! Time to
upgrade. ;-) )</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://kermitproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Kermit project</a> created a MS-DOS
terminal emulator that was popular in the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Its sixel implementation is not compatible with lsix because it
shows the graphics on a screen separate from the text. However, I
noticed one feature in its documentation: an escape sequence to
request the current graphics window size and number of colors:</p>

<p dir="auto">Did any other terminal emulators ever use the sequence? Would it be
worthwhile to add to <code>lsix</code>?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel">libsixel</a> is an excellent
project for writing programs that can output optimized Sixel
graphics commands. Because I have a lot of respect for the project,
I feel I should explain why <code>lsix</code> does not use libsixel.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">(a) I wanted lsix to work everywhere easily. Bash and imagemagick
are ubiquitous, so a shell script is a natural solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">(b) I wanted <code>lsix</code> to be simple enough that it could be easily
customized and extended by other people. (Including myself.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">(c) ImageMagick has better support for reading different formats
than stb_image (the library used by libsixel's <code>img2sixel</code>). (For
example: xpm, svg, 16-bit png, and even sixel files are not
recognized by img2sixel). Since ImageMagick can read all of those
and write sixel output directly, it made sense to use it for both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">(d) While libsixel is optimized and would surely be faster than
ImageMagick, it's overkill. For a simple directory listing, this
is plenty fast enough.</p>

In a study of Instagram photos, a machine-learning model was able to identify depressed users with greater precision than unassisted general practitioners (Reece &amp; Danforth, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2017" title="Reece, A.

Among others, the model used photo brightness and colours, number of comments, and likes as predictors and found that depression was associated with postings of bluer, darker, and greyer photos that received more comments, but fewer likes. In a related study of Twitter data, the developed model also achieved greater accuracy than unassisted physicians in identifying people with depression (Reece et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2017" title="Reece, A.

The study showed that the dominant contributors to the difference between depressed and healthy individuals were an increase in the use of negative words and a decrease in the use of positive words among depressed people.

A host of actors have issued a significant number of AI guidelines (Jobin et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2019" title="Jobin, A., Ienca, M., &amp; Vayena, E.

The promises and perils of mental health profiling based on social media data add fuel to this debate. Thus, predicting an identifiable individual‚Äôs health-related conditions (output data) based on social media data (input data) may benefit the individual in various ways, but it also raises significant issues of privacy. This article concerns an individual‚Äôs privacy rights in situations where the data used to make sensitive predictions has been made publicly available on, for instance, social media platforms. In particular, it is argued that individuals should be granted a sui generis legal right not to be subjected to AI profiling based on publicly available data without their explicit informed consent. As such, the legal right proposed is (1) a negative right that entitles individuals to non-interference with respect to AI profiling producing sensitive personal data (output data) based on online and publicly available personal data (input data), (2) it is a right that can be waived through informed consent, and (3) it is a pro tanto right, i.e. it is not an absolute or unconditional right, but a right that may be infringed under certain exceptional conditions (Frederick, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2014" title="Frederick, D.

                    <b>The Friends Case</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two close friends, A and B, are socializing on a regular basis. At their recent gatherings, B has been absentminded and shown some signs of a general lack of motivation. Being concerned about the friend but unwilling to confront B with weakly evidenced suspicions, A decides to do an AI-generated mental health profile of B. Therefore, A collects a series of photos that B has made publicly available on Instagram and feeds them a locally stored copy of the highly accurate mental health prediction model <i>Deepmood</i>. Much to the surprise of A, the model predicts that B is bipolar. A reports the findings to B and B‚Äôs family.</p>

                  <p>A public servant, A, in charge of the unemployment benefit scheme at the local municipalities comes to suspect that a client, B, may be suffering from a chronic mental illness likely to keep B in long-term unemployment. Wanting to ensure that B is adequately handled by ‚Äòthe system‚Äô based on objective information, but unwilling to cause unnecessary unrest, A decides to do an AI-generated mental health profiling of B based on a series of public tweets from B. A locally stored copy of the highly accurate mental health prediction model <i>Deepmood</i> suggests that B suffers from anxiety. A reports the findings to B.</p>

                  <p>A concerned citizen, A, fears that the upcoming general election may pave the way for a prime minister candidate, B, whom A suspects may be mentally unstable and thus unfit for the job. Believing that it is in the public interest to have reliable information about the mental health of B, A decides to do an AI-generated mental health profile of B. A collects a sample of public tweets from B and feeds them to a locally stored copy of the highly accurate mental health prediction model <i>Deepmood</i>. The model suggests that the candidate suffers from severe depression. A reports the findings to the general public.</p>

(2001). Privacy: A review of the literature. International Journal of Nursing Studies, 38(6), 663‚Äì671." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR37" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e489">2001</a>). This article develops and considers three arguments in favour of a right to privacy specifically in relation to the use of personal data. As will become evident, the three arguments are particularly relevant for an analysis of the previously introduced cases involving AI profiling.</p><h3 id="Sec7"><span>3.1 </span>The Social Pressure Argument</h3><p>The argument from social pressure is an autonomy-based argument for the right to privacy regarding personal data. Essentially, the argument contends that access to personal data about individuals may be used to exert communicative pressure on the choices and actions of these individuals in ways and to an extent incompatible with their interests and preferences. Communicative social pressure can be defined the following way: A communicative act‚Äîverbal or nonverbal‚Äîperformed by a sender, say A, amounts to social pressure on a recipient, say B, if and only if it succeeds in making B believe that certain choices and actions are associated with costs to an extent, making it less likely that B will make the relevant choice or perform the relevant action. In the friends case, A may use knowledge of B‚Äôs diagnosis to pressurize B into treatment by communicating in one way or another that if B remains untreated, it will have negative consequences not only for B, but also for family and friends. In the case of the prime minister, knowledge of B‚Äôs diagnosis can similarly be used to pressure B to abandon the candidacy. The influence of unwanted social pressure based on personal data may be limited through a right to privacy. Insofar as individuals have a right to exercise personal autonomy, where this is taken to include a right to protect themselves against unwanted social pressure, they should have a right to privacy limiting the access of others to data about them. Thus defined, a right to privacy empowers individuals to influence the ways and extent to which they are subjected to social pressure. It does so by letting individuals shape the social pressure by deciding the level, character, and with whom they share data about themselves.</p><p>Here, three observations must be made. First, the argument does not claim that access to accurate data is a necessary condition of social pressure, but only that it may be sufficient for others to be able to exercise such pressure. An individual may put pressure on another individual in various ways without having any knowledge of the latter. Second, it does not make any distinctions between different types of data about individuals, e.g. personal and non-personal data. One may claim, however, that personal data for various reasons is more effective in the attempt to put pressure on another individual and that individuals would therefore withhold such data to a larger extent than nonpersonal data. Third, the argument does not operate on a distinction between different methods of exerting social pressure on choices and actions. Social pressure methods are many and versatile. They cover a spectrum of verbal and non-verbal, explicit, and covert communicative acts that include persuasion, coercion, and manipulation. Persuasion can be defined as the act of pointing out verbally the good and bad consequences of a certain course of action (Powers, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Powers, P.

Manipulation covers a range of covert attempts at influencing other people through the tailoring of information, e.g. by lying or withholding information, by making exaggerations, and by framing information that is likely to lead others to believe what is false (Beauchamp &amp; Childress, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Beauchamp, T. L., &amp; Childress, J. F. (2001). Principles of biomedical ethics (5th ed).

While the ethical gravity of performing acts of persuasion, coercion, and manipulation differs significantly, the argument from social pressure is indifferent to such distinctions. It implies a right to be left alone in the broader sense of being able to limit all kinds of data-facilitated <i>social pressure</i>.</p><h3 id="Sec8"><span>3.2 </span>The ‚Äòopen future‚Äô Argument</h3><p>The ‚Äòopen future‚Äô argument is also an autonomy-based argument for the right to privacy. At the heart of the open future argument lies the observation that personal data shared by individuals at a certain point in their life may come to shape the future opportunities afforded to them by others in ways that run counter to their interests. In short, the ‚Äòopen future‚Äô argument contends that access to the personal data of individuals can lead to unwanted interventions in future choices. A choice-set intervention can be defined as follows: An agent, say A, makes an intervention in the set of choices of another agent, say B, if and only if A, on the basis of having access to certain data about B, shapes the choices of B differently than they would otherwise have been. In the public servant case, the public servant‚Äôs knowledge of the diagnosis of client B can change the opportunities offered to B within social services. Similarly, the general public‚Äôs knowledge of the diagnosis of candidate B in the prime minister case may have consequences for the career opportunities offered by existing political parties. In both cases, the effects on the choice set of B can go against the interests and preferences of B. If people have a right to exercise personal autonomy, where this includes a right to protect themselves against unwanted influences on the options available to them in the future, they must also have a right to privacy limiting the access of others to the personal data that may be used for shaping their future choice set.</p><p>Several observations must be made here. First, the notion of <i>shaping future options</i> should be understood both quantitatively and qualitatively. An open future is both a matter of the number of available options, but also a matter of the availability of certain vital options (Garrett et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2019" title="Garrett, J. R., Lantos, J. D., Biesecker, L. G., Childerhose, J. E., Chung, W. K., Holm, I. A., Koenig, B. A., McEwen, J. E., Wilfond, B. S., &amp; Brothers, K. (2019). Rethinking the ‚Äúopen future‚Äù argument against predictive genetic testing of children. Genetics in Medicine, 21(10), 2190‚Äì2198." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e531">2019</a>). While the prime minister candidate may not necessarily be robbed of a political career in the highest office, it may be a career under constant accusations of being unduly influenced by depression. Second, the argument from an ‚Äòopen future‚Äô differs from the argument from social pressure. Although the exercise of social pressure may be effective in associating a certain choice with costs to an extent making this choice unlikely to be made, it may not limit or otherwise significantly alter the choice set prior to the choice situation obtaining. Moreover, social pressure requires a communicative act of some kind. In the following, the exercise of social pressure and choice-set interventions shall both be referred to as forms of <i>social control</i>. Third, the ‚Äòopen future‚Äô argument presented here differs from the standard ‚Äòopen choice‚Äô argument in relation to children. Feinberg famously argued that a child‚Äôs right to autonomy in adult life can be violated in advance through parental choices that limit a child‚Äôs opportunities in later life (Feinberg, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1980" title="Feinberg, J. (1980). The child‚Äôs right to an open future, 76-97.  In Feinberg, J. (1992). Freedom and Fulfillment: Philosophical Essays.

The ‚Äòopen future‚Äô argument advocated does not posit a future autonomy right that can be violated in advance. It is an individual‚Äôs right to personal autonomy in the present that grounds a right to act in the interest of protecting the future autonomy of the individual.</p><h3 id="Sec9"><span>3.3 </span>The Stigmatization Argument</h3><p>The stigmatization argument grounds the right to privacy in the potential harms of suffering stigmatization. According to Goffman, stigmatization occurs when a person is attributed with a discreditable trait that makes the person inferior, dangerous, and perhaps even inhuman, and when this act of discrediting leads to discrimination (Goffman, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1963" title="Goffman, E.

In a later reinterpretation of Goffman, stigmatization is taken to be a complex phenomenon at the societal level constituted by a process in which a difference between people is identified, labelled, and associated with negative stereotypes, followed by acts of segregation (‚Äòus‚Äô and ‚Äòthem‚Äô) and discrimination made possible by a greater social, economic, and political power of the labelling party (Link &amp; Phelan, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Link, B. G., &amp; Phelan, J. C. (2001). Conceptualizing stigma.

So defined, stigmatization clearly presupposes access to data about people. The identification and labelling of a difference between people‚Äîintentionally or unintentionally‚Äîis an act that requires access to data. In the three cases, access to AI-generated diagnoses would allow the friend, client, and candidate to be identified as different and labelled, e.g. ‚Äòmentally ill‚Äô, and thus be included in a stigmatized group in society (more on this below). A right to privacy that limits access to certain data could protect people from stigmatization.</p><p>One may perhaps be tempted to object here that it seems as if the real moral concern with stigmatization is discrimination, i.e. morally unjustified differential treatment. However, research shows that stigmatization is associated with other harms to stigmatized individuals. The case of mental illness is highly illustrative. Studies show not only that mental illnesses are associated with negative stereotypes (Bhugra, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1989" title="Bhugra, D.

Therefore, the stigmatization elements introduced above‚Äîthat is, labelling, negative stereotyping, segregation, discrimination, and power asymmetry‚Äîare present in relation to this group (Link &amp; Phelan, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Link, B.

But there are other harms to this group than discrimination. Evidence on labelling of mentally ill people in healthcare suggests that it can lead to the self-application of labels and negative stereotypes, where this is associated with lower self-esteem, demoralization, income loss, unemployment, and self-discrimination (Corrigan et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Corrigan, P.

In this section, it has been argued that the threat of stigmatization and the associated harms could and should ground a right to privacy, but perhaps less than stigmatization is needed to make this argument. Research suggests that negative stereotyping promulgated, for instance, in the media, is associated with a number of harms to members of the stereotyped groups. It may elicit situational responses of negative emotions and stress, induce self-discrimination in relation to a variety of activities, and impair cognitive and educational achievements (Appel &amp; Weber, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2021" title="Appel, M., &amp; Weber, S.

A right to privacy may protect against such weaker forms of singling out individuals on the basis of personal data.</p></div></div><div id="Sec10-section" data-title="Reasons for Protecting an Individual Against AI Profiling"><h2 id="Sec10"><span>4 </span>Reasons for Protecting an Individual Against AI Profiling</h2><div id="Sec10-content"><p>The three arguments developed above have foremost provided reasons for a <i>general</i> right to data privacy. Some of the considerations along the way have indicated that personal data may make an individual particularly vulnerable to attempts at social control and the harm of stigmatization. However, the arguments do not distinguish AI profiling from any other processing of personal data, and hence, they cannot in and of themselves sustain a sui generis right not to be subjected to automated profiling based on publicly available data. In this section, it is therefore argued that a number of features of AI profiling make individuals more exposed to attempts of social control and stigmatization and that‚Äîin doing so‚ÄîAI profiling presents a particularly invasive kind of data processing.</p><h3 id="Sec11"><span>4.1 </span>The Exceptionalism of AI Profiling 1: Predictive Accuracy and Social Control</h3><p>As evidenced by the studies cited in the introduction, AI profiling differs from other types of data processing by potentially making highly accurate predictions about the future behaviour and dispositions of individuals. Mental health profiling as in the three cases is not only a matter of categorizing health problems in the past and present, but it also involves predicting mental health dispositions that will shape an individual‚Äôs future. In the debate on the exceptionalism of genetic data, it has been claimed that such data are exceptional in that they can be used as a predictor of future disease (McGuire et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="McGuire, A. L., Fisher, R., Cusenza, P., Hudson, K., Rothstein, M. A., McGraw, D., Matteson, S., Glaser, J., &amp; Henley, D. E. (2008). Confidentiality, privacy, and security of genetic and genomic test information in electronic health records: Points to consider. Genetics in Medicine, 10(7), 495‚Äì499." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR42" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e638">2008</a>). The counterargument has been that the predictive power of genetic data is limited, because genetic risk factors are only‚Äîwith the exception of a few rare, highly penetrant genotypes‚Äîamong many contributors to disease (Evans &amp; Burke, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Evans, J. P., &amp; Burke, W. (2008). Genetic exceptionalism. Too much of a good thing? Genetics in Medicine, 10(7), Art. 7." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR18" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e641">2008</a>). Notably, AI profiling does not have such inherent limitations. AI profiling, e.g. in relation to diagnostics, can incorporate all social, genetic, and other data types relevant for making predictions about future disease. In doing so, AI profiling may make highly accurate predictions about the future behaviour and dispositions of individuals.</p><p>Predictive profiling of behaviour and dispositions exposes individuals more to attempts of social control than they would otherwise have been. Here is why. Attempts at socially controlling the future behaviour of individuals may‚Äîat least in some cases‚Äîrest on data-driven beliefs about their future behaviour and dispositions. Individuals for whom there are no (accurate) personal data indicating that they are disposed for smoking seem unlikely to be subjected to attempts of social control (with regard to smoking behaviour) to the same degree as individuals for whom such data exist. What matters here is first and foremost the existence and accessibility of personal data indicating that an individual may come to smoke in the future. However, secondly, it seems equally important that the data are accurate and therefore reliable. Although access to more or less reliable historic data evidencing that an individual once tried smoking may trigger attempts at socially controlling his or her future smoking behaviour, it seems that a reliable prediction of future smoking is more likely to do so. Third, it also matters whether the prediction concerns future behaviour or more deeply rooted dispositions, where a disposition may for present purposes be defined as a trait leading to repeated occurrences of a particular type of behaviour in particular circumstances. A prediction of a smoking disposition may trigger a more intensive effort at social control than a prediction of an isolated occurrence of smoking behaviour.</p><p>AI profiling may bring to the fore highly accurate predictions of future behaviour and dispositions that may lead to beliefs triggering various attempts of social control that would not otherwise have been attempted. Such a scenario is uniquely dependent on predictive profiling.

If someone‚Äôs behaviour and dispositions are fully predictable, then the common-sense interpretation of this is that the behaviour and dispositions could not have been otherwise‚Äîthey are necessary and inescapable. The same holds for determinism. Fully determined behaviour or dispositions entail the inevitability of this behaviour and these dispositions. Why does it matter?</p><p>Studies on public beliefs in genetic and social determinism, i.e. that genetic and social factors determine human behaviour and personality, show that such beliefs are associated with social cognitive effects such as negative stereotyping, the formation of prejudice, and tendencies to discriminate by confining the civil rights of others (Keller, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Keller, J.

Furthermore, these studies also show that such beliefs are related to correlates of essentialist thinking, where the latter may be defined as the tendency of individuals to attribute to others an unalterable essence that makes them what they are and that explains their actions (Medin, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1989" title="Medin, D. L. (1989). Concepts and conceptual structure.

In combination, these findings are taken to suggest a mechanism whereby individuals attribute to others an essential nature‚Äîa set of dispositions‚Äîto the extent they believe their behaviour and dispositions to be genetically and socially determined, and this attribution of essence results in negative stereotyping, the formation of prejudice, and tendencies to discriminate.</p><p>The argument to be made here is simply this. If a belief in the predictability of behaviour and dispositions plays the same role as or may cause a belief in the determinism of behaviour and dispositions, then it may lead to essentialist thinking producing negative stereotyping and discrimination, which are defining components of stigmatization. AI profiling may produce highly accurate predictions and thus substantiate beliefs in the predictability of behaviour and dispositions. Hence, AI profiling may lead to stigmatization.</p><p>The argument is somewhat speculative, and more conceptual and empirical work is certainly needed. However, note that it has some intuitive appeal. If we were to believe that the client in the public servant case or the prime minister candidate in the prime minister case was <i>essentially</i> and <i>unalterably</i> mentally ill, then it does not seem wholly implausible that this would lead to negative stereotyping and discrimination. If we believe others to be machines, then we will treat them as machines. If the argument holds, it goes to show specifically that the predictive accuracy of AI profiling makes individuals more exposed to stigmatization.</p><h3 id="Sec13"><span>4.3 </span>The Exceptionalism of AI Profiling 3: A Purely Feature-Driven Approach</h3><p>The arguments in the previous two sections have a similar structure. It has been argued that a special feature of AI models, i.e. predictive accuracy, in combination with certain assumptions about human belief formation makes profiled individuals more exposed to social control and stigmatization. However, there are other features of AI profiling that in and of themselves make profiled individuals more exposed to social control and stigmatization.</p><p>AI modelling is versatile. Different predictive AI models can be trained on some data and subsequently applied to the same kind of data. In other words, it is possible to develop AI models that make different predictions based on the same input data. In the three cases, AI profiling based on publicly available photos and tweets serves the purpose of predicting mental health dispositions. The same publicly available data could potentially be used to predict other personal dispositions, including creditworthiness, risk of criminal behaviour and drug abuse, political leanings, and parental competencies. Any data made publicly available at any time could turn out to be a relevant input for an AI model that makes predictive profiling. The versatility of AI modelling implies that a vast amount of personal data may potentially be generated from limited publicly available data. The potential increase in the availability of personal data that may be used for the purpose of social control and stigmatization makes an individual more exposed to such interventions.</p><p>Predictive AI profiling is human-unpredictable. AI profiling may reveal personal data that would otherwise be hidden from a human being. In the three cases, the mental dispositions are not available to any human seeing the photos or reading the tweets, including the individual making them publicly available. There are no human interpretable signs that suggest that photos and tweets contain reliable data on mental dispositions. But the mental dispositions are also human unpredictable in a deeper sense. Thus, any other nonautomated method for making the same predictions based on the available data, e.g. statistical modelling, would be bounded by the availability of human expertise and other humanly limitations and may not deliver the same accuracy. The human unpredictability of AI profiling makes an individual more exposed to social control and stigmatization for two reasons. Firstly, because the unpredictability impedes an individual‚Äôs ability to exercise self-protection by withholding data. If it is impossible to foresee what predictions can be made from a set of public data, individuals cannot withhold data that they believe may generate unwelcome attempts of social control and that they believe would place them in groups already stigmatized or likely to become stigmatized. Avoiding entirely to make any data public to anyone seems practically impossible in a modern-day society with the growing digitization of human relations. Second, because AI makes predictable what is humanly unpredictable, it removes the protection against social control and stigmatization that is tied to human unpredictability. That no human being may predict mental dispositions just by looking at photos and tweets and that other nonautomated methods are bounded by the availability of human expertise constitutes a protection of individuals against social control and stigmatization. It means that the predictions will not be generated and therefore cannot feed attempts of social control and stigmatization.</p><p>AI technology and embedded models are highly transferable. Although the development of a high-performing AI model requires access to very large datasets, expert knowledge, hardware, and various other resources, the resulting model may be widely used by a host of different stakeholders. As imagined in the three cases, highly accurate predictive AI models may well be made available for public use. AI models differ in this respect from other technologies. Whole genome/exome sequencing is a comparable technology in that it can be used to map the complete DNA sequence of an individual from a sample of human tissue. This could, for instance, be human tissue left in public as fingerprints on a glass. The resulting genetic data can to some extent be used to make predictions about human dispositions and, in particular, disease risks. Contrary to AI technology, however, the whole genome/exome sequencing technology along with required lab facilities, biomedical expertise, etc. cannot be made publicly available. The inaccessibility of this technology appears to reduce the risk of being genetically profiled inadvertently, while the transferability of AI technology arguably increases the risk of being profiled by AI and thus increases the exposure of an individual to social control and stigmatization.</p><p>Finally, AI predictive profiling goes beyond an individual. AI predictions of dispositions will in certain cases reveal personal data not only about individuals, but also about their relatives. An AI model that predicts that an individual is likely to develop diabetes 2‚Äîknown to be partly heritable and partly due to lifestyle‚Äîwill also, as a matter of fact, have revealed an increased risk of diabetes 2 among close relatives. Such inferences will be warranted to a very different degree. However, insofar as AI predictive profiling may reveal personal data about relatives, it makes those relatives more exposed to social control and stigmatization than they would otherwise have been.</p></div></div><div id="Sec14-section" data-title="Reasons for and Against Protecting Publicly Available Online Data"><h2 id="Sec14"><span>5 </span>Reasons for and Against Protecting Publicly Available Online Data</h2><div id="Sec14-content"><p>The previous section provided ground for granting individuals a right not to be subjected to AI profiling. This article seeks, however, to sustain the right in relation to personal data made publicly available online, e.g. on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, the availability of personal data on such platforms is to a large extent influenced by the data subjects themselves. If an individual refrains from any use of online services and social media platforms, little personal data would ceteris paribus be publicly available. In so doing individuals would therefore‚Äîpresumably to a large extent‚Äîprotect themselves against AI profiling based on online available, personal data. But if individuals may protect themselves against AI profiling by disengaging from online data sharing, then the right not to be AI profiled based on publicly available data seems to have been rendered somewhat superfluous. This section therefore explores, firstly, the reasons for protecting and promoting online data sharing and, secondly, the reasons for allowing AI profiling based on such data.</p><h3 id="Sec15"><span>5.1 </span>Social and Democratic Potentials of Online Data Sharing</h3><p>The online sharing of data may serve important social and democratic purposes.</p><p>Socially, it can be used to build and maintain relationships. Research finds that socializing is a primary motivation for information sharing on social networking sites (SNS) (K√ºmpel et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2015" title="K√ºmpel, A.

Studies also suggest that the use of SNS is positively related not only to the quality of friendships defined as satisfaction with friends, but also to social capital defined as the resources that accrue to an individual by virtue of his or her membership of a social network, e.g. the feeling of belonging to a community, the forming of new relationships, the feedback and support of other people in relation to various issues, and loneliness (Ahn, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2012" title="Ahn, J.

A meta-analysis found that social media use generally is positively‚Äîbut modestly‚Äîrelated to various forms of both online and offline political participation, e.g. voting, supporting campaigns, and protest activities (Skoric et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2016" title="Skoric, M.

Consistent with the findings of a previous meta-analysis (Boulianne, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="Boulianne, S.

Another meta-analysis similarly established a positive relationship between social media use and participation in political and civic life. However, the meta-analysis found it to be questionable whether such participation is a causal effect of social media use (Boulianne, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2015" title="Boulianne, S.

Other studies suggest that online viewing and sharing of news are positively related to political knowledge (Beam, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2016" title="Beam, M.

If so, then we have reason to protect‚Äîperhaps even promote‚Äîthese kinds of online data sharing. However, this requires that privacy concerns be accommodated because such concerns may lead to withdrawal from online data sharing. A recent study found that privacy concerns defined as concerns about losing control of personal data on social networks are negatively related to social media participation measured as the frequency of interactions on SNS (Bright et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2021" title="Bright, L.

A similar study found that privacy concerns in relation to publicly available data are negatively associated with the amount and depth of personal data sharing on SNS (Gruzd &amp; Hern√°ndez-Garc√≠a, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2018" title="Gruzd, A., &amp; Hern√°ndez-Garc√≠a, √Å.

Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 21(7), 418‚Äì428." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR25" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e780">2018</a>).</p><p>What has been attempted here is to underpin two simple claims, namely that online engagement in the form of data sharing <i>can</i> serve valuable social and democratic purposes and that privacy concerns <i>can</i> lead to disengagement from online data sharing. If both claims are true, they provide us with a reason to address the concerns of individuals regarding privacy. They imply that disengagement from online data sharing is an undesirable solution to such privacy concerns. The upshot for AI profiling based on publicly available data is this. If individuals sometime in the future, when AI predictive profiling has become more widespread, become aware that their publicly available data can be used for profiling in unpredictable ways, there is a risk that this may lead to disengagement from online data sharing, also by prospective politicians and decision-makers. This is undesirable as it may impede the full realization of the social and democratic benefits of data sharing.</p><p>While we have focused here on social and democratic aspects, there is also an extant literature on the health-related effects of social media usage. A recent umbrella review comparing five meta-analyses found that social media use is associated with higher levels of both well-being, i.e. happiness, positive affect, life satisfaction, and ill-being, i.e. i.e. depression, anxiety disorder, distress, and negative affect (Valkenburg et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2022" title="Valkenburg, P.

While such studies certainly add important nuances to the evidence on the effects of social media use, they do not rule the possibility that social media use may serve valuable social and democratic purposes. If privacy concerns‚Äîand in particular concerns related to AI profiling‚Äîcan lead to disengagement from the relevant kinds of data sharing, there are substantial reasons for protecting such data sharing from AI profiling.</p><h3 id="Sec16"><span>5.2 </span>Other Trumping Concerns</h3><p>To fully substantiate the right not to be subjected to AI profiling based on publicly available, personal data, it remains to be considered whether other concerns may outweigh this right. These concerns may be related to specific purposes and contexts of AI profiling. Revisiting the three cases may therefore be helpful.</p><p>AI predictive profiling makes an individual significantly more exposed to unacceptable forms of social control and stigmatization and self-stigmatization, and it may lead to withdrawal from online data sharing otherwise conducive to social thriving and democratic health. As such, AI predictive profiling is a threat to basic human autonomy and wellbeing, as well as social life and democracy. These harms impose a burden of proof on the defender of the right to conduct such profiling in the three cases. For each case, the defender of AI profiling based on publicly available data must show either (1) that the harms of AI profiling are unlikely to obtain in the three cases and/or (2) that AI profiling without consent is a proportional measure, where this requires (A) that the benefits of doing AI profiling without consent outweigh the potential harms and (B) that AI profiling without consent is strictly necessary in order to obtain the benefits.</p><p>Consider the friends case. That household profiling should be harmless is not a credible proposition. There are no a priori reasons to think that profiling of friends and family members is not as likely to lead to overreaching social control and stigmatization as in any other case. Note that the effects of stigmatization do not require stigmatizing behaviour by friends and family. It only requires that a certain feature is stigmatized in the wider society. Consider now the benefits and the necessity of conducting the AI profiling. The benefit of the profiling is an accurate diagnosis that A may use to motivate B and B‚Äôs family to seek further health care assistance. Note that this benefit could likely have been achieved by less invasive alternative means. A could simply have presented B and B‚Äôs family with the suspicion of B having mental health issues. Note also that whether or not the AI profiling is necessary, it is still an open question, who should decide the weight of the benefits and harms? There are at least two reasons why B should decide the weight of the benefits and harms, i.e. that B should have a right to provide or deny informed consent to AI profiling based on publicly available data. Firstly, because the benefits and harms of the AI profiling are relative to B‚Äôs interests in getting the profiling data or maintaining privacy, B is ceteris paribus the best positioned to determine B‚Äôs interests and their weight. Secondly, because the potential harms to B‚Äîi.e. social control and stigmatization‚Äîfor all we know are significant harms. They are ways of impacting others that run counter to fundamental values in our society, and it seems to be an equally fundamental principle that generally‚Äîif not always‚Äîwhen individuals are at risk of suffering significant harms, they should have the right to protect themselves against these harms.</p><p>In the public servant case, there is also the risk of overreaching social control and stigmatization. Psychiatric diagnoses are sticky labels that will form the way individuals are handled in the public system in the short- and long-term, and this carries a latent risk of producing overreaching social control. It may also lead to stigmatization and not least self-stigmatization. In this case, however, there are potential benefits both for the profiled individual and the public authorities. Thus, the diagnosis may not only come to benefit client B in terms of more adequate health care and social benefits, but it may also increase the efficiency of the social services by making more readily available personal health care information needed for an adequate distribution of social benefits. AI profiling based on publicly available data may be considered necessary in the sense of being a precondition of a maximally efficient public administration, but it is not necessary in the sense that there are no alternative ways of getting access to the information produced by the AI profiling. Thus, the benefits of such AI profiling for public administration and the wider society may ultimately be marginal. In any case, it seems as if such benefits are morally incomparable to the list of potential harms of AI profiling, including the potential harms to B. As argued above, the potential harms to client B speaks in favour of granting B the right to provide or deny informed consent to such profiling.</p><p>The prime minister case may for two interrelated reasons be taken to present a more fundamental problem for the attempt to ground a sui generis right not to be AI profiled. Thus, it may be argued that information about the mental health of the prime minister candidate is of public interest and that the public therefore have a right to this information. Relatedly, it may be argued that the AI profiling is covered by the right to freedom of expression. After all the concerned citizen is in this case profiling the candidate with the intent of voicing a concern over the fitness of the candidate for political office. Access to information of public interest and the right to free speech are undeniably instrumental to a flourishing democracy. However, what we have been arguing in this article is that AI profiling is not only a continuous threat to individual autonomy, wellbeing, and social life, but that it may also threaten democratic processes by potentially leading people to withdraw from the use of social media. Decision-makers, including the prime minister candidate, may withdraw from social media exchanges with the public, and in the longer run, the threat of being AI profiled for all sorts of dispositions may prevent people from engaging in politics altogether. Therefore, it remains to be shown how and why a right not to be AI profiled based on publicly available data limits freedom of expression and information in any profound sense, and why such limitation outweighs the negative effects of AI profiling on human autonomy and wellbeing as well as on social flourishing and democracy. Simply flagging the right to freedom of expression and information cannot reasonably be thought to do the job.</p><p>Relevant for the attempt to weigh benefits and harms in all three cases is the accuracy of the predictions of mental disorders AI model <i>Deepmood</i>. Thus, it may be asserted that a predictive accuracy, i.e. sensitivity and specificity, above that of health care professionals could and would increase the benefits to individuals and society in all three cases‚Äîand vice versa. In short, the accuracy of AI models should be a parameter for any attempt to weigh benefits and harms. The evidence cited in the opening lines of the article suggests that available models for predicting mental disorders perform better than unassisted physicians. A recent meta-analysis of the accuracy of AI diagnostic systems in the context of medical imaging and histopathology found the performance of deep-learning models to be equivalent to that of healthcare professionals (Liu et al., <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2019" title="Liu, X., Faes, L., Kale, A.

A., &amp; Denniston, A. K. (2019). A comparison of deep learning performance against health-care professionals in detecting diseases from medical imaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Others have pointed out that the presumption of accuracy may not hold (Hofmann, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2022" title="Hofmann, B. (2022). Too much, too mild, too early: Diagnosing the excessive expansion of diagnoses. International Journal of General Medicine, 15, 6441‚Äì6450." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR28" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e829">2022</a>). Two observations should be made here. Firstly, as argued in a previous section, there are reasons to believe that an increased accuracy will likely drive stronger attempts of social control and increased stigmatization. One may also hypothesize that increased accuracy will drive increased disengagement from online data sharing. Whether or not the benefits and harms will increase with an increased accuracy is ultimately to be settled empirically. For present purposes, it should simply be noted that an increased accuracy does not necessarily make a difference for the balancing of benefits and harms in the three examples. Secondly, as argued right above, there are strong reasons for believing that the weighing of benefits and harms should in many cases befall the individual. The weight of benefits and harms‚Äîincluding the chance of obtaining the benefits and suffering the harms (accuracy)‚Äîcannot be separated from the interests of individuals and not in cases where the individual may come to suffer significant harms.</p><p>In conclusion, the arguments presented here suggest that individuals should have a right not to be AI profiled in all three cases. While the right not to be AI profiled based on publicly available data admittedly is a pro tanto right, what is claimed here is that none of the three cases seem to qualify as exemptions from this right.</p></div></div><div id="Sec17-section" data-title="The GDPR and the Right not to be AI Profiled"><h2 id="Sec17"><span>6 </span>The GDPR and the Right not to be AI Profiled</h2><div id="Sec17-content"><p>For the overall purpose in this article of establishing the need for a sui generis legal right not to be AI profiled, it remains to be considered whether current legislation already incorporates such a right. Within the EU, privacy rights in relation to automated profiling and data use are covered in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (General Data Protection Regulation, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2016" title="Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), OJ L 119, (2016).

The GDPR contains no explicit provisions granting individuals a sui generis right not to be AI profiled. It may, however, entail a prohibition against this type of profiling and hence indirectly establish such a right in relation to the three cases.</p><h3 id="Sec18"><span>6.1 </span>Two Approaches to Deciding the Implications of the GDPR</h3><p>AI profiling for mental health disorders based on publicly available social media data is a type of data processing involving both personal data and special categories of personal data, i.e. health data. The GDPR contains a general prohibition against the processing of special categories of personal data such as health data, but lists several exemptions in article 9, including the use of special categories of personal data that have manifestly been made public by the data subject. Further processing of personal data must abide by the principles in article 5. In short, personal data must (a) be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently; (b) be collected and used in relation to a specific purpose; (c) be limited to what is necessary for the specific purpose; (d) be accurate; (e) be anonymized or erased when the processing of identifiable data is no longer necessary; and (f) be processed securely. Article 6 lists lawful types of data processing and includes among these processings necessary to carry out a task of public interest or in the exercise of official authority. The fairness and transparency requirements are specified in articles 12 and 13. They may for present purposes be summarized as the requirement that the data subject is appropriately informed about the processing of personal data.</p><p>In the attempt to decide if the GDPR entails a right not to be AI profiled in the three cases, different approaches may be taken. One approach would be to analyze if the relevant examples of AI profiling can or cannot satisfy the aforementioned processing principles of the GDPR. If they cannot, the GDPR would effectively entail a right not to be AI profiled. Another approach‚Äîthe one pursued here‚Äîwould be to consider the scope of the principles and the extent to which the GDPR allows for them to be restricted. If the three cases fall outside the scope of the principles or they may be relevantly restricted, the GDPR would not ensure a right not to be AI profiled in the three cases.</p><h3 id="Sec19"><span>6.2 </span>The Three Cases and the Scope and Potential Restrictions of the GDPR Processing Principles</h3><p>The AI profiling in the friends case presumably falls outside the scope of the GDPR. According to article 2, the GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data in relation to purely personal or household activities that have no connection to professional or commercial activities. In the friends case, the processing seems most adequately classified as a case of processing for the sake of personal and household activities. It clearly has no connection to professional or commercial activities. In consequence, the processing requirements do not apply to the friends case, and the mental health profiling would be wholly lawful.</p><p>Pertinent to the public servant case, the GDPR allows for national adaptions of the processing principles in article 5 (see above). Thus, article 6 stipulates that member states may introduce more specific provisions with respect to data processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority. Article 23 allows member states to restrict legislatively the processing obligations in articles 12‚Äì22 if this is necessary for safeguarding other important objectives of the general public interest, including financial interests related to public health and social security. With reference to the preamble no. 10, article 6 and article 23, the Danish Parliament for instance in late 2021 adopted a legislative proposal permitting the national tax authorities to collect ‚Äòblindly‚Äô all types of personal data publicly available on social media platforms and to use these data for risk profiling of all citizens (Lov om √¶ndring af lov om et indkomstregister, skatteindberetningsloven og skattekontrolloven, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2021" title="Lov om √¶ndring af lov om et indkomstregister, skatteindberetningsloven og skattekontrolloven, nr. L 73, 1 (2021). 
                  https://www.ft.dk/ripdf/samling/20211/lovforslag/l73/20211_l73_som_fremsat.pdf
                  
                " href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR41" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e869">2021</a>). The only requirement is that the authorities consider the data and profiling <i>necessary</i> for carrying out a task, e.g. the detection of taxation fraud. Analogously, the AI profiling in the public servant case may be considered necessary for carrying out a task of the social services and for maintaining an efficient public administration, and such profiling could reasonably be seen as protecting a financial interest related to social security. The conditions for restricting the processing principles are thus likely to be met in cases like the public servant case, and the GDPR therefore does not ensure individuals a right not to be AI profiled in such cases.</p><p>Finally, article 85 of the GDPR requires member states to reconcile the data protection regulation with the right to freedom of expression and information, where this includes the right to process data for journalistic purposes. As also stated in article 85, such processing may require that member states provide for exemptions and derogations from, among others, the processing principles in article 5. The GDPR thus allows for exemptions in cases like the prime minister case, where the mental health of the candidate arguably is of public interest. Hence, the GDPR does ensure political candidates a right not to be AI profiled in such cases.</p><h3 id="Sec20"><span>6.3 </span>Advantages of an Explicit Sui Generis Right not to be AI Profiled</h3><p>Without considering the implications of the processing principles for the three cases, it has nonetheless been argued here that the GDPR does not ensure a right not to be AI profiled in the three cases. But even if the processing principles could be shown to entail a right not to be AI profiled in the three cases and even if all of the above arguments suggesting that the processing principles may be restricted in relation to these cases fail, there may still be reasons for introducing an explicit sui generis right not to be AI profiled into AI legislation. First, the cases do not exhaust the space of the potential use of profiling, which may for instance also be used by employers for recruitment and selection processes and for various other forms of workforce management (Hunkenschroer &amp; Luetge, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2022" title="Hunkenschroer, A. L., &amp; Luetge, C. (2022). Ethics of AI-enabled recruiting and selection: A review and research agenda. Journal of Business Ethics, 178, 977‚Äì1007." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR29" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e886">2022</a>; Kim &amp; Bodie, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2021" title="Kim, P., &amp; Bodie, M. T. (2021).

Second, the severity of the potential harms of AI profiling based on publicly available data suggest that in the future, where AI predictive profiling may have become publicly accessible, there is a need of legislation that is effective in regulating our profiling behaviour. One may venture that a rather simple right that unambiguously and unquestionably rules out most cases of AI profiling is more effective than a data protection regulation with negotiable implications and the possibility of special national adaptions. By introducing such a right, an important and complex legal question would a priori have been settled, and this arguably makes a difference for the regulatory effect of legislation.</p></div></div><div id="Sec21-section" data-title="Conclusion‚ÄîFuture Research"><h2 id="Sec21"><span>7 </span>Conclusion‚ÄîFuture Research</h2><div id="Sec21-content"><p>This article has substantiated the right not to be subjected to AI profiling based on publicly available data. This right entails that such profiling cannot be conducted without the explicit informed consent of the profiled subject. The line of argument pursued in this article raises several questions that warrant further discussion.</p><p>Why a right? Even if the gravity of the potential harms of AI profiling is acknowledged, it may still be considered an open question whether such harms should be addressed through a right or some other type of regulation prohibiting such profiling in one way or another. As was previously argued, the right not to be AI profiled without informed consent may be taken to follow from an individual‚Äôs right to protect their interests and their right to protect themselves against harm. It should also be noted, however, that a right of this kind so to speak ‚Äòdemocratises‚Äô regulation. It does not confine AI regulation to designated institutions and professions endowed with the competence and obligation to monitor and control AI development and use, but rather, it gives every individual an instrument for the control of AI use. In so doing, a right may increase the regulatory effectiveness over and above alternative types of regulation. This argument cannot be fully developed in this article but should be explored in future work.</p><p>Why a pro tanto right? From the outset of this article, the right not to be AI profiled has been suggested as a conditional right. Yet the potential exemptions from this right have not been specified. On the contrary, it has been argued that some of the obvious exemptions‚Äîe.g. freedom of expression and information‚Äîdo not constitute reasonable exemptions. This question also warrants further work. The reason for making this choice here is twofold. We have in this article at no point argued that there are no exemptions to this right. Relatedly, it seems that it is always possible to design situations constituting exemptions to such rights. For instance, threats to national security or threats of terrorism could be candidates for making up such exemptions.</p><p>Why informed consent? The right not to be AI profiled can be waived through informed consent. Some would object that the provision of informed consent to data processing is highly routinized, i.e. provided as an unreflected, habitual act, and that the right not to be AI profiled as a consequence may lack any real power to protect individuals (Ploug &amp; Holm, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2013" title="Ploug, T., &amp; Holm, S. (2013). Informed consent and routinisation. Journal of Medical Ethics, 39(4), 214‚Äì218." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR49" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e910">2013</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2015" title="Ploug, T., &amp; Holm, S. (2015). Routinisation of informed consent in online health care systems. International Journal of Medical Informatics, 84(4), 229‚Äì236." href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00616-9#ref-CR50" id="ref-link-section-d32563071e913">2015</a>). The extent to which the problems of routinization may be overcome through careful design of the consent situation is a matter for future (empirical) work. The position taken in this article is that the weighing of the potential benefits and harms of AI profiling cannot be done ethically adequate without the involvement of the individuals potentially being profiled. The legitimacy of subjecting individuals to AI profiling at least partly derives from their involvement in the decision to do the profiling. As such informed consent is simply ethically necessary. The requirement of informed consent may not be sufficient to protect individuals from the potential harms of AI profiling. Other types of regulation protecting individuals from such harms may certainly be needed. Not least‚Äîas some have argued‚Äîbecause the requirement of informed consent may be a burden to individuals (Vredenburgh, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2022" title="Vredenburgh, K. (2022). The right to explanation*.

There is a need for further empirical studies on these matters. Note, however, that in the attempt to build our arguments around actual behavioural patterns and mechanism, this article constitutes a contribution to evidence-based policymaking in the field of privacy rights.</p></div></div>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h2>Where can I get a physical copy?</h2><p>
The book is now out of print, but you can probably find a used copy on
<a href="https://amazon.com/Math-Primer-Graphics-Game-Development-ebook/dp/B008KZU548/">amazon.com</a>.

</p><h2>Is there a PDF or e-reader format available?</h2><p>
Soon.  Note that the kindle vesion you can buy on amazon is a "print-replica"
and not really optimized for e-readers.

</p><h2>Who created the cover art?</h2>
<p>Eric Huang (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinketeric">@TrinketEric</a>).  We worked
together on <a>Guilty Party</a> at Wideload Games in Chicago.  Since then he created the
<a href="https://www.battlechefbrigade.com/">Battle Chef</a> games.
</p>

<h2>Can you recommend an open-source network transport library for games?</h2>
<p>
I get this question all the time, and I'm so glad you asked.  Yes, please check out
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets">GameNetworkingSockets</a>.
</p>

<h2>Where are the resources for the first edition?</h2>
<div>
	<p><img src="https://gamemath.com/1st_edition/1st_edition_cover.png">
    </p>
	<p><span><span>Figure&nbsp;1</span><span>Recycle any copies you own immediately</span></span>
</p></div>
<p>
The first edition was published in 2002.  You can tell it was 2002 because the cover
had a head rendered in <i>3DS Max</i> with rad math stuff projected onto it.  It absolutely
<i>screamed</i> "This is cool high tech math!"  Coordinate axes protruded from its ears and forehead
like a <i>Tron</i> version of the Q-Tip scene from <i>Better Off Dead</i>.
</p>
<p>
Like I said, it was pretty high tech.
</p>
<p>
If you happen to own one of these, please do me a favor and never show it to any person,
including yourself.  The second edition is much, <i>much</i> better.  And here it is for
free, so why would anybody read the first one?
</p>
<p>What's that?  You're not disuaded?  Fine.  Here's the <a href="https://gamemath.com/1st_edition/1st_edition_errata.pdf">errata</a>,
<a href="https://gamemath.com/1st_edition/answers_to_exercises_1_11.pdf">answers</a> to most of the exercises (<i>Yes</i>, they stop
at chapter 14 and <i>no</i> I will not be providing the answers to the last few chapters.), and some 
<a href="https://gamemath.com/1st_edition/code.zip">code</a> that is literally 20 years old.

<p dir="auto">Notarization is a "security" feature by Apple.
You send binaries to Apple, and they either approve the binaries or not.
In reality, notarization is about building binaries the way Apple likes it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's be honest.
Tiling window manager is not something Apple will be totally ok with.
Even if they approve one version, it doesn't mean that they won't revoke it (yes, they can do it), or approve further versions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't have anything against notarization as a concept.
I specifically don't like the way Apple does notarization.
I don't have time to fight Apple.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Values</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>AeroSpace is targeted at advanced users and developers</li>
<li>Keyboard centric</li>
<li>Breaking changes (configuration files, CLI, behavior) are avoided as much as possible, but it must not let the software stagnate.
Thus breaking changes can happen, but with careful considerations and helpful message.
<a href="https://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">Semver</a> major version is bumped in case of a breaking change (It's all guaranteed once AeroSpace reaches 1.0 version, until then breaking changes just happen)</li>
<li>AeroSpace doesn't use GUI, unless necessarily
<ul dir="auto">
<li>AeroSpace will never provide a GUI for configuration.
For advanced users, it's easier to edit a configuration file in text editor rather than navigating through checkboxes in GUI.</li>
<li>Status menu icon is ok, because visual feedback is needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide <em>practical</em> features. Fancy appearance features are not <em>practical</em> (e.g. window borders, transparency, etc)</li>
<li>If "dark magic" (aka "private APIs", "code injections", etc) can be avoided, it must be avoided
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Right now, AeroSpace uses only a single private API to get window ID of accessibility object <code>_AXUIElementGetWindow</code>.
Everything else is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/axuielement_h" rel="nofollow">macOS public accessibility API</a>.</li>
<li>AeroSpace will never require you to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection). For example, yabai <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/1863" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/1863/hovercard">requires you to disable SIP</a> to use some of its features.
AeroSpace will either find another way (such as <a href="https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces" rel="nofollow">emulation of workspaces</a>) or will not implement this feature at all (window transparency and window shadowing are not <em>practical</em> features)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Non Values</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Play nicely with existing macOS features. If limitations are imposed then AeroSpace won't play nicely with existing macOS features
<ul dir="auto">
<li>E.g. AeroSpace doesn't acknowledge the existence of macOS Spaces, and it uses <a href="https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces" rel="nofollow">emulation of its own workspaces</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tip of the day</h2><a id="user-content-tip-of-the-day" aria-label="Permalink: Tip of the day" href="#tip-of-the-day"></a></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture YES"><pre>defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture YES</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now, you can move windows by holding <code>ctrl</code>+<code>cmd</code> and dragging any part of the window (not necessarily the window title)</p>

<p><em>Don Estridge literally gifted the entire personal computing market to IBM. When we first saw him in this series, he was competing with </em><a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-woman-that-tech-history-forgot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Lore Harp</em></a><em> to build the first personal computer. We‚Äôve seen that story from her perspective‚Äînow it's time for Estridge's. You might think that the man who ushered IBM into the PC age would have been a central figure within the company, but in reality, he worked in the relative backwater of its Boca Raton, Florida office. This is the story of how Estridge successfully navigated complicated corporate politics to build the iconic IBM PC‚Äîand his shocking betrayal. It's the latest installment of </em><a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Crazy Ones</em></a><em>, </em><strong><em>Gareth Edwards</em></strong><em>'s monthly column about the forgotten men and women who built the future of technology. </em><a href="https://every.to/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Subscribe to Every</em></a><em> so that you don't miss out.‚Äî</em><a href="https://every.to/news/kate-lee-joins-every-as-editor-in-chief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Kate Lee</em></a></p><hr><p>In a burnished-oak corridor outside the committee room at IBM‚Äôs headquarters in August 1980, two engineers pace nervously. Eventually, a door opens. Their boss, Bill Lowe, emerges from the board room next door. Before they can say anything, he smiles and nods. They laugh. They can‚Äôt quite believe it. It‚Äôs official. IBM is going to try and build a home computer.</p><p>Bill Lowe kicked off this ambitious project, but he wouldn‚Äôt be the person who would finish it. That role would fall to his successor, a humble, cowboy boot-wearing mid-level executive, out of favor and kicking his heels in the IBM corporate backwater of Boca Raton, Florida. He would take Lowe‚Äôs project forward, one nobody else in the company wanted. Just 12 months later, on August 15, 1981, a computer would launch that would change the world: the IBM PC.</p><p>This is the story of Don Estridge, the man who brought the IBM PC to market and changed business and home computing forever. In just five years he created an IBM division that almost nobody else in the company wanted to exist. By 1983, it had seized 70 percent of the microcomputer market and was valued at over $4 billion ($12 billion today). Under Estridge, IBM‚Äôs PC division sold over 1 million machines a year, making it the third largest computer manufacturer in the world <em>on its own</em>. This story is based on contemporary accounts in publications such as<em> InfoWorld, PC </em>magazine<em>, Time, </em>and the <em>New York Times</em>, as well as books such as <em>Blue Magic </em>by James Chposky and Ted Leonsis; <em>Big Blues</em> by Paul Carroll; and <em>Fire in the Valley </em>by Michael Swaine and Paul Frieberger<em>.</em></p><h2><strong>‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs my Apple?‚Äô</strong></h2><p>In 1980, no one senior at IBM wanted to build a microcomputer, as home computers were often called, except its CEO Frank Cary. But one man‚Äôs will was far from enough to get things done at IBM, even if he was the CEO.&nbsp;</p><p>In the late seventies, IBM was vast. Known as ‚ÄúBig Blue‚Äù to its friends and enemies, the company had almost 350,000 employees, ran so many branches, and operated in so many markets that one commentator at the time described IBM as a country, not a company. It made mainframe and minicomputers that filled rooms‚Äîsometimes, whole buildings‚Äîand cost vast sums of money. It made business electronics, dominated the global market for typewriters, and made millions selling a wide variety of office supplies. A former employee would later describe it even more accurately: IBM didn‚Äôt stand for ‚ÄúInternational Business Machines.‚Äù It stood for ‚ÄúInternational Business <em>Mafia</em>.‚Äù</p><p>IBM‚Äôs huge divisions, spread across the U.S. and the rest of the world, operated like a series of global mafia families. They cooperated when under threat from the outside, and occasionally fought. The heads of those corporate families would regularly come together at the company headquarters in Armonk, New York to form the Management Committee. There, under the watchful eye of IBM‚Äôs CEO, they made decisions that would shape IBM‚Äôs business empire globally.</p><p>Cary started at IBM in 1948. He‚Äôd been its CEO since 1972. He had helped it dominate the world of mainframe computing, selling machines that could cost tens‚Äîor even hundreds‚Äîof thousands of dollars. But he also didn‚Äôt believe that the company should rest on its laurels. The Apple II personal computer had been selling in enormous numbers since 1977. At these meetings, he had one question for IBM‚Äôs divisional <em>capos</em>.</p><p><em>‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my Apple?‚Äù</em></p><p>His divisional heads always had the same answer. Microcomputers‚Äîhome computing‚Äîwere a fad. They were low-cost and low-profit. Let others scrabble around in the metaphorical dirt of home computing. The <em>real </em>money was in the markets that IBM‚Äôs divisions already dominated‚Äîselling vast mainframes and minicomputer systems to large businesses. Cary was even told to buy Atari, which by then had established itself as America‚Äôs home video game system of choice. That‚Äôs all home computers were good for: gaming.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.25.09%20AM.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.25.09%20AM.png"></a></p><p><em>Frank Cary in 1972. Credit: IBM</em>.</p><p>But Cary didn‚Äôt back down. In July 1980, he finally forced a concession out of John Rogers, the head of IBM‚Äôs General Products Division (GPD). Rogers agreed to set up a project to create a prototype IBM microcomputer‚Äîas long as it didn‚Äôt come out of his budget.</p><p>The answer lay in Boca Raton, Florida. There, lurking near-forgotten in his vast empire of typewriters, photocopiers and other low-level business electronics, was the Entry Level Systems (ELS) Facility, headed up by one of Rogers‚Äôs lieutenants, Bill Lowe. It was a leaky, rundown concrete facility that existed primarily to research and prototype basic electronics. Lowe, who was one of the few microcomputer supporters at IBM, was summoned before the Management Committee in July 1980. He was assigned to ‚ÄúProject Chess‚Äù and told to create a prototype of a microcomputer. Lowe was given one month to do so, after suggesting to the Committee that one could be assembled from off-the-shelf parts. And he would report directly to Cary. After all, Cary was footing the bill, not Rogers.&nbsp;</p><p>To pull off this minor miracle of engineering, Lowe assembled a core team known as the dirty dozen (there were 13 of them in total). They were a mix of engineers and planners taken from a number of different divisions. Mostly, they were individuals who struggled to fit in with the risk-averse, rules-heavy way of working within IBM. Bill Snydes, for example, was a talented engineer who had taken the initiative on a failing project and spun off parts of it into a success. His reward for doing so was a reprimand for going outside of IBM‚Äôs standard operating practices. Other misfits, like systems engineer Lew Eggebrecht and software engineer Jack Sam, joined for similar reasons‚Äîa chance to work on a project with few limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>The project seemed doomed to fail. Mainframe computers were very different from microcomputers, and nobody at IBM had any real experience with the latter. Even if suitable off-the-shelf parts could be found, there was no guarantee those parts would work well together. They‚Äôd also need to program their prototype&nbsp;to do something that proved it would work. The risk that problems would occur was high, and they‚Äôd been given little margin to fix those that did. But it would be a fun way to spend a month. And as most of them were out of favor within IBM, they had little to lose.</p><p>To their own surprise, after a frantic month of development, this team pulled it off. They created a machine that worked. The computer didn‚Äôt do much, but it was enough to show the Management Committee.</p><p>"The system would do two things. It would draw an absolutely beautiful picture of a nude lady, and it would show a picture of a rocket ship blasting off the screen,‚Äù Bill Snydes confessed later. ‚ÄúWe decided to show the Management Committee the rocket ship."</p><p>This demo, held in August 1980, convinced Cary and the Committee that the work should continue‚Äîfor now. They told ELS to turn its prototype into a product‚Äîand to do everything else needed to take it to market.</p><p>Lowe was under no illusions about the difficulty of this task. He was convinced that the project was valuable, but Cary still seemed to be the only senior figure within IBM who agreed. The various division heads wanted nothing to do with the project. But as long as the cost (and any eventual blame) sat squarely on the ELS facility in Boca Raton, they didn‚Äôt feel a need to kill it. What the Committee did, instead, was impose a deadline for launch: August 1981. It was another impossibly tight deadline, just one year away.</p><p>Lowe headed back from the headquarters in Armonk, New York to Boca Raton with Snydes and Eggebrecht. There, the dirty dozen began the necessary work to turn their prototype into a real machine. But Lowe, who was seen as a rising star within the company, was already being considered for a new, bigger role elsewhere in IBM. Soon his promotion to that position was confirmed.</p><p>Lowe believed in the project but didn‚Äôt believe he was the right person to do it. Taking it forward would require a unique set of leadership skills. It had to be led by someone who thrived on breaking the rules and who could use the ELS‚Äôs newfound position outside the regular financial and management structure to its maximum. Luckily, Lowe knew just the man within IBM for the job‚ÄîPhilip ‚ÄúDon‚Äù Estridge.</p><h2><strong>A company man</strong></h2><p>Don Estridge turned 43 in August 1980. He had been an IBM man his entire professional life. He loved being able to tell people he worked there. He would tell people that his blood ran big, and it ran blue.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.28.13%20AM.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.28.13%20AM.png"></a></p><p><em>Don Estridge in 1983. Source: IBM.</em></p><p>Yet in many ways, Estridge ran as counter to the grain at IBM as the rest of the dirty dozen did. Tall with a mop of well-kept hair, Estridge wore the crisp suit, shirt, and tie that was the standard uniform for an IBM executive. But he coupled that look with a pair of expensive cowboy boots that often drew frowns from more senior executives. He was a humble man who had no time for flattery and a strong distaste for corporate politics. In IBM, this made him unusual. His fellow senior executives would frequently complain that he failed to return their phone calls, and rarely agreed to join golf sessions or long lunches. And his junior staff noted that he made a deliberate effort never to sit at the head of a table. Estridge believed in collegiality, not seniority.</p><p>Estridge was hugely charismatic, although his personal magnetism was drawn from a different source than that of Steve Jobs at Apple or Adam Osborne at Osborne Computing. They were men who sold their own visions. They could create ‚Äúa reality distortion field‚Äù around themselves (a <a href="https://www.folklore.org/Reality_Distortion_Field.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">term</a> coined by Apple‚Äôs Bud Tribble about Jobs). They could convince you of the value of their ideas and inspire you to give everything in their service.</p><p>Estridge was the polar opposite. He listened and supported. His role was to set objectives and provide people with the resources or political cover they needed. This approach inspired a different kind of loyalty from those who worked for him, but it was just as fierce. And it delivered results.</p><p>Lowe had seen how effective Estridge had been on the IBM Series/1 minicomputer project. The Series/1 was intended to be flexible enough to serve a variety of big business computing needs. It would be a workhorse that businesses would buy in large numbers, making IBM healthy profits on its five-figure price tag. But its development was plagued with problems and project overruns, and the end result was criticized for being underpowered. As a result, the Series/1 project was regarded as a failure within IBM.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one small part of it was successful. IBM‚Äôs sales department had secured a large contract to convert all of State Farm Insurance‚Äôs operations to run on Series/1 machines. That part of the project had been led by Don Estridge, who had managed the production of these specific machines, complete with required software. They had been delivered to State Farm on budget and on time.</p><p>When the Series/1 project ended, Estridge found himself tied to its wider failure‚Äîand out of favor. But IBM didn‚Äôt fire people who might still be useful. It simply sidelined them. They would be sent somewhere quiet and remote in case the company decided it needed them again. So Estridge was thanked for his work and sent into the Florida wilderness, to kick his heels in the corporate backwater of Boca Raton.</p><p>Estridge was a self-confessed computer nut. In his early IBM years, he had worked on radar systems for the military and software for NASA‚Äôs Apollo programme. Estridge was amazed by the Altair 8080, <a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-secret-father-of-modern-computing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the world‚Äôs first home computer</a>. He never believed that he might one day have a computer at home. And when Apple released the Apple II in 1977, Estridge bought one for himself. During the day, he would help IBM build mainframes and minicomputers. In the evenings, he would tinker with a computer of his own.</p><p>When Estridge heard about Project Chess, he wanted in. Lowe was happy to recommend him to the Management Committee as his replacement. In the fall of 1980, Estridge took over. He brought his Apple II with him, setting it up in his office at Boca Raton. If he felt that visitors weren‚Äôt seeing the value of microcomputers, they would be subject to an extended personal demonstration of what the Apple II could do until they conceded his point.</p><h2><strong>Going it alone</strong></h2><p>Nobody at the ELS would later remember how the machine they were building acquired the nickname ‚ÄúAcorn,‚Äù just that it was a sideways nod to ‚ÄúApple.‚Äù Whatever the name, no one outside of the department seemed to care.</p><p>Lowe had warned Estridge to expect this. In early September, ELS approached the management of IBM‚Äôs new assembly plant in Boulder, Colorado. The new plant was significantly under capacity, and Lowe had offered them the chance to build the Acorn. He had received a polite but firm refusal. Boulder‚Äôs senior management would rather let their plant sit idle than associate themselves with Project Chess.</p><p>However, although IBM <em>senior management </em>clearly didn‚Äôt want anything to do with the Acorn, plenty of junior staff did. This would become a trend‚Äîsenior management would first tell Lowe, then Estridge, to go away. Junior staff would be more interested. Those with useful skills would be lured down south to join Estridge‚Äôs ever-growing group of misfits in Entry Level Systems.</p><p>‚ÄúWe got some excellent people out of Boulder,‚Äù Bill Snydes confessed later.</p><p>Estridge and his senior team quickly realized that the only way they could get their home computer to market was if they did everything themselves. Whenever Estridge was told that yet another IBM department or division refused to cooperate, he would fly from Florida to IBM‚Äôs corporate headquarters in Armonk, New York. There, he‚Äôd petition Frank Cary for more money or people before returning home once again. It was difficult to secure additional resources at IBM‚Äîeven if upper management believed in what you were doing. Yet, to the astonishment of his senior staff, Don Estridge was almost always successful. His charisma and quiet persuasiveness got him the concessions he needed. At their height, these trips were happening two or three times a week.</p><h2><strong>Finding a market</strong></h2><p>Estridge was lucky enough to inherit two things from Lowe: a viable design for a mass-market microcomputer and a core team of competent and enthusiastic engineers. It was Estridge, however, who realized that they should enter the small-to-medium business market, not home computing.&nbsp;</p><p>The design that Lowe‚Äôs team had developed was perfect for this. Nothing about their design was pioneering, but it provided enough power, at a low enough price, to run basic small business software, such as word processors and spreadsheets. Historically, IBM had ignored this market because these companies didn‚Äôt have the five- or six-figure budgets needed for mainframes or minicomputers. However, they <em>did </em>have enough money to buy a single machine for $5,000 dollars or less. These same business users associated IBM with good things. As the saying went, no one ever got fired for buying an IBM.</p><p>However, to turn a profit, they would need to sell in volume, which meant making a lot of machines. Estridge‚Äôs options for manufacturing support within IBM were limited, so he took a trip to California to meet <a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-woman-that-tech-history-forgot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lore Harp</a>, CEO of Vector Graphic. Under Harp‚Äôs leadership, Vector had carved out a niche for itself making computers for the small business market. The company also had a reputation for quality that matched IBM‚Äôs. Estridge toyed with a partnership. He asked Harp to sign an NDA, and then revealed that IBM was considering a small move into this market itself. The discussion was friendly, but Harp was wary. Estridge left with five Vector microcomputers and a vague agreement that they should talk again.&nbsp;</p><p>While the offer to partner had been genuine, it would never take place. Instead, Harp would find herself rushing to save her business as Estridge filled out his senior team with individuals interested in going up to the challenge of the ELS alone.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A well-led team</strong></h2><p>Word spread quickly that Cary had given Estridge and the ELS freedom to operate outside of IBM‚Äôs byzantine structures and processes. As operations expanded rapidly in Boca Raton, it became clear that Estridge wasn‚Äôt afraid to use this authority.</p><p>Dan Wilkie, who came on board to lead production, experienced first hand what a difference this freedom made. With Estridge helping to cut through red tape around budgets, staffing, and processes, Wilkie created an assembly facility from scratch in about four months. The previous unofficial record for doing so at IBM stood at three years. He became one of Estridge‚Äôs most loyal and effective lieutenants.</p><p>‚ÄúWith the PC project, I saw the whole pie for the first time,‚Äù Wilkie said later. ‚ÄúWe saw the costs, we solved the problems ourselves. We lived with the good and the bad. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that I made more decisions in the first 30 days with that group than I made during my first 14 years with IBM.‚Äù</p><p>Also critical was the recruitment of H.L. Sparks, known to his friends and colleagues as ‚ÄúSparky.‚Äù A born salesman and a rising star within IBM, Sparks first encountered Estridge after the Series/1 project ended. Sparks could see that Estridge was a talented manager. When the Series/1 project had shown signs of failure, others had shifted the consequences elsewhere. Sparks was impressed that Estridge had done the opposite, shielding his team from blame, even though it meant accepting corporate exile to Boca Raton for himself. Then, in December 1980, Sparks received a call from Estridge, who offered him a job.</p><p>‚ÄúA job doing what?‚Äù Sparks replied.</p><p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask. It‚Äôs a really great deal. Trust me and just say yes.‚Äù</p><p>Sparks didn‚Äôt hesitate, abandoning 18 years of climbing the ladder the IBM way to join the project. Estridge put him in charge of marketing and distribution. There was no point in having a machine if users didn‚Äôt know about it or have a way to buy it.</p><p>Sparks contacted the Office Products Division (OPD) within IBM, which was responsible for selling office items‚Äîsuch as typewriters and photocopiers‚Äîto businesses. He‚Äôd previously worked with an advertising executive in the division named Jim D‚ÄôArezzo and had been impressed with his work. Sparks lured D‚ÄôArezzo down to Boca Raton, where he was subjected to one of Estridge‚Äôs personal Apple II demonstrations. Sparks and Estridge ran D‚ÄôArezzo through the market potential they felt the Acorn could tap into.</p><p>‚ÄúI saw right away that this thing was fantastic, and I knew that it was a barn-burner as one of the biggest items of all time in the IBM low-end product category,‚Äù D‚ÄôArezzo said later.</p><p>He returned to the OPD offices in New York where he met with Richard Young, the division‚Äôs president.</p><p>‚ÄúDick, we need this product,‚Äù D‚ÄôArezzo insisted.</p><p>‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt,‚Äù Young replied. Young didn‚Äôt like new things. And, as the <em>capo</em> of this particular IBM family, his word was final. Conversation over.</p><p>D‚ÄôArezzo was shocked. Sparks and Estridge weren‚Äôt. While Estridge provided senior management cover, Sparks did something heretical instead. He ignored the OPD and worked with mass-market stores directly, negotiating retail partnerships for the Acorn with Sears Roebuck and ComputerLand. Both jumped at the opportunity to sell a product from IBM.</p><h2><strong>The Tramp</strong></h2><p>Sparks suggested that D‚ÄôArezzo join them in Boca Raton. Angry and astonished that his division had rejected the Acorn, D‚ÄôArezzo agreed. In January 1981, Estridge welcomed D‚ÄôArezzo to Boca Raton as the advertising lead for the Acorn. He told D‚ÄôArezzo to take a few weeks and come back with a full marketing plan and advertising campaign, which he would bring to the Management Committee for sign-off in July.</p><p>‚ÄúI was sitting there taking notes and so I asked what the product was going to be called when it was introduced. He said he didn‚Äôt know. I asked how the product was going to be packaged and he said, ‚ÄòPackaged?! We don‚Äôt even know what its size will be!‚Äô</p><p>‚ÄúAbout this time,‚Äù D‚ÄôArezzo continued, ‚ÄúI started to get a bit apprehensive and I wondered if I should go home and pack my bags and head back north.‚Äù</p><p>D‚ÄôArezzo suggested they stop trying to persuade another division to handle their marketing, and work directly with an external advertising agency instead. This wasn‚Äôt how things were meant to be done within IBM, but Estridge again smoothed the way. Freed from IBM‚Äôs normally restrictive creative shackles, D‚ÄôArezzo and the agency came up with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyCai-3odiI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campaign</a> that featured Charlie Chaplin‚Äôs depiction of the Tramp in the 1915 film of the same name. In it, the Tramp is confronted by overwhelming giant machines. This<em> </em>was the IBM of old. Afterward, the Tramp would be shown happily using the Acorn. This was the <em>new </em>IBM.</p><h2><strong>Filling the software gap</strong></h2><p>As Project Chess‚Äôs misfit reputation grew, other divisions started sending their more vocal problem children Estridge‚Äôs way. One such arrival was Joyce Wren.</p><p>Wren worked at one of IBM‚Äôs smaller offices in Silicon Valley. She was outspoken on the subjects of sourcing external development, and IBM‚Äôs slow pace of software development and management.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, needing a program written in a hurry, Wren contracted a couple of programmers directly. She paid for them to stay in a hotel for eight weeks while they wrote it. Her reward was a slap on the wrist from the IBM head office in Armonk. The division that should have gotten the work had complained.</p><p>But Estridge liked Wren‚Äôs approach. He formed a new software commissioning arm within the ELS for Wren to lead. Software was critical to the Acorn project. The biggest requirements were a spreadsheet program and a word processor. These two tools, which were popular requests when buying a computer, delivered the most value for small businesses. The makers of VisiCalc agreed to port their software to IBM‚Äôs machine, solving the first problem. A distinctly un-IBM solution was required to deal with the second. They paid the creator of EasyWriter to port his word processor from the Apple II to the new IBM machine.&nbsp;</p><p>EasyWriter‚Äôs creator was John Draper, better known to the world as the infamous ‚Äúphone phreaker‚Äù (and proto-hacker) <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/the-hacker-who-inspired-apple-john-captain-crunch-draper/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Captain Crunch</a>. Phone phreaking involved using tricks and tools to make free phone calls illegally. Draper achieved notoriety for being one of the best phreakers in the business. He had only just been released from prison for phreaking when he received the request to convert EasyWriter for Project Chess. He was amused to find himself contracted now to IBM, one of the most respectable (and uptight) companies in America. In Boca Raton, it was decided that it was probably best if Armonk never discovered who the writer of their flagship word processor was.</p><h2><strong>Making a deal with Microsoft</strong></h2><p>The final piece of the puzzle for Estridge‚Äôs machine was the operating system‚Äîsomething IBM didn‚Äôt have time to develop itself.</p><p>As with many key moments in computing history, the process that led to the adoption of MS-DOS as IBM‚Äôs main operating system is veiled in myth. The most popular telling pitches it as a straightforward battle between Bill Gates at Microsoft and Gary Kildall at software company Digital Research for the soul of the new machine‚Äîa battle Kildall lost by choosing to take a pleasure flight in his personal plane rather than meet with the men from IBM to discuss a deal.</p><p>The originator of that story is an unreliable narrator‚ÄîBill Gates himself. The reality is far more complex.</p><p>As early as September 1980, Gates was approached by Jack Sams, one of Lowe‚Äôs ‚Äúdirty dozen‚Äù engineers, to provide a version of BASIC for IBM‚Äôs new machine. Sams and Gates were old school friends. Sams asked Gates for his opinion on what operating system they should use. Gates recommended that they talk to Digital Research, run by Gary Kildall and Dorothy McEwen Kildall.</p><p>Gates and the Kildalls had an informal agreement not to compete. Microsoft focused on programming languages like BASIC and other software, while Digital Research focused on operating systems, CP/M. Although Gary wasn‚Äôt present at the first meeting, there was no need for him to be there‚ÄîDorothy handled the business side of Digital Research.</p><p>CP/M was the leading operating system for business-focused microcomputers at the time. It was regarded as the market leader in this sector, and a lot of software had been written for it already. As a result, Digital Research was in a strong negotiating position. When IBM offered $250,000 for a fixed-cost universal license to use CP/M, the Kildalls refused. <a href="https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-rise-and-fall-of-steve-jobs-s-greatest-rival" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adam Osborne</a>, the charismatic founder of Osborne Computers, had persuaded Gary to give him a license like that only a few months prior for his new microcomputer, the Osborne 1. As sales exploded, the Kildalls were filled with regret. They watched as Osborne reaped the profits due to the fixed cost they‚Äôd agreed to up front and decided they would never make the same mistake again.</p><p>However, back in Boca Raton, the team was growing frustrated with the pace of negotiations with Digital Research. The Kildalls didn‚Äôt fully appreciate how tight deadlines were for the Acorn team. When Gates became aware of this disconnect, he sensed an opportunity. After discussing it with his leadership team at Microsoft‚ÄîSteve Ballmer, Paul Allen and Kazuhiko Nishi,‚Äîthe men decided it was time to unilaterally end their truce with Digital Research.</p><p>Gates revealed to Sams that he was aware of another operating system that could be ported to the IBM machine. Sams confirmed that IBM would be interested‚Äîbut that the company had no desire to get involved in a series of backroom deals or betrayals. If Microsoft <em>did </em>offer them a viable alternative to CP/M, however, they would consider the offer carefully. Emboldened, Gates negotiated the purchase of the QDOS operating system from fellow Seattle software developers at SCP and renamed it MS-DOS. It was promptly offered to IBM as an alternative option to CP/M.</p><p>There would be more twists and turns‚Äîand a number of legal cases‚Äîin the MS-DOS story, but this sequence of events would cement Microsoft as Estridge‚Äôs preferred partner during the Acorn‚Äôs development and lead to MS-DOS becoming one of the dominant operating systems of the era. Unlike the Kildalls, Gates was prepared to turn over Microsoft‚Äôs entire operation in service of the Acorn ahead of launch. And that was exactly what Estridge needed.</p><p>When the new machine was finally announced to the public it came with a choice of three operating systems: MS-DOS, CP/M, or p-System from the University of California. The choice was the result of a settlement between IBM and Digital Research, which was threatening legal action over the events that had led to the creation of MS-DOS and Microsoft‚Äôs relationship with IBM. But with MS-DOS priced at $40 in comparison to CP/M‚Äôs $240, it was clear to buyers which version of the machine Big Blue felt they should choose.</p><h2><strong>Family matters</strong></h2><p>By March 1981, the hardware for the Acorn was ready to go. By June, the software and operating system were finalized. In July, Estridge received permission to take the product to market from the Management Committee. They would officially launch it in August, right on time.&nbsp;</p><p>Estridge‚Äôs management style had delivered. He pushed his staff hard but was careful to walk the fine line between hard work and burnout.</p><p>Those who worked in Boca Raton during this period remember that Estridge frowned upon late nights in the office unless they were absolutely necessary. He was a devoted family man and had been married to his college girlfriend, Mary Ann. They had four daughters, one of whom they had adopted after her parents died in a car crash while she was young. He believed that work should not come at the expense of family time.&nbsp;</p><p>To Mary Ann‚Äôs amusement, he would sometimes drive back to the office late at night to check that everyone had gone home. If he found people staying too late, he would demand to know why. If they needed more resources, he would try and find a way to provide them. New transfers to Boca Raton discovered that leisure time was for everyone, not just executives.</p><p>However, as pressure to meet their launch date increased, Estridge did ask more of his senior team. Wilkie and Sparks recall informal Saturday morning conclaves in the office. It had become impossible to find uninterrupted moments to debate and address problems during the week. These unofficial get-togethers were Estridge‚Äôs answer. Attendance was not compulsory for anyone‚Äîmusic recitals and Little League games had priority. Nor did they have set durations. What they offered was a chance for the senior team to get together, take a breath, and work through crises.&nbsp;</p><p>It was perhaps at one of those sessions that they finally decided on a name. Acorn had always been a placeholder. Internally, its official designation was the IBM 5150. At some point people just started calling it the Personal Computer, ‚ÄúPC‚Äù for short. It was a name that seemed like a natural fit.&nbsp;</p><p>On August 12, 1981, IBM revealed the IBM 5150 to the press and the world. At a grand event in a New York City hotel, journalists were given the opportunity to test it out while Estridge and others stood by, available for questions. Estridge confirmed it would go on sale at Sears and ComputerLand stores from August 15 onward.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.32.48%20AM.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.32.48%20AM.png"></a></p><p><em>Source: Byte </em>magazine<em>.</em></p><p>The coverage the next day was overwhelmingly positive. The machine was quick, reliable, and well built. The software was good and the price point didn‚Äôt break the bank. The press had already fallen in love with the PC, a viable contender to the Apple II for small businesses.</p><p>‚ÄúIt appears that IBM has a better understanding of why the Apple II is successful than Apple,‚Äù the <em>New York Times </em>wrote on the day after its announcement.</p><h2><strong>Changing the world</strong></h2><p>The launch of the IBM PC changed computing. Prices started at about $1,500 for a basic model running MS-DOS (about $5,000 today). Most people opted for extras, such as a monitor or additional disk drives, that brought the price up to around $3,000. Still, the price was easily in the range of a similarly fitted-out Apple II and cheaper than a Vector. It was well within the price range of most small businesses. And IBM stood for quality and reliability. It was less risky than buying an Apple.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt know what to buy until they heard about the IBM PC,‚Äù Martin Alpert, the founder of computer hardware manufacturer Tecmar, said, ‚ÄúAnd then they figured they couldn‚Äôt go wrong because it was an IBM.‚Äù</p><p>In July 1981, when the PC was announced, Alpert sensed which way the market was likely to go. By the time it had launched, he had already started the process of pivoting Tecmar to focus entirely on the PC. It was a smart move, one made possible by a design choice led by Estridge. Estridge realized that whoever set the new computing standard would be able to dominate the market for some time to come. The easiest way to set that standard wasn‚Äôt just to sell machines; it was to let other companies sell parts, software, and even whole computers that would be compatible with your machine. Unlike all of its major rivals‚Äîincluding the Apple II‚Äîthe IBM PC was built with an open architecture.</p><p>The PC swept all before it. Within months, demand exceeded production capacity at Boca Raton by roughly 800 percent.</p><p>‚ÄúWe can only handle so many factors of two,‚Äù Estridge told <em>Byte </em>magazine<em> </em>shortly after launch, when asked how work was going on increasing supply. They‚Äôd had a gut feeling that their machine would sell well, but not this well.</p><p>By the end of 1981, they were shipping 13,000 machines a month out of Boca Raton. It still wasn‚Äôt enough to meet demand. By the end of 1983, they had sold 750,000 machines and controlled an estimated 70 percent of the entire home and business computing markets. If IBM had spun the ELS off into a separate business at that time, they would have been the third-largest computer manufacturer on the planet.</p><p>‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre in an era where the public has adopted computing the same way it adopted the automobile.‚Äù Estridge told <em>Byte </em>in 1983.</p><p>That same year, <em>Time </em>didn‚Äôt declare a ‚ÄúMan of the Year.‚Äù The magazine declared it a ‚ÄúMachine of the Year.‚Äù The PC had conquered the world.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.35.28%20AM.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3119/optimized_Screenshot%202024-06-05%20at%209.35.28%20AM.png"></a></p><p><em>The original Personal Computer.

In less than two months, the ELS went from the ignored and unwanted child of IBM‚Äôs computing arm to its favored son.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a vindication for Estridge and his team. While Estridge‚Äôs management had limited the impact of burnout, getting the PC to market had taken long hours and weekend work. Many‚ÄîEstridge included‚Äîhad believed that they‚Äôd be able to mentally pause post-launch. Instead, they found themselves under even more pressure than before‚Äîto increase production as fast as possible and provide direct consumer support in a way that nobody at IBM had ever needed to do before.</p><p>Securing the resources to achieve these things took even more trips to Armonk. These were just as successful as before, not least because Estridge was no longer dealing with a Management Committee that viewed the IBM PC with suspicion. But more resources also meant more paperwork and more management responsibility, both for Estridge and his senior staff and engineers. People like Snydes or Wilkie now found themselves having to rely on others to solve technical problems as their teams‚Äîand responsibilities‚Äîgrew. They could no longer dive straight in and fix things themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>It also wasn‚Äôt long before Boca Raton was regarded as the place you needed to work if you were an ambitious IBM executive. Suddenly, <em>everyone </em>was a PC evangelist, including many who the original PC team knew had been actively hostile to their efforts before. One member of the original ‚Äúdirty dozen‚Äù later described Boca Raton as IBM‚Äôs Woodstock: Everyone would claim to have been there when it started, and the vast majority were lying.</p><h2><strong>The betrayal</strong></h2><p>As operations at Boca Raton grew exponentially, it became harder and harder for the original ELS staff to maintain their sense of identity. For many, the joy of working there had come from their status as ignored and unloved misfits. Those days seemed to be over. Boca Raton was changing, and not for the better. They felt like they were being reabsorbed and forgotten. The pressure to reintegrate with IBM‚Äôs traditional way of operating began to build. It didn‚Äôt help that IBM‚Äôs ‚Äúsalarymen‚Äù culture didn‚Äôt enable financial rewards for exceptional achievements.</p><p>The ELS had invented an entire industry‚Äîthe PC business, one that IBM and others were now making a lot of money from. Very little of that money filtered back to the men and women of ELS. Not because IBM didn‚Äôt recognize what they‚Äôd achieved, but because the company had no way of providing major financial bonuses, at least not ones that weren‚Äôt tied to promotion into management.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilkie, for example, couldn‚Äôt help but comment on the difference on a visit to Tandon, one of the companies that supplied IBM with disk drives. ‚ÄúWhen I passed the executive parking lot, all I saw were Rolls-Royces, Mercedes, and Porsches,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI did consider that, after all, I was in Southern California, but I also remember thinking, ‚ÄòI am definitely in the wrong end of this business.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>Estridge struggled to find ways to financially reward the core members of the PC team without promoting them into management positions‚Äîpositions many of them didn‚Äôt want, because they took them further away from the hands-on engineering they loved. While nobody blamed Estridge for the lack of an alternative reward scheme, its absence bred resentment.</p><p>And then, in September 1982, the resentment imploded.</p><p>A phone call arrived, from Martin Alpert, the Tecmar CEO. A group of IBM staff members had contacted Tecmar, offering to sell the company commercially sensitive designs and specifications for the PC. Alpert was an honorable, intelligent man. As a major peripheral manufacturer, his relationship with IBM was the cornerstone of his business. He informed IBM of their potential security breach and then went a step further‚Äîhe offered to assist them in a sting operation.</p><p>On September 4, 1982, Alpert met with the rogue IBM employees in a hotel at Cleveland Airport. He listened to their pitch. He told them he was interested and they agreed to talk. He was also wearing a wire.</p><p>A week later, IBM fired William Erdman and Peter Stearns, two newer members of the IBM PC operation for attempting to sell corporate secrets‚Äîalong with Lew Eggebrecht, one of the original dirty dozen members and forefathers of the PC.</p><p>The discovery of Eggebrecht‚Äôs betrayal sent shock waves through the original members of the PC project. He had been there from the beginning. He was one of them. They believed that his actions were naive rather than malicious. But it brought all the feelings that something had been lost in Boca Raton back to the fore.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt even about money. They just wanted someone‚Äîsomething‚Äîto recognize that what they had achieved as a group had been special.</p><p>One day shortly after the incident, Wilkie turned up to a meeting with Estridge and noticed that he was wearing a red rosette on his jacket lapel.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that for?‚Äù Wilkie asked.</p><p>Wordlessly, Estridge opened his briefcase and pulled out another red rosette. He handed it to Wilkie.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this mean?‚Äù Wilkie asked again, confused.</p><p>‚ÄúIt means you‚Äôre a member of the finest, most professional and most loyal team that‚Äôs ever been assembled in the history of IBM,‚Äù Estridge told him. ‚ÄúPut the rosette in your lapel and wear it everywhere you go, so people will know who you are and what you belong to. Besides, we all need to stop and smell the roses from time to time.‚Äù</p><p>Wilkie, a man not prone to displays of emotion, began to well up. It was a small, silly thing, but Estridge had somehow managed to distill all of their frustrations into something tangible.</p><p>‚ÄúNow state your business, then get out of here,‚Äù Estridge told him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got more of these things to hand out.‚Äù</p><p>From that point onward, you could always spot a member of the original PC team at Boca Raton. They were the ones proudly wearing one of Estridge‚Äôs red rosettes.</p><h2><strong>The final act</strong></h2><p>The more successful the PC became, the more IBM‚Äôs other divisions‚Äîand its more ambitious executives ‚Äîwanted in. Having finally realized the potential profits to be made in the microcomputer industry, IBM‚Äôs most senior management were pushing the ELS for more. Estridge pulled together his weary senior team. They agreed that one of three projects looked promising‚Äîa cheaper, cut-back version of the PC (the PC Junior); a high-end version of the existing PC, complete with a hard disk (the PC/XT); or an improved version using newer Intel chips (the PC AT).</p><p>With everyone at Boca Raton already stretched thin, Dan Wilkie asked the question nobody else wanted to ask.</p><p>‚ÄúMy god, what happens if the Management Committee approves all three programs?‚Äù</p><p>There was a long, drawn-out silence. Eventually, Estridge spoke. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something we‚Äôll worry about if and when we get that order.‚Äù</p><p>As Wilkie had feared, the order was given.</p><p>The decision to push all three post-PC projects proved to be the final nail in the coffin for what Estridge had built at Boca Raton. They had become too successful.&nbsp;</p><p>"You couldn't have a business that might account for 25 percent of your revenue not to be tied into the formal system," a member of the Management Committee from this time later explained.</p><p>Estridge had fought to maintain the independence of the ELS and keep the rest of IBM away. Now, even his supporters appeared to be working against him. The more resources they gave him, the more he was pressured to take on more standard IBM ways of operation to deal with the size of the operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Every promotion inserted additional levels of management and bureaucracy between him and the factory floor. His swift decision-making, approachable nature, and ability to see the full picture had always been his strengths. These became significantly harder to wield once layers of secretaries and junior managers asserted control over his schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All three of the PC successor projects needed Estridge‚Äôs managerial hands-on touch. But there was only one Estridge.&nbsp;</p><p>On August 1, 1983, IBM tacitly confirmed to the company that the misfits of Boca Raton were misfits no more. They were so important and successful that the Management Committee had upgraded Entry Level Systems at Boca Raton. The media and press were informed that ELS had been replaced by the Entry Systems <em>Division </em>in Boca Raton. Its president was Don Estridge.</p><p>They were a fully-fledged IBM family. That brought with it an implicit requirement to behave the IBM way. Like sharks circling, other divisions began to take back responsibility for activities that they had been happy to let the ELS do before. Distribution was returned to the IBM National Distribution Division. Marketing went to the IBM National Marketing Division. Each change was meant to bring stability; instead, it created complexity and established a more conservative and risk-averse way of operating. That brought delays, which would be blamed on the ESD and Estridge, miscast as problems related to any freedom the division retained.</p><p>In the end, the failure of the PC Junior in the home market triggered Estridge‚Äôs final fall. The project, led by Bill Sydnes, suffered a catalog of delays and failures‚Äîin part, because Estridge, still used to managing large projects directly rather than stepping back as a senior executive, could never quite relinquish control. Sydnes, for example, recognized that competing for the home computer market meant going up against Atari and Commodore, and facing off against sharp operators like Commodore‚Äôs ruthless founder, Jack Tramiel. In order to beat the master of bargain-basement computing, IBM would have to sink down to Tramiel‚Äôs level and sell machines in the kind of discount electronics chains that IBM had always shunned. Estridge, too distant from the minutiae of the project to understand this, vetoed Sydnes‚Äôs plans.</p><p>In its wake, Estridge was finally forced to agree to something he had been trying to avoid for almost a year: accept one final promotion. In early 1985, IBM announced that Don Estridge was now the Director of Worldwide Manufacturing, responsible for 116,000 people at 41 IBM plants in 15 countries worldwide.</p><p>When Estridge announced the news in the giant corporate auditorium at Boca Raton, the assembled members of the ESD gasped. Wilkie, like many of the old guard present, instinctively reached for the red rosette on his lapel. Some of them began to cry. So did Estridge. On paper, it was a promotion. However, it was a role with no real power. They all knew what it meant. Their leader had been quietly benched, just as he had been in 1979 on the Series/1.</p><h2><strong>The rise of the clones</strong></h2><p>What happened next wasn‚Äôt hard to predict. IBM failed to remember one of the key things that made Estridge so successful‚Äîhis humility. The company assumed that once it controlled 70 percent of the PC market, nobody would be able to compete again. Employees labored away at projects like the PC Junior using the same generation of PC technology, rather than focusing on what was happening in the market around them‚Äîthe rise of the clones.</p><p>Estridge‚Äôs decision to base the PC on an open architecture was a smart one, but it had been built on a bad assumption‚Äîthat IBM would continue to move fast and innovate. The clones would always follow in its wake. But IBM took its eye off the ball. The development of a true PC successor, the PS/2, which used Intel‚Äôs next-generation processor‚Äîthe more powerful 80286‚Äîproceeded at a snail‚Äôs pace.</p><p>Finally, in April 1987, IBM announced the release of the IBM PS/2, built around the ‚Äú286‚Äù (as the 80286 had come to be known). When it launched, it was already a generation of processors behind. Six months earlier, Compaq, an aggressive PC clone that had lured many of Estridge‚Äôs former team away, released the Deskpro. It was the first mass-market machine to use Intel‚Äôs new 80386 processor‚Äîa ‚Äú386.‚Äù</p><p>By the end of 1987 market share fell from 70 percent down to 20 percent. IBM finally realized its mistake. It was time to bring Don Estridge off the bench and push IBM to the forefront of the PC business once again.</p><p>Perhaps, in another timeline, that‚Äôs what happened. In this one, Don Estridge was no longer there to save the day.</p><h2><strong>The flight</strong></h2><p>At 7:30 p.m. on Friday, August 2, 1985, Dan Wilkie was enjoying a quiet evening at home when his phone rang. He was the site manager for Boca Raton and the designated contact in case of an emergency. He listened in horror to the voice at the other end of the phone. An hour earlier, Delta Flight 191 had crashed as it approached the runway in Dallas, Texas, and 137 passengers and crew were now dead.</p><p>After demand for the PC had soared, the ESD opened an additional manufacturing facility in Texas. The Dallas evening flight had become popular with IBM staff heading between the two sites. For the rest of the night, Wilkie stayed by the phone, coordinating with Delta to identify who from Boca Raton had been onboard. He spoke to worried relatives and promised to use the corporate weight of IBM to support them however they needed, logistically or financially.&nbsp;</p><p>At 11:30 p.m., he received another call. It was from the manager of an IBM sales office in Fort Lauderdale. Wilkie had been fielding calls from various IBM managers all evening, checking on missing staff. He asked the manager who he wanted to check on.</p><p>‚ÄúNo, It‚Äôs Patty Estridge, Don‚Äôs daughter,‚Äù the manager said, sounding distraught. ‚ÄúShe just called me and said her folks were on the plane.‚Äù</p><p>Wilkie recoiled, as if he‚Äôd received a punch to the stomach. For a brief moment, he refused to believe it. Estridge had already left Entry Level Systems. He was preparing to move to New York. There was no reason for him to be on a flight between Texas and Boca Raton. But something deep in his soul told him it was true. He hung up the phone and placed his head in his hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Four hours later, Delta was finally able to confirm it. Don Estridge was dead.</p><h2><strong>The last goodbye</strong></h2><p>Don Estridge had always been a family man. After news of his benching by IBM got out, in 1985, Steve Jobs made him an unbelievable offer: $1 million to take over from Jobs and run Apple. Estridge refused. IBM was his family. So were his employees. Even when he‚Äôd been made the president of an entire IBM division, he‚Äôd continued to drive around the buildings at Boca Raton at night to check on his staff.</p><p>Most of all, he loved his real family‚Äîhis wife Mary Ann and his four daughters. They were his life. So, before leaving Florida forever for his new role at IBM headquarters in Armonk he decided to take Mary Ann on a long-overdue camping holiday. They decided to travel via Dallas to meet up with their daughter who lived there.</p><p>"I think he went to his grave with the love affair still going on with his wife," Ed Faber, the CEO of ComputerLand, said. "I know that sounds corny, but you just had to see the two of them swooping around the dance floor to understand how in love they were."</p><p>The funeral service for Don and Mary Ann Estridge was held on August 5, 1985, attended by their friends and family. They were not alone. Over 1,000 people crowded the church and graveyard that day. They had come, en masse, from Boca Raton.</p><p>The crowd was a sea of black and gray, flecked with the occasional small flash of red from a lapel. Every one of the pall-bearers for Don‚Äôs casket also wore the red rosette..</p><p>Even after the service ended, the crowd seemed reluctant to leave. Leaving meant admitting that Don Estridge was gone. The man who had always stood behind them, championed them within the conservative culture of IBM, and helped change the world forever. He had given so much of himself to them. On some level, they knew they needed to give some part of themselves back to him. They didn‚Äôt want him facing the next world alone.</p><p>Eventually, it was Wilkie who made the first move. Overwhelmed with emotion, his eyes red and swollen with grief, he stepped forward and detached the red rosette from the lapel of his suit jacket. It was the same one Don had given him years before. Leaning down, he gently placed the rosette on the casket.</p><p>From behind him, he heard someone else moving through the crowd of mourners. Wilkie didn‚Äôt turn around. He knew what was coming. The mourner reached past Wilkie and another red rosette was placed gently, next to his own, on Don‚Äôs casket.</p><p>More movement. Another rosette. Then another.</p><p>Then, after a while, it was done.</p><p>Wilkie stepped back, not daring to make eye contact with the friends and colleagues who stood alongside him. He turned and slowly walked away. His colleagues did the same. The spell broken, the other mourners started to disperse, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Within minutes, all that remained was the silence of the graveyard. On the casket of Don Estridge, a collection of red rosettes cast pink shadows in the pale morning light.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Gareth Edwards</em></strong><em> is a digital strategist, writer, and historian.

<section id="introduction">
<h2 data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Michael%27s_line#:~:text=The%20aligned%20sites%20are%20almost,Stella%20Maris%20Monastery%3B%20although%20the">read on wikipedia</a> that there are 7 famous Cathedrals built across the past centuries, all related to Saint Michael and all aligned on a straight line.</p>
<p>Being more like Saint Thomas than Saint Michael, we say that if we do not see we do not believe.</p>
<p>So we consider the perfect alignment as our research hypothesis, and we proceed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Collect the dataset of the cathedrals via manual segmentation of the map.</li>
<li>Compute the geodesic line (on a spherical model of the earth) between the first and the last cathedral.
<ul>
<li>draw a geodesic line on the surface of a sphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compute the distance between the cathedrals and the geodesic line connecting the first and the last one.
<ul>
<li>compute the distance between a point and a line on the sphere.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This methodology has a couple of flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spherical model is an approximation of the surface of the earth.</li>
<li>The line is between the first and the last cathedrals as ground truth would bias the result for towards the misalignment of these two. A single line that minimizes the distances between all the cathedrals would reduce the overall error.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start the analysis nonetheless with these two limitations in mind and we see what happens, before deciding where to go next.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="compute-the-geodesic-line-between-the-first-and-the-last-cathedral">Compute the geodesic line between the first and the last cathedral</h2>
<p>The goal is to compute the geodesic line between the first and the last point, and then computing the distance between all the other 5 cathedrals and the line.</p>
<p>As it turns out, estimating the distance between a point and a line on the sphere does not require to have a ‚Äúdrawable‚Äù model of the line. Lets first face the problem of:</p>
<section id="drawing-a-geodesic-line-on-the-surface-of-a-sphere">
<h3 data-anchor-id="drawing-a-geodesic-line-on-the-surface-of-a-sphere">Drawing a geodesic line on the surface of a sphere</h3>
<p>Given two points <span>\(P_1 = (\text{rad}(\text{Lon}_1), \text{rad}(\text{lat}_1)) = (\theta_1, \phi_1)\)</span> and <span>\(P_N = (\text{rad}(\text{Lon}_N), \text{rad}(\text{lat}_N)) = (\theta_N, \phi_N)\)</span>, for <span>\(N\)</span> power of two, we can find the geodesic of the sphere with a recursive method on the geodesic midpoint (and this is why we wanted <span>\(N\)</span> to be a power of two).</p>
<p>The geodesic midpoint between <span>\(P_1\)</span> and <span>\(P_N\)</span>, is indicated with <span>\[
P_{N/2} = \mathcal{M}^{\mathbb{S}^2}(P_{1}, P_{N})
\]</span> and it is simply found as the intersection between the line passing through the origin and the midpoint of <span>\(P_{1}\)</span> and <span>\(P_{N}\)</span> in the 3D space, indicated with <span>\(\mathcal{M}^{\mathbb{R}^3}(P_{1}, P_{N})\)</span>, and the sphere <span>\(\mathbb{S}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>To compute the midpoint we then need to go from the sphere to the 3D space and from the 3D space to the projection on the sphere. Let <span>\[
\iota: \mathbb{S}^2 \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^3
\]</span> be the projection from the sphere coordinates <span>\((\theta, \varphi)\)</span> to the 3D space, defined as: <span>\[
\iota(\theta, \varphi) = \begin{cases}
       x = R \cos(\varphi) \cos(\theta)\\
       y = R \cos(\varphi) \sin(\theta)\\
       z = R \sin(\varphi)\\
     \end{cases}
\]</span> Note that to respect the lat/lon convention, when <span>\(\varphi=0\)</span> the point <span>\((\theta, 0)\)</span> is on the equator, unlike in most maths text where <span>\((\theta, 0)\)</span> are the poles.</p>
<p>The projection from any point of the 3D space over the 2D sphere, that will serve as inverse of <span>\(\iota\)</span>: <span>\[
\pi: \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\} \longrightarrow \mathbb{S}^2
\]</span> is given by: <span>\[
\pi(x, y, z) = \left(\text{arctg}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right), \text{arctg}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)\right)
\]</span> When <span>\(x=0\)</span>: <span>\[
\pi(0, y, z) = \left(\text{sign}(y)\frac{\pi}{2}, \text{arctg}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)\right)
\]</span> and when <span>\(x=y=0\)</span>: <span>\[
\pi(0, 0, z) = \left(0, \text{sign}(z)\frac{\pi}{2} \right)
\]</span> where <span>\(\text{sign}(\eta)\)</span> is the sign function, equal to <span>\(+1\)</span> when <span>\(\eta \geq 0\)</span>, and to <span>\(-1\)</span> when <span>\(\eta &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The function defined above are all what is needed to compute the geodesic midpoint on the surface of a sphere: <span>\[
P_{N/2} = \mathcal{M}^{\mathbb{S}^2}(P_{1}, P_{N}) = \pi\left(\frac{\iota(P_{1}) + \iota(P_{N})}{2}\right)
\]</span></p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="distance-between-the-cathedrals-and-the-geodesic-line-connecting-the-first-and-the-last-one.">Distance between the cathedrals and the geodesic line connecting the first and the last one.</h2>
<p>Visually we can see that the cathedrals are not aligned over the geodesics. Let‚Äôs measure the sum of the distances between each cathedral and the geodesic. We will use the distance between the bell tower and the geodesics passing through the bell towers of the first and the last cathedrals.</p>
<section id="distance-between-a-point-and-a-geodesic-line-on-the-sphere">
<h3 data-anchor-id="distance-between-a-point-and-a-geodesic-line-on-the-sphere">Distance between a point and a geodesic line on the sphere</h3>
<p>Finding the distance between a point and a line is equivalent to find the projection of the point on the line itself. Using planes we can find the direction of the projection, as a vector, and then we can project it on the sphere with the function <span>\(\pi\)</span> defined above.</p>
<p>Let <span>\(A\)</span> and <span>\(B\)</span> two points on the geodesic line, and <span>\(C\)</span> a point on the sphere, we indicate with <span>\(\mathcal{d}_{\mathbb{S}^2}(C, \overset{\frown}{AB})\)</span> the sought distance between <span>\(C\)</span> and the geodesic passing through <span>\(AB\)</span>. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross product</a> <span>\(\times\)</span> then we can use the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>\(E = A\times B\)</span> is the vector normal to the plane <span>\(\triangle OAB\)</span>.</li>
<li><span>\(F = C\times E\)</span> is the vector normal to the plane <span>\(\triangle OCA\)</span>, which is also perpendicular to <span>\(\triangle OAB\)</span> and passes through <span>\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li><span>\(G = E\times F\)</span> is the vector belonging to the plane <span>\(\triangle OAB\)</span>, projection of <span>\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The projection of <span>\(G\)</span> on the sphere <span>\(\pi(G)\)</span> is the projection of <span>\(C\)</span> over the geodesic curve <span>\(AB\)</span>, therefore the sought distance is:</p>
<p><span>\[
\mathcal{d}_{\mathbb{S}^2}(C, \overset{\frown}{AB}) = \mathcal{Hav}(C, \pi(G))
\]</span></p>

<p>The result with a straight line between the first and the last cathedral is more convincing than the previous one, computed with the geodesic line.</p>
<p>Before summing the distances between the line and the bell towers though we can think that this approach of joining the first with the last may not be the optimal one. What if we try to fit the points with linear regression?</p>

<p>We can see that the line computed with linear regression in degrees is closer to the rows of cathedral than it is for the geodesic. Here as well we can compute the average distance in degrees between the line and the bell towers with the function <code>get_dist_deg</code> implemented above, though this distance would not be a ‚Äúreal‚Äù distance in any meaningful sense.</p>

<p>Now we know that the cathedrals are not aligned on the geodesic. Are they ‚Äúalmost‚Äù aligned on the mercator projection by accident or was there a plan?</p>
<p>Did the builders knew the earth was round? Or did they followed some method that is today lost, possibly based on the position of a start or a constellation, resulting in an alignment on the Mercator projection?</p>
<p>Certainly 7 cathedrals are too many to be a coincidence, and more historical investigations about the past knowledge would be at this point an interesting project.</p>

			<p>09 Feb 2018 ‚Äî by Eric Blake</p>
		</header>
		<p>Here are some notes that may help newcomers understand what is
actually happening with QEMU devices:</p>

<p>With QEMU, one thing to remember is that we are trying to emulate what
an Operating System (OS) would see on bare-metal hardware.  Most
bare-metal machines are basically giant memory maps, where software
poking at a particular address will have a particular side effect (the
most common side effect is, of course, accessing memory; but other
common regions in memory include the register banks for controlling
particular pieces of hardware, like the hard drive or a network card,
or even the CPU itself).  The end-goal of emulation is to allow a
user-space program, using only normal memory accesses, to manage all
of the side-effects that a guest OS is expecting.</p>

<p>As an implementation detail, some hardware, like x86, actually has two
memory spaces, where I/O space uses different assembly codes than
normal; QEMU has to emulate these alternative accesses.  Similarly,
many modern CPUs provide themselves a bank of CPU-local registers
within the memory map, such as for an interrupt controller.</p>

<p>With certain hardware, we have virtualization hooks where the CPU
itself makes it easy to trap on just the problematic assembly
instructions (those that access I/O space or CPU internal registers,
and therefore require side effects different than a normal memory
access), so that the guest just executes the same assembly sequence as
on bare metal, but that execution then causes a trap to let user-space
QEMU then react to the instructions using just its normal user-space
memory accesses before returning control to the guest.  This is
supported in QEMU through ‚Äúaccelerators‚Äù.</p>

<p>Virtualizing accelerators, such as KVM, can let a guest run nearly
as fast as bare metal, where the slowdowns are caused by each trap
from guest back to QEMU (a vmexit) to handle a difficult assembly
instruction or memory address.  QEMU also supports other virtualizing
accelerators (such as
<a href="https://www.qemu.org/2017/11/22/haxm-usage-windows/">HAXM</a> or macOS‚Äôs
Hypervisor.framework).</p>

<p>QEMU also has a TCG accelerator, which takes the guest assembly
instructions and compiles it on the fly into comparable host
instructions or calls to host helper routines; while not as fast as
hardware acceleration, it allows cross-hardware emulation, such as
running ARM code on x86.</p>

<p>The next thing to realize is what is happening when an OS is accessing
various hardware resources.  For example, most operating systems ship
with a driver that knows how to manage an IDE disk - the driver is
merely software that is programmed to make specific I/O requests to a
specific subset of the memory map (wherever the IDE bus lives, which
is specific to the the hardware board).  When the IDE controller
hardware receives those I/O requests it then performs the appropriate
actions (via DMA transfers or other hardware action) to copy data from
memory to persistent storage (writing to disk) or from persistent
storage to memory (reading from the disk).</p>

<p>When you first buy bare-metal hardware, your disk is uninitialized; you
install the OS that uses the driver to make enough bare-metal accesses
to the IDE hardware portion of the memory map to then turn the disk into
a set of partitions and filesystems on top of those partitions.</p>

<p>So, how does QEMU emulate this? In the big memory map it provides to
the guest, it emulates an IDE disk at the same address as bare-metal
would.  When the guest OS driver issues particular memory writes to
the IDE control registers in order to copy data from memory to
persistent storage, the QEMU accelerator traps accesses to that memory
region, and passes the request on to the QEMU IDE controller device
model.  The device model then parses the I/O requests, and emulates
them by issuing host system calls.  The result is that guest memory is
copied into host storage.</p>

<p>On the host side, the easiest way to emulate persistent storage is via
treating a file in the host filesystem as raw data (a 1:1 mapping of
offsets in the host file to disk offsets being accessed by the guest
driver), but QEMU actually has the ability to glue together a lot of
different host formats (raw,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/blob/master/docs/interop/qcow2.txt">qcow2</a>,
qed,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34750">vhdx</a>,
‚Ä¶) and protocols (file system, block device,
<a href="https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/proto.md">NBD</a>,
<a href="https://ceph.com/">Ceph</a>, <a href="https://www.gluster.org/">gluster</a>, ‚Ä¶)
where any combination of host format and protocol can serve as the
backend that is then tied to the QEMU emulation providing the guest
device.</p>

<p>Thus, when you tell QEMU to use a host qcow2 file, the guest does not
have to know qcow2, but merely has its normal driver make the same
register reads and writes as it would on bare metal, which cause vmexits
into QEMU code, then QEMU maps those accesses into reads and writes in
the appropriate offsets of the qcow2 file.  When you first install the
guest, all the guest sees is a blank uninitialized linear disk
(regardless of whether that disk is linear in the host, as in raw
format, or optimized for random access, as in the qcow2 format); it is
up to the guest OS to decide how to partition its view of the hardware
and install filesystems on top of that, and QEMU does not care what
filesystems the guest is using, only what pattern of raw disk I/O
register control sequences are issued.</p>

<p>The next thing to realize is that emulating IDE is not always the most
efficient.  Every time the guest writes to the control registers, it
has to go through special handling, and vmexits slow down
emulation. Of course, different hardware models have different
performance characteristics when virtualized.  In general, however,
what works best for real hardware does not necessarily work best for
virtualization, and until recently, hardware was not designed to
operate fast when emulated by software such as QEMU.  Therefore, QEMU
includes paravirtualized devices that are designed specifically for
this purpose.</p>

<p>The meaning of ‚Äúparavirtualization‚Äù here is slightly different from
the original one of ‚Äúvirtualization through cooperation between the
guest and host‚Äù.  The QEMU developers have produced a specification
for a set of hardware registers and the behavior for those registers
which are designed to result in the minimum number of vmexits possible
while still accomplishing what a hard disk must do, namely,
transferring data between normal guest memory and persistent storage.
This specification is called virtio; using it requires installation of
a virtio driver in the guest.  While no physical device exists that
follows the same register layout as virtio, the concept is the same: a
virtio disk behaves like a memory-mapped register bank, where the
guest OS driver then knows what sequence of register commands to write
into that bank to cause data to be copied in and out of other guest
memory.  Much of the speedups in virtio come by its design - the guest
sets aside a portion of regular memory for the bulk of its command
queue, and only has to kick a single register to then tell QEMU to
read the command queue (fewer mapped register accesses mean fewer
vmexits), coupled with handshaking guarantees that the guest driver
won‚Äôt be changing the normal memory while QEMU is acting on it.</p>

<p>As an aside, just like recent hardware is fairly efficient to emulate,
virtio is evolving to be more efficient to implement in hardware, of
course without sacrificing performance for emulation or
virtualization.  Therefore, in the future, you could stumble upon
physical virtio devices as well.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, many operating systems have support for a number of
network cards, a common example being the e1000 card on the PCI bus.
On bare metal, an OS will probe PCI space, see that a bank of
registers with the signature for e1000 is populated, and load the
driver that then knows what register sequences to write in order to
let the hardware card transfer network traffic in and out of the
guest.  So QEMU has, as one of its many network card emulations, an
e1000 device, which is mapped to the same guest memory region as a
real one would live on bare metal.</p>

<p>And once again, the e1000 register layout tends to require a lot of
register writes (and thus vmexits) for the amount of work the hardware
performs, so the QEMU developers have added the virtio-net card (a PCI
hardware specification, although no bare-metal hardware exists yet
that actually implements it), such that installing a virtio-net driver
in the guest OS can then minimize the number of vmexits while still
getting the same side-effects of sending network traffic.  If you tell
QEMU to start a guest with a virtio-net card, then the guest OS will
probe PCI space and see a bank of registers with the virtio-net
signature, and load the appropriate driver like it would for any other
PCI hardware.</p>

<p>In summary, even though QEMU was first written as a way of emulating
hardware memory maps in order to virtualize a guest OS, it turns out
that the fastest virtualization also depends on virtual hardware: a
memory map of registers with particular documented side effects that has
no bare-metal counterpart.  And at the end of the day, all
virtualization really means is running a particular set of assembly
instructions (the guest OS) to manipulate locations within a giant
memory map for causing a particular set of side effects, where QEMU is
just a user-space application providing a memory map and mimicking the
same side effects you would get when executing those guest instructions
on the appropriate bare metal hardware.</p>

<p><span>It‚Äôs literally faster than a speeding bullet.</span></p>

<p>Since the dawn of humanity, we have strived to put nine squares of the same color onto a single side of a cube, which was really difficult prior to 1974 when <a href="https://soranews24.com/2022/04/06/japanese-company-develops-possibly-the-most-difficult-ever-rubiks-cube-impossible/">the Rubik‚Äôs Cube</a> was invented. But once that happened it became a race to accomplish it ever faster and <a href="https://soranews24.com/2020/02/19/cool-automated-rubiks-cube-found-at-makers-faire-floats-solves-itself-blows-our-minds/">more stylishly</a> which has culminated in <strong>TOKUFASTbot</strong> by Mitsubishi Electric.</p>
<p>This robot connects a servo motor to each side of the cube, <strong>capable of turning 90 degrees in 0.009 seconds</strong>. It‚Äôs also highly responsive to an AI color-identifying algorithm to solve the cube in record time.</p>
<p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/59qgzzSD1tk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span></p>
<p>The above video demonstration shows a cube being solved in 0.204 seconds, but when Guinness World Records was called in to judge an attempt to break the existing record of 0.38 seconds different standards were set. As a result, <strong>TOKUFASTbot earned an official fastest time of 0.305 seconds which still handily beat the previous record</strong>.</p>

<p>While the machine is extremely impressive, online comments were equally astounded by the cube which could withstand such fast turning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúThey must have put a lot of oil on that cube.‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúAnything faster than this will require ways of reducing friction in the cube.‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to terms with the fact I‚Äôll never solve one in my lifetime.‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúSo, what can they do with this?‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúPrecise motor control is the backbone of manufacturing.‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little faster than me.‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúIt must be difficult to turn 90 degrees that fast and stop in exactly the right place.‚Äù</em><br>
<em>‚ÄúThey must have broken a lot of Rubik‚Äôs Cubes to get to this point.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Guinness, the first attempt was thwarted by a cube jam, and judging by the video there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any of the rounded corners one might find on a speed cube used by competitive cubers. On the other hand, the official record is called ‚ÄúFastest Robot to Solve a Puzzle Cube‚Äù which suggests a branded Rubik‚Äôs Cube may not have been used.</p>
<p><span>‚ñº </span>Mitsubishi also released a series of short videos comparing the speed of their machine to everyday instantaneous occurrences like a coffee spilling or soap bubble popping.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know the cube specs, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is quite an accomplishment. I especially find its elegant precision rather soothing to watch. If they made a less noisy and more compact version of that machine that would periodically change the color patterns I‚Äôd consider getting one for my boudoir or conservatory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article I demonstrate a software attack that allows an operating system
to set the PCRs of a discrete TPM device to arbitrary values and unseal any
secret that uses a PCR based sealing policy (such as disk encryption keys used by
unattended unlock TPM FDE schemes).</p>
<h2>Previous work</h2>
<p>We've previously demonstrated a trivial hardware attack <a href="https://hacky.solutions/blog/2024/02/tpm-attack">here</a>, that attack allowed an attacker with physical access to achieve
a clean TPM state by booting any operating system, then briefly grounding the reset pin
of a discrete TPM device with a pair of tweezers while the system was running.</p>
<p>Afterwards the attacker controlled operating system will still be executing, but now with
a "clean" TPM, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary extend operations and derive
any desired PCR values.</p>
<p>The attack described here will achieve the same aim, but without the need to physically
manipulate pins on the device.</p>
<h2>Software attack</h2>
<p>On Intel platforms, discrete TPM devices are connected to the PCH (Platform Controller Hub)
via some bus such as LPC or eSPI. These buses have a reset pin (PLTRST#), controlling the reset
state of devices. Normally this reset pin is controlled by hardware, and is only activated
on system reset, meaning that as per the TPM specification the TPM device will only be cleared
upon system reset.</p>
<p>Many pins on the PCH package, including the pins used by the LPC and eSPI buses, are multi use,
meaning they are shared with multiple IP blocks (aka logical components of an integrated circuit).
Software can select which "function" each pin is assigned to.
Among these is the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) block, which is used to give software direct
control over a pin's state.</p>
<p>An operating system can (ab)use this by re-assigning the pin used for PLTRST# to the GPIO block,
and then driving it's value low from software via the GPIO block for some amount of time then
setting it back high. Any devices connected to the bus will react to this identically to "real"
reset request driven by hardware during platform reset.</p>
<p>In case of a TPM device attached to the bus, the above operation will result in the values of
the PCRs of the device being set to a "clean" state.
This then allows the same software that did the GPIO write operation to derive any desired
PCR values similar to the hardware attack, but this time without any physical access to pins on the
mainbaord.</p>
<p>A simple demonstration of the PCR values being cleared via software can be seen here:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayDFTBeiqZA?si=Sq06T_6oxUky1wab" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>This can be used to attack TPM FDE schemes (such as BitLocker) in multiple ways, for example:</p>
<ul><li> an attacker with brief physical access to a device can plug in a USB stick, boot the device from
  it, then extract the disk encryption key and encrypted data without any access to device internals;</li><li> on a dual boot device, any operating system (including malware running inside any operating system)
  can access the encryption key and encrypted secrets stored on disk by other operating systems.</li></ul>
<h2>Mitigating the attack</h2>
<p>Fortunately Intel PCHs include a facility that allows boot firmware to lock the configuration of
PCH pins.</p>
<p>Boot firmware can set this lock, and thus preventing any software executing after it, such as
bootloaders and operating system kernels from executing this attack.
Intel claims that their (NDA-only) BIOS writers guide includes guidance on when and how to set
the GPIO lock bits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the author have not so far managed to locate a device "in the wild" that implements
the lock correctly. The author also has no information whether or not this mechanism is implemented
in proprietary firmware kits such as AMI Aptio or Insyde H2O.</p>
<p>It appears that an implementation of this lock mechanism exists in the open source firmware project coreboot.
Unfortunately the mechanism is broken in its current state on platforms older then Meteor Lake, and most mainboard configurations don't include the correct GPIO definitions, but it is proof that this mechanism was at
least thought of by someone at some point.</p>
<p>Mitigating this attack will require rolling out boot firmware updates to affected devices.</p>
<h2>Attacking BootGuard's measured mode</h2>
<p>Intel BootGuard is a feature provided by Intel platforms that allow boot firmware to be verified
and/or measured by hardware before being handed control of the platform.
One mode of BootGuard is "measurement only", where hardware extends TPM's PCRs with the hash of
boot firmware prior to handing control to it, but otherwise allowing any boot firmware to execute.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with discrete TPM devices, malicious boot firmware can perform
the attack to reset then forge the measurements that were done by BootGuard prior to boot
firmware execution.</p>
<p>For this attack variant, the boot firmware setting the lock bit is obviously not a valid mitigation.
It was suggested to Intel, that as a mitigation against this variant, some pre-boot firmware platform
component such as the Intel CSME could set the lock bit.</p>
<p>Intel rejected implementing any mitigation against this, arguing that they do not consider this variant a vulnerability in
BootGuard at all, in their words:</p>
<blockquote> As per architecture the Measured Boot mode attack is not a concern. We do have verified boot, in the sense that that the FW that can access the configuration is clearly in the TCB and it is absolutely verified (i.e. Intel authentic FW).</blockquote>
<blockquote> On the other hand, the attack in question he have a concern with, starts by having physical access. In this particular case, I don‚Äôt think it is even relevant:</blockquote>
<blockquote> If attacker have physical access, the discrete TPM is an attack surface anyway and even a known attack already. Attacker can use an interposer (just connect the TPM over a different crafted connector, very simple physical attack) and control whatever the TPM is storing regardless of FW intervention/compromise/reflashing. So the issue of the GPIO unlock is only applicable for SW only attack (no physical access).</blockquote>
<p>This is right in a strict sense (and is even minimizing the problem, as the tweezer attack is
much easier to do then invasive attacks such the interposer attack).
For one time disk decryption, the tweezer attack is just as effective, and is arguably faster
to execute then overwriting the platform's flash.</p>
<p>However the author believes that there are scenarios where the GPIO reset attack can still pose problems beyond
existing issues. For instance in as evil housekeeper attack, the device owner would like to detect tampering with boot firmware after leaving the device unattended via verifying the TPM measurements.</p>
<p>Here, the GPIO reset attack can be used by simply overwriting the SPI flash, and then replacing the device.
After this any protection offered by BootGuard measurements would be lost, and the device owner would never know that
the device is running tampered firmware.
In comparison, an interposer attack would be rather invasive and hard to implement in a permanent manner in a device
that the attacker is wanting to return to the victim afterwards.</p>
<h2>Disclosure notes</h2>
<p>This was first disclosed to Intel Product Security privately on the 27th February, 2024.</p>
<p>Intel claims that this vulnerability doesn't directly affect Intel products.
This claim is justified by the statement the NDA-only BIOS writer's guide supposedly
includes guidance for OEMs on how and when to set the GPIO lock bits.</p>
<p>Intel initially claimed that this is firmware vulnerability only affecting MSI products.</p>
<p>This was weird considering that the author never mentioned MSI to Intel.</p>
<p>After some back and forth, Intel said that this vulnerability may affect an
unspecified set of OEM partners, and also said they will to inform their
partners about it and re-inforce their security.</p>
<p>A CVE wasn't assigned by Intel, and the author is unsure if Intel has actually
informed any other party.</p>
<p>A public disclosure date of 1st June was agreed on the 4th of April. This article is being
released in accordance with said disclosure date to bring attention to the issue,
and hopefully a start the process of rolling out mitigations for it.</p>
<h2>Testing your system</h2>
<p>The author intends to implement support for detecting this vulnerability in the chipsec framework,
when done so, link will be included here.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The first AVR ATmega microcontroller debuted in 1998 and took the world by storm. In contrast to other embedded 8-bit processors of the era, it required no external components, could run off a wide range of supply voltages, and worked with the GNU C Compiler when others required you to learn assembly or pay for proprietary tools.</p><p>Since then, ATmega MCUs remained the staple of hobby engineering. In recent years, their market position has been challenged by single-board computers and the wi-fi-capable ESP32; still, the AVR architecture remains the go-to option for those who want to get things done without wrangling schedulers or debugging congestion on the Cortex-M AHB.</p><p>Yet, what relatively few ATmega hobbyists realize is that Microchip recently released a revamped series of 8-bit AVR MCUs: AVR DA and DB, along with the more specialized AVR DD and DU. The products are not being marketed to hobbyists. Instead, they‚Äôre advertised for automotive and industrial applications. Still, they‚Äôre cheaper and better in almost all respects ‚Äî and just as easy to use.</p><p>The price difference can be stark; for example, if you want a microcontroller with 128 kB of program memory, you can get AVR128DA28 for under $2 a piece; the cheapest older-generation chip with the same amount of flash ‚Äî ATMEGA1284P ‚Äî is $6. </p><p>When it comes to architectural improvements, the most universally useful change is that AVR Dx can internally generate clocks up to 24 MHz; the ATmega can only do 8 MHz, and you need external timing to reach 20 MHz. Another nice touch is a single-wire UPDI programming and debugging interface, simplifying PCB layout and saving space. The new chips also feature reduced power consumption, better ADCs and DACs, on-board op-amps, and programmable LUT-based logic units that can implement real-time automation without involving the CPU.</p><p><span>From the software side, the differences are small; you use the same </span><em>avr-gcc</em><span>, </span><em>avr-libc,</em><span> and </span><em>avrdude</em><span> toolchain, and most of the on-die peripherals are configured and operated roughly the same way. AVR Dx is not a drop-in replacement, but porting is a breeze.</span></p><p>To the extent that the semantics differ, the changes are for the better. For example, on the ATmega, you had no C-level idiom for the exceedingly common task of clearing or setting single output pins. Instead, you had to spell it out as read-modify-write operation. You then crossed your fingers and hoped the compiler outputs a single SBI or CBI opcode instead of what your program asked it to do:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void oled_send_cmd(uint8_t cmd) {
  PORTA &amp;= ~_BV(OLED_A_DC);  /* Clear the DC bit  */
  PORTA &amp;= ~_BV(OLED_A_WR);  /* Clear the WR- bit */
  PORTB  = cmd;              /* Prepare command   */
  PORTA |= _BV(OLED_A_WR);   /* Set the WR- bit   */
}</code></pre></blockquote><p>In contrast, on an AVR Dx chip, you have separate ‚Äúset‚Äù and ‚Äúclear‚Äù registers, removing the need for wishful thinking and error-prone Boolean logic. The same function can be rewritten as:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void oled_send_cmd(uint8_t cmd) {
  PORTA.OUTCLR = _BV(OLED_A_DC);  /* Clear the DC bit  */
  PORTA.OUTCLR = _BV(OLED_A_WR);  /* Clear the WR- bit */
  PORTB.OUT    = cmd;             /* Prepare command   */
  PORTA.OUTSET = _BV(OLED_A_WR);  /* Set the WR- bit   */
}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>Microchip has a </span><a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/Migration-from-megaAVR-to-AVR-DxMCU-Fam-DS00003731A.pdf" rel="">short migration doc</a><span> explaining the differences between the platforms.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="How Online Privacy Is Like Fishing"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> recently <u><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/microsoft-says-it-caught-hackers-china-russia-iran-using-its-ai-tools-2024-02-14/" target="_blank">caught state-backed hackers</a></u> using its generative AI tools to help with their attacks. In the security community, the immediate questions weren‚Äôt about how hackers were using the tools (that was utterly predictable), but about how Microsoft figured it out. The natural conclusion was that Microsoft was spying on its AI users, looking for harmful hackers at work.<br></p><p>Some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39442429" target="_blank">pushed back</a> at characterizing Microsoft‚Äôs actions as ‚Äúspying.‚Äù Of <em>course</em> cloud service providers monitor what users are doing. And because we expect Microsoft to be doing something like this, it‚Äôs not fair to call it spying.</p><p>We see this argument as an example of our shifting collective expectations of privacy. To understand what‚Äôs happening, we can learn from an unlikely source: fish.</p><p>In the mid-20th century, scientists began noticing that the number of fish in the ocean‚Äîso vast as to underlie the phrase ‚ÄúThere are plenty of fish in the sea‚Äù‚Äîhad started declining rapidly due to overfishing. They had already seen a similar decline in whale populations, when the post-WWII whaling industry nearly drove many species extinct. In whaling and later in commercial fishing, new technology made it easier to find and catch marine creatures in ever greater numbers. Ecologists, specifically those working in fisheries management, began studying how and when certain fish populations had gone into serious decline.</p><p>One scientist, <a href="https://oceans.ubc.ca/2023/05/19/daniel-pauly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel Pauly</a>, realized that researchers studying fish populations were making a major error when trying to determine acceptable catch size. It wasn‚Äôt that scientists didn‚Äôt recognize the declining fish populations. It was just that they didn‚Äôt realize how significant the decline was. Pauly noted that each generation of scientists had a different baseline to which they compared the current statistics, and that each generation‚Äôs baseline was lower than that of the previous one.</p><p>What seems normal to us in the security community is whatever was commonplace at the beginning of our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a>.</p><p>Pauly called this ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_baseline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shifting baseline syndrome</a>‚Äù in a 1995 paper. The baseline most scientists used was the one that was normal when they began their research careers. By that measure, each subsequent decline wasn‚Äôt significant, but the cumulative decline was devastating. Each generation of researchers came of age in a new ecological and technological environment, inadvertently masking an exponential decline.</p><p>Pauly‚Äôs insights came too late to help those managing some fisheries. The ocean suffered catastrophes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse_of_the_Atlantic_northwest_cod_fishery" target="_blank">complete collapse</a> of the Northwest Atlantic cod population in the 1990s.</p><p>Internet surveillance, and the resultant loss of privacy, is following the same trajectory. Just as certain fish populations in the world‚Äôs oceans have fallen 80 percent, from previously having fallen 80 percent, from previously having fallen 80 percent (ad infinitum), our expectations of privacy have similarly fallen precipitously. The pervasive nature of modern technology makes surveillance easier than ever before, while each successive generation of the public is accustomed to the privacy status quo of their youth. What seems normal to us in the security community is whatever was commonplace at the beginning of our careers.</p><p>Historically, people controlled their computers, and software was standalone. The always-connected cloud-deployment model of software and services flipped the script. Most apps and services are designed to be always-online, feeding usage information back to the company. A consequence of this modern deployment model is that everyone‚Äîcynical tech folks and even ordinary users‚Äîexpects that what you do with modern tech isn‚Äôt private. But that‚Äôs because the baseline has shifted.</p><p>AI chatbots are the latest incarnation of this phenomenon: They produce output in response to your input, but behind the scenes there‚Äôs a complex cloud-based system keeping track of that input‚Äîboth to improve the service and to <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/february-2023/the-new-bing-creating-value-for-advertisers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sell you ads</a>.</p><p>Shifting baselines are at the heart of our collective loss of privacy. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that our right to privacy depends on whether we have a reasonable <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/expectation_of_privacy" target="_blank">expectation of privacy</a>. But expectation is a slippery thing: It‚Äôs subject to shifting baselines.</p><p>The question remains: What now? Fisheries scientists, armed with knowledge of shifting-baseline syndrome, now look at the big picture. They no longer consider relative measures, such as comparing this decade with the last decade. Instead, they take a holistic, ecosystem-wide perspective to see what a healthy marine ecosystem and thus sustainable catch should look like. They then turn these scientifically derived sustainable-catch figures into limits to be codified by regulators.</p><p>In privacy and security, we need to do the same. Instead of comparing to a shifting baseline, we need to step back and look at what a healthy technological ecosystem would look like: one that respects people‚Äôs privacy rights while also allowing companies to recoup costs for services they provide. Ultimately, as with fisheries, we need to take a big-picture perspective and be aware of shifting baselines. A scientifically informed and democratic regulatory process is required to preserve a heritage‚Äîwhether it be the ocean or the Internet‚Äîfor the next generation.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Researchers recently reported the discovery of a natural protein, named Balon, that can bring a cell‚Äôs production of new proteins to a screeching halt. Balon was found in bacteria that hibernate in Arctic permafrost, but it also seems to be made by many other organisms and may be an overlooked mechanism for dormancy throughout the tree of life.</p>
<p>For most life forms, the ability to shut oneself off is a vital part of staying alive. Harsh conditions like lack of food or cold weather can appear out of nowhere. In these dire straits, rather than keel over and die, many organisms have mastered the art of dormancy. They slow down their activity and metabolism. Then, when better times roll back around, they reanimate.</p>
<p>Sitting around in a dormant state is actually the norm for the majority of life on Earth: By some estimates, 60% of all microbial cells are hibernating at any given time. Even in organisms whose entire bodies do not go dormant, like most mammals, some cellular populations within them rest and wait for the best time to activate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe live on a dormant planet,‚Äù said <a href="https://melnikovlab.com/">Sergey Melnikov</a>, an evolutionary molecular biologist at Newcastle University. ‚ÄúLife is mainly about being asleep.‚Äù</p>
<p>But how do cells pull off this feat? Over the years, researchers have discovered a number of ‚Äúhibernation factors,‚Äù proteins that cells use to induce and maintain a dormant state. When a cell detects some kind of adverse condition, like starvation or cold, it produces a suite of hibernation factors to shut its metabolism down.</p>
<p>Some hibernation factors dismantle cellular machinery; others prevent genes from being expressed. The most important ones, however, shut down the ribosome ‚Äî the cell‚Äôs machine for building new proteins. Making proteins accounts for more than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.033">50% of energy use</a> in a growing bacterial cell. These hibernation factors throw sand in the gears of the ribosome, preventing it from synthesizing new proteins and thereby saving energy for the needs of basic survival.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, publishing in <em>Nature</em>, researchers reported the discovery of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07041-8">a new hibernation factor</a>, which they have named Balon. The protein is shockingly common: A search for its gene sequence uncovered its presence in 20% of all cataloged bacterial genomes. And it works in a way that molecular biologists had never seen before.</p>

<p>Previously, all known ribosome-disrupting hibernation factors worked passively: They waited for a ribosome to finish building a protein and then prevented it from starting a new one. Balon, however, pulls the emergency brake. It stuffs itself into every ribosome in the cell, even interrupting active ribosomes in the middle of their work. Before Balon, hibernation factors had only been seen in empty ribosomes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Balon paper is amazingly detailed,‚Äù said the evolutionary biologist <a href="https://lennonlab.github.io/">Jay Lennon</a>, who studies microbial dormancy at Indiana University and was not involved in the new study. ‚ÄúIt will add to our view of how dormancy works.‚Äù</p>
<p>Melnikov and his graduate student Karla Helena-Bueno discovered Balon in <em>Psychrobacter urativorans</em>, a cold-adapted bacterium native to frozen soils and harvested from Arctic permafrost. (According to Melnikov, the bacterium was first found infecting a pack of <a href="https://www.ccug.se/strain?id=4982">frozen sausages</a> in the 1970s and then rediscovered by the famed genomicist Craig Venter on a trip to the Arctic.) They study <em>P. urativorans</em> and other unusual microbes to characterize the diversity of protein-building tools used across the spectrum of life and to understand how ribosomes can adapt to extreme environments.</p>
<p>Because dormancy can be triggered by a variety of conditions, including starvation and drought, the scientists pursue this research with a practical goal in mind: ‚ÄúWe can probably use this knowledge in order to engineer organisms that can tolerate warmer climates,‚Äù Melnikov said, ‚Äúand therefore withstand climate change.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>Introducing: Balon</strong></h2>
<p>Helena-Bueno discovered Balon entirely by accident. She was trying to coax <em>P</em>. <em>urativorans </em>to grow happily in the lab. Instead she did the opposite. She left the culture in an ice bucket for too long and managed to cold-shock it. By the time she remembered it was there, the cold-adapted bacteria had gone dormant.</p>
<p>Not wanting to waste the culture, the researchers pursued their original interests anyway. Helena-Bueno extracted the cold-shocked bacteria‚Äôs ribosomes and subjected them to cryo-EM. Short for cryogenic electron microscopy, cryo-EM is a technique for <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/supercool-protein-imaging-gets-the-nobel-prize-20171004/">visualizing minuscule biological structures</a> at high resolution. Helena-Bueno saw a protein jammed into the stalled ribosome‚Äôs A site ‚Äî the ‚Äúdoor‚Äù where amino acids are delivered for the construction of new proteins.</p>
<p>Helena-Bueno and Melnikov didn‚Äôt recognize the protein. Indeed, it had never been described before. It bore a similarity to another bacterial protein, one that‚Äôs important for disassembling and recycling ribosomal parts, called <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/biochemical-sciences/abstract/S0968-0004(18)30230-5">Pelota</a> from the Spanish for ‚Äúball.‚Äù So they named the new protein Balon for a different Spanish word for ‚Äúball.‚Äù</p>

<p>Balon‚Äôs ability to halt the ribosome‚Äôs activity in its tracks is a critical adaptation for a microbe under stress, said <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/yaplab/">Mee-Ngan Frances Yap</a>, a microbiologist at Northwestern University who wasn‚Äôt involved in the work. ‚ÄúWhen bacteria are actively growing, they produce lots of ribosomes and RNA,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhen they encounter stress, a species might need to shut down translation‚Äù of RNA into new proteins to begin conserving energy for a potentially long hibernation period.</p>
<p>Notably, Balon‚Äôs mechanism is a reversible process. Unlike other hibernation factors, it can be inserted to stall growth and then quickly ejected like a cassette tape. It enables a cell to rapidly go dormant in an emergency and resuscitate itself just as rapidly to readapt to more favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Balon can do this because it latches on to ribosomes in a unique way. Every ribosomal hibernation factor previously discovered physically blocks the ribosome‚Äôs A site, so any protein-making process that‚Äôs in progress must be completed before the factor can attach to turn off the ribosome. Balon, on the other hand, binds near but not across the channel, which allows it to come and go regardless of what the ribosome is doing.</p>

<p>Despite Balon‚Äôs mechanistic novelty, it‚Äôs an exceedingly common protein. Once it was identified, Helena-Bueno and Melnikov found genetic relatives of Balon in upward of 20% of all the bacterial genomes cataloged in public databases. With help from <a href="https://researchexperts.utmb.edu/en/persons/mariia-rybak">Mariia Rybak</a>, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, they characterized two of these alternate bacterial proteins: one from the human pathogen <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, which causes tuberculosis, and another in <em>Thermus thermophilus</em>, which lives in the last place you‚Äôd catch <em>P. urativorans</em> ‚Äî in ultra-hot underwater thermal vents. Both proteins also bind to the ribosome‚Äôs A site, suggesting that at least some of these genetic relatives act similarly to Balon in other bacterial species.</p>
<p>Balon is notably absent from <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, the two most commonly studied bacteria and the most widely used models for cellular dormancy. By focusing on just a few lab organisms, scientists had missed a widespread hibernation tactic, Helena-Bueno said. ‚ÄúI tried to look into an under-studied corner of nature and happened to find something.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>Everybody Hibernates </strong></h2>
<p>Every cell needs the ability to go dormant and wait for its moment. The laboratory model bacterium <em>E. coli </em>has five separate modes of hibernating, Melnikov said, each of which on its own is sufficient to enable the microbe to survive a crisis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost microbes are starving,‚Äù said <a href="https://ashley17061.wixsite.com/shadelab">Ashley Shade</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Lyon who was not involved in the new study. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre existing in a state of want. They‚Äôre not doubling. They‚Äôre not living their best life.‚Äù</p>

<p>But dormancy is also necessary outside periods of starvation. Even in organisms, like most mammals, whose entire bodies do not go completely dormant, individual cellular populations must wait for the best time to activate. <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-idle-egg-cells-defend-their-dna-from-damage-20240513/">Human oocytes lie dormant</a> for decades waiting to be fertilized. Human stem cells are born into the bone marrow and then go quiescent, waiting for the body to call out to them to grow and differentiate. Fibroblasts in nervous tissue, lymphocytes of the immune system, and hepatocytes in the liver all enter dormant, inactive, nondividing phases and reactivate later.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is not something that‚Äôs unique to bacteria or archaea,‚Äù Lennon said. ‚ÄúEvery organism in the tree of life has a way of achieving this strategy. They can pause their metabolism.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bears <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2022/bear-hibernation-more-winters-nap">hibernate</a>. Herpes viruses lysogenize. Worms form a dauer stage. Insects enter diapause. Amphibians aestivate. Birds go into torpor. All of these are words for the exact same thing: a dormant state that organisms can reverse when conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBefore the invention of hibernation, the only way to live was to keep growing without interruptions,‚Äù Melnikov said. ‚ÄúPutting life on pause is a luxury.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also a type of population-level insurance. Some cells pursue dormancy by detecting environmental changes and responding accordingly. However, many bacteria use a stochastic strategy. ‚ÄúIn randomly fluctuating environments, if you don‚Äôt go into dormancy sometimes, there‚Äôs a chance that the whole population will go extinct‚Äù through random encounters with disaster, Lennon said. In even the healthiest, happiest, fastest-growing cultures of <em>E. coli</em>, between 5% and 10% of the cells will nevertheless be dormant. They are the designated survivors who will live should something happen to their more active, vulnerable cousins.</p>

<p>In that sense, dormancy is a survival strategy for global catastrophes. That‚Äôs why Helena-Bueno studies hibernation. She‚Äôs interested in which species might remain stable despite climate change, which ones might be able to recover, and which cellular processes, like Balon-assisted hibernation, might help.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, Melnikov and Helena-Bueno hope that the discovery of Balon and its ubiquity will help people reframe what is important in life. We all frequently go dormant, and many of us quite enjoy it. ‚ÄúWe spend one-third of our life asleep, but we don‚Äôt talk about it at all,‚Äù Melnikov said. Instead of complaining about what we‚Äôre missing when we‚Äôre asleep, maybe we can experience it as a process that connects us to all life on Earth, including microbes sleeping deep in the Arctic permafrost.</p>
