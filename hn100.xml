<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>In September 2015, a vibration lasting just one-fifth of a second changed the history of physics. It was the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/530261a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/530261a" data-track-category="body text link">first direct detection of gravitational waves</a> — perturbations in the geometry of space-time that move across the Universe at the speed of light.</p><p>Astronomers say it was like gaining a new sense — as if, until 2015, they had only been able to ‘see’ cosmic events, and now could ‘hear’ them, too. Since then, it has become almost a matter of daily routine to record the passage of gravitational waves at the two massive facilities of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in Louisiana and Washington state, along with their sibling Virgo observatory near Pisa, Italy.</p><p>The detection of gravitational waves has provided <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19337" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19337" data-track-category="body text link">new ways to explore the laws of nature and the history of the Universe</a>, including clues about the life story of black holes and the large stars they originated from. For many physicists, the birth of gravitational-wave science was a rare bright spot in the past decade, says Chiara Caprini, a theoretical physicist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. Other promising fields of exploration have disappointed: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02741-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02741-3" data-track-category="body text link">dark-matter searches</a> have kept coming up empty handed; the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva has found nothing beyond the Higgs boson; and even some promising hints of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02532-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02532-6" data-track-category="body text link">new physics</a> seem to be fading. “In this rather flat landscape, the arrival of gravitational waves was a breath of fresh air,” says Caprini.</p><p>That rare bright spot looks set to become brighter.</p><p>All of the more than 100 gravitational-wave events spotted so far have been just a tiny sample of what physicists think is out there. The window opened by LIGO and Virgo was rather narrow, limited mostly to frequencies in the range 100–1,000 hertz. As pairs of heavy stars or black holes slowly spiral towards each other, over millions of years, they produce gravitational waves of slowly increasing frequency, until, in the final moments before the objects collide, the waves ripple into this detectable range. But this is only one of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19337" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.19337" data-track-category="body text link">many kinds of phenomenon</a> that are expected to produce gravitational waves.</p><p>LIGO and Virgo are laser interferometers: they work by detecting small differences in travel time for lasers fired along perpendicular arms, each a few kilometres long. The arms expand and contract by minuscule amounts as gravitational waves wash over them. Researchers are now working on several next-generation LIGO-type observatories, both on Earth and, in space, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna; some have even proposed building one on the Moon<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. Some of these could be sensitive to gravitational waves at frequencies as low as 1 Hz.</p><p>But physicists are also exploring entirely different techniques to detect gravitational waves. These strategies, which range from watching pulsars to measuring quantum fluctuations, hope to catch a much wider variety of gravitational waves, with frequencies in the megahertz to nanohertz range (see ‘Opening the window on gravitational waves’).</p><figure>

</figure><p>By broadening their observational window, astronomers should be able to watch black holes circling each other for days, weeks or even years, rather than just catching the last few seconds before collision. And they’ll be able to spot waves made by totally different cosmic phenomena — including mega black holes and even the start of the Universe itself. All this, they say, will crack open many remaining secrets of the cosmos.</p><h2>Pulsar timing array: catching waves that last a decade</h2><p>Last year, one viable alternative to interferometers entered the game.</p><p>Since the early 2000s, radio astronomers have been attempting to use the entire Galaxy as a gravitational-wave detector. The trick is to monitor dozens of neutron stars called pulsars. These spin on their axis hundreds of times per second while emitting a radio-frequency beam, producing what looks like a pulse of light on each turn.</p><p>Gravitational waves sweeping the Galaxy would change the distance between Earth and each pulsar, creating anomalies in detected pulsar frequencies from one year to the next. Observations of a collection or array of pulsars — called a pulsar timing array (PTA) — should be able to detect changes induced by gravitational waves with frequencies of just nanohertz, as might be produced by pairs of supermassive black holes, for example. It takes tens of years for successive crests of such waves to pass a given vantage point, meaning that tens of years of observations are needed to spot them.</p><article data-label="Related">

But three of the groups — all but the Chinese one — are now pooling their data and conducting a joint analysis in the hope of getting to the ‘D’ word. This requires painstaking work, because each group processed its raw data in slightly different ways, and so it could take at least another year to get to publication, says Scott Ransom, an astrophysicist at the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a senior member of the North American collaboration.</p><p>“In our current data, we almost certainly have the hints of individual supermassive black-hole binaries out there,” says Ransom.

 </article><p>What cosmologists are looking for in the CMB is a specific ‘B mode’ pattern in the swirls of its polarization — the preferential directions in which the microwaves wiggle — that would have been imprinted by the passage of gravitational waves. The theory is that such waves should have been produced by inflation, a quick burst of exponential cosmic expansion thought to have happened around the time of the Big Bang<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. Inflation would explain many of the Universe’s most striking properties, such as its flatness and how mass is distributed. The gravitational waves that inflation produced would have started at high frequencies, but would by now be at incredibly low frequencies of around 10<sup>−14</sup> Hz.</p><p>Although inflation is a cornerstone of accepted cosmological theory, there’s no proof of it yet. The B-mode pattern would be the smoking gun and, moreover, would reveal the energy scales involved, which would be a first step towards understanding what powered inflation.</p><p>The problem is, no one knows whether that energy scale was large enough to have left a noticeable mark. “Inflation predicts the B modes, but we don’t know if it’s big enough to be detected,” says Marc Kamionkowski, a theoretical astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. But if the leading models are right, either the Simons Observatory or CMB-S4 should eventually find it, he says.</p><h2>Atom interferometry: closing the gap</h2><p>Although many of these projects push gravitational-wave science towards lower frequencies, they leave a crucial gap just below 1 Hz.</p><p>Detecting such frequencies could reveal mergers of black holes much more massive than those seen by LIGO (which spots waves from collapsing stars that weigh at most a few tens of solar masses). “This is an unexplored region, but it could be populated with lots of black holes,” says Caprini.</p><figure>

</figure><p>A nascent technique could come to the rescue, according to physicist Oliver Buchmüller at Imperial College London. “Atom interferometry sits in that gap which we currently cannot explore with any other technology,” he says. An atom interferometer is a vertical high-vacuum pipe in which atoms can be released and allowed to fall under gravity. As they do so, physicists tickle the atoms with laser light to toggle them between an excited and a relaxed state — the same principle used by atomic clocks. “We’re trying to push this atomic-clock technique to what’s ultimately possible,” says Jason Hogan, a physicist at Stanford University in California.</p><p>To detect gravitational waves, physicists plan to drop two or more sets of atoms at different heights inside the same vertical pipe, and to measure the time it takes for a laser pulse to travel from one set of atoms to the next, says Hogan. The passage of gravitational waves would result in light spending either slightly less or slightly more time travelling between them — a variation smaller than one part in 100 billion billion.</p><p>Pioneering experiments at Stanford University have developed atom interferometers with 10-metre drops, but detecting gravitational waves would require devices at least 1 kilometre in height, which could be installed in a mine shaft, say, or even in space. As a first step, several groups around the world are planning to build 100-m atom interferometers as test beds. One such facility, called MAGIS-100, is already under construction in an existing shaft at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago, Illinois, and is scheduled for completion in 2027.</p><h2>Desktop detectors: pushing the frequency up</h2><p>Other researchers are exploring ways of detecting gravitational waves with much, much smaller (and cheaper) detectors — including some that could fit on a desktop. These are designed to watch for extremely high-frequency gravity waves. Known phenomena probably don’t produce such waves, but some speculative theories do predict them.</p><p>The Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD) at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois looks like a toy LIGO: it bounces lasers between pairs of mirrors just 1 metre apart. The LSD is a prototype for a new type of instrument designed to sense gravitational waves using resonance: the same principle by which even little pushes can make a child on a swing go higher and higher if they are timed just right<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In a vacuum inside each of the LSD’s arms, laser light suspends a particle just micrometres wide. As with an interferometer, the passage of gravitational waves will alternately elongate and compress the length of each arm. If the frequency of the gravitational waves resonates with that of the device, the lasers will then give many tiny kicks to the particle. The LSD can track the particle’s motion with a precision of femtometres, says Northwestern physicist Andrew Geraci, who is leading the project.</p><p>The LSD is designed to be sensitive to gravitational waves with frequencies of around 100 kHz. This prototype might already have a shot at detecting some, if the team can keep experimental noise in check — and provided that such waves exist. “Depending how optimistic you are, we may be able to measure a real signal in that band even with a 1-m instrument,” Geraci says. Future versions could be scaled up to 100-m-long arms, he adds, which would increase their sensitivity.</p><p>Theoretical physicist Ivette Fuentes at the University of Southampton, UK, has an idea for making an even smaller resonant detector. She aims to exploit sound waves in an exotic state of matter called a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) — a cloud of atoms kept at temperatures as low as a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero. If a gravitational wave passes through at a frequency that resonates with the sound wave, it can be detected. Because the act of looking for this signal destroys the BEC, a new flood of atoms needs to be released every second. The process might need to be repeated for months for a successful detection, Fuentes says.</p><p>In principle, a BEC-based detector could expand the search for gravitational waves to extremely high frequencies of 1 MHz or more — again, provided they exist. Fuentes says her scheme would require pushing BEC techniques just a little beyond the current state of the art. “I think the idea is very bold,” she says. Physicists have posited that high-frequency gravitational waves could reveal exotic physics that went on in the first second or so after the Big Bang. “We could use it to study the state of the Universe at very high energies,” says Caprini.</p><h2>Quantum crystal: only takes a second</h2><p>A final, more radical proposal for detecting gravitational waves involves putting objects in two places at once.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Sougato Bose, a physicist at University College London, has proposed a device in which a micrometre-sized diamond crystal is put in a superposition of two quantum states. In his scheme, the crystal’s two ‘personas’ would be pushed apart by as much as 1 metre and then brought together again — an extremely delicate procedure that has been compared to putting the nursery-rhyme character Humpty Dumpty back together after a fall. The passage of gravitational waves would make one persona travel further than the other when apart, putting them out of sync — in a measurable way — when reunited. The whole process would take around one second to complete, which would make the device sensitive to gravitational waves of around 1 Hz.</p><p>This idea is extremely ambitious: such quantum tricks have so far been shown to work only for objects the size of molecules, and no one has ever tested whether quantum weirdness can be pushed to such extremes. “Putting Humpty Dumpty back together has never been demonstrated for crystals,” says Bose.</p><p>But if the technique can be perfected, then table-top experiments such as this one could take gravitational-wave detection out of the hands of just a few large-scale labs. Together, these techniques could blow open the window on what can be seen. “The outlook is very positive,” says Caprini.</p>

    <time datetime="2024-06-25 08:54">25 June 2024</time> - Wits University 
  </p>
  <p>The Rhisotope Project at Wits is entering a new testing phase with the insertion of radioisotopes into 20 live rhinoceros.</p>
  <p>After three years of meticulous and dedicated hard work, the Rhisotope Project at Wits University has successfully inserted low doses of radioisotopes into 20 live rhinoceros.</p>
<p>In this final phase of the research project, Professor James Larkin from the University of the Witwatersrand’s Radiation and Health Physics Unit (RHPU) in collaboration with a team of experts who are leaders in the world of rhino conservation and veterinary work, will closely monitor the health and vital statistics of the rhinos over a period of six months, in order to determine the viability of this approach. .</p>
<p>The Rhisotope Project’s intention is to use nuclear technology in the form of small, measured quantities of radioisotopes and to insert these into the horns of rhinoceros, which can be picked up by radiation detection portal monitors at international borders, including at harbours, airports and land-crossings. These radioisotopes will provide an affordable, safe and easily applicable method to create long-lasting and detectable horn markers that cause no harm to the animals and environment. At a later stage, the work will expand to elephants, pangolins and other fauna and flora.</p>
<p>Being pioneered in the UNESCO Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, the Project aims to benefit from existing, sophisticated multi-billion-dollar nuclear security infrastructure that already exists throughout the world. Over 11 000 radiation detection portal monitors are installed at airports, harbours and other ports of entry, including thousands of trained personnel equipped with radiation detectors, all of which can detect the smallest radioactive particles. In contrast to this, the infrastructure and number of trained officials to detect wildlife trafficking at ports of entry internationally is extremely limited.</p>

  <p>“Every 20 hours in South Africa a rhino dies for its horn. These poached horns are then trafficked across the world and used for traditional medicines, or as status symbols. This has led to their horns currently being the most valuable false commodity in the black-market trade, with a higher value even than gold, platinum, diamonds and cocaine. Sadly, rhino horns play a large role in funding a wide variety of criminal activities globally,” says Professor James Larkin. “Ultimately, the aim is to try to devalue rhinoceros horn in the eyes of the end users, while at the same time making the horns easier to detect as they are being smuggled across borders.”</p>
<p>Starting on Monday, 24 June 2004, Professor Larkin and his team carefully sedated the 20 rhinos &nbsp;and drilled a small hole into each of their horns to insert the non-toxic radioisotopes. The rhinos were then released under the care of a highly qualified crew that will monitor the animals on a 24-hour basis for the next six months. “Each insertion was closely monitored by expert veterinarians and extreme care was taken to prevent any harm to the animals,” says Larkin. “Over months of research and testing we have also ensured that the inserted radioisotopes hold no health or any other risk for the animals or those who care for them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and application of the Rhisotope Project nuclear technology has the capacity to help deter poaching, increase the detection capabilities of smuggled horns, increase prosecution success, reveal smuggling routes and deter end-user markets.</p>
<p>Rhino poaching reached crisis levels since 2008 where close to 10 000 rhinos were lost to poaching in South Africa, with wildlife trafficking being the third biggest organised crime globally.</p>
<p>Professor Lynn Morris, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Research and Innovation at Wits University says: “This is an example of how cross-disciplinary research and innovation makes a real difference. This novel approach pioneered by Prof Larkin and his colleagues has the potential to eradicate the threat of extinction our unique wild-life species&nbsp;&nbsp; , especially in South Africa and on the continent. This is one of many projects at Wits that demonstrates research with impact, and which helps to address some of the local and global challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.”</p>
<p>The Rhisotope Project at Wits was set up by a small team of likeminded individuals as a South African-based conservation initiative in January 2021 with the intention of becoming a global leader in harnessing nuclear technology to protect threatened and endangered species of fauna and flora as well as communities of people.</p>
<p>Aside from developing a solution to combat the illicit trade and trafficking of wildlife products, the Rhisotope Project seeks to provide education and social upliftment to empower people and local communities. A special focus is aimed at uplifting the girls and women of rural communities, who are often the backbone of these communities in the remote areas where endangered species are found and are the greatest components of success in changing the hearts and minds of local communities thereby creating rhino ambassadors and champions.</p>

<p>Symptoms typically begin with constipation and sleep problems, up to 20 years before progressing into dementia and the debilitating loss of muscle control.</p><figure id="attachment_131231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131231"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1.jpg" alt="Hands picking up a glass" width="642" height="500" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-131231">(<a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEGCRiWJIk/">pixelshot/Canva Pro</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear">Previous research</a> found people with Parkinson's disease also experience changes in their microbiome long before other signs appear.</p>
<p>Analyzing fecal samples from 94 patients with Parkinson's disease and 73 relatively healthy controls in Japan, Nishiwaki and team compared their results with data from China, Taiwan, Germany, and the US.</p>
<p>While different groups of bacteria were involved in the different countries examined, they all influenced pathways that synthesize B vitamins in the body. The researchers found the changes in gut bacteria communities were associated with a decrease in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin">riboflavin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin">biotin</a> in people with Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Nishiwaki and colleagues then showed the lack of B vitamins was linked to a decrease in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-chain_fatty_acid">short-chain fatty acids</a> (SCFAs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamine">polyamines</a>: molecules that help create a healthy mucus layer in the intestines.</p>
<p>"Deficiencies in polyamines and SCFAs could lead to thinning of the intestinal mucus layer, increasing intestinal permeability, both of which have been observed in Parkinson's disease," Nishiwaki <a href="https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2024/06/20240618-01.html">explains</a>.</p><figure id="attachment_131227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131227"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the process of gut bacteria depleting B vitamins and leading to symptoms of Parkinson's disease" width="642" height="950" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642-280x415.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642-600x888.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-131227">Summary of findings from the study and speculations from previous research.

These include <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dry-cleaning-chemical-could-be-major-cause-of-parkinsons-scientists-warn">cleaning chemicals,</a> <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-pathways-to-parkinsons-could-point-to-a-single-way-to-prevent-it">pesticides</a>, and herbicides.</p>
<p>Such toxins lead to the overproduction of α-synuclein fibrils – molecules <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106411">known to amass</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-detects-parkinsons-7-years-before-most-symptoms-show">dopamine-producing cells</a> in the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease">substantia nigra</a> part of our brains, and increased nervous system inflammation, eventually leading to the more debilitating motor and dementia symptoms of Parkinson's.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/BM4WLJBtjxF8Cx3wFsjFhKb/?lang=en">2003 study</a> found high doses of riboflavin can assist in recovering some motor functions in patients who also eliminated red meat from their diets.</p>
<p>So it's possible that high doses of vitamin B may prevent some of the damage, Nishiwaki and team propose.</p><figure id="attachment_131228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131228"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/VitaminBInBlood642.jpg" alt="Illustration of a vitamin B2 molecule in the blood.

<p>Of course, with such a complicated chain of events involved in Parkinson's disease, not all patients likely experience the same causes, so each individual would need to be assessed.</p>
<p>"We could perform gut microbiota analysis on patients or conduct fecal metabolite analysis," <a href="https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2024/06/20240618-01.html">explains</a> Nishiwak.</p>
<p>"Using these findings, we could identify individuals with specific deficiencies and administer oral riboflavin and biotin supplements to those with decreased levels, potentially creating an effective treatment."</p><p>This research was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00724-z"><em>npj Parkinson's Disease</em></a>.</p>

<p>Amazing! I immediately went to order a Swedish keyboard.</p>
<p>I notice there’s a lot less available to order on the Swedish store than, say, the German one. I was hoping to order a WiFi antenna unit for my standalone mainboard and a couple of other parts. Are those parts expected to become available in Sweden soon?</p>
<p>Edit: I refreshed the store and a few more items are available. Looks like I just need to be patient <img src="https://community.frame.work/images/emoji/apple/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=12" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>The openSUSE project recently <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2024/05/28/aeon-desktop-brings-new-features-in-rctwo-release/">announced</a>
the second release candidate (RC2) of its <a href="https://aeondesktop.github.io/">Aeon Desktop</a>, formerly known
as MicroOS Desktop GNOME. Aside from the new coat of naming paint,
Aeon breaks ground in a few other ways by dabbling with technologies not found in other openSUSE releases. The goal for Aeon is to provide
automated system updates using snapshots that can be applied
atomically, removing the burden of system maintenance for
"<q>lazy developers</q>" who want to focus on their work rather than desktop
administration. System-tinkerers need not apply.</p>

<p>The idea behind Aeon, as with other immutable (or <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/946526/">image-based</a>) Linux
distributions, is to provide the core of the distribution as a read-only image or
filesystem that is updated atomically and can be rolled back if
needed. Google's ChromeOS was the first popular Linux-based desktop
operating system to follow this model. Since the
release of ChromeOS a number of interesting immutable
implementations have cropped up, such as <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/">Fedora
Silverblue</a>, <a href="https://projectbluefin.io/">Project Bluefin</a>
(<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/954059/">covered here</a> in
December 2023), 
openSUSE's <a href="https://microos.opensuse.org/">MicroOS</a> (<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/927373/">covered here</a> in March
2023), and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core">Ubuntu Core</a>.</p>

<p>What makes up the core software and how the immutable bits are
composed, deployed, and managed varies quite a bit between distributions.
Aeon uses a utility called <a href="https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/man-pages/transactional-update.8.html">transactional-update</a>
(with openSUSE's Zypper package manager under the hood) and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:BTRFS">Btrfs subvolumes</a> to
<a href="https://kubic.opensuse.org/documentation/transactional-update-guide/transactional-update.html">create
and update system snapshots</a>. Basically, instead of installing and
updating a system with individual packages while it is running,
the updates are applied in the background to a separate Btrfs snapshot
and then the system is rebooted into that snapshot. The <tt>/home</tt>
and <tt>/var</tt> directories are, of course, writable Btrfs volumes;
<tt>/etc</tt> uses <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html">overlayfs</a>
to apply local changes on top of the default configuration files.</p>

<p>User-installed software for these distributions is separated from the rest of the system
software on a mutable filesystem using some type of application-containerization technology like <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>, <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>, or <a href="https://snapcraft.io/about">Snap</a>. In Aeon's case, user
applications are generally installed via Flatpak, or using a
traditional package manager inside a containerized Linux distribution
of the user's choice that is managed with <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox">Distrobox</a>. 
(On Aeon, Distrobox uses Podman to run containers.)</p>

<h4>Installation and updates</h4>

<p>The openSUSE YaST team has been <a href="https://yast.opensuse.org/blog/2024-05-17/agama-8">working
on</a> a new installer called <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/agama">Agama</a>, but Aeon has its
own installer, the <a href="https://github.com/sysrich/tik">Transactional Installation
Kit</a> (tik). The tik installer is designed to deploy operating
system images to UEFI hardware, which means that users with older
hardware are (at least currently) out of luck when it comes to
installing Aeon. It can also make use of the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Ignition">Ignition</a>
and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Combustion">Combustion</a>
configuration tools to create users, enable services,
install SSH keys, and more, automatically at install time.</p>

<p>As with the rest of the distribution, the philosophy for tik is
"minimal". Tik does not ask the user to make any
choices about software, how disk partitions should be laid out, or
much else, except to confirm that the installation should
proceed. Users are prompted to choose <em>which</em> disk to use,
when a system has multiple disks. If the target system has a existing MicroOS
installation, tik will offer to back up (and restore) existing users and data as
long as the USB stick with the installer has more free space than the
data stored in the home directory.</p>

<p>After installation, there is a first-run wizard to perform system
configuration. It asks for the usual information: the language
and keyboard layout to use, wireless network connection information,
time zone, and user information. Aeon does not configure a root user,
so the first system user is set up as an administrator and can use
<tt>sudo</tt> to perform any administrative tasks.</p>

<h4>Truly minimal desktop</h4>

<p>Aeon is composed from packages in the openSUSE Tumbleweed and
MicroOS repositories, so Aeon RC2 provides users with an up-to-date <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/966187/">GNOME&nbsp;46</a>
desktop using Wayland. (GNOME&nbsp;46.2, to be exact.) It also includes Linux
6.9.3, systemd v255, and glibc 2.39.</p>

<p>Many Linux distributions offer "minimal" desktop package
selections, but openSUSE Aeon takes this farther than most. Aside from
some basic applications one would expect with GNOME—such as the
file manager, settings application, and other utilities—Aeon
comes with almost no software installed as part of the base
system. Firefox and GNOME's text editor, calculator, and terminal
application are all installed as Flatpaks as a second step after the
desktop user logs in the first time. If a user wants a media player,
office suite, email application, or even image and PDF viewers, they
have to be installed separately. That <em>may</em> be taking
minimalism a bit too far, but it does give users a lot of control over
what is installed on their system.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/978229/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/openSUSE-Aeon-sm.png" alt="[openSUSE Aeon minimal
install]" title="openSUSE Aeon minimal install"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>Aeon is touted as a distribution for users who do not want to
hassle with system administration, but its sparse selection of
software ensures that some up-front work is required to reach the
payoff. For example, aside from having to
install expected utilities like a PDF viewer, the <tt>man</tt> command
and man pages are not part of the default software. Probably the best
way to deal with that is to create a Distrobox container to do one's work in,
though having the Distrobox man pages available would be
helpful when doing so. (Distrobox <a href="https://distrobox.it/#quick-start">documentation</a> is available
online, of course, but I've always reached for man pages first.)</p>

<p>One attractive, and seemingly unique, feature that Aeon offers is
automatic updates for the operating system, installed Flatpaks, and
any distroboxes that one may have set up. It's not unusual to offer
system and Flatpak updates, but updating distroboxes is usually a task
left to the user. It can become unwieldy quickly if one has several
distroboxes set up that need to be updated manually.</p>

<p>According to the RC2 announcement: there are a few features
targeting better performance. Aeon is the first openSUSE
edition to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram">zram</a> kernel module for
system swap. This is supposed to improve system performance by
avoiding swapping to disk. Aeon's transactional update system is also
supposed to automatically choose packages compiled with <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2023/03/02/tw-gains-optional-optimizations/">x86-64-v3
optimizations</a> for CPUs with Advanced Vector Extensions version two
(AVX2) extensions, if they are available and the system supports them.</p>

<p>Overall, Aeon looks like a good choice for users who want a
minimal, immutable openSUSE GNOME desktop system. It would be
especially attractive for users who want a distraction-free system
with just a few applications, like an IDE and web browser for
development work. It is probably not a great choice for openSUSE users
who are happy with Tumbleweed or Leap and installing software with Zypper.</p>

<p>Readers interested in trying openSUSE Aeon should check out the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Aeon/InstallGuide">install
guide</a> and <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Aeon">overview</a>. The
distribution is still in a release-candidate stage, so rough edges are
to be expected—but it is solid enough to test drive and <a href="https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=openSUSE+Aeon&amp;format=guided">report
bugs</a> if they're found.</p><br clear="all"><hr><p>

Thus New York’s public transit policy is fundamentally America’s public transit policy—and NYC’s urban development is in many ways America’s urban development.</span></p><p><span>That’s why it was so important when </span><a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/mta-pauses-new-york-city-congestion-pricing-plans-indefinitely/5479563/" rel="">earlier this month</a><span>, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced that America’s first congestion pricing scheme would be “indefinitely paused”. The policy would have charged vehicles for entering the perpetually gridlocked streets of Lower Manhattan, using the money raised to then fund many of the city’s transit projects—and it was slated to officially begin operating less than 30 days from the announcement. In the short term, the flip-flop will be extremely costly for the city and state, but more broadly the cancellation and the dynamics that led up to it are emblematic of many of the problems holding back American cities &amp; infrastructure.</span></p><p><span>In one sense, the congestion pricing scheme is a radical new experiment in American transportation policy. Cars compete for scarce urban road space with more efficient modes of transportation like buses, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/12uoj82/good_thing_there_are_no_people_in_the_congestion/" rel="">emit large amounts of noxious chemicals and particulate matter from tailpipes and tires</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/auto-insurance/fatal-car-crash-statistics/" rel="">are the leading cause of death for Americans under 55</a><span>, and in large quantities become disruptively loud for workers and residents. Lower Manhattan is among the few places in America where substantial transit alternatives to driving exist, so a congestion tax should induce mode shifts away from cars and toward the subway—to the benefit of the local and global climate. Wealthier residents are more likely to drive and poorer residents more likely to take transit, so congestion pricing serves redistributive purposes as well. New York’s scheme promised to be a pioneering first for the nation, a pilot project that if successful could be copied in cities throughout the US.</span></p><p><span>Yet in another sense, the plan should be entirely unremarkable. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_Licensing_Scheme" rel="">Congestion pricing has existed in some form throughout cities across the world for 50 years</a><span>, and is fundamentally just a fancy version of the normal tolling systems that are common on bridges, tunnels, and other roadways. People who drove into Lower Manhattan were already “paying” for the privilege to do so, just with the time and gasoline lost to bumper-to-bumper traffic rather than in hard cash. As with any heavily overcrowded bridge or highway, mispricing was causing economic inefficiency—charging for entry would allow priority vehicles to get where they’re going faster, incentivize better use of existing roadways, and open up a funding stream that could be used to expand beyond current infrastructure constraints. Economists would recommend some form of congestion pricing just for the benefits to road users alone.

People were increasingly driving into the city and underutilizing transit infrastructure—thus congestion pricing, while initially envisioned for a pre-pandemic world, rapidly became a necessary part of plans for a post-COVID recovery. Taxing traffic, with all its negative externalities, was certainly much more politically palatable and economically beneficial than attempting to raise payroll taxes further, which would have strained New York’s already-slow post-COVID jobs recovery. Plus, the incidence of congestion taxes would also fall more on tourists and residents of New Jersey/Connecticut, helping to recapture some of the economic value lost to the suburbs as a result of remote work. The policy should have been an easy win for the city.</span></p><p><span>Yet just before implementation, congestion pricing was indefinitely paused at a press conference framed around inflation and cost of living concerns, highlighting how much the tax side of the scheme loomed large in voters’ minds. That makes sense for drivers from Bergen County in northern New Jersey, for whom the system was (financially) all cost and no benefit—they would pay to enter downtown, but the revenue collected would all go to transit investments outside their county, and their primary benefit would thus only be experiencing less traffic when driving through Manhattan. But Governor Hochul does not represent New Jerseyans, and for New Yorkers (</span><a href="https://urbanstats.org/comparison.html?longnames=%5B%22New+York%2C+USA%22%2C%22New+York+city%2C+New+York%2C+USA%22%5D" rel="">especially the 55% of city households who don’t own a car</a><span>), the tradeoff was supposed to be clearer—impose costs on a small subset of drivers to deliver benefits in the form of transit investments that would serve the majority of people. Those benefits, however, felt relatively small to many city and state residents.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png" width="1456" height="930" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:930,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:256463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cf95e54-3699-4d2a-bc7d-c4d3c1b06ff8_2886x1843.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>A lot of congestion-pricing criticism posits that the MTA already has “enough money” and just needs to spend it better.

The Governor is turning the MTA into a </span><a href="https://pedestrianobservations.com/2024/06/05/hochul-suspends-congestion-pricing/" rel="">nightmare customer and a horrible coworker here</a><span>, as the cancellation of congestion pricing jeopardizes key funding and matching federal dollars for a suite of construction projects at the 11th hour. </span><a href="https://x.com/DaveCoIon/status/1799257709935468869/photo/1" rel="">The MTA’s CFO was forced to announce that the agency will now need to “reorganize the [2020-2024 Capital] Program to prioritize the most basic and urgent needs” because it “cannot award contracts that do not have a committed, identified funding source.”</a><span> That means tens of billions of dollars in investments could be shelved, including Phase II of the Second Avenue Subway, the </span><a href="https://new.mta.info/project/penn-station-access" rel="">Metro-North Penn Station Access</a><span> expansions, a host of station upgrades, and much more. Contractors who work with the MTA on these projects already charge a premium for having to manage the substantial risk that construction is delayed or canceled—introducing “the Governor might suddenly decide your job is over” as another risk to worry about will just increase those cost premiums, thin the pool of companies who are capable of working with the MTA, and reward the politically savvy.</span></p><p>The fact that infrastructure plans can go through years of study, environmental review, public consultation, pilot projects, revisions, lawsuits, construction, delays, and more only to then be shelved days before final implementation is a large part of why public works are so expensive in the first place. The number of veto points for American infrastructure is extremely high—even one “no” across from any number of officials throughout construction can stop a project dead—and that veto power makes it easy to extract money and concessions from projects. Pick more costly construction methods to minimize surface disruption, reduce daily construction time to leave existing traffic unimpeded, move infrastructure to suboptimal locations to appease powerful voting constituencies, expand stations to meet interagency demands for back office space, and in the absolute worst cases just use discretionary powers to do quid-pro-quo corruption. Also, imagine if you were among the hundreds of state, local, and federal civil servants who worked on any part of the congestion pricing or MTA capital investment plans—would you want to remain at your job after having years of work tossed aside at the last minute? The hollowing out of institutional capacity within transportation agencies is a serious driver of cost problems, with planning becoming a bespoke project-by-project activity heavily dependent on expensive outside consultants rather than a regular in-house activity.</p><p><span>As a more practical matter, hundreds of millions were already (over)spent on congestion pricing between years of studies, protracted legal battles, construction of physical infrastructure, contracts for implementation, and much more—all that money is wasted by pulling the plug at the last possible second.

Pre-pandemic, it was normal for urban mass transit to receive only 6-9% of all state and local land transportation spending, and for bus and train passenger terminals to receive roughly another 3-5%. However, relative spending on both items has cratered post-COVID, with the share of construction spending going to mass transit falling to the lowest levels in a decade this year. Even when these investments are made, American cities struggle to make the best of new infrastructure.</p><p><span>Public transit is a network system that depends on scale to be successful—a two-line metro is more than twice as valuable as a 1-line metro, and a metro that goes between dense downtown neighborhoods is much more valuable than one that meanders through sprawly suburbs. A large part of why American transit infrastructure projects fail is because even when built they are placed in the middle of nowhere or are undercut by local governments that prevent the necessary complementary neighborhood housing and commercial developments.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In the past 12 months my body’s mobility and flexibility went from abysmal, a source of persistent pain impacting my quality of life, to pretty darn good. I’m not about to become a stretching influencer, but after a year of researching, trial and error, and hard work I feel back on track and like I have tools that will really serve me and my body for decades. I’m honestly grateful for the big wake up call and I thought I would I share the most important things I learned.</p>
<p>A year ago my 37 year old body was completely wrecked. It snuck up on me. In the pandemic I started seriously strength training for the first time. I spent two years lifting heavy 3-4 days per week and it worked. I gained 20 pounds of muscle. For the first time in my life I got really strong, bench pressing my bodyweight and deadlifting/squatting around 2x that.</p>
<p>But throughout this process, I completely utterly neglected my flexibility and mobility. Rock climbing and yoga have been main exercise for most of my adult life, but climbing gyms and yoga studios were closed or inaccessible for most of those 2 years. So I packed on layers and layers of new muscle fibers with virtually no mobility work.</p>
<p>On top of that, I had the most stressful two years of my life on both personal and professional fronts. I always thought the idea that “we hold stress in our {body part}” was woo woo nonsense. It isn’t. Persistent stress and tension has a real affect on our bodies.</p>
<p>The problem is the typical weight lifting session doesn’t require a ton of full body mobility. The barbell that stabilizes the weight, allowing you to exert the most force possible, also limits the range of motion you actually utilize at the gym.</p>
<p>Without my noticing it my mobility fell off a cliff. My shoulders were frozen stiff. I couldn’t raise my arms over my head, hold a basic down dog, or touch my hand to my back or shoulder blades at all. I couldn’t touch my toes or even sit on the floor comfortably. Every major muscle group was hard as a rock all the time, as if I was flexing it as hard as I could. My range of motion was laughable and everything was gobbed up with layers of fascia.</p>
<p>Then I started trying to use my body to do things again—rock climb, ski, bike, yoga, or just carry things up a 4th floor walk up—and my whole body imploded. First, <em>everything</em> felt unbelievably challenging because every single body movement felt like it was pulling against heavy resistance bands. Next, everything hurt all the time. I had persistent muscle soreness, tightness, and pain all the time. Then the last straw was the nerve pain. I started getting numbness in my fingers and periodic electric shocks of pain going up both my arms doing simple day to day things like opening a door or picking up a cooking pan.</p>
<p>It sucked. I felt like I was 90 years old, decrepit and in constant pain. It was seriously degrading my quality of life and I was willing to try anything and everything. So here’s what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li data-list-kind="bullet">I went for a massage 2x/week</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet">I bought a fancy Theragun massage tool</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet">I went to two different local physical therapists</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet">I started going to yoga 2x/week</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet">I start stretching and warming up before climbing workouts</li>
</ul>
<p>3 months of all of that did exactly <em>nothing</em> for my mobility issues.</p>
<p>Massages and percussive massage tools can provide some temporary relief but have no lasting effect.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it seems that most PTs have absolutely no idea how to systematically treat these kind of issues. Like a massage therapist, they would use a kind of scraping tool or some other treatment that would provide some relief, and tell me to do nerve glides, charge me $250, and tell me they’d see me next week. But the process didn’t seem to have much of a real methodology and each week felt like zero progress. My experience seems to be similar to that of many others dealing with similar issues.</p>
<p>Yoga and pre-workout stretching are fine for maintaining flexibility, but not barely effective at <em>creating</em> flexibility, especially when you are severely limited.</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The turning point</h2>
<p>As I have often done in my life when the conventional solutions to a problem are failing me, I turned to the Twitter community for help and also went deep down YouTube and other internet rabbit holes. And that’s how I learned that everything I thought I knew about stretching was wrong.</p>
<p>The turning point was when I got connected to and did a virtual consult with <a href="https://twitter.com/movebettersam" data-lasso-id="435">Sam Martin from Move Better Project</a> (huge thanks to Sam Segar for making that intro). Sam explained to me that the numbess and nerve pain was likely Thoracic Outlet Syndrome or something similar where my stiff gunked up inflexible muscles were compressing and trapping the median nerve that runs from the shoulder through the arm and down to the fingers.</p>
<p>Sam gave me a bunch of simple exercises to target each muscle group (including some hard to find ones). But he also gave me a radically better overall understanding of&nbsp;<em>how</em> stretching and mobility actually works. These fundamental ideas explained why none of the stuff I’d tried before had any real effect and laid the groundwork for me to effectively build an approach to my own mobility.</p>
<p>I realized that I was a bit of an extreme case. Interventions that worked for most people, felt like they barely made a dent in my issues. That’s when I discovered a number of great YouTube channels dedicated to mobility for power lifters and other beefcakes. These guys were preaching similar methods as Sam, but devising more intense variations that I needed to unlock by extremely laminated muscle fibers.</p>
<p>I’ll share some specific examples below, but here are the main ideas I learned that completely changed my approach to mobility.</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">What I learned</h2>
<p><strong>Hold stretches for 2 minutes (or more!). </strong>The kind of brief stretching you might do in a vinyasa yoga class poses or while warming up for a workout will have almost no effect on increasing your flexibility. To move the needle on your flexibility you need to be holding each position for <em>at least</em> two minutes, and sometimes more like 5+ minutes. Yes, this takes a long time. For several months while I was rebuilding my mobility I was spending 30-45 minutes almost every day on mobility.</p>
<p>These long holds, initially needing up to 5 minutes each, were the key to getting my shoulder mobility back into a good range.</p>
<p>The good news is that, at least in my experience, this only necessary when you’re trying to <em>increase </em>your mobility. Once you get things in a pretty good place, shorter regular stretching will do a good job of maintaining.</p>
<p><strong>Smash it, don’t rub it. </strong> Rubbing your muscles mainly just increases bloodflow, which is nice, but isn’t going to break up the years of fascia and adhesions or release chronically stiff muscles. You need to <em>smash</em> them instead.</p>
<ol>
<li data-list-kind="ordered">Create pressure in the meaty part of the muscle with something like a lacrosse ball. For me I usually have to move it around until I find a particularly stiff (and painful) spot to place it.</li>
<li data-list-kind="ordered">Once you find the spot, DON’T MOVE THE BALL AROUND. Keep it in that same spot and hold that pressure for ~2 minutes or until you feel like the muscle release. For me this can feel like a long time where nothing is happening except this ball is painfully jabbing into my muscles, and then out of nowhere the muscles just melt all at once. Stay in the same place until you feel that change happen.</li>
<li data-list-kind="ordered">To increase the intensity and get even more relief, keep the pressure point in the same place, but start moving the muscle or limbs around it through their normal range of motion while still holding the pressure point in the same place. To understand what i mean, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/9u8_6RdBdL8?feature=shared&amp;t=167" data-lasso-id="436">Sam in this tricep smash video</a> and how he moves his whole arm while keeping the ball in place.</li>
</ol>
<p>This smashing technique was the essential ingredient in finally releasing extreme tightness I developed in my pecs, from bench press-type exercises, and in my shoulder blades, from a severe muscle imbalance. More on that below.</p>
<p><strong>Train your nervous system, don’t just stretch. </strong>It’s easy to think of your muscles as just some kind of rubber band and flexibility is just a matter of mechanically stretching them out so they get looser. But that’s not how it works. Most of the time your body is already physically capable of achieving the position, but you need to train your nervous system that it’s safe for it to relax into that position. So it’s not very productive to just contort your body, grit your teeth and sweat for two minutes while trying to watch TV. You will definitely get some benefit from this, but the far better approach is to consciously focus on steady breathing and mindfully relaxing the muscles one by one.</p>
<p>This kind of mindful breath-focused stretching has been essential for my lower body hip and hamstring mobility in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent tightness is as much a strength issue as a flexibility one. </strong>If you’ve figured out how to smash a muscle and stretch it and it still keeps getting tight, it’s probably a strength imbalance issue. Other muscles around it may be overdeveloped and are essentially pulling it out of balance all the time. This will feel a little counter-productive, because strength training a muscle will often make it feel tighter in the short term. But over the long-term a combination of smashing, stretching, and strengthening is often the right balance.</p>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 2 []">Mobility tools that actually work</h2>
<p>I was in so much pain that I bought every mobility gizmo I could find. My home workout area looked like a medieval torture chamber. Most of those things are gathering dust now. Here is the short list of, mostly very cheap, mobility tools that actually work:</p>
<ul>
<li data-list-kind="bullet"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kieba-Massage-Lacrosse-Myofascial-Therapy/dp/B017V7UKW2/ref=sr_1_6?crid=20HJHQ65PYQZU&amp;keywords=lacrosse%20ball&amp;qid=1707073055&amp;sprefix=lacrosse%2Caps%2C280&amp;sr=8-6&amp;tag=tyletrin-20&amp;tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="457">Lacrosse ball</a>: this is your go to smashing tool.</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrival-Bullseye-Adjustable-Massage-Release/dp/B0B54373DG/ref=pd_ci_mcx_mh_mcx_views_0?pd_rd_w=BP8zC&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.225b4624-972d-4629-9040-f1bf9923dd95%3Aamzn1.symc.40e6a10e-cbc4-4fa5-81e3-4435ff64d03b&amp;pf_rd_p=225b4624-972d-4629-9040-f1bf9923dd95&amp;pf_rd_r=7PQJ3S2KRGNXND48GC3R&amp;pd_rd_wg=uPrY6&amp;pd_rd_r=b4aeff7b-b4f0-4eed-a220-1cf684f6303e&amp;pd_rd_i=B0B54373DG&amp;tag=tyletrin-20&amp;tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="458">Psoas tool</a>: This is the nuclear option for smashing. It’s designed to target deep muscles like the psoas but I also found it incredibly helpful for releasing muscles in my shoulders and back.</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WIKDAY-Resistance-Exercise-Stretching-Crossfit/dp/B08C7K77PS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3CENYXTSV4HDL&amp;keywords=resistance%20bands&amp;qid=1707073084&amp;sprefix=resistance%20ban%2Caps%2C277&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=tyletrin-20&amp;tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="459">Resistance bands</a>: I used these both for building strength to correct imbalances and as a way to stretch my shoulders. I’d get a pack like this one with a door anchor unless you have something at home to anchor them to.</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trideer-Eco-Friendly-Accessories-Stretching-Workouts/dp/B0B154V8LM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3JLWZIJIP6TER&amp;keywords=yoga%20blocks&amp;qid=1707073137&amp;sprefix=yoga%20blocks%2Caps%2C278&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=tyletrin-20&amp;tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="460">Yoga blocks</a>: Great for support getting into positions where your flexibility is very limited like a split. Can also be used to increase the intensity of a stretch.</li>
<li data-list-kind="bullet"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ActiveGear-Large-Yoga-Mat-Comfortable/dp/B08TFBSY6R/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=1NWPF645FE2V8&amp;keywords=large%20square%20yoga%20mat&amp;qid=1707073167&amp;sprefix=large%20squaryoga%20mat%2Caps%2C295&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=tyletrin-20&amp;tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="461">Giant yoga mat</a>: I found it really helpful to have a large surface area to move through the positions I needed and this over-sized yoga mat was perfect.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Recommended Internet Rabbit Holes</h2>
<p>Here are some of my favorite resources for learning more in general and finding specific suggestions for how to diagnose and target individual mobility issues.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Martin, Move Better Project (YouTube):</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MoveBetterProject/videos" data-lasso-id="437">Sam’s YouTube page</a> is filled with tons of great short videos for specific exercises. I also booked Sam for a virtual consultation which was one of the highest value things I did all year.</p>
<p><strong>Smashwerx (YouTube)</strong>: This was my favorite of the channels targeting more hardcore power lifters. In particular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tChmqOdSOas" data-lasso-id="462">this video</a>, involving dangling a kettlebell while you smash your pec into a bar, was the only thing I found that finally unglued my pec muscles.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Strength Side (YouTube)</strong>: This is a fantastic all around strength and fitness channel and they have a bunch of good mobility routines, <a href="https://youtu.be/W5LvKNElKH4" data-lasso-id="463">like this lower body one</a>, to easily incorporate into your day to day.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong>: My two favorite follows right now are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kruseelite" data-lasso-id="464">@kruseelite</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/twstraining/?hl=en" data-lasso-id="465">@twstraining</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, despite all these resources, I never found a video of anything that could release the tightness in my shoulder blade that I just could not get rid of. I discovered this nuclear option muscle release using the psoas tool. <a href="https://x.com/tylertringas/status/1754222793992925464?s=20" data-lasso-id="466">Watch the video here</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p><em>We would like to thank Voltage Park, Dell, H5, and NVIDIA for their invaluable partnership and help with setting up our cluster. A special thanks to Ozan, Melissa, Drew, Michael, and David at Voltage Park for their dedicated support throughout the project. Setting up a cluster of this size is an enormous challenge and we couldn’t have done it without them.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the span of a few months, with a small team of researchers and engineers, we trained a 70B parameter model from scratch on our own infrastructure that outperformed zero-shot GPT-4o on reasoning-related tasks.</p>
<p>Today, we’re sharing an end-to-end guide for setting up the required infrastructure: from bringing up the initial cluster and installing the OS, to automatically recovering from errors encountered during training. In each step, we detail the challenges we encountered and how we resolved them. Along with our learnings, we’re releasing many of the infrastructure scripts we developed to ensure healthy hosts, so that other teams can more easily create stable infrastructure for their own model training.</p>
<p>Along with our detailed process, we are releasing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imbue-ai/cluster-health/tree/master/health_checks">Host-level health checks</a>: scripts to ensure that a given host is free from known errors</li>
<li>An NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) patch that improves logging around errors and stalls</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imbue-ai/cluster-health/tree/master/gpu_stress_test">A stress test</a> to confirm that GPUs are able to allocate large tensors and perform standard operations</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imbue-ai/cluster-health/tree/master/host_validation">Networking tests</a> to check that the GPUs on a given machine are able to communicate with each other (via NVLink) and with GPUs on other machines (via InfiniBand)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/imbue-ai/cluster-health/tree/master/ufm_events">script which parses the Unified Fabric Manager (UFM) event log</a>, checks for relevant events, and determines which network ports should be disabled</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/imbue-ai/cluster-health/tree/master/ib_burn">script which generates a comprehensive burn-in workload for InfiniBand fabrics</a>, aiming to exercise every available link</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the process, members of our engineering team worked with our partners at Voltage Park to prepare the cluster for production use. The full process involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provisioning individual machines</li>
<li>Provisioning InfiniBand</li>
<li>Ensuring fully healthy machines</li>
<li>Diagnosing common training issues</li>
<li>Improving infrastructure tooling</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these steps is described in greater detail below.</p>
<h2 id="background-how-this-is-supposed-to-work">Background: How this is supposed to work</h2>
<p>The purpose of our compute was to enable rapid experimentation with large-scale language models. To do this, we needed a large number of fast GPUs that could communicate with each other at high speeds.</p>
<p>This post focuses on one cluster that had 4,092 H100 GPUs spread across 511 computers, with eight GPUs to a computer. There were 511 computers with GPUs because some connections needed to be reserved for the Unified Fabric Manager nodes, which managed the InfiniBand network. On the 511 hosts with GPUs, each GPU was directly connected to a ConnectX-7 card that could simultaneously transmit and receive at 400 Gbps to any other GPU on the InfiniBand network through its own ConnectX-7 card.</p>
<p>Our InfiniBand network topology was called “fully non-blocking” because every GPU could, in theory, simultaneously talk to another GPU at the maximum rate. This was enabled by a three-tier InfiniBand network architecture: the three levels of InfiniBand switches, when properly connected, enabled this high level of throughput over the entire network. See below for an overview of the InfiniBand network:</p>

<p>Note that the communication for training networks happened over InfiniBand, not over Ethernet. While the machines were also connected to an Ethernet network, that network was used to transfer datasets, checkpoints, and other data. It would have been far slower to send data over Ethernet because data would first travel from the GPU to the CPU, and then out one of the 100 Gbps Ethernet cards. While it would have been possible to train over Ethernet using a technique called <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MLNXOFEDv23070512/RDMA+over+Converged+Ethernet+(RoCE)">RDMA over Converged Ethernet</a> (RoCE), that would require a significant amount of additional work on both the hardware and software side, and would generally be less reliable than InfiniBand (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15627">this paper</a> that outlines the extensive process).</p>
<p>There was also a secondary Ethernet network used purely for configuration and management, enabling access to the controller interface for the basic input/output system (BIOS), power supplies, and other low level machine interfaces. Without this management network, we would have had to manually set up our nodes with a USB drive, keyboard, and monitor, which would not have been not a sustainable approach for hundreds of machines.</p>
<p>Using our cluster for high performance training meant that every component — InfiniBand, Ethernet, GPUs, and the nodes themselves — had to work near perfectly. If even a single one of the over 12,000 connections was a little flaky, it could slow down the entire training run.</p>
<p>The rest of this post details the process of actually getting to a point where everything works perfectly, and ensuring that it stays that way.</p>

<h2 id="provisioning-individual-machines">Provisioning individual machines</h2>
<p>After establishing an initial Ethernet connection to the cluster via the management network, we obtained access credentials to the baseboard management controller (BMC). The BMC is a specialized service processor that remotely monitors a host system and is typically wired to a separate network. It allowed us to interact with every machine as if we were physically present and provided additional APIs for hardware health, BIOS setting, and power management.</p>
<p>With these components in place, we rolled up our sleeves and began setting up the cluster.</p>
<h3 id="step-0-getting-one-machine-provisioned">Step 0: Getting one machine provisioned</h3>
<p>We first used iDRAC (Dell’s baseboard management controller) to install Ubuntu 22.04 on a single server, which would be used to set up everything else. Among other things, iDRAC allowed us to mount and boot off of an ISO image from a local computer, with a virtual console provided in the browser. This would ideally be the only manual installation in this process.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-installing-an-os-on-every-machine">Step 1: Installing an OS on every machine</h3>
<p>With patient zero taken care of, we proceeded to install Ubuntu’s Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS) software to help provision the remaining servers. With the Preboot eXecution Environment protocol (PXE) booting and automated iDRAC tools, we instructed every machine to boot off the network and configured MAAS to respond to the PXE boot requests. When performing the initial network boot, servers received an IP from MAAS via a dynamic IP allocation protocol (DHCP) and an initial kernel without needing to have anything installed on the local drives. This bare-bones environment was automatically used to perform a persistent OS installation. In theory, we would wait for the first boot, and everything would be taken care of. In practice, however, the MAAS integration with BMC was not reliable, so we used the iDRAC API to collect the MAC address (a unique physical hardware identifier) for every machine in advance.</p>
<p>Throughout the training process, MAAS was a generally reliable component of the stack. However, we experienced some hiccups at the beginning that were fairly specific to our setup. For instance, during the first few provisions, the clocks were so far off that HTTPS certificate validation issues prevented anything from being installed via apt. Relatedly, because the MAAS server had to take care of so many responsibilities (DHCP server, DNS server for hostname to IP resolution, HTTP proxy between hosts and official Ubuntu package servers, NTP server, cloud-init configuration management, and ground truth database for connecting MAC addresses to IPs to hostnames to custom metadata), we had difficulty tracking issues to the root cause component. Adding to this was the learning curve around the MAAS provisioning lifecycle, as it was designed to handle the complexity of managing greenfield deployments as well as gradual migration of nodes and various debugging/unhealthy intermediate states.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-diagnosing-broken-machines">Step 2: Diagnosing broken machines</h3>
<p>As is typical in setting up large GPU clusters, we found that about 10% of the machines failed to boot, mostly due to physical issues with the servers. Some issues we encountered included: unconnected or miswired Ethernet cables, hardware issues in iDRAC, broken power supply units, bad NVME (nonvolatile memory express) drives, missing internal wires, and network cards or GPUs failing to show up. We automated checks for these issues, passed some machines back to Dell for re-testing, and filed appropriate tickets for the data center staff. An advantage of taking the cluster setup into our own hands was that we were immediately able to put the healthy machines to use while awaiting maintenance on the others.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-minimal-viable-observable-metal">Step 3: Minimal <del>viable</del> observable metal</h3>
<p>We proceeded to set up the following on every server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Docker (for more easily running services and training jobs)</li>
<li>Data center GPU drivers</li>
<li>Prometheus node exporter (for exporting a steady stream of hardware / OS metric)</li>
<li>DCGM exporter (additional metrics from NVIDIA for GPU state / clocks / utilization)</li>
<li>RAIDZ ZFS pool on all the non-OS drives (this enables machines to survive one drive being down, and also gives transparent compression for free, which is particularly helpful for plain-text datasets and repetitive logs, routinely enabling us to use about 10 times more space than we would have otherwise been able to)</li>
</ol>
<p>We then ran basic GPU diagnostics to determine whether the GPUs were mostly functional — those that weren’t would typically experience hardware issues within a couple hours.</p>
<p>During this time we ran into some bandwidth bottlenecks when we tried to install software packages across all 400 nodes in parallel. This was also the first time we started to receive heat alerts for high temperatures on various components in the data center deployment. This first batch of heat issues was mostly remediated via firmware updates.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-single-node-gpu-training">Step 4: Single-node GPU training</h3>
<p>The next step was ensuring that every machine could handle real GPU workloads in isolation. Many couldn’t, due to a number of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPU-related errors, which were mostly fixed by reseating the cards in their slots: physically sliding out the 200-pound server from the rack, removing all the cables in between the cover and the GPUs, then taking the GPUs out and putting them in again before replacing all the cables and reracking the server.</li>
<li>A number of the wires between the GPUs and the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) buses or network cards reported <em>“limited width: x4 &lt; x16”</em> according to Ubuntu server logs. After updating the PCIe switch bus firmware, we found that the internal PCIe cables needed to be reseated for around a quarter of the hosts in the cluster — presumably because the rather fragile cables were situated between the casing and the GPUs, which meant that they would be jostled or unplugged any time anyone wanted to do maintenance on the GPUs.</li>
<li>A number of miscellaneous failures affected single-digit hosts. Dell helped us fix these via firmware upgrades:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>NVMe drives didn’t show up as faulty, but locked up the entire machine when touched.</li>
<li>Hard drives showing up in random order under Linux, which confused MAAS and caused the OS to get installed on the wrong drive.</li>
<li>Wrong temperature readings, which caused fans to spin up to 100% all the time. This was caused in part by having a bad NVIDIA driver, which we resolved by downgrading to the previous driver version.</li>
<li>Dynamic frequency scaling for CPUs going haywire, limiting to 2 GHz on the active cores.</li>
<li>Direct GPU-GPU communication (GDR, or GPUDirect RDMA Peer Memory Client) was impossible to apply successfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="provisioning-infiniband">Provisioning InfiniBand</h2>
<h3 id="step-0-installing-the-ufm">Step 0: Installing the UFM</h3>
<p>One advantage of InfiniBand was its centralized design, as it has one brain for the entire network. Therefore, we only had to deal with one entity for the 320 network switches in the fabric. Our first task was to figure out which switch connected to which machines, then to correlate that with the wiring diagram and rename the switches by their physical location.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-time-for-rewiring">Step 1: Time for rewiring</h3>
<p>Initially, the UFM couldn’t detect the 320 network switches, let alone all of the hosts expected to be present on the fabric. After conferring with our data center partners, we confirmed that the switches were powered on and wired in, yet remained undetectable. Upon examining the network wiring list, we noticed that the top level of the fabric was misdesigned: instead of a single unified fabric, we had eight disjointed networks with no common routing paths. After rewiring the connections, we added checks to verify that all the physical connections lined up with the new design.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-ten-thousand-temperature-alerts">Step 2: Ten thousand temperature alerts</h3>
<p>After resolving the physical wiring issues, the UFM successfully established contact with all InfiniBand switches in the fabric. However, almost every switch port began reporting excessively high temperatures, sometimes exceeding 70 degrees Celsius, even though they weren’t transmitting data yet. We discovered that the issue stemmed from open spaces between switches in the same networking racks, which caused hot air to recirculate back to the front. Our data center partners helped us diagnose the issue quickly and develop a suitable workaround.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-eighteen-hundred-alerts">Step 3: Eighteen hundred alerts</h3>
<p>Many ports also exhibited high error rates or fluctuated between working and broken states, known as “flapping.” These issues only surfaced when the ports were actively used, so preemptive detection proved challenging, as the entire fabric consisted of 10,000 links with a high degree of redundancy. Our data center partners helped clean and reseat alerting ports, and we disabled the remaining alerting transceivers while waiting for replacements.</p>
<p>Although InfiniBand is highly resilient to hardware failures, once about 10% of the fabric began experiencing issues, features like adaptive routing couldn’t function reliably enough to work around haphazardly dropping links.</p>
<p>During this period, we managed to conduct multi-node training runs with 100 to 200 machines. Our process was largely improvised: we sometimes launched on a random set of nodes, observed their performance, and tried to stay running on as many of those nodes as possible. This approach allowed us to find a reliable subset of the InfiniBand fabric, but proved tricky because every time we would change the set of nodes used for training, the default set of InfiniBand links would change.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-burn-infiniband-burn-disco-inferno">Step 4: Burn InfiniBand burn, disco inferno</h3>
<p>To diagnose InfiniBand issues more efficiently, we devised a specialized workload for the entire cluster that focused on simultaneously pushing as much data as possible through every port on the entire fabric. This was not the same as running one large all-reduce workload across the cluster, which would utilize NCCL to optimize communication within individual nodes by having GPUs communicate using NVLink via Server PCIe Module (SXM) sockets.</p>
<p>Instead, we opted for a brute force approach, and succeeded handily. The UFM began sending alerts about data transmission exceeding 97% of the theoretical capacity through most ports, and some switches temporarily crashed. Every port left standing at the end of the day was deemed robust enough to proceed, and the rest were disabled or handed off for later repair.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-gpudirect-rdma">Step 5: GPUDirect RDMA</h3>
<p>For the GPUs to communicate without incurring CPU overhead, we enabled a feature called GPUDirect RDMA, which allowed direct communication with the InfiniBand network cards. This involved two key steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/535.183.01/README/nvidia-peermem.html">Enabling an extra kernel module</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/archives/nccl_2114/user-guide/docs/troubleshooting.html#pci-access-control-services-acs">Ensuring PCIe Access Control Service (ACS) was disabled to prevent immediate hangs</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-6-grow-the-golden-set-of-servers">Step 6: Grow the golden set of servers</h3>
<p>A rule of thumb for GPU clusters using the newest hardware: expect about 3% of machines to break every week.</p>
<p>There is a crucial nuance that often gets lost, however: it’s not that every machine has a uniform 3% chance of failing; rather, a small number of malcontent machines repeatedly break in different ways until they’re properly fixed. This highlighted the advantage of having a large number of machines on the same fabric. Instead of playing whack-a-mole on our large training run with random machines, we could instead focus on growing a set of known reliable, or “golden,” machines.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-maintenance">Step 7: Maintenance</h3>
<p>InfiniBand maintenance mostly involved responding to UFM alerts, swapping failing cables and transceivers, and occasionally diagnosing more difficult errors, such as faulty switches. Large scale regressions were usually caused by two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firmware upgrades, especially if applied to only half of the cluster, which could corrupt the UFM state and necessitate UFM restarts on all of the InfiniBand switches.</li>
<li>Mass restarts of GPU boxes at the same time, which could flood the UFM state with updates and similarly necessitate a UFM service restart.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ensuring-fully-healthy-machines">Ensuring fully healthy machines</h2>
<p>Throughout this process, we discovered numerous ways individual machines could fail or slow down training runs. Many of these failure modes were not immediately obvious, so we wrote a number of health checks to determine which hosts were healthy enough to use for training. We have released the code for these <a href="https://github.com/imbue-ai/cluster-health">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that many of these health checks are specific to our runtime environments, are not necessarily related to the base hardware, or are extremely trivial to fix or automate. This is by design: for the overall goal of making our machines ready for training, we wanted a single entrypoint that would answer <em>“yes”</em> or <em>“no,”</em> and would abstract over any number of “trivial” details.</p>
<h3 id="gpu-health-check">GPU Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that we had the correct number of GPUs, that ECC (error correction code) checking was enabled, and that there were no ECC errors. We also checked that the NVLink topology, which connects the GPUs to each other, was up and error-free.</p>
<h3 id="disk-space-health-check">Disk Space Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that hosts had no more than 95% disk space utilization.</p>
<h3 id="docker-health-check">Docker Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that Docker was able to run a container with GPUs attached (i.e. NVIDIA Container Runtime was working properly), and that all Docker containers relevant for monitoring/profiling were active and given the correct host permissions.</p>
<h3 id="dmesg-health-check">Dmesg Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that there were no hardware Xids or SXid errors (faults thrown by the NVIDIA GPUs or inter-GPU NVIDIA switches) in dmesg. We also read out all dmesg log lines to verify that they were all categorizable in a list of <em>“usual/expected log lines”</em>.</p>
<h3 id="idrac-health-check">iDRAC Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked for iDRAC errors on the machine, ignoring non-fatal error messages. This is specific to our Dell machines and is not part of the health checks that we are open sourcing.</p>
<h3 id="disk-health-check">Disk Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that zpool was mounted, Docker was connected to it properly, and that it could actually be touched without the CPU locking up.</p>
<h3 id="infiniband-health-check">InfiniBand Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked for the presence of increased InfiniBand error rates and/or outdated driver firmware.</p>
<h3 id="nvlink-health-check">Nvlink Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked for NVLink errors on the machine. Empirically, this didn’t seem to result in training failures, but it may result in slowdowns.</p>
<h3 id="gdr-health-check">GDR Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that GDR was enabled on the machine.</p>
<h3 id="vbios-health-check">VBIOS Health Check</h3>
<p>We checked that the VBIOS version of the GPUs, as well as the H100 baseboard firmware were up to date.</p>
<h3 id="flint-health-check">Flint Health Check</h3>
<p>We used flint and <code>hca_self_test</code> to check that we have the right version of the Mellanox OFED driver, card firmware, and transceiver firmware, and that they were compiled correctly against the NVIDIA drivers.</p>
<h3 id="psb-health-check">PSB Health Check</h3>
<p>We queried PCIe devices to check that the speed and width of connections is what we expected between the GPUs, the PSB (PCIe Switch Bus), and the network cards. We also checked that the switch firmware was on the current version. This script was developed by Dell and not Imbue, so we are currently unable to share it.</p>
<p>In addition to these quick health checks, we also had a couple of more involved health checks that included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializing a matrix computation via PyTorch and measuring the NVLink bandwidth and GPU computation speed and memory. We set the proper GDR flags to test both InfiniBand and NVLink.</li>
<li>Using <code>ib_write_bw</code> with <code>–use_cuda</code> to send data over the IB cards and measure the PCIe and InfiniBand card bandwidth. We ran this for a longer period (~15 mins) to ensure we caught flappy InfiniBand links.</li>
<li>Running a multinode diagnostic run to check NCCL initialization ability and whether it would randomly stall. If it stalled, our forked NCCL code added additional logging. This could take 12 to 24 hours to detect issues, so we typically only ran this for new nodes, or when we suspected an issue.</li>
<li>Checking the DCGM exports for any GPU clock throttle events (excluding the expected <code>gpu_idle</code> and <code>power_cap</code>). Multinode training that exercised all GPUs, InfiniBand cards, and CPU and disk simultaneously was the best way to exercise these power events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diagnosing-common-training-issues">Diagnosing common training issues</h2>
<p>Once the hardware began working properly, it was time to begin training.</p>
<p>In this section, we share some concrete debugging steps and insights revealed through our experience running large language model training jobs on our cluster.</p>
<h3 id="crashing-on-startup">Crashing on startup</h3>
<p>In some ways, this was the best error to encounter, because it would (theoretically) be easy to reproduce and iterate on.</p>
<p>We first checked whether we were running our code on the correct version, configurations, and environment variables. While basic, we found that it was critical to ensure that launching training was reproducible and easily inspectable, especially since intermediate abstractions like Docker image caching or opaque secrets configurations could muddy the waters.</p>
<p>Another basic check conducted was ensuring all our machines were online, and that the emitted stack traces or logs could be easily aggregated and inspected. We used a Loki, Prometheus, and Grafana stack, but any suitable log aggregation or tracing SaaS would be appropriate. Due to the synchronous, distributed nature of these runs, often the first error to trigger would cause a cascade of unrelated errors. Here, health checks also helped instantly detect obvious issues such as broken hard drives or missing or invalid GPUs.</p>
<p>We built a system to automatically relaunch on failure, which made log and error aggregation even more important to avoid mixing up errors from different relaunches. Some common errors we encountered included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Errors like <code>Forward order differs across ranks: rank 0 is all-gathering 43 parameters while rank 1228 is all-gathering 1 parameters</code>. We found that this was a quirk of PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) implementation that could be resolved by a relaunch.</li>
<li>GPU Out of Memory (OOM) Errors, that looked like <code>CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate …</code> We fixed these by by double-checking our configurations and code, and backing out any recent code changes that might have caused extra utilization of GPU#0 due to improper PyTorch device specification during startup.</li>
<li>CPU/RAM OOM Errors, which were less easily spotted from error logs, and were typically best detected via dmesg logs from the host outside Docker containers. We saw them mostly as <code>CalledProcessError</code> or <code>ConnectionError</code>, when a forked process or network peer was reaped by OOM Killer invocation. We preferred to just fail health checks and restart the box when an OOM Killer invocation was detected from dmesg. We also checked our code path had a sufficient amount of manual garbage collection (see below sections on how to disable it), and wasn’t accidentally trying to do computations or move tensors on to the CPU.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="crashing-in-the-middle-of-training">Crashing in the middle of training</h3>
<p>The first order of business was to automate systems that would rerun all diagnostic health checks (see previous sections), then auto-restart the run without unhealthy hosts. We encountered a few random hardware faults, including Xid and SXid errors which could crash the run without emitting meaningful Python stack traces. Some instances, like row remapping, were recoverable by a restart. Others, like uncorrectable ECC errors, often needed hardware maintenance or replacement parts.</p>
<p>In addition, we observed crashes caused by particularly malformed training data. For instance, a very large single document in the corpus could cause OOM errors in either the GPU or CPU. To prevent these, we had a fully deterministic data loader, which made every crash easily reproducible via correlation with the epoch or step number. We found it helpful to disable dataloading or substitute fake data (such as all zeroes) to confirm whether the data was truly the root cause.</p>
<p>Finally, it was also helpful to record network and general node health statistics via any preferred method of metrics aggregation. Issues like Ethernet briefly cutting out or running out of disk space may not show up as helpful error messages, but could be easily correlated with collected data.</p>
<h3 id="hanging-with-no-stacktrace-information-possibly-followed-by-a-timeout">Hanging with no stacktrace information (possibly followed by a timeout)</h3>
<p>These types of errors were extremely frustrating to debug, due to the lack of helpful information and the fact that they were often difficult to reliably reproduce.</p>
<p>The most memorable type was characterized by error messages like</p>
<p><code>Watchdog caught collective operation timeout: WorkNCCL(SeqNum=408951, OpType=_ALLGATHER_BASE, … , Timeout(ms)=600000) ran for 600351 milliseconds before timing out</code></p>
<p>simultaneously appearing across all GPU workers in the training run.</p>
<p>What this meant was that one or more of the hosts failed to complete a NCCL operation, or even crashed out of the NCCL and InfiniBand connection, causing all other hosts to block synchronously on the particular tensor op until the <code>NCCL_TIMEOUT</code> was reached. Unfortunately, the nature of the NCCL library made it incredibly difficult to find which particular host(s) was the culprit.</p>
<p>We made some logging changes to the NCCL library (see our fork <a href="https://github.com/boweiliu/nccl">here</a>) to better surface which messages or operations were in-flight when the crash happened, and thereby identify which was the host or GPU that seemed to prevent the runs.</p>
<p>Note that in order to identify misbehaving hosts, we often needed to figure out which hosts did not produce certain log messages. The lack of such messages indicated that the workers on that host were stragglers or had crashed.</p>
<p>Other instances of unresponsiveness without helpful error messages could typically be associated with hardware-related issues, such as the aforementioned Xid/SXid/ECC errors causing the NVIDIA driver or NVIDIA docker communication driver to lock up. To distinguish the NCCL hangs from driver hangs and from a race condition or deadlock in Python code, we used tools including Py-Spy and GNU Project Debugger (GDB) to live-debug stalled processes wherever we encountered them. Using this method, we were able to catch one particular issue where, due to a misconfiguration in the Python threading settings, we were unable to launch the eight multi-threaded NCCL GPU processes properly on certain hosts which hit a race condition during pre-PyTorch initialization code.</p>
<h3 id="training-slowdowns-as-measured-by-mfu">Training slowdowns (as measured by MFU)</h3>
<p>Lack of instrumentation could make these types of issues even more frustrating than the previous category. In addition to breaking out Py-Spy, stack trace inspection, and GDB, we also spun up NVIDIA Nsight and profiling tools to help, some of which were difficult to work with in a highly distributed setup.</p>
<p>Sadly, generic slowdowns or lower-than-previously-demonstrated model flops utilization (MFU) could be caused by a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it proved helpful to double-check configurations, code, and environment variables. We experienced running the wrong model, the wrong batch size, the wrong UFM or NCCL settings, the wrong <code>CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS</code>, which all caused suboptimal performance.</p>
<p>We also found it useful to measure instantaneous (i.e. per-batch) MFU rather than a smoothed or windowed average, as the pre-smoothed shape of the MFU curve often helped us diagnose the class of issue. Issues included:</p>
<h4 id="training-immediately-started-off-at-extremely-low-mfu-less-than-110th-of-expected-and-remained-stable">Training immediately started off at extremely low MFU (less than 1/10th of expected) and remained stable</h4>
<p>This was most often a hardware issue with the InfiniBand networking, such as a dead switch at the T2 or T3 layer. It could also be caused by hardware issues between the GPU and the NIC, showing up in dmesg as <code>PCIe x16 lanes limited by …</code></p>
<h4 id="training-immediately-started-off-at-30-of-expected-mfu-and-remained-stable">Training immediately started off at 30% of expected MFU and remained stable</h4>
<p>This could be caused by one host with improperly set GDR (NVIDIA Peer Memory), or incorrect GDR environment variables.</p>
<h4 id="training-immediately-started-off-at-60-80-of-expected-mfu-and-remained-stable">Training immediately started off at ~60-80% of expected MFU and remained stable</h4>
<p>Most commonly, this was caused by degraded or faulty InfiniBand links, especially if a single particular GPU had a faulty associated InfiniBand NIC, causing NCCL to try to route the traffic over local NVLink and use the NIC on another GPU on the same host. It could also be caused by CPU throttling, which required tweaking some BIOS settings for particular hosts.</p>
<h4 id="sudden-drastic-dips-by-10x-for-single-batches-that-occurred-regularly">Sudden drastic dips (by 10x) for single batches that occurred regularly</h4>
<p>This was almost certainly related to checkpointing or evaluations — verifiable by checking against epoch or step counts. Annoyingly, this causes many false positives if automated alerting is set just to trigger off of MFU anomalies.</p>
<h4 id="sudden-drastic-dips-by-10x-for-single-batches-that-occurred-randomly-and-rather-rarely-on-the-order-of-every-15-minutes-and-achieved-full-recovery-to-good-mfu-immediately-afterward">Sudden drastic dips (by 10x) for single batches that occurred randomly and rather rarely (on the order of every 15 minutes), and achieved full recovery to good MFU immediately afterward</h4>
<p>This seemed to be most commonly caused by other CPU-heavy workloads scheduled on one of the hosts in the run. Rather than build profiling tooling to identify the particular host, we found it easier to crudely monitor CPU usage by PID. This could also be attributable to sporadically poor networking, such as dataloader bottlenecks. We used metrics monitoring and added Python code timing logs for the dataloading, checkpoints, and any non-NCCL code, which proved quite reliable.</p>
<h4 id="mfu-graph-gradually-sagged-downward-over-the-course-of-a-run-but-returned-to-100-upon-any-restart">MFU graph gradually sagged downward over the course of a run, but returned to 100% upon any restart</h4>
<p>Theoretically, this would be caused by heat accumulation on the switches, but we never saw that. Instead, we used Python and NVIDIA profilers to determine that the degradation seemed to be the result of automatic garbage collection.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://imbue.com/70b-blog/windowed-mfu.png" alt=""></p></div>
<p>While debugging these slowdowns, we noticed a pattern of periodic dips in throughput that almost appeared deterministic. As the training run progressed, the dips impacted a progressively larger percentage of distributed operations. This led to a hypothesis that the dips could be related to automatic garbage collection, which we validated by profiling and testing. Once we disabled automatic garbage collection and scheduled garbage collection to occur at specific intervals across all hosts, these throughput “sags” disappeared.</p>
<p>We used a synchronous distributed training algorithm, FSDP, which is based on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/zero-deepspeed-new-system-optimizations-enable-training-models-with-over-100-billion-parameters/">ZeRO-3</a>. During a blocking operation, a single worker process running garbage collection could slow down every other worker. With hundreds of worker processes, this could result in significant slowdowns.</p>
<h4 id="good-performance-in-the-beginning-then-sudden-dips-to-70-of-expected-that-persisted-at-high-frequency-every-15-seconds">Good performance in the beginning, then sudden dips (to 70% of expected) that persisted at high frequency (every 15 seconds)</h4>
<p>We observed this was correlated with NVIDIA GPU “clock throttle reasons,” which we collected via applying the proper settings to NVIDIA DCGM. Heat issues (GPU temperatures or broken/degraded host cooling fans) or power supply failures caused this. Also, some of our hosts with specific power supply hardware had voltage problems when we maxed out all 8 GPU utilization and 8x NIC InfiniBand utilization and CPU/RAM/disk at the same time, but only when all were being used — typically only during an actual training run.</p>
<h4 id="good-performance-but-a-bit-noisier-than-usual-high-frequency-white-noise-variance-between-90-and-100-of-expected-mfu">Good performance but a bit “noisier” than usual (high-frequency white noise variance between 90% and 100% of expected MFU)</h4>
<p>This was also InfiniBand hardware related, but typically due to moderately degraded or flapping links higher up in the network rather than at the less redundant host to T2 layer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these issues are not easily pinnable to a particular host, and the InfiniBand-related issues were especially hard to nail down because of the topology-aware nature of the InfiniBand switch technology. InfiniBand seemed to prefer adjacent hosts in the InfiniBand fat-tree design, and the UFM could route packets in ways that would result in asymmetric link speeds.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary/flowchart/sanity checklist for debugging throughput regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did it ever work?</li>
<li>Did you change something recently (e.g. merged code, updated drivers)?</li>
<li>Are you running on healthy hosts? Are all your dependent services running, including third party SaaS, e.g. Docker Hub, GitHub, or whatever else your stack depends on?</li>
<li>Are you sure you ran with the exact same code, environment, configurations, versions, host list, rank order, random seed as the last time (if possible)?</li>
<li>Is it reproducible?</li>
<li>Is it correlated with anything else? Other processes? Daily crontab? Host or DCGM or UFM metrics?</li>
<li>Are your tools to measure metrics correct?</li>
<li>Does the issue still occur when running reduced code (smaller model, faked data, no checkpoint saving or loading)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon completing the above steps, one can achieve good performance when training a model…at least until something inevitably breaks.</p>
<p>In this section, we cover a few different tools and systems that we made to ensure that training continued running smoothly, ideally with a minimal amount of human intervention. Because we are a small team, we simply didn’t have enough people to constantly make manual repairs, so we attempted to automate as much of the process as possible.</p>
<p>Almost all of our training run problems could be pinpointed to faulty machines or network components. These failures occur frequently in a large cluster, so it was essential to automate the process of disabling faulty machines and network components and requesting repairs.</p>
<h3 id="faulty-machines">Faulty machines</h3>
<p>We developed a system for automatically relaunching crashed runs from the most recent checkpoint. The relaunch process would begin by running our health checks on every available machine and classifying each machine’s health based on which health checks it passes; it would then attempt to relaunch the training job on the healthiest machines.</p>
<h3 id="faulty-network-components">Faulty network components</h3>
<p>All the network component failures we observed were detected by the UFM and registered in the UFM event log, so responding to network component failures was just a matter of parsing the UFM log and taking the appropriate action for each event.</p>
<p>The UFM events system is quite complicated, containing dozens of event types. In practice, however, we found that only a handful of events were problematic, mostly related to links going down or high symbol error counts. After identifying these events, we were able to write scripts to parse the UFM event log, disable links and ports implicated in recent events, file maintenance tickets on those network components, and re-enable those components once maintenance was finished.</p>
<h3 id="local-mirror-file-system">Local mirror file system</h3>
<p>It became obvious early on that one of the bottlenecks to large distributed training runs would be Ethernet speed into and out of the cluster. A shared Ethernet connection with a bandwidth of about 10Gbit/s would quickly become saturated if hundreds of workers tried to download datasets and model checkpoints simultaneously.</p>
<p>As a result, we decided to build a local file system within our cluster to mirror cloud storage and essentially serve as a cache to reduce the number of files we needed to fetch from S3. To deal with cluster churn (machines would often be disabled or swapped out for maintenance reasons) we did three-fold replication of each file, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">consistent hashing</a> to distribute load evenly in a way that minimized file movements during churn. Limited disk space on the cluster meant that we also had to develop various tools for keeping track of file lifecycles and clearing out files that were no longer relevant.</p>
<h3 id="local-distributed-docker-registry">Local distributed Docker registry</h3>
<p>We also made use of <a href="https://github.com/uber/kraken">Kraken</a>, a fantastic open source software to enable peer-to-peer transfer of Docker images. We had almost no issues with it, which was a bit surprising given the complexity of both the task and the implementation.</p>
<h3 id="various-performance-monitoring-tools">Various performance-monitoring tools</h3>
<p>We set up the default Torch profiler as well as NVIDIA’s Nsight Systems. The latter was helpful for understanding exactly how long forward/backward passes and NCCL communications take, and in determining if we were bottlenecked by communications or compute for a given model size and worker count. However, Nsight Systems was somewhat difficult to use, because it required running Docker in privileged mode, disabling security checks related to performance monitoring events, and because saving out the profiles often required stopping the entire training process.</p>
<p>In addition, we found it helpful to write tools to detect slow training batches and understand potential causes of slowness. The most useful of these was a tool which monitored how long each batch took and dumped the stack trace of every worker when a batch was unusually slow - this made it easier to identify specific hosts with subtle hardware or software issues.</p>
<h3 id="subdividing-machine-groups-to-pinpoint-faulty-hosts">Subdividing machine groups to pinpoint faulty hosts</h3>
<p>During our first few months using the cluster (when our health checks were not as thorough as they are now), we often ran into a situation where a training run on a specific set of machines was failing but it wasn’t clear which machine was at fault. To pinpoint faulty hosts, we developed tools to make it easy to partition the set of machines into subsets and launch a smaller job on each subset of machines.</p>
<p>For instance, if a job on a group of 48 machines was failing, we would launch smaller runs on six groups of eight machines, and then launch smaller runs on eight groups of six machines. It would often be the case that only a single run would fail on each of these two stages, allowing us to conclude with high confidence that the machine which was part of faulty runs in both stages was problematic.</p>
<h2 id="reflections-and-learnings">Reflections and learnings</h2>
<p>Over the course of setting up and maintaining our infrastructure, we gleaned a few useful learnings on the overall process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Being able to swap out machines for each other is extremely useful.</strong> For any given training run we found it helpful to have 10-20% more machines than necessary for the run, so that we could easily relaunch in case of machine failures. Setting up the cluster networking in such a way that every machine is closely connected with every other machine meant that we could essentially use any working subset of the machines.</li>
<li><strong>It’s worth writing tests and automated solutions for every kind of hardware or software failure you experience</strong>, since every issue encountered during training will reoccur. Similarly, for every opaque error message, it’s worthwhile to write tools to make the error more interpretable.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility is the key to good science.</strong> One rule we quickly adopted is “change only one thing at a time,” even for the simplest things.</li>
<li><strong>Trust, but verify.</strong> Whenever we introduced an external tool to the process or onboarded a new person, either externally or internally, we made sure to double-check their claims, especially if subsequent steps depended on those results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Training large language models requires complex infrastructure to even get started. We chose to be heavily involved in the details of the infrastructure set-up both because we believe it is important to fully understand the systems we work with, and because we suspected that it would ultimately prove more efficient. Now, having gone through the full process, we’re very glad we took this approach — it ended up being critical to have full control over our infrastructure and to be able to easily debug problems at every level of abstraction.
While this process required extensive supervision and iteration, it allowed us to deeply understand the underlying procedures, build a series of tools to ensure healthy hosts, learn how to automate systems to ensure continual smooth training, and ultimately create infrastructure that has allowed us to rapidly iterate on the training of cutting edge language models.</p>
<p>This infrastructure process exemplifies our approach to researching and building a robust foundation for AI agents: probing the nitty-gritty details, continually improving upon existing processes, and building useful tools and systems that enable our scrappy team to tackle larger challenges.</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 200 people have been charged in a sweeping nationwide crackdown on health care fraud schemes with false claims topping $2.7 billion, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice">the Justice Department</a></span> said on Thursday. </p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/merrick-garland">Attorney General Merrick Garland</a></span> announced the charges against doctors, nurse practitioners and others across the U.S. accused of a variety of scams, including a $900 million scheme in Arizona targeting dying patients. </p><p>“It does not matter if you are a trafficker in a drug cartel or a corporate executive or medical professional employed by a health care company,” Garland told reporters. “If you profit from the unlawful distribution of controlled substances, you will be held accountable.” </p><p>In the Arizona case, prosecutors have accused two owners of wound care companies of accepting more than $330 million in kickbacks as part of a scheme to fraudulently bill Medicare for amniotic wound grafts, which are dressings to help heal wounds. </p>
    

<p>Nurse practitioners were pressured to apply the wound grafts to elderly patients who didn’t need them, including people in hospice care, the Justice Department said. Some patients died the day they received the grafts or within days, court papers say. </p>



<p>In less than two years, more than $900 million in bogus claims were submitted to Medicare for grafts that were used on fewer than 500 patients, prosecutors said. </p><p>The owners of the wound care companies, Alexandra Gehrke and Jeffrey King, were arrested this month at the Phoenix airport as they were boarding a flight to London, according to court papers urging a judge to keep them behind bars while they await trial. An attorney for Gehrke declined to comment, and a lawyer for King didn’t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press.</p>
    
<p>Authorities allege Gehrke and King, who got married this year, knew charges were coming and had been preparing to flee. At their home, authorities found a book titled “How To Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish Without a Trace,” according to court papers. In one of their bags packed for their flight, there was a book titled “Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive The System,” the papers say.</p>
    

<p>Gehrke and King lived lavishly off the scheme, prosecutors allege, citing luxury cars, a nearly $6 million home and more than $520,000 in gold bars, coins and jewelry. Officials seized more than $52 million from Gehrke’s personal and business bank accounts after her arrest, prosecutors say. </p><p>In total, 193 people — including 76 doctors, nurse practitioners, and other licensed medical professionals — were charged in a series of separate cases brought over about two weeks in the nationwide health care fraud sweep. Authorities seized more than $230 million in cash, luxury cars and other assets. The Justice Department carries out these sweeping health care fraud efforts periodically to help deter other potential wrongdoers. </p><p>In another scheme targeting Native Americans, phony sober living homes were set up promising addiction treatment. Claims were then submitted for services that were never actually performed, officials said. </p>
    

<p>Another case alleges a scheme in Florida to distribute misbranded HIV drugs. Prosecutors say drugs were bought on the black market and resold to unsuspecting pharmacies, which then provided the medications to patients. </p><p>Some patients were given bottles that contained different drugs than the label showed. One patient ended up unconscious for 24 hours after taking what he was led to believe was his HIV medication but was actually an anti-psychotic drug, prosecutors say. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Department of Justice at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice">https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice</a></span>.</p>

<p>An upgrade from Python 3.11 to 3.12 has led to the rejection of
some Python apps by Apple's app stores. That led to Eric Froemling submitting a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522">bug report</a>
against CPython. That, in turn, led to an interesting
discussion among Python developers about how far the project was
willing to go to accommodate app store review processes. Developers
reached a quick consensus, and a solution that may arrive as soon as
Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>

<p>The problem at hand is that Apple's macOS App Store is
automatically rejecting apps that contain the string
"itms-services". That is the URL scheme for apps that
want to ask Apple's iTunes Store to install another
app. Software distributed via Apple's macOS store is
sandboxed, and sandboxed apps are prohibited from using URLs
with the <tt>itms-services</tt> scheme. That string is in the
<tt><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></tt>
parser in Python's standard library, though an application may never actually use
the <tt>itms-services</tt> handler.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple did not do anything so
straightforward as to <em>explain</em> this to Froemling. Once
he filed an appeal with Apple about the rejection, Apple finally told him that
<tt>parse.py</tt> and <tt>parse.pyc</tt> were the offending
files. After that, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522#issuecomment-2169031927">he
said</a>, it was not hard to track down the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
Now in retrospect I'm frustrated I didn't think to run a full text
search for itms-services over Python itself earlier or stumble across
one of the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1655">other
cases</a> of folks hitting this.
</blockquote>

<p>Russell Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011">started the discussion</a> in the Python Core
Development discussion forum on June&nbsp;17. He wanted to know whether "<q>acceptable to app
stores</q>" should be a design goal for CPython, or if that compliance
should be a problem left to the tools that generate application
bundles for app stores.</p>

<h4>Paranoid and inscrutable</h4>

<p>Keith-Magee noted in his initial question that Apple's review processes were the
most "<q>paranoid and inscrutable</q>" of app-store-review processes,
but that other app stores also had "<q>validation and acceptance processes
that are entirely opaque</q>". One solution might be to obfuscate the
offending string to pass review, but that might "<q>lead to an obfuscation arms race</q>" and
there were no guarantees this would be the last time the project had
to resolve app-validation problems. The other option, he said, was to
consider this to be a distribution problem and leave it to tools like
<a href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/py2app/">py2app</a>, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/buildozer/">buildozer</a> to
solve. Traditionally, they have had to patch CPython anyway, he said,
because it did not support Android or iOS "out of the box". But that
will change with Python 3.13 when no patching should be required for
those platforms.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Alex Gaynor <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/3">suggested</a> that the project try a
an approach that Keith-Magee had not put forward inspired by
Gaynor's experience with the <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">cryptography</a> library.
The project often receives complaints that the library refuses
to parse a certificate that is technically invalid, but was in wide
use. He said that the policy was to accept pull
requests that work around those issues "<q>provided they are small,
localized, and generally aren't too awful</q>". 
But, he added, these patches should only be accepted on the condition
that someone complains to the third party (in this case Apple), and extracts
some kind of commitment that they would do something about it. He
suggested that the workaround be time-limited, to give users a decent
experience "<q>while also not letting large firms simply externalize
their bizarre issues onto OSS projects</q>".</p>

<p>Brandt Bucher <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/4">wondered</a>
whether obfuscation was even allowed, or if it would be seen as
circumventing the review process. That was a question no one seemed to
have an answer to; and Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/6">responded</a> with an&nbsp;8-Ball emoji and
the phrase "<q>ask again later</q>." He added that Gaynor's approach
sounded appealing, but it would be like screaming into the
void. Apple, he said, barely has an appeals process and there is no
channel available to the Python project "<q>to raise a complaint that
we could reasonably believe would result in a change of
policy</q>".</p>

<p>Another approach, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/12">suggested</a>
by Alyssa Coghlan, would be to use a JSON configuration file that
<tt>urllib</tt> would read to set up its module level attributes
"<q>rather than hardcoding its knowledge of all the relevant schemes</q>".
That could allow app generators to drop "itms-services"
from the configuration file rather than patching <tt>urllib.py</tt>
directly. Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/13">said</a> that could work, but "<q>it strikes me as a
bit of overkill for an edge case</q>" that could be handled by
obfuscation or distribution-level patching.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;20, Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/16">wrote</a>
that he had thought of another approach: adding a build-time option
called "<tt>--with-app-store-patch</tt>" that removes code that is
known to be problematic. He said it would be enabled
by default for the iOS platform, and disabled elsewhere. It could be
used when building an application for macOS, if the developer intended
to distribute that application via the macOS App Store. He suggested
that the option could also accept a path to a file with a patch, to
allow distributors to provide an updated patch if an app store changes
its rules after the maintenance window for a Python release has
closed.</p>

<h4>Let's paint the bikeshed</h4>

<p>Coghlan <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/20">asked</a>
if it was now time to "<q>paint a config option bikeshed</q>". She
said that the proposed option name was both too broad and too
narrow. The "app-store" component of the name was too broad, because
it could encompass any app store, not only Apple app stores. The
"patch" component was too narrow, because patch specifies the
method of complying with policies rather than intent. There may be
other methods required to comply with app-store-compliance
checks. Keith-Magee liked the suggestion about dropping "patch" from
the option name, and suggested painting the bikeshed a nice shade of
"<tt>--with-app-store-compliance</tt>" that would interact with
platform identification to sort out what is required.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;25, Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/31">thanked</a>
participants in the discussion for their input, and pointed to a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/120984">pull request</a>
that would implement the <tt>--with-app-store-compliance</tt>
configuration option. In the request, he noted that it would be
possible to use the option with platforms other than iOS or macOS, but
there were no use cases for that at present. If all goes well, it
should be available in Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>

<p>It is frustrating that free-software projects like Python have to
waste time finding ways around opaque review processes just so
developers can write software for non-free platforms. However, the
approach taken by Keith-Magee and other CPython developers seems to be
the least-bad option that offers the best experience for Python
application developers. It will almost certainly not be the last time that a
project runs into this problem.</p><br clear="all">

				<p>The company best known for RStudio, the leading integrated development environment (IDE) for R programmers, has quietly launched a “next-generation” IDE designed specifically for both R and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/positron" rel="nofollow">Positron IDE</a> is available in public beta as of today for macOS, Windows, and Linux.</p><p>Created by Boston-based Posit PBC, formerly RStudio, Positron is based on Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3666488/what-is-visual-studio-code-microsofts-extensible-code-editor.html">Visual Studio Code</a>. Users of VS Code will likely find Positron’s look and feel rather familiar, with panels for writing code and viewing code output, consoles and terminals, and an activity bar at the far left offering options for file navigation, version control, debugging, and extensions. However, Positron is packaged out of the box to be easier to set up, especially for R users but also for Python.</p><p>There’s no need to install extensions in order to get R up and running in Positron, as is <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3625488/how-to-run-r-in-visual-studio-code.html%20">the case with VS Code</a>. Likewise you don’t have to install an extension for Positron to run Python. In fact, you’re cautioned <em>not</em> to install the usual VS Code extensions for R and Python in Positron, since the IDE already comes with that functionality built-in. For both languages, you should have the basic language files installed on your system, as well as the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/" rel="nofollow">IPykernel</a> package to run Python. Positron easily found both my R and Python installations at first launch.</p><figure><a href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/06/positron_opening_screen-100963305-orig.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" rel="nofollow"><img alt="positron opening screen" width="1200" height="739" data-imageid="100963305" data-license="IDG" data-original="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/06/positron_opening_screen-100963305-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" loading="lazy" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/06/positron_opening_screen-100963305-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70"></a> <small>IDG</small></figure><p>You can install other VS Code extensions in Positron if you want them, though. Because Microsoft does not allow third-party IDEs to access the official VS Code Marketplace, Positron extensions are installed via the <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenVSX registry</a>. “Posit is a major sponsor of OpenVSX,” Posit noted in its Positron wiki. Not all VS Code extension authors also submit and regularly update their projects to OpenVSX, however.</p><p>Posit calls the project “a next-generation data science IDE” and “an extensible polyglot tool for writing code and exploring data.” It has a built-in, easy-to-use data and variable explorer, which includes options like sorting and filtering data frames. It can be accessed by clicking an icon, for both R and Python data.</p><p>“The Data Explorer is intended to complement code-first exploration of data, allowing you to display data in a spreadsheet-like grid, temporarily filter and sort data, and provide useful summary statistics directly inside of Positron,” according to the project wiki. “The goal of the Data Explorer is not to replace code-based workflows, but rather supplement with ephemeral views of the data or summary statistics as you further explore or modify the data via code.”</p><p>There are other welcome little tweaks in Positron, such as cmd/ctrl + enter running one line of a Python script and then moving your cursor to the next line of code. This can be surprisingly helpful for quick code examination outside of the debug tool. If you are working on a project that combines both R and Python scripts, which I increasingly do as an R user working with generative AI, the IDE also easily pops up the correct console when you switch between scripts in both languages.</p><p>The repo cautions that Positron is “an early stage project under active development.” Users should keep that in mind when weighing how and when to try it out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/fcc-rule-would-make-carriers-unlock-all-phones-after-60-days/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/fcc-rule-would-make-carriers-unlock-all-phones-after-60-days/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40814728">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC wants to make it significantly easier for consumers to unlock their phones from their carriers, proposing that all devices must be unlockable just 60 days after purchase. How this will mesh with current plans and phone-buying trends, however, is something the agency is hoping to learn before putting such a rule into effect.</p>

<p>Mobile phones purchased from a carrier are generally locked to that carrier until either the contract is up or the phone is paid off. But despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/15/if-you-want-tech-freedom-congress-needs-to-change-a-law/">improvements to the process over the years </a>(unlocking was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/26/unlocking-your-phone-is-now-illegal-but-what-does-that-mean-for-you/">flat-out illegal </a>not long ago), it still isn’t quite clear to all consumers when and how they can unlock their phone and take it to the carrier (or country) of their choice.</p>

	
	


<p>To be clear, this is not about opening up your phone using a face, fingerprint or password, but changing settings in its software to allow it to work with different mobile networks.</p>

<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-proposes-mobile-phone-unlocking-requirement">in a press release Thursday</a>. “When you buy a phone, you should have the freedom to decide when to change service to the carrier you want and not have the device you own stuck by practices that prevent you from making that choice,” she wrote. “That is why we are proposing clear, nationwide mobile phone unlocking rules.”</p>

	
	


<p>Specifically, the release says, carriers would simply have to provide unlocking services 60 days after activation. A welcome standard, but it may run afoul of today’s phone and wireless markets.</p>

<p>For instance, although the dreaded two-year contract is no longer forced on most consumers, many still opt for them to lock in the price and get other benefits. And perhaps more to the point, the phones themselves are often paid for in what amount to installment plans: You get a phone for “free” and then pay it off over the next few years.</p>

<p>The NPRM is the stage of FCC rulemaking where it has a draft rule but has not yet solicited public feedback. Only July 18, the agency will publish the full document and open up commentary on the above issues. And you can be sure there will be some squawking from mobile providers!</p>


	
	


<p>Not knowing the specifics of the proposed rule, we can’t be sure how it would mix with these common pay-over-time details. But unlocking a phone doesn’t free someone from needing to pay the device off — they can just use it on other networks if they want. And if a carrier lets you buy a phone outright from it but locks it to the bands for six months or a year out of sheer greed, this would offer an early exit.</p>

	
	


<p>As Rosenworcel said, the point of the rule is to offer consistency and transparency: a simple, national rule from regulators setting a reasonable limit on how and whether carriers can lock down devices. We’ll know more in July when the full NPRM is published.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="a18ceec073330138c96eaeed00e512fa" data-plugin="LayoutElement"><h5>Plan It Now,</h5>

<h5>Build It Later</h5>



<p><span>Project management is not just a tool to mislead the client into thinking you're actually doing something.</span></p>

<p><span>It can also be used to create a high quality product, on time, and slightly over budget.</span></p>

<p><span>For the second lighthouse I project managed, designed and then 3D printed all the parts, It looks great, and fits the brief completely.</span></p>

<p><span>But guess which one I now prefer.</span></p>

<p><span>So two lighthouses later, I realised that the act of planning sometimes loses the spirit of the idea.</span></p>

<p><span>Even so, I decided to try to plan and manage the Valve.Computer project, and fortunately, as the build grew, it gained more spirit than I can shake a stick at.</span></p>
</div><div id="a18ceec0733303a102bddc43e1de045d" data-plugin="LayoutElement"><h5>The Valve.Computer Project</h5>



<p><span>My stepdaughter is a senior Product Manager and my stepson is a Chartered Engineer and he frequently works as a Project Manager. They would know how to manage this project. Luckily they are too successful and busy to ever read this, thank goodness!</span></p>

<p><span>I tried doing the project management on a PC but gave up, and instead used 3 coloured pens, A4 paper and self adhesive address labels to cover up my mistakes. I simply found it easier. The only problem I discovered is that the paper gets a bit thick after several layers of amendments, but the big advantage is that can always find your last version, it's simply the thickest.</span></p>

<p><span>The main thing I discovered over the year was that the first time I tried almost anything I failed, but the annoying experience often enabled future success.</span></p>

<p><span>I started by stabbing at various bits of the idea. Eventually I was able to define what I wanted to do. I now realise that this definition, was the most important part of the whole project management.</span></p>

<p><span>The program seemed to consist of many complex components, all of which I needed to understand, to be able to build the Valve.Computer.</span></p>

<p><span>How do thermionic valves work, how do you design a PCB, and how on earth do you get from a NOR gate, to a memory register, via microcodes from a clock and a ROM, to actually run software. And what exactly is a microcode anyway. At times, in fact most of the time, it all just seemed impossible.</span></p>

<p><span>The main solutions I found were, firstly to keep the number of unique sub systems to an absolute minimum, secondly to use double triode valves to halve the physical size, which also reduced the construction time, and thirdly, to design multi layer printed circuit boards to reduce the inevitable build errors and produce a robust construction.</span></p>



<p><span>So far it has only gone BANG twice. The first time I pulled out plugs like my life depended on it, and Judy cried, “Everything all right!”. The second time I only slightly panicked, and Judy continued to decorate the Christmas tree, but later bought me a surpise present, a fire extinguisher!</span></p>



<p><span>But most important of all, is to have a lovely wife, who knows you're daft as a brush, and that life together is brilliant.</span></p>

Unfortunately, there are several rare edge cases. As a tool moves from academic prototype to production-ready, obscure cases can and do occur. This results in loop analysis being a key source of late-discovered but significant algorithmic bugs. To avoid these, this paper presents a collection of examples and "folklore" challenges in loop analysis.</p></section><section id="backmatter" role="doc-bibliography" data-extent="backmatter"><h2>References</h2><div role="list"><div role="listitem" data-has="label"><p>[1]</p><div id="ref-00001"><p>2023.
