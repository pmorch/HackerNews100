    <p>Estimates for achieving intermediate fluency in Mandarin Chinese range up to spending years and around 4000 total hours (2,200h classroom hours, 1,800 outside). I did it in 1500 hours total and less than a year.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<section>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>There is a lot of disagreement on language proficiency estimates. They are unreliable and inaccurate. My rough best estimates:<br>
Mean: <strong>2,200h classroom + ~1800h outside -&gt; 50% pass ILR 3 -&gt; true average level is ~ILR 2+</strong><br>
My journey: <strong>150h classroom + 1350h outside -&gt; 50/50 shot at passing ILR 3 exam -&gt; true average level ILR 2+</strong><br>
Detailed walkthrough: One of our best sources, the US Department of State, sadly has a lot of content under NDAs, including exams. That said, they <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/?ref=isaak.net">estimate</a> that reaching "General Professional Fluency" (<a href="https://www.govtilr.org/Skills/ILRscale2.htm?ref=isaak.net">ILR 3</a>) takes 2,200 <em>classroom</em> hours over 88 weeks. This is 2,200/88 = 25 hours a week. Diplomats describe studying a language at the DOS as "the hardest thing you will do in your life". <em>Classroom</em> hours do not include the heavy homework and content consumption. For them, this is not a 25h part-time breeze. It is life.<br>
What the program sounds like, it takes more like 45h a week for 88 weeks (3096h). Add some private language practice, travelling, and content consumption, and studying for the actual exam (which seems brutal). Now, getting to ILR3 fluency seems like taking <strong>well above 4000 hours</strong>, all included.<br>
This is being good on paper. These kinds of language proficiency levels tend to fall short in real-life. In fact, they fall short even on paper: Only some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/rd19bj/success_rates_in_2011_and_2012_of_the_fsi_at/?ref=isaak.net">50% pass</a> the ILR3 test after the 88 weeks. In additio, tests are a mediocre proxy for actual communication ability. My sense from reading online is that the diplomats at ILR3 on paper have only truly mastered something like ILR2.<br>
Similarly, I spent <strong>some 1,500 hours total</strong>, including everything like classroom hours, tutoring hours, content consumption, and conversations. On paper, I would guess I am at ILR3, but that is probably an overestimate. So call it ILR2+.<br>
To be fair, also take generously take some time off that 4000-hour estimate: Call it usually takes <strong>3000 hours to get to a similarly strong</strong> ILR2+ level / on-paper ILR3. Hence the 3000h vs 1500h comparison.<br>
This is my rough outline of the core estimate. I do not really care enough to get into more detail or studying for passing tests. I just enjoy learning the language and using it. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Over the last 365 days, I studied Mandarin for fun. With anki, tutors, and traveling accelerating my learning, I ended up getting to the level of comfortable conversational fluency. My Mandarin isn't perfect nor perfectly fluent, but I can now handle everything up to technical conversations in the area of my PhD.&nbsp;</p><p>For serious language learners, I also jotted down a longer list of methodds: <a href="https://isaak.net/mandarinmethods/">isaak.net/mandarinmethods</a></p><h2 id="humble-beginnings-%E2%80%94-%E7%AD%9A%E8%B7%AF%E8%93%9D%E7%BC%95">Humble Beginnings — 筚路蓝缕</h2><p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Last September, I was deep into my math undergrad. It was pretty dry. I was looking for some fun non-math side project.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> I flirted with French, Russian, archery, parkour, and Japanese. But those didn’t ignite my passion. I happened to watch a snippet of the anime Demon Slayer in an obscure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VoT0TY0emM&amp;ref=isaak.net">Chinese fan dub</a>. Ironically, this caught my attention. I also had lots of Chinese friends, so why not learn a little Mandarin? Oh my, I had no idea how obsessed I'd end up with this "little" side project.</p>
<p>Berkeley had a breakneck-speed Mandarin beginner class. I loved it. Within a week, we learned pinyin. We learned the tones. We learned to read. We learned to write. Then started talking immediately, every single day. Talking in horribly horribly broken Chinese, but nevertheless having conversations.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> I learned the very most important survival vocabulary, like: <em>I am Isaak</em> and <em>Yes, I live in America</em> and <em>Sorry, no, I’m not a basketball player for the Golden State Warriors</em>.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I had virtually no math background, so I spent a lot of my time studying math from absolute scratch. It was brutal. It was rewarding. It also was very dry. Many months of many proofs, many \[ and some forgotten \], many months of many ∴ and many more □. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Between running from Chinese class to discrete math classes, I’d be staring into the orange California sunset sky, and mumbling random Demon Slayer anime phrases to myself in Chinese, like "Lightning Breath - First Slash and Lightning" (雷之呼吸，一之型，霹雳一闪!). Oops... <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

But come chat anyway! (Qingyuan, China)</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>The beginning was by far the hardest time, and many tuned out or dropped out. But I had lots of fun. I played a lot. I wrote a horrible poem about humanity colonizing Mars. My Chinese was absolute crap, but I was improving <em>fast</em>. Chinese is my fifth language, and I had a few tricks up my sleeve:</p><h2 id="intense-self-study-%E2%80%94-%E8%87%AA%E5%BC%BA%E4%B8%8D%E6%81%AF">Intense Self-Study — 自强不息</h2><p><strong>Month 3: </strong>Spaced repetition is a superweapon. The spaced repetition app Anki is the core reason why I was able to study Chinese efficiently. Alongside Anki, I adopted other methods to learn <em>faster</em>. </p><p>Frequency-based learning. Comprehensible input. Reading lots as soon as I could, especially graded readers. Buying a calligraphy pen-brush and learned how to write the 600 Chinese characters. FSRS. Creating a 100,000-card Anki megadeck. For all the nitty-gritty language learning tips, check out <a href="https://isaak.net/mandarinmethods/" rel="noreferrer">my methods post</a>. </p><p>Early on, I started watching anime dubs like Boruto or Scissor Seven. I really enjoyed myself despite barely understanding anything. Every few minutes I collected a new word to study. The content I watched in those early days felt like colorful images with funny sounds which occasionally made sense.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkzR7VAlJdrPr9X0XuxXJFcdOB9gnxfeRHyrtUpagDZ2krk5NsaA9653_HhAGhzu1L4LmF-vgN9e_rkNWXRd6CRNZex7DUk9SFfjqcITATrrGw8Nx_BcWKjrvXo06bFKYRAtk6bLBYaLLsZ_bK-LIu2ezL?key=va-1OSyREuqkqYOZib3JNw" alt="" loading="lazy" width="379" height="213"><figcaption><i><em>Colorful images with funny sounds which occasionally make sense</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>On day 70 I reached a vocabulary of 1050, of which 460 characters.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

</li>
</ol>
</section>
<p>The other superweapon I implemented was personalized tutoring. My first month studying Chinese was mostly in a 20-people class. But then, I took Bloom's Two-Sigma effect to heart and got myself lots of 1-1 tutoring. The more time I spent on tutoring, the more it accelerated my studies.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>There’s legends like <a href="https://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/43939-independent-chinese-study-review/?ref=isaak.net"><u>Tamu</u></a> spending dozens of hours with tutors, but I’d mostly spend up to six hours a week. More would start to detract from my main focus, which were still my math studies. My default for working with tutors was to lead a "normal" conversation. I had two strict rules for conversations with tutors: 1. Only Chinese, no English. 2. Correct every single mistake I make. </p><figure><img src="https://isaak.net/content/images/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2042" srcset="https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 600w, https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 1000w, https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 1600w, https://isaak.net/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/IMG_3800.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>I definitely lost all my social anxiety after 3 days of walking around tourist-packed Hawaii beaches loudly talking broken Chinese</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>At the start, this tutoring was excruciatingly slow. But it was very worth it. After the chat, I’d ask them to send me a summary of my key mistakes and newly learned vocabulary. It’d add that to my Anki.&nbsp;</p><p>I made lots of mistakes. I still do.

I knew all the Chinese I needed to know to travel. (<em>No, sorry, I’m not LeBron James.</em>) I figured out tourist visas, and just went for it. After Christmas in chafing-lips-freezing-cold Austria, I found myself wandering around fogged-up-glasses-humid Taipei.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

I’d walk around with airpods in, sugar-shocked from eating too many sugar gourds, explaining to my tutor in great detail what tasty novel things I ate at the night market. When not on a tutoring call, I’d sit in cafes and study, wander around markets, or talk to locals. </p><p>Being a foreigner with passable Mandarin is... amusing. When meditating in a small Buddhist temple town in middle-of-nowhere rural Sichuan, I was a local celebrity. 300 primary schooler filed past me, who definitely hadn't seen an Austrian-African foreigner speaking Mandarin. They totally lost it. It was fun, but also tiring. Eventually I preferred to be in the cities, where being a foreigner wasn’t a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>At least, I got a good taste of why being famous must be great for exactly three minutes, and then quite frankly horrible forever after. Not again. I’m okay, thanks.</p><p>In total, I was in Mainland China three times this year, for a total of two months.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> It goes without saying that every journey gave me an enormous boost in my learning pace. The first time travelling got me from <em>broken</em> to <em>comfortable in all day-to-day situations</em>. Every time I travelled I learned roughly 1000 new words/characters. Every time immensely boosted my fluent expression and listening ability.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I ended up going to China again fairly soon, in Spring break. This time I went with an adventure-hungry Austrian friend who was also learning Chinese, and we pushed each other to get better and better.

Apart from the study sprints while traveling, I tried to keep up a consistently high pace back at home. Chinese wasn’t my focus then — math and neuro were.

<p>Immersion is best done while traveling. Still, I started to immerse myself as well as I could at home. My devices would be in Chinese. I started taking some notes primarily in Mandarin. I had lots of social support throughout too: I was lucky to be able to build new relationships entirely in Chinese. For example, my grad school supervisor, a Tsinghua graduate now at MIT, was more than happy to teach me neuroscience in Chinese. I had tutors. I turned older relationships fully Chinese. This had me constantly speaking Mandarin day-to-day.</p><p><strong>Month 12: </strong>Exactly 365 days after I started, I reached a vocabulary of 8000 words and characters.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdSe8Wt-7sEziRiPjp_mO0JZ6rHEK_kdZkBDlxJZ0e-7HBiN__o1wAXc8Fsdb8_Nu20BQTQWKO841-ADHl7o7VO1RB9XEtcyuQiQXyCRD5N4jYXjDtM76t_rpyLBg7dro0U04raEzKooGKAiPfYzuND38_U?key=va-1OSyREuqkqYOZib3JNw" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="63"></figure><p>8000 words and characters makes most content I encounter relatively understandable. My vocabulary is a weird personal mix: Basics including everything up to HSK5, anime vocabulary, biology, mathematics, and random everyday stuff from travelling.</p><p>Vocabulary is only one part of fluency. It's important to keep eyes on the goal: The goal of any language is to communicate effectively. Prompted for feedback on my progress, my usually reserved tutor recently commented: “This was the fastest learning pace from zero to advanced conversational fluency I have ever seen." </p><p>That's kind, but being<em> fluent </em>feels like it’ll always be an overstatement. Especially for Chinese. I’m definitely not <em>Fluent™</em>. I sometimes still get my tones wrong. Full-speed native speech is sometimes still tough. Local dialects remain a complete mystery to me.</p><p>I’d say I’m <em>comfortable </em>with Chinese. I can <em>comfortably</em> travel in any Mandarin-speaking place. I can <em>comfortably </em>hold long conversations. I can <em>comfortably </em>watch most content. I can <em>comfortably </em>build relationships entirely in Mandarin.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal? I want to reach a level where the legendary Three-Body Problem will be <em>comfortably </em>readable.</p><hr><p>Curious about more?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>For a while now I've started my day by unlocking my phone and scrolling through different news and social media sites to see what's going on. It's not exactly <em>great</em> for my mental health and I've been trying to cut down on screen time for a while. I still want to stay up-to-date though, especially after I get up in the morning.</p>
<p>I recently purchased a dot matrix printer from eBay, and thought it would be a great excuse to have a custom "front page" printed out and ready for me each day. So, that's what I built!</p>

<p>I'll take this article to dive in and show you what I used, how I set it up, and the <strong>PHP script</strong> that powers it all.</p>

<h2>Purchasing the hardware</h2>
<p>The supply list for this project was pretty small, and with the exception of the printer, most of this can be found on Amazon or other online retailers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dot matrix printer</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero W [<a href="https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w-basic-starter-kit-1">link</a>]</li>
<li>Serial to USB adapter [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IDU0T1Y?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1">link</a>]</li>
<li>Power supply</li>
</ul>
<p>The printer I purchased was a <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102666267">Star NP-10</a> from what looks like the mid-80's. I can't be 100% sure, but any dot matrix printer with a serial port should do the trick. The prices range from about $80-120 USD, but I was able to get this one for about half that price because it was marked as "unsure if working".</p>
<p>It did need a little cleaning up and some tuning of the ink ribbon cartridge (isn't that cool, it's like a typewriter!), but after that it fired right up and ran through the test page print.</p>
<p>After that, I hooked everything up. The Raspberry Pi is connected to my WiFi, and then via USB to the serial port of the printer. After turning on the printer and <code>ssh</code>ing into the Pi, I can verify that the printer is available at <code>/dev/usb/lp0</code>.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>how do I get this thing to print?</strong></p>
<h2>Figuring out the printer's code</h2>
<p>Because the printer is available at <code>lp0</code> I wanted to see if I could just echo raw text to it and have it come through the printer. So I ran the following:</p>
<pre><code data-theme="material-theme-palenight" data-lang="bash"><!-- Syntax highlighted by torchlight.dev --><p><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello, world!</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>/dev/usb/lp0</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Which resulted in an error that the file couldn't be accessed. Bummer, a permissions issue. Easily fixed though with some <code>chmod</code>'ing:</p>
<pre><code data-theme="material-theme-palenight" data-lang="bash"><!-- Syntax highlighted by torchlight.dev --><p><span>sudo</span><span> </span><span>chmod</span><span> </span><span>666</span><span> </span><span>/dev/usb/lp0</span></p></code></pre>
<p>There might be a better way to handle that, but it allowed my echo to go through, and I saw the text available on the printer! Alright, I can send raw data to the printer via this file, so let's find a way to scale this up.</p>
<p>I use PHP as my language of choice in a day-to-day basis, and this is no exception. I write a basic script that accesses the file through <code>fopen()</code> and starts writing text to it. I try a few sentences, some spacing, and then some unicode art, but quickly find out that there's not as much character support on the printer as I was sending.</p>
<p><img src="https://aschmelyun.com/storage/images/blog/dotmatrix-encoding-errors.jpg" alt="Picture of a printed sheet showing a bunch of wrongly-encoded characters"></p>
<p>So I thought it was about time that I start digging into how this thing <em>actually works</em>. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of internet hoarders, I found a <a href="https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/manuals/Star%20Micronics/dot_matrix/Star%20Micronics%20-%20NP-10%20-%20Users%20Manual.pdf">full manual for the printer</a> scanned and uploaded as a PDF.</p>
<p>Come to find out, either because of the age or just the manufacturing decision, this printer has a <strong>very specific character set</strong> that it accepts. Loosely based off of the IBM PC's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code Page 437</a> it consists mostly of your standard alpha-numeric characters, but with a small set of special symbols, lines, and boxes. Neat!</p>
<p>Sending these characters to the printer is pretty straightforward, I can just echo out the hex values with PHP like so:</p>
<pre><code data-theme="material-theme-palenight" data-lang="php"><!-- Syntax highlighted by torchlight.dev --><p><span>$</span><span>horizontalDouble </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>\xCD</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>$</span><span>deg </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>\xF8</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>str_repeat</span><span>($</span><span>horizontalDouble</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>24</span><span>);</span></p><p><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>78</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>deg </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>F</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Alright, so I'm able to write text to the printer just fine, and include some special characters and design symbols. Now I need to figure out <em>what</em> I want to see every morning.</p>
<h2>Gathering the data</h2>
<p>I knew I wanted four distinct sections for my personal front page: <strong>weather, stocks, major news headlines, and a few top reddit posts</strong>. After all, that's usually what I end up look at on my phone in the morning.</p>
<p>Additionally, since this is an experimental project, I wanted to remain super cheap for this data, free if at all possible. Thankfully there's an amazing <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis">GitHub repo</a> for free and public APIs, so I just went through there and found the ones I needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The weather pulls from <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs">Open-Meteo</a> and no API key is needed</li>
<li>Stocks data pulls from <a href="https://twelvedata.com/docs">twelvedata</a> that offers a generous free tier</li>
<li>News headlines pull from <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started">NYTimes</a> which has a decent free tier, good enough for this project</li>
<li>Reddit posts pull from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/rvqirc/how_to_get_reddit_api_data_using_json/">Reddit JSON</a> which is free (but I had to spoof my User-Agent)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the sections, I wrote some basic PHP code to pull in the payload from the API endpoint and compile the data I wanted into a larger overall array. I only wanted specific stocks, types of headlines, and subreddit posts, and if any of the sections couldn't have data to present I just simply crash the script early so I can start it again at a later time.</p>
<p>This can be seen in this snippet which I use for pulling news headlines:</p>
<pre><code data-theme="material-theme-palenight" data-lang="php"><!-- Syntax highlighted by torchlight.dev --><p><span>// Get news headlines data</span></p><p><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Fetching news headlines data...</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>$</span><span>newsUrl </span><span>=</span><span> NEWS </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>?api-key=</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> NEWSKEY</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>$</span><span>newsData </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[];</span></p><p><span>$</span><span>newsAmount </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>$</span><span>data </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>json_decode</span><span>(</span><span>file_get_contents</span><span>($</span><span>newsUrl</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>true);</span></p><p><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(!</span><span>isset</span><span>($</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>results</span><span>'</span><span>]))</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>die</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Unable to retrieve news data</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></p><p><span>}</span></p><p><span>foreach</span><span> </span><span>($</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>results</span><span>'</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>article</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>($</span><span>article</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>type</span><span>'</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>Article</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>(</span><span>in_array</span><span>($</span><span>article</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>section</span><span>'</span><span>],</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>U.S.</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>World</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>Weather</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>Arts</span><span>'</span><span>]))</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>($</span><span>newsAmount </span><span>&lt;</span><span> MAXNEWS</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>$</span><span>newsData</span><span>[]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>article</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>$</span><span>newsAmount</span><span>++;</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>The <code>NEWS</code>, <code>NEWSKEY</code>, and <code>MAXNEWS</code> variables are all constants instantiated at the top of the script for easy editing.</p>
<p>Running this compiles everything I want to see displayed on the paper, but now I need to take on the actual task of formatting everything for the printer, and sending it the raw data.</p>
<h2>Printing out my front page</h2>
<p>I could just print out a heading for each section, but that's a little boring. I wanted a bit of <strong><em>flair</em></strong> to the project, so I decided to have a box at the top displaying the current date, day of the week, and my front page name all nicely bordered.</p>
<p>It took a little math, but I got everything working by using a combination of the hex values I talked about above, <code>str_repeat</code> and the knowledge that the page width for this printer is <strong>80 characters</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, just simply go through each section, print a little heading:</p>
<pre><code data-theme="material-theme-palenight" data-lang="php"><!-- Syntax highlighted by torchlight.dev --><p><span>str_repeat</span><span>($</span><span>horizontalSingle</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span> WEATHER </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>str_repeat</span><span>($</span><span>horizontalSingle</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>PAGEWIDTH </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>9</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>And then print out the data that I want displayed for that section:</p>
<pre><code data-theme="material-theme-palenight" data-lang="php"><!-- Syntax highlighted by torchlight.dev --><p><span>"</span><span>   </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>round</span><span>(($</span><span>weatherData</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>daily</span><span>'</span><span>][</span><span>'</span><span>daylight_duration</span><span>'</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>3600</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>h of Sunlight  -  Sunrise: </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>date</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>g:ia</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>strtotime</span><span>($</span><span>weatherData</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>daily</span><span>'</span><span>][</span><span>'</span><span>sunrise</span><span>'</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]))</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>  -  Sunset: </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>date</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>g:ia</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>strtotime</span><span>($</span><span>weatherData</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>daily</span><span>'</span><span>][</span><span>'</span><span>sunset</span><span>'</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]))</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>For the weather and stocks, I knew I wouldn't hit the edge of the paper so I just wrote everything in single long lines. But that's different for the news headlines and Reddit posts.</p>
<p>If I just feed the printer one long line of text, it's smart enough to cut it and start printing on another line. But, I didn't want a word getting cut off in the middle and starting on the next line. So I implemented a small function to handle line length and instead return back an array of lines with a max length corresponding to the page width.</p>

<p>Now all that's left to do is run the script!</p>
<h2>Usage and wrapping up</h2>
<p>I can fire off the printer manually by just running <code>php print.php</code> but I've instead set up a cron job to handle it for me.</p>
<p>Every morning at around 8am it starts printing out my personalized front page. I rip it off and check it out in the morning while drinking my coffee.</p>
<p><img src="https://aschmelyun.com/storage/images/blog/dotmatrix-example-print.jpg" alt="Example page printed"></p>
<p>As silly as it might sound, it just feels better having that finite amount of news on a single sheet of paper. Of being able to stop there instead of endlessly scrolling through websites and social media apps.</p>
<p>Also, this was a super fun project and I'm hoping I can find more uses for this dot matrix printer. Working with physical hardware (especially older specimens like this) is always a blast for me, and being able to integrate them with new technology or use them in interesting ways just ignites pure passion and reinforces why I became a programmer in the first place.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? If you have any ideas for projects like this, or just have a question or comment, I'd love to hear it! Catch me on <a href="https://twitter.com/aschmelyun">Twitter</a> if you'd like to chat more.</p>

<p>Today, Waymo and Hyundai Motor Company announced they have entered into a multi-year, strategic partnership. In the first phase of this partnership, the companies will integrate Waymo’s sixth-generation fully autonomous technology – the Waymo Driver – into Hyundai’s all-electric IONIQ 5 SUV, which will be added to the Waymo One fleet over time.</p>
<p>The IONIQ 5 vehicles destined for the Waymo fleet will be assembled at the new Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) EV manufacturing facility in Georgia and then integrated with Waymo’s autonomous technology. The companies plan to produce a fleet of IONIQ 5s equipped with Waymo’s technology in significant volume over multiple years to support Waymo One’s growing scale. Initial on-road testing with Waymo-enabled IONIQ 5s will begin by late 2025 and become available to Waymo One riders in the years to follow.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Hyundai as we further our mission to be the world's most trusted driver,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “Hyundai’s focus on sustainability and strong electric vehicle roadmap makes them a great partner for us as we bring our fully autonomous service to more riders in more places.”</p>
<p>“Hyundai and Waymo share a vision to improve the safety, efficiency and convenience of how people move,” said José Muñoz, president and global COO of Hyundai Motor Company, and president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America. “Waymo’s transformational technology is improving road safety where they operate, and the IONIQ 5 is the ideal vehicle to scale this further. The team at our new manufacturing facility is ready to allocate a significant number of vehicles for the Waymo One fleet as it continues to expand. Importantly, this is the first step in the partnership between the two companies and we are actively exploring additional opportunities for collaboration.”</p>
<p>“We recently <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/4227"><u>announced</u></a> the launch of Hyundai Motor Company’s autonomous vehicle foundry business to provide global autonomous driving companies with vehicles capable of implementing SAE Level 4 or higher autonomous driving technology,” said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Vehicle Platform (AVP) Division. “There is no better partner for our first agreement in this initiative than industry-leader Waymo.”</p>
<p>The Hyundai IONIQ 5 will be delivered to Waymo with specific autonomous-ready modifications like redundant hardware and power doors. The <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/footer/corporate/awards/ioniq5"><u>award-winning</u></a>, all-electric vehicle will enable long driving shifts on a single charge, and its 800-volt architecture will minimize time out of service with some of the industry’s fastest charging speeds available. The IONIQ 5’s well-appointed and spacious interior will offer plenty of legroom, headroom, and rear cargo space for a comfortable rider experience.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said on Thursday that 159 employees (roughly 8.4% of staff) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/">accepted a severance package</a> that the company had offered to those who disagreed with his direction of WordPress and his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/">handling of the tussle with web hosting provider WP Engine</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, Mullenweg said the package offered $30,000 or six months of salary, whichever is higher, but the employees who took it would not be eligible to be re-hired by Automattic. </p>







<p>Nearly 80% of people who took the offer worked in the company’s Ecosystem / WordPress division, and the rest were in Automattic’s Cosmos businesses, consisting of apps like Pocket Casts, Day One, Tumblr and Cloudup.</p>

<p>Mullenweg, who co-created WordPress and is arguably the face of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wordpress.org/">open-source project</a>, tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, writing that the company “decided to design the most generous buy-out package possible, we called it an Alignment Offer.”</p>

<p>“HR added some extra details to sweeten the deal; we wanted to make it as enticing as possible,” he wrote, and later on added: “159 people took the offer, 8.4% of the company, the other 91.6% gave up $126M of potential severance to stay!” </p>

<p>“It was an emotional roller coaster of a week. The day you hire someone, you aren’t expecting them to resign or be fired; you’re hoping for a long and mutually beneficial relationship. Every resignation stings a bit,” Mullenweg wrote.</p>

<p>Mullenweg and Automattic have been in a skirmish with WP Engine for almost two weeks now, in which the CEO has called WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress,” accusing it of wrongfully using the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/wordpress-org-bans-wp-engine-blocks-it-from-accessing-its-resources/">banning the company</a> from accessing the open-source WordPress.org resources.</p>


<p>Both WP Engine and Automattic have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/wp-engine-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-automattic-over-mullenwegs-comments/">sent</a> each other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/legal-ping-pong-in-the-wordpress-world-continues-automattic-now-sends-wp-engine-a-cease-and-desist-letter-alleging-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cease-and-desist letters</a>. And WP Engine earlier on Thursday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg</a>, accusing the company and its CEO of “abuse of power,” extortion, and saying the WordPress co-creator has conflicts of interest in handling WordPress as an open-source project.</p>

<p>Automattic has so far called all of WP Engine’s claims meritless. “I stayed up last night reading WP Engine’s Complaint, trying to find any merit anywhere to it. The whole thing is meritless, and we look forward to the federal court’s consideration of their lawsuit,” the company’s legal representative, Neal Katyal, said in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://automattic.com/2024/10/03/meritless/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/jeffr0/status/1841585100665872569">several</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/BoweFrankema/status/1841836017810092059">people</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/kellie/status/1841210258422972536">X</a> have hinted about a severance offer being circulated among Automattic employees. Mullenweg also <a rel="nofollow" href="https://medium.com/@kelliepeterson/nice-guy-matt-mullenweg-ceo-of-wordpress-com-cries-foul-and-threatens-me-with-legal-action-f116ac57d862">allegedly DM’d a former employee who posted about the offer</a> and accused her of attacking the company and him.</p>







<p>Today, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/p3ob7o/status/1842078298030956576">some Automattic employees</a> who opted to keep their jobs <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/richard_tabor/status/1842062384820633742">posted messages</a> in support of the company and Mullenweg.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nv1t.github.io/blog/kekz-headphones/">https://nv1t.github.io/blog/kekz-headphones/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41738552">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Close to a year ago, I stumbled upon the Kekz Headphones, which seemed like an interesting approach on the whole digital audio device space. They claimed to work without any internet connection and all of the content already on the headphones itself. They are On-Ear Headphones, which work by placing a small chip (I call them “Kekz” or “Cookie”) into a little nook on the side and it plays an audio story.
I was intrigued, because there were some speculations going around, how they operate with those “Kekz”-Chips.</p><p>I invite you to join me on a journey into the inner workings of those headphones. We will talk about accessing the encrypted files on the device, breaking the crypto and discovering disclosure of data from customers.</p><h2 id="opening-the-headphones">Opening the headphones</h2><p>I sourced my headphones from “Kleinanzeigen” (something like craigslist, or facebook marketplace) to keep the research costs low and maybe get some cookies with it. I got the wonderful colour red.
<img src="https://nv1t.github.io/blog/img/2024/9fedcf0c1ac98650a8055d6744523e91.png" alt="Headphones opened up, PCBs hanging out, Kekz chips are lying to the left.">
After opening up the headphones, you will have 2 PCBs which are connected by 7 wires. Two speakers and a battery. The chinese lettering in the silk layer is just the colour description of the wires itself. You don’t see any interesting breakout for anything here. The Pin-Row in the middle is for the NFC antenna on the other side of the board. You see two Vias with the label <code>DP</code> and <code>DM</code>, which is on the USB line. This will be interesting at a later stage.</p><p><img src="https://nv1t.github.io/blog/img/2024/9c2962c7adb42ddbf4c88bb9f44b7d7a.jpg" alt="PCB of one of the ears, which has the important chips on it. Description is in the text.">
The first thing that stands out is a Jieli Chip, which appears to be the core component of the entire headset. These chips are mostly used in cheap Bluetooth hardware and are difficult to determine which version is currently running. From a quick search i think this Chip (<code>AC21BP0H733-51C8</code>) is probably some version of the <code>AC6951C</code>.</p><p>The chip on the bottom, <code>TSC9883</code>, is a NFC Reader IC, which I don’t care for.</p><p>It has two infrared proximity sensors to detect the ear and cookie insertion to prevent from reading a cookie more than once and stop when taking off the headphones.</p><p>On the right of the PCB you see an SD cardholder, which has a 32gb SD Card on the inside. The SD Card has a Fat32 Filesystem with 276 directories. There is an update, which ups that to around 369 directories. Each directory has multiple files with the extension <code>kez</code>, which are most likely encrypted.</p><p><img src="https://nv1t.github.io/blog/img/2024/87e3e2c1ef721f3e60733fc2e0e3149e.png" alt="Directory and Filelisting from the SD Card"></p><p>Interestingly, I was looking at the SD Card before and I connected the headphones to the accompanied Windows Application. After the connection, the files were gone and I was kinda puzzled, until I found the following code in the application:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="csharp"><span><span><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> HideFolders()
</span></span><span><span>{

</span></span><span><span>	{

</span></span><span><span>	}
</span></span><span><span>	<span>string</span> drive = Globals.Drive;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>string</span>[] directories = Directory.GetDirectories(drive);
</span></span><span><span>	<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; directories.Length; i++)
</span></span><span><span>	{
</span></span><span><span>		DirectoryInfo directoryInfo = <span>new</span> DirectoryInfo(directories[i]);
</span></span><span><span>		<span>if</span> (<span>int</span>.TryParse(directoryInfo.Name, <span>out</span> <span>var</span> _))
</span></span><span><span>		{
</span></span><span><span>			directoryInfo.Attributes |= FileAttributes.Hidden;
</span></span><span><span>		}
</span></span><span><span>	}
</span></span><span><span>	<span>new</span> FileInfo(Path.Combine(drive, <span>"kekzId.json"</span>)).Attributes |= FileAttributes.Hidden;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>They seem to set the hidden Attribute on the first connect, so the files are not easily discovered.</p><p>We have multiple options to attack this system. We can either try to dump the firmware of the main controller chip and reverse engineer that, or we understand, how a “Kekz” works.</p><p>As we currently have little information about the controller, and we haven’t looked into the NFC Communication yet, let’s first check the cookies themselves and go the easy route.</p><h2 id="you-get-a-cookie-and-you-get-a-cookie">You get a cookie and you get a cookie.</h2><p>I have a <a href="https://proxmark.com/">Proxmark3</a> lying around and if we try to “just read” a Kekz, it will result in an error, as it seems to be locked:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>[usb] pm3 --&gt; hf mfu info

We just have access to the ones we have already seen.
As those tags are 13.35Mhz, is is also possible to write them by your Phones NFC (you will see this later on)</p><h2 id="what-does-this-string-mean">What does this string mean?</h2><p>We have this weird string <code>en002071696263</code> which has something to do with playing the content and we know the content is probably one of those directories we did see earlier on the SD-card.</p><p>If we begin to delete one directory after the other, we can determine which directory has the desired content inside. For this cookie, the directory is <code>0020</code>. If we look into other cookies we will see the structure is:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cookie</th><th>String</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cookie Crew 1</td><td>en 0020 71696263</td></tr><tr><td>Cookie Crew 1</td><td>en 0020 71696263</td></tr><tr><td>Feuerwehrman Sam</td><td>en 0002 6161777a</td></tr><tr><td>Was ist Was</td><td>en 0031 67766172</td></tr><tr><td>Hotzenplotz</td><td>en 0006 73657463</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I can move those files to a directory <code>4444</code>, the files will be played, but garbage output. This means the <code>0020</code> is important for the decryption phase.
Renaming <code>0020</code> to something else will result in an “unbaked” Chip.
If i move the files to a directory <code>1020</code>, they will be played just fine, after rebranding the chip to <code>en102071696263</code></p><p>We could try more stuff to understand the encryption, but…let us recap</p><ol><li>the four integers number after <code>en</code> is the directory</li><li>they are partially important for the decryption.</li><li>four bytes in the end, we don’t know the purpose, but they are essential for decryption</li></ol><h2 id="moargive-me-moaaaaar">Moar…give me moaaaaar</h2><p>The only crux is, we only can decrypt stuff we have already seen, but i want to have an attack on everything.</p><p>We could brute force the 4 Bytes. Without any further assumption, this would be <code>255**4</code> possibilities, which is way to many.</p><p>But if we look into the last four bytes more closely, we can assume one last thing:
In our examples, the four bytes are hex representation for four small letters from the alphabet.</p><p>With this assumption, we can bring this down to <code>26**4</code>. That sounds more reasonable, but can we attack the crypto further?</p><p>Lucky for us, they published an application which can write a cookie named “Wunderkekz”. This App can encrypt arbitrary MP3 files to the correct <code>kez</code>-Fileformat. And more Lucky for us: it is written in csharp.</p><p>Therefore, we can take a look into the encryption routine (i translated it to python, variable naming directly from the original decompilation):</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span>str_crumb_hex <span>=</span> sys<span>.</span>argv[<span>3</span>] <span># #"E9-F5-33-6B" # Assuming this value based on your previous examples</span>

</code></pre><p>We talked about the two vias <code>DP</code> and <code>DM</code>. Interestingly, we are not finding any other connection to the chip, no UART, no JTAG, nothing.
Looking into Jie-li, they are pretty weird chips. The documentation and various sources, state they are programmed over the normal USB Data lines. There are two main methods to control them.</p><h2 id="signaling-dpdm-on-usb">Signaling DP/DM on USB</h2><p>The normal way to put the chip into DFU mode would be sending a custom pullup/pulldown over the <code>D+</code> and <code>D-</code>:
<img src="https://nv1t.github.io/blog/img/2024/ad221d82128b7872b20afc5731412ff7.png" alt="">
After this signal, <code>D+</code> and <code>D-</code> gets pulled to Ground for <code>2ms</code> and the device boots up into the DFU Mode with uboot.</p><p>There are special programmer to achieve this, but i’ve seen a post, where somebody build his/her own programmer with an arduino.</p><p>I tried to achieve this with a raspberry pi pico and couldn’t get the Chip into DFU mode. I even tried to use the special programmer for this, but still…no luck.</p><p>In addition, i thought, the windows application does some magic to connect them and read/write content of the headphones. How?! That has to work without any extra hardware and you don’t have such control over the USB data lines from an operating system application.</p><h2 id="hid-communication">HID Communication</h2><p>The other more convenient option for these chips are: they might have special commands over HID which reconnect them in different stages.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/">https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41738502">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cartographist is an experimental web browser optimized for rabbit-holing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of opening new windows (with <code>cmd</code>-click), Cartographist spawns horizontally scrollable panes.</li>
<li>Instead of forcing you to find things in a linear history, Cartographist shows a tree-structured outline of your browsing:
<img src="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/history.jpg" loading="lazy" width="720" height="280"></li>
<li>Instead of always starting fresh, Cartographist can save, and load "trails" — the exact state of the session you've left — supporting researching topics over long periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more context about the project, you can check out the longer write-up below, which originally appeared as a part of <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/"><span>Q4 2021</span></a> newsletter.</p>

<h2>Transcluded from <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/#cartographist"><span>Cartographist</span></a></h2>
          
<p>During the summer of 2020 I played around with an idea for research-focused web browser, embodying some of the concepts from <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/notes/browsing-vs-searching/"><span>Browsing vs Searching</span></a> note — <em>browsing</em> being an open-ended divergent activity, and <em>searching</em> understood as information retrieval.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/szymon_k/status/1289942401318977537" target="_blank"><span>I shared a preview on Twitter</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a>, to a surprisingly overwhelming response, but I got distracted with other things and never got back to the project. I still occasionally get requests for sharing this, so here it is: <a href="https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist" target="_blank"><span>szymonkaliski/Cartographist</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of browsing in panes was inspired by <a href="http://andymatuschak.org/" target="_blank"><span>Andy Matuschak's website layout</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> and some of <a href="http://nateparrott.com/" target="_blank"><span>Nate Parrot's</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> experiments around stacking mobile web browser views next to each other (which I can't seem to find anymore, sorry).
This sort of layout has a long history, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns" target="_blank"><span>Miller columns</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> and the original Smalltalk class browser, and is a great interface for detail-in-context browsing.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also use this technique for navigating code with Vim, where a single shortcut goes to a definition of a function in a new pane:</p>
<p><img src="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/vim-panes.jpg" loading="lazy" width="3536" height="1790"></p><p>(<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/" target="_blank"><span>Glamorous Toolkit</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> is worth checking out, as it takes the idea of pane browsing to another level)</p>
<p>In theory, I also really like the idea of disk-persisted history which allows for going back to a browsing session after a while, and consciously deciding which "topic" I am in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, I don't think having the full history is that useful.
Yes, it's sometimes good to know how you ended up somewhere, but I think what's most valuable about "research" is the synthesis part — grabbing parts of larger wholes, rearranging, recombining, thinking with the material.
A small step in this direction could be persisting scroll position or maybe selection, and making the history editable — allowing users to remove dead ends, add notes, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, it started to feel that I'm solving this problem on a wrong level.
For example, a good window manager could replace Cartographist almost completely —
I played around with columnar layout in <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/hhtwm/"><span>HHTWM</span></a> for a bit, but lack of horizontal scrolling makes it not that useful in the end.</p>
<p>Well, let me know if you have any ideas how to make Cartographist better! Is there anything interesting here that I'm not seeing? Could it be useful to you in any way?</p>

In the decades since, four more areas have been identified around the globe where locals apparently have an increased chance of becoming a centenarian: <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/okinawa">Okinawa</a> in Japan; Nicoya in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/costa-rica">Costa Rica</a>; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ikaria">Ikaria</a> in Greece and Loma Linda in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/california">California</a>. These so-called Blue Zones have inspired countless studies, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-blue-zones-solution-eating-and-living-like-the-world-s-healthiest-people-by-dan-buettner-book-review-bluezone-thinking-for-a-long-and-healthy-existence-10224244.html">cookbooks</a>, travel stories and even their own Netflix documentary series (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/blue-zones-netflix-diet-documentary-b2408185.html">2023’s <em>Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones</em></a>). The trouble is, the outlandish claims about the life-giving properties of these regions just don’t stand up to close scrutiny.</p><p>Last month, Dr Saul Newman of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work debunking Blue Zones. Newman’s investigation into serious flaws in the data about the world’s oldest people saw him take home an award that has been handed out since 1991 for scientific research that “makes people laugh, and then think.” Newman says that when he looked into the claims about Blue Zones he found a pattern of significant data being routinely ignored if it didn’t fit the desired narrative, and statistical anomalies that could be better explained by administrative errors or cases of pension fraud. “It’s as if you gave the captain of the Titanic nine goes at it and he’s smacked into the iceberg every time,” Newman tells <em>The Independent </em>of the research. “What’s most astounding is that nobody in the academic community seems to have thought it’s ridiculous before this. It’s absurd.”</p><p>Take Sardinia, the original Blue Zone. While it was purported to be home to crowds of centenarians, European Union figures show that the island only ranks around 36-44th for longevity in the continent. Many of those who were supposed to have reached very old age in their Italian idyll turned out to in fact be dead, they just hadn’t been reported as such to the authorities. “Sometimes the mafia is involved, sometimes it’s carers,” says Newman. “There’s a lot of cases in Italy where younger relatives have just kept claiming the pension even though granddad’s out the back in the olive garden.”</p><div><figure><div data-gallery-length="3"><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/GettyImages-1235544411.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/GettyImages-1235544411.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/GettyImages-1235544411.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Natividad Talia Matarrita Fonseca, 93, at home in the supposed ‘Blue Zone’ of Nicoya, Costa Rica"></p></div><figcaption>Natividad Talia Matarrita Fonseca, 93, at home in the supposed ‘Blue Zone’ of Nicoya, Costa Rica<span> <!-- -->(<!-- -->Ezequiel Becerra/AFP via Getty Images<!-- -->)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Something similar seems to have been happening in Nicoya in Costa Rica, where around 40-50% of centenarians were found to have misreported their ages, and on the Greek island of Ikaria. In 2015, Germany requested that Greece audit their spending as a condition of their bailout during the financial crisis. Until then, Greece had been paying pensions to around 9,000 centenarians. After the audit, that figure dropped by 72%. “That number comes from the Greek minister who was handing out the pensions,” says Newman. “He’s the guy with the most incentive to minimize the problem of anybody in the world, and he’s saying that 72% are rubbish.”</p><figure><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7892fd45317565c6" viewBox="0 0 80 47"><path fill="#ec1a2e" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"></path></svg></span><div><blockquote><p>When they’ve measured Okinawa it doesn’t do any of the things they claim Blue Zones do. Not even close. It’s comedically wrong</p></blockquote></div><p>Dr Saul Newman</p></figure><p>Claims about the Blue Zones have gone far beyond simply saying that people in the regions live longer than average. Author Dan Buettner, who founded the Blue Zones LLC marketing company in 2008, has outlined what he calls the “Power 9” factors prevalent in these areas that contribute to long, healthy lives. These are: exercising by moving naturally, having a purpose, “downshifting” routines to reduce stress, stopping eating when 80% full, eating largely plant-based diets, drinking 1-2 glasses of wine per day, a sense of religious faith or belonging, putting their families first and living in positive social networks.</p><p>However, when Newman looked into whether these characteristics are true in Okinawa, he found a wide gap between the claims and reality. “There’s some extraordinary cognitive dissonance going on,” he says. “The Japanese run one of the largest and longest-running nutritional surveys in the world. It covers 96% of their citizens, and when they’ve measured Okinawa it doesn’t do any of the things they claim Blue Zones do. Not even close. It’s comedically wrong.”</p><p>Take for example the claim made on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bluezones.com/2016/11/power-9/">BlueZones.com</a> that Okinawans are disproportionately filled with “Ikigai”, a sense of purpose in their life. That’s just not true: in fact, Okinawa has the 4th highest suicide rate in Japan. Similarly, claims that the area is particularly religious don’t hold water. “They’re the least religious place in Japan,” says Newman. “93% atheist.”</p><p>How did the idea that Okinawa is a great place to grow old take root in the first place? Newman attributes it in part to the fire-bombing of the area by the US during World War II, which caused the destruction of countless birth certificates and other records. “Within Okinawa, the distribution of centenarians is predicted by who had their Hall of Records blown up,” he says. “You have an occupying army of GIs who don’t really speak Japanese replacing birth certificates because they’ve just blown them sky high. In a town where this has happened, you have more centenarians.”</p><div><figure><div data-gallery-length="3"><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/GettyImages-1366067630.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/GettyImages-1366067630.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/GettyImages-1366067630.jpg?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="US Marines pass each other going to and from the battlefront during the Battle of Okinawa circa June 1945"></p></div><figcaption>US Marines pass each other going to and from the battlefront during the Battle of Okinawa circa June 1945<span> <!-- -->(<!-- -->Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images<!-- -->)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>This wouldn’t be the first time that dubious record-keeping has led to false claims of extreme longevity. For decades, the Guinness Book of Records stated that the world’s oldest man was Pierre Joubert, who had lived to the grand old age of 113 years, 124 days. It later turned out that record keepers had conflated a father’s birth date with the death date of his son, who was also named Pierre Joubert. In fact, the elder Joubert had died at the more reasonable age of 65 – a fact that had been written on his death certificate the whole time, if anybody had bothered to check.</p><p>For Newman, claims about the health benefits of the supposed Blue Zone lifestyle lose all credibility when you understand how unsupported the premise is by empirical data. “Firstly, does lying to the public matter?” he asks. “Secondly, the astounding thing is that one of the guidelines is that you should drink every day at twice the NHS heavy drinking guidelines. That is a recipe for alcoholism. It’s mad that it’s being propelled as health advice. If you were a doctor telling your patient to drink every day, you’d get disbarred.”</p><p>The suggestion that daily boozing is a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle is particularly strange when you consider the fifth Blue Zone, Loma Linda. This small city in Southern California is home to a large community of tee-total Seventh Day Adventists. The area was added to the list in 2008, and then in 2020 Buettner sold Blue Zones LLC to Adventist Health, the health care system of the Seventh Day Adventist Church. “Why are Seventh Day Adventists, who claim this as their core belief, pushing people to drink?” asks Newman. “They’re supposed to be sober. It’s just baffling to me.”</p><p><em>The Independent </em>has approached Blue Zones LLC for comment.</p><p>In the end, it might be time to retire the concept of Blue Zones and write the whole thing off as a collective case of wishful thinking. “People do not want to go jogging,” says Newman. “They don’t want to give up drinking. They don’t want to give up smoking. They want there to be some far flung, exotic island where everything’s okay and if you eat the goji berries you’re gold. It’s a nice dream, and it has always, throughout the entirety of history, sold well. But is it true? I would suggest jogging.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <div><p>IR-2024-258, Oct. 3, 2024</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service announced today that Direct File will be available for the 2025 tax filing season in double the number of states than last year’s pilot, and it will cover a wider range of tax situations, greatly expanding the number of taxpayers eligible to use the free e-filing service.</p>

<h2>State and eligibility expansion</h2>

<p>For the 2025 tax filing season, eligible taxpayers in 24 states will be able to use Direct File: 12 states that were part of the pilot last year, plus 12 new states where Direct File will be available in the upcoming filing season.</p>

<p>During the pilot last year, Direct File was available in <strong>Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State</strong> and <strong>Wyoming</strong>. For the 2025 tax filing season, Direct File will also be available in <strong>Alaska, Connecticut, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania</strong> and <strong>Wisconsin</strong>.</p>

<p>In 2025, more than 30 million taxpayers in those 24 states will be eligible to use Direct File. Additional states could still join Direct File in 2025, and several states have expressed interest or announced that they will participate in Direct File in 2026.</p>

<p>In addition to doubling the number of states where Direct File will be available, the service will also cover a wider range of tax situations for the 2025 filing season. During the pilot last year, Direct File covered limited tax situations, including wage income reported on a W-2 form, Social Security income, unemployment compensation and certain credits and deductions. For the 2025 filing season, Direct File will support <strong>1099’s for interest income greater than $1,500, retirement income</strong> and the <strong>1099 for Alaska residents reporting the Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. </strong></p>

<p>During the pilot, Direct File supported taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents. This year, Direct File will also cover taxpayers claiming the<strong> Child and Dependent Care Credit, Premium Tax Credit</strong>, <strong>Credit for the Elderly and Disabled, </strong>and <strong>Retirement Savings Contribution Credits.</strong> In addition to covering taxpayers claiming the standard deduction and deductions for student loan interest and educator expenses, this year, Direct File will support taxpayers claiming deductions for <strong>Health Savings Accounts</strong>. Over the coming years, the IRS will gradually expand Direct File’s scope to support most common tax situations, focusing – in particular – on tax situations that impact working families.</p>

<p>“We’re excited about the improvements to Direct File and the millions more taxpayers who will be eligible to use the service this year,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. “Above all, our goal is to improve the experience of tax filing itself and help taxpayers meet their obligations quickly and easily. Direct File will be a critical part of achieving that goal as we expand and improve the service.”</p>

<h2>Direct File service improvements</h2>

<p>Direct File is a web-based service that works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. It guides taxpayers through a series of questions to prepare their federal tax return step-by-step. Last year, thousands of Direct File users got help from IRS customer service representatives through a live chat feature in English and Spanish. Once taxpayers have completed their federal tax return, the Direct File system automatically guides them to state tools to complete their state tax filings.</p>

<p>For the 2025 filing season, Direct File will include new features to make filing taxes quicker and easier. Direct File users can try a new chat bot to help guide them through the eligibility checker. Live chat will again be available in English and Spanish, and users can opt into additional authentication and verification, which will allow customer service representatives to provide more information.</p>

<p>“User experience, both within the Direct File tool and the integration with state tax systems, will continue to be the foundation for Direct File moving forward,” Werfel said. “We will focus – first and foremost – on continuing to get it right. Accuracy and comprehensive tax credit uptake will be paramount concerns to ensure taxpayers file a correct return and get the refund to which they’re entitled.”</p>

<h2>Direct File’s role in the tax system</h2>

<p>Following a successful pilot during the 2024 tax filing season, where more than 140,000 taxpayers across 12 states used Direct File, the IRS undertook a comprehensive review of the service and its role in the broader tax system.</p>

<p>Taxpayers across the country told the IRS they want more no-cost electronic filing options. The IRS heard directly from hundreds of organizations across the country, more than 100 members of Congress, individual Direct File users and from those that are interested in using Direct File. Millions of taxpayers who did not live in one of the12 pilot states visited the Direct File website to learn more about the service or asked live chat assistors to make Direct File available in their state.</p>

<p>In May 2024, the IRS announced that Direct File would be a permanent tax filing option, and the service is working with all states interested in participating. In the coming years, Direct File will continue to be one option among many from which taxpayers can choose, and it will complement important options, such as preparation by tax professionals or through commercial software providers, who are critical partners with the IRS in delivering a successful tax system for the nation.</p>

<p>The IRS also noted another side effect of the Direct File pilot was increased attention on all free filing options, including an increase in usage of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a2fc2c3-9e78-4514-b1dc-6959b2f5e891" href="https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free" title="File your taxes for free">Free File</a>. The IRS remains committed to the ongoing relationship with Free File, Inc., which has served taxpayers for two decades in the joint effort to provide free commercial software. Last spring, the IRS signed a five-year extension with industry to continue Free File. As the IRS works to expand Direct File, it will work to strengthen all free filing options for taxpayers, including Free File, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fecfa7e8-e586-490e-90bb-044d87b74fcf" href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers" title="Free tax return preparation for qualifying taxpayers">Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE)</a> – all of which saw increased usage and interest last year.</p>

<p>“Direct File is an important component of a stronger, more comprehensive tax system that gives taxpayers electronic filing options that best suit their needs,” Werfel said. “It is a critical tool in the IRS’ effort to meet taxpayers where they are, give them options to interact with us in ways that work for them and help them meet their tax obligations as easily and quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>Direct File will begin accepting tax returns when the filing season opens.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>This is an easter egg in <code>man</code>. When you run <code>man</code> without specifying the page or with <code>-w</code>, it outputs "gimme gimme gimme" to stderr, but only at 00:30:</p>

<pre><code># date +%T -s "00:30:00"
00:30:00
# man -w
gimme gimme gimme
/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man
</code></pre>

<p>The exit code is always 0.</p>

<p>The correct output should always be:</p>

<pre><code># man -w
/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man
# echo $?
0
# man
What manual page do you want?
# echo $?
1
</code></pre>

<p>The string "gimme gimme gimme" can be found in RHEL, OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian and probably more, so it's not really distro specific. You can <code>grep</code> your <code>man</code> binary to verify.</p>

<p><a href="http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/tree/src/man.c#n4122" rel="noreferrer">This code is responsible for the output</a>, added by <a href="http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/man.c?id=002a6339b1fe8f83f4808022a17e1aa379756d99" rel="noreferrer">this commit</a>:</p>

<pre><code>src/man.c-1167- if (first_arg == argc) {
src/man.c-1168-   /*

src/man.c:1173:     fprintf (stderr, "gimme gimme gimme\n");
</code></pre>

<p>I have contacted RHEL support about this issue.</p>

<p>The string comes from well known <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEjLoHdbVeE&amp;t=1m10s" rel="noreferrer">ABBA song Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The developer of the man-db, Colin Watson, decided that there was enough fun and the story won't get forgotten and <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/?id=b225d9e76fbb0a6a4539c0992fba88c83f0bd37e" rel="noreferrer">removed the easter egg completely</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you Colin!</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The name <code>perfctl</code>&nbsp;comes from the cryptominer process that drains the system’s resources, causing significant issues for many Linux developers. By combining “perf” (a Linux performance monitoring tool) with “ctl” (commonly used to indicate control in command-line tools), the malware authors crafted a name that appears legitimate. This makes it easier for users or administrators to overlook during initial investigations, as it blends in with typical system processes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">After exploiting a vulnerability (as in our case) or a misconfiguration, the main payload is downloaded from an HTTP server controlled by the attacker.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In our case, the main payload was named <code>httpd</code>, and it demonstrated multiple layers of execution, showcasing a deliberate design to ensure persistence and evade detection. Once executed, the main payload copies itself from memory to a new location in the ‘/tmp’ directory, runs the new binary from there, terminates the original process, and then deletes the initial binary to cover its tracks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The main payload is now executed from the <code>/tmp</code> directory under a different name. Based on what we’ve seen the malware chose the name of the process that originally executed it, thus it looks less suspicious, if the system is examined.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In our case the malware was executed by <code>sh</code>, thus the name of the malware was changed from <code>httpd</code> to <code>sh</code>. At this point, it functions as both a dropper and a local command-and-control (C2) process. The malware contains an exploit to CVE-2021-4043, which it is trying to run in order to gain root privilege on the server.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The malware continues to copy itself from memory to half a dozen other locations, with names that appear as conventional system files. It also drops a rootkit and a few popular Linux utilities that were modified to serve as user land rootkits (i.e. ldd, lsof). A cryptominer is also dropped and in some executions, we also observed some proxy-jacking software transferred from a remote server and executed.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As part of its command-and-control operation, the malware opens a Unix socket, creates two directories under the <code>/tmp</code>&nbsp;directory, and stores data there that influences its operation. This data includes host events, locations of the copies of itself, process names, communication logs, tokens, and additional log information. Additionally, the malware uses environment variables to store data that further affects its execution and behavior.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">All the binaries are packed, stripped, and encrypted, indicating significant efforts to bypass defense mechanisms and hinder reverse engineering attempts. The malware also uses advanced evasion techniques, such as suspending its activity when it detects a new user in the <code>btmp</code>&nbsp;or <code>utmp</code> files and terminating any competing malware to maintain control over the infected system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto"><code>Httpd</code> then stops and deletes itself.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The attacker modifies the <code>~/.profile</code> script, which sets up the environment during user login. This script is designed to execute the malware first, followed by the legitimate workload expected to run on the server. It checks if <code>/root/.config/cron/perfcc</code> is an executable file, and if so, it runs the malware.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, the script ensures that in Bash environments, the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file is executed, applying user-specific configurations such as aliases and environment variables—likely to maintain normal server operations while the malware runs. Finally, the script suppresses <code>mesg</code>&nbsp;errors to avoid any visible warnings during execution.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4 aria-level="3">Appendix 1: Initial Access</h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">CVE-2023-33246 is a vulnerability found in <code>RocketMQ</code>, which is a software that manages messages. This vulnerability allows unauthorized execution of commands on systems where <code>RocketMQ</code> is installed. This issue occurs because RocketMQ does not adequately check who is trying to access it, which means anyone, even without permission, can make changes or execute commands. The problem is made worse because the parts of <code>RocketMQ</code> that handle storing and delivering messages were not designed to be directly accessible over the internet, and they don’t require authentication for performing sensitive operations like updating settings. This makes it relatively easy for attackers to exploit this vulnerability.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The binary <code>httpd</code>&nbsp;is a packed ELF (<code>MD5: 656e22c65bf7c04d87b5afbe52b8d800</code>) bears many detections in VirusTotal, including general Linux Trojan, Coinminer, Exploitation tool for CVE-2021-4034, malware dropper etc.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our analysis shows that in a way all these detections are correct, as in a nutshell this is a multipurpose malware-dropper that contains all the above.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As per the main payload, it is named in the download server as avatar.php, after it is downloaded, it’s renamed to <code>httpd</code>.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Next, the <code>httpd</code> executable is copied from the running process into to <code>/tmp</code> directory, as illustrated in Figure 33 below.

          <p>Cox Communications is lowering Internet upload speeds in entire neighborhoods to stop what it considers "excessive usage," in a decision that punishes both heavy Internet users and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Cox, a cable company with about 5.2 million broadband customers in the United States, has been sending notices to some heavy Internet users warning them to use less data and notifying them of neighborhood-wide speed decreases. In the case we will describe in this article, a gigabit customer who was paying $50 extra per month for unlimited data was flagged by Cox because he was using 8TB to 12TB a month.</p>
<p>Cox responded by lowering the upload speeds on the gigabit-download plan from 35Mbps to 10Mbps for the customer's whole neighborhood. Cox confirmed to Ars that it has imposed neighborhood-wide slowdowns in multiple neighborhoods in cases like this one but didn't say how many excessive users are enough to trigger a speed decrease.</p>
<p>Mike, a Cox customer from Gainesville, Florida, pays $150 a month, including $100 for 1Gbps download speeds and 35Mbps upload speeds, and another $50 for "unlimited data" so that he can go over <a href="https://www.cox.com/residential/internet/learn/data-usage.html">Cox's 1TB data cap</a>. Mike told Ars via email that most of his 8TB+ monthly use consists of scheduled device backups and "data sharing via various (encrypted) information-sharing protocols," such as peer-to-peer networks, between 1am and 8am. (We agreed to publish Mike's first name only but reviewed his bills and confirmed the basic details of his account with Cox.)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, data usage for most households declines significantly during those 1am-8am overnight hours, so a robustly built broadband network should be able to handle the traffic. In any case, Mike couldn't use more than 35Mbps for uploads at any given time because that's the limit Cox always imposed on its gigabit-download cable plan. Mike said his household's daytime and evening use is more like a typical Internet user's, with work-from-home activities during the day and streaming video in high-definition during the evening.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Mike also said his level of Internet usage has been roughly the same for the past four years that he's been using Cox—but it was only in mid-May that the company flagged him for excessive use. This may suggest that Cox is struggling to handle pandemic-level broadband traffic, but Cox says that the vast majority of its network is "performing very well."</p>
<p>Cox provided a little more detail after this story published, saying that the neighborhood-wide slowdowns and disconnection threats sent to individual customers "are two separate initiatives that could cross over in some cases."</p>
<p>(<em>Clarification</em>: Mike's nightly uploads alone couldn't have accounted for more than half of his monthly 8TB+ usage if his upload speeds were capped at 35Mbps; seven hours of nightly uploads at that rate would amount to about 3.3TB per month. The nightly uploads may have accounted for most of his upload usage, however, as his monthly usage of 8TB to 12TB includes both downloads and uploads. Assuming Mike was also downloading heavily during those 1-8am hours, then the overnight usage including both downloads and uploads would account for most of his overall data usage.)</p>
<h2>“Scheduled for termination”</h2>
<p>First, Mike got three calls from Cox including one that left a voicemail saying, "we need to speak with you regarding your Internet usage. Your home is using an extraordinarily high amount of Internet data and adjustments need to be made immediately." The voicemail warned that your "Internet will be scheduled for termination" unless usage reductions are "made within five days," according to Mike.</p>
<p>Mike explained how he responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since I work from home, I naturally was very concerned they would pull the plug on me and I'd be unable to work. Immediately calling the number [provided in the voicemail], I was funneled directly to a department for "questions about your recent Internet speed changes," and spoke with a representative there. He went on to explain that their network is overburdened and since I was an above-average user, I was being targeted to lower my usage or else have my account terminated... I tried to explain that my usage is not out of the ordinary for me. My day-time bandwidth usage is paltry (most of my bandwidth consumption is scheduled from 1am-8am), and that Cox should have been upgrading their infrastructure instead of oversubscribing nodes and pocketing the record revenue. I was told if I did not make a substantial decrease in my upload data usage, my service would be terminated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/gkicjg/cox_internet_speeds_lately/fr670cx/">Reddit thread last month</a> confirm that Mike isn't the only Cox customer being warned to cut upload speeds in order to avoid being kicked off the network.&nbsp;Cox didn't tell Mike exactly how much data he'd have to shave off his monthly usage. There was "no magic number or threshold, just an arbitrary amount of decrease, a Cox-deemed 'good effort,'" or his service would be cut off, he said.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Shortly after that phone call, Mike received an email from Cox with the subject line, "Alert: Action required to continue your Internet service." Mike provided Ars with a copy of the email.</p>
<p>"We've recently tried getting in touch with you about your service—your account has been identified as using an extremely high level of bandwidth, which is causing a negative impact on our network and our other customers across your neighborhood," the email said. Mike's "extraordinarily high" upload usage "is negatively impacting Internet service of other customers, which is a violation of our <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/acceptable-use-policy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, the email said. The policy contains a broad prohibition on transmitting amounts of data large enough to disrupt the network, but it doesn't specify an amount.</p>
<p>The real kicker is that Cox's email to Mike said that everyone in his neighborhood will get lower upload speeds until July 15:</p>
<blockquote><p>During these unprecedented times, many people are working and schooling from home, and maintaining connectivity is important. We are working to provide a positive Internet experience for everyone, so we've adjusted our Gigablast upload speeds in your neighborhood from 35Mbps to 10Mbps, now through July 15, 2020. Your download speeds have not changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cox's email doesn't specifically state that Mike's usage spurred the decision to impose a neighborhood-wide slowdown, but this is apparently only happening in a small percentage of neighborhoods where Cox has seen heavier use than elsewhere in its network.</p>
<h2>Questions for Cox</h2>
<p>This raises several questions that we asked Cox. We asked the cable company why its network is "unable to handle Mike's uploads in the middle of the night" and whether it has "considered adding capacity to its network instead of forcing unlimited-data customers to use less data." We asked Cox how much data, specifically, customers who pay for unlimited data are actually allowed to use, and "Why isn't Mike allowed to use unlimited data when he is paying for the highest speeds and paying extra for unlimited data?"</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We also asked why Cox is imposing slowdowns throughout entire neighborhoods instead of only on the people allegedly violating the Acceptable Use Policy and whether the slowdowns are imposed even when only a single customer in a neighborhood is flagged for excessive usage. We also asked how many people in Mike's neighborhood are affected by the upload-speed decrease and whether they will get discounts to reflect their reduced service.</p>
<p>Cox didn't provide as much detail as we were looking for, but it confirmed the neighborhood-wide speed decreases, saying it has "identified a small number of neighborhoods where performance can be improved for all customers in the neighborhood by temporarily increasing or maintaining download speeds and changing upload speeds for some of our service tiers."</p>
<p>Cox defended the temporary 10Mbps upload speed for its gigabit-download plan, saying that "10Mbps is plenty of speed for the vast majority of customers to continue their regular activity and have a positive experience." Of course, customers paying extra for Cox's fastest plan and unlimited data are more likely to be outliers who do need high upstream bandwidth. Unlike fiber-to-the-home service, in which ISPs offer symmetrical upstream and downstream speeds, cable service generally has much lower uploads than downloads. Cox offers symmetrical gigabit speeds in some areas where it has deployed fiber directly to homes but provides slower upload speeds on its cable network. Cable users may eventually get symmetrical upload and download speeds from an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/envious-of-5g-hype-cable-cos-unveil-potentially-confusing-10g-trademark/">upgrade to DOCSIS</a>, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/speeds-and-data-plans.html">Cox webpage</a> that was updated on April 30 says that the gigabit plan's upload speeds are now "10Mbps in limited areas to support consistent service across customers during periods of sustained increased Internet usage."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The now-repealed net neutrality rules likely wouldn't have prevented this kind of data slowdown, as the slowdown would presumably fall under an exception for "reasonable network management." But the Obama-era system in which ISPs were regulated as common carriers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/how-title-ii-goes-beyond-net-neutrality-to-protect-internet-users-from-isps/">gave more rights to consumers</a> to complain about unreasonable rates and practices, perhaps giving extra impetus to ISPs to upgrade their networks instead of limiting their users. Cox is a private company and thus doesn't report network-upgrade spending publicly, but major ISPs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/ajit-pai-promised-faster-broadband-expansion-comcast-cut-spending-instead/">Comcast</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/att-slashed-billions-from-network-spending-cut-tens-of-thousands-of-jobs/">AT&amp;T</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/charter-will-spend-less-on-cable-network-in-2019-but-charge-customers-more/">Charter</a> have reduced network spending since the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/">repealed</a> its net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation. (<strong>Update</strong>: Harold Feld, senior VP of consumer-advocacy group Public Knowledge, <a href="https://twitter.com/haroldfeld/status/1270371055262203906">says</a> that "Cox's&nbsp;going after unspecified 'excess uploaders' would probably have violated the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/how-the-net-neutrality-repeal-helps-isps-keep-their-hidden-fees-hidden/">enhanced disclosure rules</a> under the 2015 net neutrality order.")</p>
<p>Cox told Ars that it "will continue to work with anyone who is violating our Acceptable Use Policy with excessive use to help ensure everyone can have a positive Internet experience."</p>
<h2>Cox says network “performing very well”</h2>
<p>Cox told Ars its "network is performing very well overall" during the pandemic, and that out of 28,000 neighborhood nodes across the US, 98 to 99 percent "are performing with adequate capacity even with the tremendous level of increased peak usage." If Cox's 5.2 million paying broadband customers are spread equally across nodes, each node would serve about 185 households.</p>
<p>Cox said that it always "keep[s] a close eye at the individual node level to make sure we don't approach any congestion thresholds and need to make any adjustments. Similar to our normal process, if we see the network reach or exceed utilization thresholds we will accelerate network upgrade plans in the impacted areas. This could include splitting nodes, pulling additional fiber, equipment swaps and/or core network changes, all of which add capacity to the area."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But those measures apparently aren't enough to handle users like Mike, Cox said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In some instances a number of excessive users, like the customer you referenced, are causing congestion problems in a small number of neighborhoods by utilizing over 100-200 times more upstream bandwidth than the average household. This type of excessive usage is negatively impacting the service of other customers, which is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy. It is not our desire to terminate anyone's service, but we may need to address excessive usage out of fairness to the rest of our customers, especially during this time when households are even more dependent on a good Internet experience...</p>
<p>In the case of the customer you mentioned, we have communicated with him about our concerns and it appears he has made adjustments to his usage to operate within our Acceptable Use Policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike confirmed to Ars that he has lowered his use by limiting overnight upload speeds to 400kbps, "so that it is always throttled." His usage in the 2.5 weeks since May 22 is 2.1TB, putting him well below his usual monthly pace.</p>
<h2>Pandemic spurs extra broadband use</h2>
<p>Broadband networks have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/pandemic-hasnt-crushed-broadband-networks-even-rural-areas-are-doing-ok/">mostly held up well</a> during the pandemic. Cable-lobby group NCTA, which represents Cox and other cable companies, <a href="https://www.ncta.com/COVIDdashboard">says</a> that "networks are engineered to provide superior performance throughout the day" and that "provider-backbone networks have significant capacity and show no signs of congestion." Since March 1, NCTA says that peak upstream traffic has risen 26.2 percent and peak download traffic has risen 9.1 percent.</p>
<p>Cox told us that "a small percentage of nodes... were approaching congestion levels prior to" the pandemic, and that "the dramatically increased use in those neighborhoods has pushed [them] beyond the threshold where performance will be impacted. These speed adjustments are temporary while we try to keep as many people as possible connected during the crisis."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Mike said he suspects Cox is limiting upload speeds "because their network can't handle the increase of residential live video conference streaming" that has happened during the pandemic. Recently, Mike said he has been seeing upload speeds of only 4Mbps to 5Mbps.</p>
<h2>Coming soon: A price increase</h2>
<p>Mike's bill is currently lower than usual because Cox, like other ISPs, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/comcast-waives-data-cap-until-at-least-june-30-in-response-to-pandemic/">providing unlimited data</a> to all customers during the pandemic. The waiver of the $50 monthly unlimited-data charge temporarily knocked his bill down to $100, and Cox provided a further $20 discount on his latest bill. Mike's bill doesn't explain the reason for the $20 credit, but it could be because of the new upload data limit.</p>
<p>But Cox is already signaling that Mike is in for a price increase in the near future. Today, Mike told Ars that "I just got an alert after logging in that my one-year introduction rate is now over, so I'll be paying $175 a month for 'unlimited' data once the current data-overage exceptions expire. Yay."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Robert Dennard, DRAM Pioneer, Dies at 91"><p><strong>Robert Dennard </strong></p><p>Inventor of Dynamic RAM </p><p>Fellow, 91; died 23 April</p><p>In 1967 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/thanks-for-the-memories" target="_self">Dennard</a> invented what is known as DRAM—a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell consisting of a tiny capacitor and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a>. </p><p>Before his invention, RAM required bulky, power-hungry components that were expensive to produce. His breakthrough paved the way for inexpensive, high-density, and commercially available memory.</p><p>The computing pioneer received the 2009 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-medal-of-honor/" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for his innovation.</p><p>Dennard began his career as a staff engineer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a>’s New York City research lab. He worked on new devices and circuits for logic and memory applications and developed advanced data communication techniques. </p><p>He was transferred in 1961 to IBM’s newly opened <a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Watson Research Center</a>, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., where he worked on field-effect transistors and integrated circuits, using a six-transistor memory cell for each bit of data, the standard at the time. In 1968 Dennard successfully reduced a RAM cell to a small capacitor and a single field-effect transistor—the device that became known as DRAM. He was granted a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3387286A/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> for his invention in 1968. </p><p>By the early 1970s, DRAM was standard in virtually all computers. A decade later, the device powered the first PCs—including the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> 5150—allowing them to perform more complex operations.</p><p>After DRAM’s success, Dennard turned his attention to transistors. In 1972 he developed principles for scaling metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices, the main building block in low-power and high-performance very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. IEEE Fellow <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/50-years-of-moores-law/" target="_self">Gordon Moore</a> had predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, but Dennard proposed that as transistors got smaller, their power consumption would remain nearly constant. He published his theory, now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennard scaling</a>, with a set of supporting principles in the 1974 paper “<a href="http://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/dennard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Design of Ion-Implanted MOSFETs With Very Small Physical Dimensions</a>.”</p><p>Dennard was named an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/ibm_fellows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM Fellow</a> in 1979. For the next several decades at the company, he worked on metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, refining RAM and developing low-voltage, high-performance circuits. </p><p>During his career, he was honored with dozens of awards including the 2019 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-robert-n-noyce-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal</a> and the 2001 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Edison Medal</a>. In 1997 Dennard was inducted into the <a href="https://www.invent.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Inventors Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p>He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering in 1954 and 1956 from <a href="https://www.smu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Southern Methodist University</a>, in Dallas. Two years later he earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now part of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a>).</p><p><strong>Richard P. Schulz</strong></p><p>Power systems engineer</p><p>Life Fellow, 87; died 29 May</p><p><a href="https://www.donohuefuneralhome.com/obituaries/richard-schulz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schulz</a> began his career in 1959 as a power systems engineer at <a href="https://www.ge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Electric</a> in Schenectady, N.Y. He worked there until 1987, when he joined <a href="https://www.aep.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Electric Power</a> in Columbus, Ohio. He retired in 2000 and became a consultant.</p><p>He specialized in power systems analysis. </p><p>Schulz, a member of the <a href="https://ieee-pes.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Power &amp; Energy Society</a>, authored or coauthored <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37285469200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">32 papers</a> on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/power-grid">power grid</a> testing reliability that were featured in IEEE publications.</p><p>He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical and mechanical engineering in 1959 from <a href="https://www2.lehigh.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lehigh University</a>, in Bethlehem, Pa., and a master’s degree in 1966 from <a href="https://www.union.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union College</a>, in Schenectady. </p><p><strong>C. Gordon Bell</strong></p><p>Developer of early PCs</p><p>Fellow, 89; died 17 May</p><p><a href="https://ethw.org/C._Gordon_Bell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bell</a> helped develop early PCs at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Corp.</a>, a pioneering computer company in Maynard, Mass. He received the 1992 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-john-von-neumann-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE John Von Neumann Medal</a> for “innovative contributions to computer architecture and design.”</p><p>He joined DEC in 1960 and spent his first few years there designing the firm’s minicomputers and time-sharing computers. Time-sharing was a technique that made computing faster and less expensive by allowing multiple users to operate a system concurrently without interfering with each other.</p><p>Bell left DEC in 1966 to join the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now part of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a>) as a professor of computer science and electrical engineering. </p><p>He returned to DEC in 1972 as vice president of R&amp;D and led the development of the company’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VAX minicomputers</a>. Introduced in 1977, the VAX line featured a 32-bit instruction set architecture and virtual memory. Its user-friendly operating system, known as VMS, enabled file sharing, networking, and other new features. </p><p>In 1979 Bell and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Olsen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ken Olsen</a>, the company’s CEO, founded the <a href="https://tcm.computerhistory.org/decmuseum.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Digital Computer Museum</a> in Marlborough, Mass.

(Solar activity waxes and wanes over the course of an 11-year cycle.)</p><p>Solar flares are classified by size into different classes, with X-class flares being the most powerful. M-class flares are 10 times less powerful than X-class, followed by C-class flares, which are 10 times weaker than M-class. B-class flares are 10 times weaker than C-class, and A-class flares are 10 times weaker than B-class and have no noticeable impact on Earth. Each class is further divided by numbers from 1 to 10 (and beyond for X-class flares) to indicate the flare's relative strength.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're interested in tracking space weather and knowing when and where to spot auroras, I suggest downloading a space weather app that provides forecasts based on your location.
