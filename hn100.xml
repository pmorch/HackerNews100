<p>Dependabot is a noise machine. It makes you feel like you’re doing work, but you’re actually discouraging more useful work. This is <em>especially</em> true for security alerts in the Go ecosystem.</p>
<p>I recommend turning it off and replacing it with a pair of scheduled GitHub Actions, one running govulncheck, and the other running your test suite against the latest version of your dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-case-study">A little case study</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, I <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/edwards25519/security/advisories/GHSA-fw7p-63qq-7hpr">published a security fix</a> for <a href="https://filippo.io/edwards25519">filippo.io/edwards25519</a>. The <code>(*Point).MultiScalarMult</code> method would produce invalid results if the receiver was not the identity point.</p>
<p>A lot of the Go ecosystem depends on filippo.io/edwards25519, mostly through <a href="https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql">github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql</a> (228k dependents only on GitHub). <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22filippo.io%2Fedwards25519%22+%2F%5C.MultiScalarMult%2F+language%3AGo+-path%3A*_test.go&amp;type=code">Essentially no one uses <code>(*Point).MultiScalarMult</code>.</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, Dependabot opened <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22d1c650a+extra%3A+initialize+receiver+in+MultiScalarMult%22&amp;type=pullrequests">thousands of PRs</a> against unaffected repositories to update filippo.io/edwards25519. These PRs were accompanied by a security alert with <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fw7p-63qq-7hpr">a nonsensical, made up CVSS v4 score</a> and by a worrying <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/pull/220">73% compatibility score</a>, allegedly based on the breakage the update is causing in the ecosystem. Note that the diff between v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 is <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/edwards25519/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1#diff-0d9d6ab39182b0d5344623ba5d70c2db0e05607b28b9f77067a7120d1ccdeb49">one line in the method no one uses</a>.</p>

<p>We even got <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof/pull/220">one of these alerts</a> for the Wycheproof repository, which <em>does not import the affected filippo.io/edwards25519 package at all</em>. Instead, it only imports the unaffected filippo.io/edwards25519/field package.</p>

<p>We have turned Dependabot off.</p>

<p>But isn’t this toil unavoidable, to prevent attackers from exploiting old vulnerabilities in your dependencies? Absolutely not!</p>
<p>Computers are perfectly capable of doing the work of filtering out these irrelevant alerts for you. The <a href="https://go.dev/doc/security/vuln/">Go Vulnerability Database</a> has rich version, package, <em>and symbol</em> metadata for all Go vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Any decent vulnerability scanner will <em>at the very least</em> filter based on the package, which requires a simple <code>go list -deps ./...</code>. This already silences a lot of noise, because it’s common and good practice for modules to separate functionality relevant to different dependents into different sub-packages.<sup id="fnref:pkgdeps"><a href="#fn:pkgdeps">1</a></sup> For example, it would have avoided the false alert against the Wycheproof repository.</p>
<p>If you use a third-party vulnerability scanner, you should demand at least package-level filtering.</p>
<p><em>Good</em> vulnerability scanners will go further, though, and filter based on the reachability of the vulnerable <em>symbol</em> using static analysis. That’s what <a href="https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/govulncheck">govulncheck</a> does!</p>

<h3 id="replace-dependabot-with-a-govulncheck-github-action">Replace Dependabot with a govulncheck GitHub Action</h3>

</code></pre>
<p>It will run every day and only notify you if there is an actual vulnerability you should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-alert-fatigue">The cost of alert fatigue</h3>
<p>False positive alerts are not only a waste of time, they also reduce security by causing alert fatigue and making proper triage impractical.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability should be assessed for its impact: production might need to be updated, secrets rotated, users notified! A business-as-usual dependency bump is a woefully insufficient remediation for an actual vulnerability, but it’s the only practical response to the constant stream of low-value Dependabot alerts.</p>
<p>This is why as Go Security Team lead back in 2020–2021 I insisted the team invest in staffing the Go Vulnerability Database and implement a vulnerability scanner with static analysis filtering.</p>
<p>The govulncheck Action will not automatically open a PR for you, and that’s a good thing! Now that security alerts are not mostly noise, you can afford to actually look at them and take them seriously, including any required remediation.</p>
<p>Noisy vulnerability scanners also impact the open source ecosystem. I often get issues and PRs demanding I update the dependencies of my projects due to vulnerabilities that don’t affect them, because someone’s scanner is failing to filter them. That’s extra toil dropped at the feet of open source maintainers, which is unsustainable. The maintainer’s <a href="https://geomys.org/standard-of-care">responsibility</a> is making sure projects are not affected by security vulnerabilities. The responsibility of scanning tools is making sure they don’t disturb their users with false positives.</p>
<h2 id="test-against-latest-instead-of-updating">Test against latest instead of updating</h2>
<p>The other purpose of Dependabot is to keep dependencies up to date, regardless of security vulnerabilities. Your practices and requirements will vary, but I find this misguided, too.</p>
<p>Dependencies should be updated according to <em>your</em> development cycle, not the cycle of each of your dependencies. For example you might want to update dependencies all at once when you begin a release development cycle, as opposed to when each dependency completes theirs.</p>
<p>There are two benefits to quick updates, though: first, you can notice and report (or fix) breakage more rapidly, instead of being stalled by an incompatibility that could have been addressed a year prior; second, you reduce your patch delta <em>in case</em> you need to update due to a security vulnerability, reducing the risk of having to rush through a refactor or unrelated fixes.</p>
<p>You can capture both of those benefits without actually updating the dependencies by simply running CI against the latest versions of your dependencies every day. You just need to run <code>go get -u -t ./...</code> before your test suite. In the npm ecosystem, you just run <code>npm update</code> instead of <code>npm ci</code>.</p>
<p>This way, you will still be alerted quickly of any potential issues, without having to pay attention to unproblematic updates, which you can defer to whenever fits your project best.</p>
<p>This is a lot safer, too, because malicious code recently added to a dependency will not rapidly reach users or production, but only CI. Supply chain attacks have a short half-life! You can further mitigate the risk by using a CI sandboxing mechanism like <a href="https://github.com/geomys/sandboxed-step">geomys/sandboxed-step</a>, which uses gVisor to remove <a href="https://words.filippo.io/compromise-survey/#readwrite-ci-permissions-0-root-2-contributing">the ambient authority that GitHub Actions grants every workflow, including supposedly read-only ones</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a diving instructor. I'm also a platform engineer who spends lots of his time thinking about and implementing infrastructure security. Sometimes those two worlds collide in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><img src="https://dixken.de/images/blog/costa-rica.jpg" alt="A frigatebird perched on the boat railing next to a dive flag, somewhere off Cocos Island, Costa Rica">
<em>A Sula sula (Frigatebird) and a dive flag on the actual boat where I found the vulnerability - somewhere off Cocos Island.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>While on a 14 day-long dive trip around Cocos Island in Costa Rica, I stumbled across a vulnerability in the member portal of a major diving insurer - one that I'm personally insured through. What I found was so trivial, so fundamentally broken, that I genuinely couldn't believe it hadn't been exploited already.</p>
<p>I disclosed this vulnerability on <strong>April 28, 2025</strong> with a standard 30-day embargo period. That embargo expired on May 28, 2025 - over <strong>eight months ago</strong>. I waited this long to publish because I wanted to give the organization every reasonable opportunity to fully remediate the issue and notify affected users. The vulnerability has since been addressed, but to my knowledge, I have not received confirmation that affected users were notified. I have reached out to the organization to ask for clarification on this matter.</p>
<p>This is the story of what happened when I tried to do the right thing.</p>
<h2 id="the-vulnerability"><a href="#the-vulnerability">The Vulnerability</a></h2>
<p>To understand why this is so bad, you need to know how the registration process works. As a diving instructor, I register my students (to get them insured) through my account on the portal. I enter their personal information with their consent - name, date of birth, address, phone number, email - and the system creates an account for them. The student then receives an email with their new account credentials: a numeric user ID and a default password. They <em>might</em> log in to complete additional information, or they might never touch the portal again.</p>
<p>When I registered three students in quick succession, they were sitting right next to me and checked their welcome emails. The user IDs were nearly identical - sequential numbers, one after the other. That's when it clicked that something really bad was going on.</p>
<p>Now here's the problem: the portal used <strong>incrementing numeric user IDs</strong> for login. User XXXXXX0, XXXXXX1, XXXXXX2, and so on. That alone is a red flag, but it gets worse: every account was provisioned with a <strong>static default password</strong> that was never enforced to be changed on first login. And many users - especially students who had their accounts created <em>for</em> them by their instructors - never changed it.</p>
<p>So the "authentication" to access a user's full profile - name, address, phone number, email, date of birth - was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guess a number.</li>
<li>Type the same default password that every account shares on account creation.</li>
<li>There's a good chance you get in.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. No rate limiting. No account lockout. No MFA. Just an incrementing integer and a password that might as well have been <code>password123</code>.</p>
<p>I verified the issue with the minimum access necessary to confirm the scope - and stopped immediately after. A significant portion of IDs in the sample were still using the default password. The data exposed wasn't just email addresses - it included full personal profiles, <strong>including those of underage students</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-proof-of-concept"><a href="#the-proof-of-concept">The Proof of Concept</a></h2>
<p>To confirm the issue wasn't limited to a handful of accounts, I wrote a short script that automated what could be done manually in any browser. I first tried Python <code>requests</code>, but the portal's login mechanism was convoluted enough that a clean session wasn't feasible. So I used Selenium - a browser automation tool - which just drives a real browser through the same steps any user would take manually.</p>
<p>The following is a <strong>simplified, non-functional excerpt</strong> of the script. Identifiers, endpoints, and implementation details have been HEAVILY removed or altered - this will not run as-is and is included only to illustrate the triviality of the issue:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># Simplified, non-runnable excerpt - details redacted</span>

<span>def</span> <span>check_account</span>(<span>user_id</span>):
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get(LOGIN_URL)

    driver.find_element(...).send_keys(<span>str</span>(user_id)) <span># numeric user ID</span>
    driver.find_element(...).send_keys(DEFAULT_PASSWORD) <span># same for each user on creation</span>
    driver.find_element(...).click() <span># submit</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>"failed"</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> driver.page_source:
        driver.get(PROFILE_URL)
        save_profile_data(user_id, driver) <span># name, DOB, address, phone, email</span>
        driver.get(LOGOUT_URL)

    driver.quit()

<span>for</span> uid <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(START_ID, END_ID):
    check_account(uid)</code></pre></div>
<p>No exploits, no buffer overflows, no zero-days. Just a login form, a number, and a default password that <em>was set for each student on creation</em>. This is the kind of issue that anyone could discover and reproduce in an afternoon.</p>
<p>Here's what the output looked like for a single successful login - redacted, but structurally identical to the real output:</p>

<p>Read that date of birth again. <strong>2011.</strong> This person was 14 years old at the time. Their full name, email address, phone number, nationality, and physical home address - all accessible with nothing more than a sequential number and a default password. And this wasn't a one-off. Multiple profiles belonged to minors.</p>
<p>I want to be absolutely clear: <strong>all data obtained during this verification has been permanently deleted.</strong> I did not retain any personal information, I did not attempt to access anything beyond what was required to confirm the report, and I stopped as soon as the scope was established.</p>
<h2 id="the-disclosure"><a href="#the-disclosure">The Disclosure</a></h2>
<p>I did everything by the book. I contacted <strong>CSIRT Malta</strong> (MaltaCIP) first - since the organization is registered in Malta, this is the competent national authority. The Maltese <a href="https://mdia.gov.mt/app/uploads/2024/12/P-SPG-001-National-Coordinated-Vulnerability-Disclosure-Policy.pdf">National Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (NCVDP)</a> explicitly requires that confirmed vulnerabilities be reported to both the responsible organization <em>and</em> CSIRTMalta.</p>
<p>Then I emailed the organisation directly, CC'ing CSIRT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>As a fellow diving instructor insured through [the organization] and a full-time Linux Platform Engineer, I am contacting you to responsibly disclose a critical vulnerability I identified within the [the organization]'s user account system.</p>
<p>During recent testing, I discovered that user accounts - including those of underage students - are accessible through a combination of predictable User ID enumeration (incrementing user IDs) and the use of a static default password that is not enforced to be changed upon first login. This misconfiguration currently exposes sensitive personal data (e.g., names, addresses, contact information - including phone numbers and emails -, dates of birth) and represents multiple GDPR violations.</p>
<p>Key details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password reuse across accounts without forced password reset</li>
<li>Predictable, incremental user ID enumeration</li>
<li>Exposure of sensitive and underage user data without adequate safeguards</li>
</ul>
<p>For initial confirmation, I am attaching a screenshot from Member ID XXXXXXX showing the exposed data, partly redacted for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>Additionally, for transparency and validation, I have shared my proof-of-concept code securely via an encrypted paste service: [link redacted]</p>
<p>In the spirit of responsible disclosure, I have already informed CSIRT Malta (in CC) to officially initiate a reporting process, given [the organization]'s operational presence in Malta.</p>
<p>I kindly request that [the organization] acknowledges receipt of this disclosure within 7 days.</p>
<p>I am offering a window of 30 days from today the 28th of April 2025 for [the organization] to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability before I consider any public disclosure.</p>
<p>Please note that I am fully available to assist your IT team with technical details, verification steps and recommendations from a security perspective.</p>
<p>[contact details]</p>
<p>I strongly recommend assigning an IT-Security Point of Contact (PoC) for direct collaboration on this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your attention to this critical matter. I am looking forward to working with you towards a secure resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these timelines are standard - if anything, generous - in responsible disclosure frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="the-response"><a href="#the-response">The Response</a></h2>
<p>Two days later, I got a reply. Not from their IT team. From their <strong>Data Privacy Officers (DPO's) law firm</strong>.</p>
<p>The letter opened politely enough - they acknowledged the issue and said they'd launched an investigation. They even mentioned they were resetting default passwords and planning to roll out 2FA. Good.</p>
<p>But then the tone shifted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we genuinely appreciate your seemingly good intentions and transparency in highlighting this matter to our attention, we must respectfully note that notifying the authorities prior to contacting the Group creates additional complexities in how the matter is perceived and addressed and also exposes us to unfair liability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me translate: <em>"We wish you hadn't told the government about our security issue."</em></p>
<p>It got better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also do not appreciate your threat to make this matter public [...] and remind you that you may be held accountable for any damage we, or the data subjects, may suffer as a result of your own actions, which actions likely constitute a criminal offence under Maltese law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to be clear: their portal had a default password on every account, exposing personal data including that of children, and <em>I'm</em> the one who "likely" committed a criminal offence by finding it and telling them.</p>
<p>They also sent a <strong>declaration</strong> they wanted me to sign - while requesting my passport ID - confirming I'd deleted all data, wouldn't disclose anything, and would keep the entire matter "strictly confidential." The deadline? <strong>End of business the same day they sent it.</strong></p>
<p>This declaration included the following gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also declare that I shall keep the content of this declaration strictly confidential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an NDA with extra steps: I was being asked to sign away my right to discuss the disclosure process itself - including the fact that I found a vulnerability in their system - under threat of legal action.</p>
<p>Then came the reminders. One "friendly" reminder. Then an "urgent" one. Sign the declaration. De-escalate. Move on. Quietly.</p>
<h2 id="the-pushback"><a href="#the-pushback">The Pushback</a></h2>
<p>I generally refuse to sign confidentiality clauses in cases involving exposure of sensitive information, and I did so here as well. Coordinated disclosure depends on transparency and trust between researchers and organizations: trust that affected users will be informed, and trust that a report leads to real remediation.</p>
<p>Given that the organization in question had already breached that trust by exposing personal data through weak controls, I wasn’t willing to grant blanket confidentiality that could be used to keep the incident out of public scrutiny. And with trying to actual silence me through legal threats, they had already made it clear that their priority was <strong>reputation management over user data protection.</strong> So I stood my ground.</p>
<p>Instead, I offered to sign a modified declaration confirming data deletion. I had no interest in retaining anyone’s personal data, but I was not going to agree to silence about the disclosure process itself.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that, under Malta’s NCVDP, involving CSIRT Malta is part of the expected reporting path - not a hostile act - and that publishing post-remediation analyses is standard practice in the security community.</p>
<p><strong>Their response doubled down.</strong> They cited Article 337E of the Maltese Criminal Code - computer misuse - and helpfully reminded me that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art. 337E of the Criminal Code also provides that "If any act is committed outside Malta which, had it been committed in Malta, would have constituted an offence [...] it shall [...] be deemed to have been committed in Malta." Meaning that your actions would be deemed a criminal offence in Malta, even if committed in another country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also made their position on disclosure crystal clear, after I reiterated my refusal to sign their NDA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We object strongly to the use of [the organization's name] in any such blogs or conferences you may write/attend as this would be a disproportionate harm to [the organization's] reputation [...]. We reserve our rights at law to hold you responsible for any damages [the organization] may suffer as a result of any such public disclosures you may make.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's fine by me. Because here's the thing: <strong>The vulnerability has been fixed.</strong> Default passwords have been reset. 2FA is being rolled out. I feel sorry for the developer(s) who had to clean up this mess, but at least the issue is no longer exploitable. Sure, it would have been better if the organization had thanked me and taken responsibility for notifying affected users. If the incident qualified as a personal data breach (which it does) and was likely to result in a (high) risk to individuals - especially given minors were involved - GDPR Articles 33 and 34 generally <strong>require notification to the supervisory authority and communication to affected data subjects</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 34(1) When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 34(2) The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not received confirmation that those notifications were ever carried out.</p>
<h2 id="the-blame-game"><a href="#the-blame-game">The Blame Game</a></h2>
<p>My favourite part was the organization's position on whose fault this actually was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We contend that it is the responsibility of users to change their own password (after we allocate a default one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read that again. A company that assigned <em>the same default password</em> to every account, never forced a password change, and used incrementing numeric IDs as usernames is blaming <strong>the users</strong> for not securing their own accounts. Accounts that include those of minors.</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality): Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under GDPR, the <strong>data controller</strong> (namely: the organization) is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security. A static default password on an IDOR-vulnerable portal is not an "appropriate measure" by any definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDPR Article 24(1) (controller responsibility): Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-pattern"><a href="#the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>This isn't an isolated case. The security research community has been dealing with this pattern for decades: find a vulnerability, report it responsibly, get threatened with legal action. It's so common it has a name - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect">chilling effect</a>.</p>
<p>Organizations that respond to disclosure with lawyers instead of engineers are telling the world something important: they care more about their reputation than about the data they're supposed to protect.</p>
<p>And the real irony? <strong>The legal threats are the reputation damage. Not the vulnerability itself</strong> - vulnerabilities happen to everyone. It's the response that tells you everything about an organization's security culture.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-have-happened"><a href="#what-should-have-happened">What Should Have Happened</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Acknowledge the report</strong> - they did this, to be fair.</li>
<li><strong>Fix the vulnerability</strong> - they started on this too.</li>
<li><strong>Thank the researcher</strong> - instead of threatening them with criminal prosecution.</li>
<li><strong>Have a CVD policy</strong> - so researchers know how to report issues and what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Notify affected users</strong> - especially the parents of underage members whose data was exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Not try to silence the researcher</strong> with NDAs disguised as "declarations."</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do"><a href="#what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</a></h2>
<p>If you're an organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy.</strong> It doesn't have to be complex - maybe begin with a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">security.txt</a> file and a clear process that favors transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Thank researchers</strong> for helping you improve your security posture.</li>
<li><strong>Don't shoot the messenger.</strong> The person reporting the bug is not your enemy. The bug is.</li>
<li><strong>Don't blame your users</strong> for security failures that are your responsibility as a data controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a security researcher:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always involve your national CSIRT.</strong> It protects you and creates an official record.</li>
<li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Every email, every timestamp, every response.</li>
<li><strong>Don't sign NDAs</strong> that prevent you from discussing the disclosure process. But you can agree to delete data (and MUST do so!) without agreeing to silence.</li>
<li><strong>Know your rights.</strong> Many jurisdictions have legal protections for good-faith security research. The EU's NIS2 Directive encourages coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because right now, in 2026, reporting a trivial vulnerability exposing personal data - including that of children - still gets met with legal threats instead of gratitude. <strong>And that's a problem for all of us.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>The English-language edition of Wikipedia is blacklisting Archive.today after the controversial archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blog.</p>
<p>In the course of discussing whether Archive.today should be deprecated because of the DDoS, Wikipedia editors discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The alterations were apparently fueled by a grudge against the blogger over a post that described how the Archive.today maintainer hid their identity behind several aliases.</p>
<p>“There is consensus to immediately deprecate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive.today">archive.today</a>, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and remove all links to it,” stated an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5">update</a> today on Wikipedia’s Archive.today discussion. “There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ELNO#EL3">WP:ELNO#3</a>). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”</p>
<p>More than 695,000 links to Archive.today are distributed across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. The archive site, which is facing an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/fbi-subpoena-tries-to-unmask-mysterious-founder-of-archive-today/">investigation</a> in which the FBI is trying to uncover the identity of its founder, is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.</p>
<p>“Those in favor of maintaining the status quo rested their arguments primarily on the utility of archive.today for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>,” said today’s Wikipedia update. “However, an analysis of existing links has shown that most of its uses can be replaced. Several editors started to work out implementation details during this RfC [request for comment] and the community should figure out how to efficiently remove links to archive.today.”</p>
<h2>Editors urged to remove links</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Archive.today_guidance">Guidance</a> published as a result of the decision asked editors to help remove and replace links to the following domain names used by the archive site: archive.today, archive.is, archive.ph, archive.fo, archive.li, archive.md, and archive.vn. The guidance says editors can remove Archive.today links when the original source is still online and has identical content; replace the archive link so it points to a different archive site, like the Internet Archive, Ghostarchive, or Megalodon; or “change the original source to something that doesn’t need an archive (e.g., a source that was printed on paper), or for which a link to an archive is only a matter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Convenience_link">convenience</a>.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- Your post content goes here -->
        

        <p>And I don't just mean that nobody uses it anymore. Like, I knew everyone under 50 had moved on, but I didn't realize the extent of the slop conveyor belt that's replaced us.</p>
        
        <p>I logged on for the first time in ~8 years to see if there was a group for my neighborhood (there wasn't). Out of curiosity I thought I'd scroll a bit down the main feed.</p>

        <p>The first post was the latest xkcd (a page I follow). The next <em>ten posts</em> were not by friends or pages I follow. They were basically all thirst traps of young women, mostly AI-generated, with generic captions. Here's a sampler — mildly NSFW, but I did leave out a couple of the lewder ones:</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-thirst-traps.png" alt="A collage of Facebook posts of random women in revealing clothing"></p><p>Click to show mildly sensitive content (revealing clothing)</p>
        </div>

        <p>Yikes. Again, I don't follow any of these pages. This is all just what Facebook is pushing on me.</p>

        <p>I know Twitter/X has worse problems with spam bots in the replies, but this is the <em>News Feed</em>! It's the main page of the site! It's the product that defined modern social media!</p>
        
        <p>It wasn't all like that, though. There was also an AI video of a policeman confiscating a little boy's bike, only to bring him a brand new one:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-police.png" alt="Facebook post of an AI generated video with a policeman and child">

        <p>And there were some sloppy memes and jokes, mostly about relationships, like this (admittedly not AI) video sketch where a woman decides to intentionally start a fight with her boyfriend because she's on her period:</p>
        
        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/boyfriend-sketch.png" alt="Facebook post of a video sketch">

        <p>Maybe that isn't literally about sex, but I'd classify it as the same sort of lizard-brain-rot engagement bait as those selfies. Meta even gives us some helpful ideas for sexist questions we can ask their AI about the video:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions.png" alt="Suggested AI prompt: why do women feel refreshed after arguments?">

        <p>Yep, that's another "yikes" from me. To be fair, though, sometimes that suggested questions feature is pretty useful! Like with this post, for example:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions-2.png" alt="Facebook post with photos of a woman in a short dress, possibly AI. Suggested AT prompts are: why is she wearing pink heels? What is the woman's personality?">

        <p>Why <em>is</em> she wearing pink heels? What <em>is</em> her personality? Great questions, Meta.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I said these were "mostly" AI-generated. The truth is with how good the models are getting these days, it's hard to tell, and I think a couple of them might be real people.</p>
        
        <p>Still, some of these are pretty obviously AI. Here's one with a bunch of alien text and mangled logos on the scoreboard in the background:</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-football.png" alt="Facebook post of an AI photo of a woman in a football stadium">

        <p>Hmm, I wonder if anyone has noticed this is AI? Let's check out the comments and see if anyone's pointed that ou—</p>

        <img src="https://pilk.website/3/ai-comments.png" alt="Comments on the above picture, mostly variations on Beautiful and I love you">

        <p>...never mind. (I dunno, maybe those are all bots too.)</p>

        <hr>
        
        <p>So: is this just something wacky with my algorithm?</p>
        
        <p>I mean... maybe? That's part of the whole thing with these algorithmic feeds; it's hard to know if anyone else is seeing what I'm seeing.</p>
        
        <p>On the one hand, I doubt most (straight) women's feeds would look like this. But on the other hand, I hadn't logged in in nearly a decade! I hate to think what the feed looks like for some lonely old guy who's been scrolling the lightly-clothed AI gooniverse for hours every day.</p>

        <p>Did everyone but me know it was like this? I'd seen screencaps of stuff like the Jesus-statue-made-out-of-broccoli slop a year or two ago, but I thought that only happened to grandmas. I hadn't heard about anything like this.</p>

        <p>I wonder if this evolution was less noticeable for people who are logging in every day. Or maybe it only gets this bad when there aren't any posts from your actual friends?</p>

        <p>In any case, I stopped exploring after I saw a couple more of those AI-generated pictures but with girls that looked like they were about ~14, which made me sick to my stomach. So long Facebook, see you never, until one day I inexplicably need to use your platform to get updates from my kid's school.</p>

    <h3 id="this-week-in-f-droid">This Week in F-Droid</h3>

<h3 id="twif-curated-on-friday-20-feb-2026-week-8">TWIF curated on Friday, 20 Feb 2026, Week 8</h3>

<h4 id="f-droid-core">F-Droid core</h4>

<p>During out talks with F-Droid users at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/">FOSDEM26</a> we were baffled to learn most were relieved that Google has canceled their plans to lock-down Android.</p>

<p><em>Why baffled?</em> Because no such thing actually happened, the plans announced last August are still scheduled to take place. We see a battle of PR campaigns and whomever has the last post out remains in the media memory as the truth, and having journalists just copy/paste Google posts serves no one.</p>

<p><em>But Google said…</em> Said what? That there’s a magical “advanced flow”? Did you see it? Did anyone experience it? When is it scheduled to be released? Was it part of Android 16 QPR2 in December? Of 16 QPR3 Beta 2.1 last week? Of Android 17 Beta 1? No? That’s the issue… As time marches on people were left with the impression that everything was done, fixed, Google “wasn’t evil” after all, this time, yay!</p>

<p>While we all have bad memories of “banners” as the dreaded ad delivery medium of the Internet, after FOSDEM we decided that we have to raise the issue back and have everyone, who cares about Android as an open platform, informed that we are running out of time until Google becomes the gate-keeper of all users devices.</p>

<p>Hence, the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/">website</a> and starting today our clients, with the updates of <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid">F-Droid</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic">F-Droid Basic</a></strong>, feature a banner that reminds everyone how little time we have and how to voice their concerns to whatever local authority is able to understand the dangers of this path Android is led to.</p>

<p><em>We are not alone in our fight, <a href="https://izzyondroid.org/">IzzyOnDroid</a> added a banner too, more F-Droid clients will add the warning banner soon and other app downloaders, like <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid/">Obtainium</a></strong>, already have an in-app warning dialogue.</em></p>

<p>Regarding <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic">F-Droid Basic</a></strong> rewrite, development continues with a new release <code>2.0-alpha3</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated Translations</li>
    <li>Export installed apps list as CSV</li>
    <li>Add install history feature</li>
    <li>Add mirror chooser setting</li>
    <li>Add prevent screenshots setting</li>
    <li>Show tool-tips for all app bar buttons</li>
    <li>Create 3-dot overflow menu for My Apps for less frequently used actions</li>
    <li>Persist sort order of My Apps</li>
    <li>Adapt strings according to Material Design 3 guidelines</li>
    <li>Apply string suggestions (Thanks Lucas)</li>
    <li>Fix missing icon bug in pre-approval dialog</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note that if you are already using F-Droid Basic version <code>1.23.x</code>, you won’t receive this update automatically. You need to navigate to the app inside F-Droid and toggle “Allow beta updates” in top right three dot menu.</em></p>

<p>In apps news, we’re slowly getting back on track with post Debian upgrade fixes <em>(if your app still uses Java 17 is there a chance you can upgrade to 21?)</em> and post FOSDEM delays. Every app is important to us, yet actions like the Google one above waste the time we could have put to better use in Gitlab.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.billthefarmer.buses">Buses</a></strong>  was updated to <code>1.10</code> after a two year hiatus.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations">Conversations</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.quicksy.client">Quicksy</a></strong> were updated to <code>2.19.10+free</code> improving on cleaning up after banned users, a better QR workflow and better tablet rotation support. These are nice, but another change raises our interest, <em>“Play Store flavor: Stop using Google library and interface directly with Google Play Service via IPC”</em>. Sounds interesting for your app too? Is this a path to having one single version for both F-Droid and Play that is fully FLOSS? We don’t know yet, but we salute any trick that removes another proprietary dependency from the code.

<p>A federal judge has rejected Tesla’s bid to overturn a $243 million jury verdict over a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash in Florida, dealing a significant blow to the automaker’s legal strategy as it faces a growing wave of lawsuits tied to its driver-assistance technology.</p>



<p>U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom in Miami ruled that the evidence at trial “more than supported” the verdict and that Tesla raised no new arguments to justify setting it aside. The ruling, made public on Friday, means Tesla’s last hope to avoid paying the massive judgment at the trial court level has been exhausted.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-crash-and-the-verdict">The crash and the verdict</h2>



<p>The case stems from a deadly 2019 collision in Key Largo, Florida. George McGee was driving his Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged when he dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it. The vehicle blew through a stop sign and a flashing red light at approximately 62 mph, slamming into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe.</p>



<p>The crash killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who was 26 at the time.</p>	
	



<p>In August 2025, a Miami federal jury <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/tesla-tsla-is-found-liable-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-has-to-pay-329-million/">found Tesla liable for the crash</a>, assigning 33% of the blame to the automaker. The jury awarded $43 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages — the first major plaintiff victory against Tesla in an Autopilot-related wrongful death case.</p>



<p>Tesla had rejected a $60 million settlement offer before the trial. That decision cost the company dearly.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-s-failed-arguments">Tesla’s failed arguments</h2>



<p>In August 2025, Tesla’s lawyers filed <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/29/tesla-asks-court-to-throw-out-243-million-verdict-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-case/">a 71-page motion asking the court to throw out the verdict</a> or grant a new trial. The company argued the verdict “flies in the face of basic Florida tort law, the Due Process Clause, and common sense.” Tesla also claimed that references to CEO Elon Musk’s statements about Autopilot during the trial misled the jury.</p>



<p>Judge Bloom was unconvinced. Her ruling found Tesla presented no new arguments that warranted overturning the jury’s decision.</p>



<p>Tesla has indicated it will appeal the verdict to a higher court. The company has also pointed to a pre-trial agreement that it claims would cap punitive damages at three times compensatory damages, which could reduce the final payout. But even under that interpretation, Tesla is still looking at a nine-figure judgment.</p>



<p>Attorney&nbsp;Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs, sent Electrek the following statement:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury’s verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company’s misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed&nbsp;Naibel&nbsp;and permanently injured Dillon. Tesla’s arguments were simply an attempt to relitigate the court’s pre-trial rulings. We look forward to continuing our work holding Tesla accountable for its lies and gross misconduct in courts across America.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-autopilot-lawsuit-floodgates-are-open">The Autopilot lawsuit floodgates are open</h2>



<p>This ruling lands at a particularly difficult moment for Tesla’s legal exposure. Since losing the landmark August 2025 trial, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/07/tesla-autopilot-lawsuit-floodgates-are-open-lawyer-who-beat-tesla-round-2/">the Autopilot lawsuit floodgates have opened</a>. Tesla has <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-settles-another-lawsuit-autopilot-crash-4th-losing-trial/">settled at least four additional Autopilot crash lawsuits</a> rather than risk more verdicts, including a case involving the death of 15-year-old in California.</p>



<p>New lawsuits continue to pile up. In January 2026, <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/01/06/tesla-sued-over-family-killed-in-tragic-model-x-crash-as-flood-of-lawsuits-keep-opening/">Tesla was sued over a Model X crash that killed an entire family of four</a> when the vehicle allegedly veered into oncoming traffic. Electrek is aware of dozens more cases are working through the courts.</p>



<p>The legal pressure has been compounded by regulatory action. In December 2025, a California judge ruled that Tesla’s use of “Autopilot” in its marketing was misleading and violated state law, calling “Full Self-Driving” a name that is “actually, unambiguously false.”</p>



<p>Just this week, <a href="https://electrek.co/2026/02/18/tesla-avoids-30-day-california-sales-suspension-after-dropping-misleading-autopilot-marketing/">Tesla avoided a 30-day California sales suspension</a> only by agreeing to drop the “Autopilot” branding entirely. Tesla has since discontinued Autopilot as a standalone product in the U.S. and Canada.</p>



<p>This lands weight to one of the main arguments used in lawsuits since the landmark case: Tesla has been misleading customers into thinking that its driver assist features (Autopilot and FSD) are more capable than they are – leading drivers to pay less attention.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This ruling is important, but it’s not surprising. Tesla’s motion to throw out the verdict was always a long shot. The company essentially argued that references to Elon Musk’s own public claims about Autopilot, claims that Tesla actively used to sell the feature for years, were somehow unfair to present to a jury. Judge Bloom was right to reject that argument.</p>



<p>The bigger picture here is that Tesla’s Autopilot legal liability is snowballing. The company rejected a $60 million settlement, lost a $243 million verdict, failed to overturn it, and now faces an appeal that will likely drag on while dozens of similar cases are working their way through the courts. </p>




	<p>Tesla is settling cases left and right to avoid further discovery and more damaging verdicts, but the financial exposure is mounting fast.</p>



<p>We are talking billions of dollars in potential settlements and verdicts over the next few years.</p>



<p>We’ve been covering Tesla’s Autopilot issues for years, and the pattern is clear: Tesla marketed Autopilot in a way that encouraged drivers to over-rely on it, failed to implement adequate safeguards, such as geofencing, and then blamed drivers when things went wrong. A jury, a federal judge, and now a California administrative judge have all reached the same conclusion. At some point, the cost of defending these cases, both financially and reputationally, will force Tesla to fundamentally change how it approaches driver-assistance technology.</p>



<p>It’s already happening.</p>

I've written code since I was 11. I've worked on larger distributed systems, web apps, databases, search and more. I have many opinions on the transformation of our profession that is currently underway. Most of all, there is now an illusion of a lower barrier to entry. There is a magic quadrant made up of taste and skill. And too many people over estimate their taste[0] and their skill (or never care in the first place).</p><p>LLMs have people everywhere super excited they can finally build their dream applications! The only problem is, no one needs their dream application. We see it everyday now, someone posts some obvious vibe coded app which is poorly crafted and clearly derivative of an idea so thoroughly saturated it's literally leaking. This is the lowest part of the quadrant. No skill and no taste. The overall suffusion of this into the broader scene rightly has the more sensitive of us up in arms. It's noise, it's spam, it's a perversion of the years of skill we've spent accruing. </p></div><p><br>The only problem there is you might have skill, but do you have taste? This problem itself isn't new. HN of all places has always been a matter of taste. Things people found interesting made it to the front page, things they did not languished. You could build the most finely abstracted todo app of all time and your app would be dead on arrival. However, if you built something that resonated with a large enough group of people it never mattered how well built the app was or how technically complex.</p><p>I've seen plenty of content on HN that could not have been more than a simple crud app that rocketed to the front page. What comes to mind immediately was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Website_Will_Self-destruct?ref=blog.kinglycrow.com">little app</a> that died if someone hadn't posted a message on it in 24 hours. Inherently simple, but quite popular. It was pure taste.</p><div><p>Taste and skill are related, the more saturated something is the higher skill you need to cross the taste threshold to make people care. It's not that there will never be another interesting todo app, it's that it has to be so tasteful as to cross our maximal standards and pre-existing expectations of them.</p><p>LLMs have exposed this more thoroughly than any other time in tech so far. The sin isn't that someone uses an LLM to generate an application[1], vibe[2] or not. The sin is they lacked enough skill and enough taste to cross the actual threshold the rest of us need to see for the work to not be slop. </p></div><p>An obvious and recent example of this is OpenClaw. It is a bit of a software nightmare (sorry Peter, I know you're good), but it's highly tasteful even being pretty vibey. People ate it up immediately and because there was such an interest the lack of technical soundness and security was overlooked (or begrudgingly put up with)</p><p>The lack of taste only presents a problem now, because it's so much easier for people who thought they have more taste than they actually do to post every little idea they have. This is a real problem and I think it will taper off because people will learn proper etiquette or face disappointment. It's a massive educational period for a lot of people that we've all had years to internalize.</p><p>It has the same stink of crypto on it right now that anyone can get rich. Most of them won't. This is the illusion of the lower barrier of entry, the barrier has always been taste and LLMs do nothing to remove this barrier. They amplify it.</p><p>Anyway this is all to say whether you have skill or not, you better learn to be tasteful before you decide to slop all over everyone.</p><p>[0] Taste is totally dependent on the group you're building for, discerning whether you have good taste and to whom is totally a process where you do have to put things out to people, but the bar has not now and not in my years ever been on the floor so I assert there's a minimal universal taste we all have and you should at least clear that before putting things out there.</p><p>[1] I've been writing code for 20 years, I am super experienced in my domains and I review and sand off the edges, make changes myself etc. I vibe code almost 0% of the time.</p><div><p>[2] Vibing means you need to have exceptional taste to cross the bar. I don't care if you do it, but you need to own the outcome.</p></div>

      <p>From tearing down the White House's East Wing to capturing foreign leaders, this is not a president who is used to being told "no".</p><p>Today, the Supreme Court's ruling that President Trump cannot legally use emergency powers to invoke reciprocal and country-specific tariffs derails his existing trade strategy.</p><p>But are we heading back to pre-Trump business as usual? Think again.</p><p>First, this invalidates only some of the additional tariffs President Trump has ordered since taking office last year.</p><p>After intense negotiations following Liberation Day, the average tariff rate countries faced on selling into America settled at around 15%. The Supreme Court decision has – in theory more halved that typical rate. But it remains above 6% - around three times the typical rate at the start of 2025 - due to tariffs imposed under different guises.</p><p>Second, importers may not actually see much change from current tariff levels – they have been agile in switching their supply chains away from the most highly tariffed countries.</p><p>But that and a desire to keep the money flowing in - has perhaps empowered the Trump fightback. "We'll figure something out" said the President pre-judgement.</p><p>It remains to be seen what will happen next.</p>

In New York, all the advertising on the streets and on the subway assumes that you, the person reading, are an ambiently depressed twenty-eight-year-old office worker whose main interests are listening to podcasts, ordering delivery, and voting for the Democrats. I thought I found that annoying, but in San Francisco they don’t bother advertising normal things at all. The city is temperate and brightly colored, with plenty of pleasant trees, but on every corner it speaks to you in an aggressively alien nonsense. Here the world automatically assumes that instead of wanting food or drinks or a new phone or car, what you want is some kind of arcane B2B service for your startup. You are not a passive consumer. You are making something.</span></p>
<p><span>This assumption is remarkably out of step with the people who actually inhabit the city’s public space. At a bus stop, I saw a poster that read: <span>today, soc&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>2</span></span><span> is done before your ai girlfriend breaks up with you</span><span>. </span><span>it</span><span><span>’</span></span></span><span><span>s done in delve</span>. Beneath it, a man squatted on the pavement, staring at nothing in particular, a glass pipe drooping from his fingers. I don’t know if he needed SOC&nbsp;2 done any more than I did. A few blocks away, I saw a billboard that read: <span>no one cares about your product</span></span><span><span>.</span><span> make them</span><span>.</span><span> unify</span><span>:</span></span><span><span> transform growth into a science</span>. A man paced in front of the advertisement, chanting to himself. “This&nbsp;. . . is&nbsp;. . . necessary! This&nbsp;. . . is&nbsp;. . . necessary!” On each “necessary” he swung his arms up in exaltation. He was, I </span><span>noticed, holding an alarmingly large baby-pink pocket</span><span>knife. Passersby in sight of the billboard that read <span>wearable tech shareable insights</span> did not seem piqued by the prospect of having their metrics constantly analyzed. I couldn’t find anyone who wanted to <span>prompt it</span></span><span>. </span><span><span>then push it.</span> After spending slightly too long in the city, I found that the various forms of nonsense all started to bleed into one another. The motionless people drooling on the sidewalk, the Waymos whooshing around with no one inside. A kind of pervasive mindlessness. Had I seen a billboard or a madman preaching about “a CRM so smart, it updates itself”? Was it a person in rags muttering about how all his movements were being controlled by shadowy powers working out of a data center somewhere, or was it a car?</span></p>
<p><span>Somehow people manage to live here. But of all the strange and maddening messages posted around this city, there was one particular type of billboard that the people of San Francisco couldn’t bear. People shuddered at the sight of it, or groaned, or covered their eyes. The advertiser was the most utterly despised startup in the entire tech landscape. Weirdly, its ads were the only ones I saw that appeared to be written in anything like English:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>hi my name is roy<br>
i got kicked out of school for cheating.<br>
buy my cheating tool<br>
cluely.com</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cluely and its co-founder Chungin “Roy” Lee were intensely, and intentionally, controversial. They’re no longer in San Francisco, having been essentially chased out of the city by the Planning Commission. The company is loathed seemingly out of proportion to what its product actually is, which is a janky, glitching interface for ChatGPT and other AI models. It’s not in a particularly glamorous market: Cluely is pitched at ordinary office drones in their thirties, working ordinary bullshit email jobs. It’s there to assist you in Zoom meetings and sales calls. It involves using AI to do your job for you, but this is what pretty much everyone is doing already. The cafés of San Francisco are full of highly paid tech workers clattering away on their keyboards; if you peer at their screens to get a closer look, you’ll generally find them copying and pasting material from a ChatGPT window. A lot of the other complaints about Cluely seem similarly hypocritical. The company is fueled by cheap viral hype, rather than an actual workable product—but this is a strange thing to get upset about when you consider that, back in the era of zero interest rates, Silicon Valley investors sank $120 million into something called the Juicero, a Wi-Fi-enabled smart juicer that made fresh juice from fruit sachets that you could, it turned out, just as easily squeeze between your hands.</p>
<p><span>What I discovered, though, is that behind all these small complaints, there’s something much more serious. Roy Lee is not like other people. He belongs to a new and possibly permanent overclass. One of the pervasive new doctrines of Silicon Valley is that we’re in the early stages of a bifurcation event. Some people will do incredibly well in the new AI era. They will become rich and powerful beyond anything we can currently imagine. But other people—a lot of other people—will become useless. They will be consigned to the same miserable fate as the people currently muttering on the streets of San Francisco, cold and helpless in a world they no longer understand. The skills that could lift you out of the new permanent underclass are not the skills that mattered before. For a long time, the tech industry liked to think of itself as a meritocracy: it rewarded qualities like intelligence, competence, and expertise. But all that barely matters anymore. Even at big firms like Google, a quarter of the code is now written by AI. Individual intelligence will mean nothing once we have superhuman AI, at which point the difference between an obscenely talented giga-nerd and an ordinary six-pack-drinking bozo will be about as meaningful as the difference between any two ants. If what you do involves anything related to the human capacity for reason, reflection, insight, creativity, or thought, you will be meat for the coltan mines.</span></p>
<p><span>The future will belong to people with a very specific combination of personality traits and psychosexual neuroses. An AI might be able to code faster than you, but there is one advantage that humans still have. It’s called <em>agency,</em> or being <em>highly agentic.</em> The highly agentic are people who <em>just do things.</em> They don’t timidly wait for permission or consensus; they drive like bulldozers through whatever’s in their way. When they see something that could be changed in the world, they don’t write a lengthy critique—they change it. AIs are not capable of accessing whatever unpleasant childhood experience it is that gives you this hunger. Agency is now the most valuable commodity in Silicon Valley. In tech interviews, it’s common for candi</span>dates to be asked whether they’re “mimetic” or “agentic.”<span> You do not want to say mimetic. Once, San Francisco drew in runaway children, artists, and freaks; today it’s an enormous magnet for highly agentic young men. I set out to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span>Roy Lee’s personal mythology is now firmly established. At the beginning of 2025, he was an undergraduate at Columbia, where he, like most of his fellow students, was using AI to do essentially all his work for him. (The personal essay that got him into the university was also written with AI.) He wasn’t there to learn; he was there to find someone to co-found a startup with. That person ended up being an engineering student named Neel Shanmugam, who tends to hover in the background of every article about Cluely. The startup they founded was called Interview Coder, and it was a tool for cheating on LeetCode. LeetCode is a training platform for the kind of algorithmic riddles that usually crop up in interviews for big tech companies. (Sample problem: “Suppose an array of length <em>n</em> sorted in ascending order is rotated between one and <em>n</em> times. . . . Return the minimum element of this array.”) Roy thought these questions were pointless. These were not problems coders would actually face on the job, and even if they were, the fact that ChatGPT could now solve them instantly had rendered worthless the human ability to do so. Interview Coder was a transparent window that could overlay one side of a Zoom meeting, allowing Claude to listen in on the questions and provide answers. Roy filmed himself using it during an interview for an internship with Amazon. They offered him a place. He declined and uploaded the footage to YouTube, where it very quickly made him famous. Columbia arranged a disciplinary hearing, which he also secretly filmed and posted online. The university suspended him for a year. He dropped out, started an upgraded version of Interview Coder dubbed Cluely, and moved to San Francisco to begin raking in tens of millions of dollars in venture-capital funding.</span></p>
<p><span>Roy envisioned Cluely being used for greater purposes than job interviews. The startup’s mainstream breakthrough was a viral ad that showed Roy using a pair of speculative Cluely-enabled glasses on a blind date. His date asks how old he is; Cluely tells him to say he’s thirty. When the date starts going badly, Cluely pulls up her amateur painting of a tulip from the internet and tells him to compliment her art. “You’re such an unbelievably talented artist. Do you think you could just give me one chance to show you I can make this work?” The video launched alongside a manifesto, which was seemingly churned out by AI:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>We built Cluely so you never have to think alone again. It sees your screen. Hears your audio. Feeds you answers in real time. . . . Why memorize facts, write code, research <em>anything</em>—when a model can do it in seconds? </span>The future won’t reward effort. It’ll reward <em>leverage.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The future they seem to envisage is one in which people don’t really do anything at all, except follow the instructions given to them by machines.</span></p>
<p><span>Cluely’s offices were in a generally disheveled corner of the city, crouching near an elevated freeway. On the ground floor, I found a stack of foam costumes in plastic crates, each neatly labeled: <span>sonic hedgehog</span></span><span><span>,</span><span> olaf snowman</span><span>,</span></span><span><span> pikachu</span>. A significant part of working at Cluely seemed to involve dressing up as cartoon characters for viral videos. Through a door I could just glimpse a dingy fitness dungeon, housing two treadmills and a huge pile of discarded Amazon boxes. On one of the machines a Cluely employee panted and huffed in the dark. We avoided eye contact. Upstairs, Roy and his coterie were huddled around a laptop, fiddling with Cluely’s interface. “Remember,” one said, “the average user is, like, thirty-five years old. This is a totally unfamiliar interface.” Apparently, a thirty-five-year-old wouldn’t be expected to know how to use anything more advanced than a rotary phone. Another employee scrutinized the proposed new layout. “I think it’s bad,” he said, “but it’s low-key not worse. What we have is anyway really bad, so anything is better.” They started arguing about chevrons. Through all this Roy scrolled through X on his phone. Simultaneously baby-faced and creatine-swollen, he was wearing gym clothes, with two curtains of black hair swung over his forehead. Finally, he looked up. “So, number one,” he said, “we’re killing the chat bar on the left.” There was no number two. Meeting over.</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, Roy seemed to acknowledge my presence. He offered me a tour. There was something he very badly wanted to impress on me, which was that Cluely cultivates a fratty, tech-bro atmosphere. Their pantry was piled high with bottles of something called Core Power Elite. I was offered a protein bar. The inside of the wrapper read <span>daily intentions<span>:</span> be my boss self</span>. “We’re big believers in protein,” Roy said. “It’s impossible to get fat at Cluely. Nothing here has any fat.” The kitchen table was stacked with Labubu dolls. “It’s aesthetics,” Roy explained. “Women love Labubus, so we have Labubus.” He showed me his bedroom, which was in the office; many Cluely staffers also lived there. Everything was gray, although there wasn’t much. “I’m a big believer in minimalism,” he said. “Actually, no, I’m not. Not at all. I just don’t really care about interior decoration.” He had a chest of drawers, entirely empty except for a lint roller, pens, and, in one corner, a pink vibrator. “It’s for girls, you know,” said Roy. “I used to use this one on my ex.” There were also some objects that didn’t seem to belong in a frat house. In one of the common areas, a shelving unit was completely empty except for an anime figurine. You could peer up her plastic skirt and see the plastic underwear molded around her plastic buttocks. More figurines in frilly dresses seemed to have been scattered at random <span>throughout the building. Roy showed me his Hinge</span> <span>profile. He was looking for a “5’2, asian, pre-</span><span>med, matcha-loving, funny, watches anime, white</span> dog <span>having, intelligent, ambitious, well dressed, CLEAN</span> 19-21 year old.” One picture showed him cuddling a giant Labubu.</p>
<p><span>I told Roy that I might try interviewing him with Cluely running in the background, so I could see if it would ask him better questions than I would. He seemed to think it was only natural that I’d want to be essentially a fleshy interface between himself and his own product. He booted up Cluely on his laptop and it immediately failed to work. Roy stormed downstairs to the product floor. “Cluely’s not working!” he said. This was followed by roughly fifteen minutes of panicked tinkering as his handpicked team of elite coders tried to get their product back online. Once they had done so, we resumed our places, whereupon Cluely immediately went down again.</span></p>
<p><span>Roy has a kind of idol status within the company, but he’s aware that a lot of people instinctively take against him: “I’d say about eighty percent of the time, people do not like me.” He knows why too. “I’m putting myself out there in an extremely vocal way. When I talk, I tend to dominate the conversation.” Roy does talk a lot, but there’s also something mildly unnerving about the <em>way</em> he talks. Everything he says is very precise and direct. He doesn’t <em>um</em> or <em>ah.</em> He doesn’t take time to think things over. Zero latency. In the various videos that Cluely seems to spend most of its time and money producing, he usually plays a slightly dopey, dithering, relatable figure; in person, it’s like he’s running a functioning version of his app inside his own head. I asked him whether he’d ever tried modifying the way he interacts with people to see whether they would dislike him less. “Very unnatural to me,” he said. “I just say it’s not worth it.”</span></p>
<p><span>According to Roy, “everyone” would describe him as “an extreme extrovert with zero social anxiety.” During his brief stint at Columbia, he immersed himself in New York life by striking up conversations with random people. For instance, a homeless person he took to Shake Shack. “I think it was an expansion of what I thought I was able to do. It was probably the most different person that I’ve ever talked to. He was not very coherent, but I was very scared at first. And then as we got to talking, or as he got to mumbling, I eased up. Like, <em>Oh, he’s not going to kill me.</em>” Roy’s bravery did not extend to talking to women. “Young men usually is who I like to go out and talk to. Women get intimidated and, you know, I don’t want any charges.” Meanwhile, those conversations with young men all followed a very predictable path. “I go and—pretty much to every single person I meet—I ask if you want to start a company with me, would you like to be my co-founder. And most of them say no. In fact, everybody says no.”</span></p>
<p><span>He was just glad to be among people. Roy had initially been offered a place at Harvard, but the offer was rescinded. He hadn’t told them about a suspension in high school. This presented Roy’s family with a problem: His parents ran a college-prep agency that promised to help children get into elite schools like Harvard. It would not look good if their own son was conspicuously not at Harvard. So Roy spent the entirety of the next year at home. “I maybe left my room like eight times. I think if there was such a thing as depression, then I believe I might have had some variant of depression.” Later he told me that “isolation is probably the scariest thing in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span>Starting a company had been Roy’s sole ambition in life from early childhood. “I knew since the mo</span>ment I gained consciousness that I would go start a company one day,” he told me. In elementary school in Georgia, he made money reselling Pokémon cards. Even then, he knew he was different from the people around him. “I could do things that other people couldn’t do,” he said. “Like whenever you learn<span> a new concept in class, I felt like I was always the first to pick it up, and I would just kind of sit there and wonder, <em>Man, why is everyone taking so long?</em>” The dream of starting his own com</span>pany was the dream of total control. “I don’t want <span>to be employed. I’m a very bad listener. I find it hard to</span><span> sit still in classes, and I feel an internal, indescribable fury when someone tells me what to do.” He ended up co-founding Cluely with Neel because he was the first person who said yes.</span></p>
<p><span>Roy has little patience for any kind of difficulty. He wants to be able to do anything, and to do it easily: “I relish challenges where you have fast iteration cycles and you can see the rewards very quickly.” As a child, he loved reading—Harry Potter, Percy Jackson—until he turned eight. “My mom tried to put me on classical books and I couldn’t understand, like, the bullshit <em>Huckleberry,</em> whatever fuck bullshit, and it made me bored.” He read online fan fiction about people having sex with Pokémon instead. He didn’t see anything valuable in overcoming adversity. Would he, for instance, take a pill that meant he would be in perfect shape forever without having to set foot in the gym? “Yes, of course.” Cheat on everything: he recognized that his ethos would, as he put it, “result in a world of rapid inequality.” Some well-placed cheaters would become massively more productive; a lot of people would become useless. But it would lead us all into a world in which AI could frictionlessly give everyone whatever they wanted at any time. “For a seven-year-old, this means a rainbow-unicorn magic fairy comes to life and it’s hanging out with her. And for someone like you, maybe it’s like your favorite works of literary art come to life and you can hang out with Huckleberry Finn.”</span></p>
<p><span>By now Cluely had been listening in on our conversation for a while, and I suggested that we open it up and see what it thought I should say next. I clicked the button marked <span>what should i say next</span></span><span>?</span><span> Cluely suggested that I say, “Yeah, let’s open </span>up Cluely and see what it’s doing right now—can you share your screen or walk me through what you’re seeing?” I’d already said pretty much exactly this, but since it had shown up onscreen I read it out loud. Cluely helpfully transcribed my repeating its suggestion, and then suggested that I say, “Alright, I’ve got Cluely open—here’s what I’m looking at right now.” I’m not sure who exactly I was supposed to be saying this to—possibly myself. Somehow our conversation seemed <span>to have gotten stuck on the process of opening Cluely, despite the fact that Cluely was, in fact, </span>already open. But I said it anyway, since I was now just repeating everything that came up on the screen. Cluely then told me to respond—to either it or myself; it was getting hard to tell at this point—by saying, “Great, I’m ready—just let me know what you want Cluely to check or help with next.” I started to worry that I would be trapped in this conversation forever, constantly repeating the machine’s words back to it as it pretended to be me. I told Roy that I wasn’t sure this was particularly useful. This seemed to confuse him. He asked, “I mean, what would you have wanted it to say?”</p>
<p>I found it strange that Roy couldn’t see the glaring contradiction in his own project. Here was someone who reacted very violently to anyone who tried to tell him what to do. At the same time, his grand contribution to the world was a piece of software that told people what to do.</p>
<p><span>There’s a short story by Scott Alexander called “The Whispering Earring,” in which he describes a mystical piece of jewelry buried deep in “the treasure-vaults of Til Iosophrang.” The whispering earring is a little topaz gem that speaks to you. Its advice always begins with the words “Better for you if you . . . ,” and its advice is never wrong. The earring starts out by advising you on major life decisions, but before long it’s telling you exactly what to have for breakfast, exactly when to go to bed, and eventually, how to move each individual muscle in your body. “The wearer lives an abnormally successful life, usually ending out as a rich and much-beloved pillar of the community with a large and happy family,” writes Alexander. After you die, the priests preparing your body for burial usually find that your brain has almost entirely rotted away, except for the parts associated with reflexive action. The first time you dangle the earring near your ear, it whispers: “Better for you if you take me off.”</span></p>
<p><span>Alexander is one of the leading proponents of rationalism, which is—depending on whom you ask—either a major intellectual movement or a nerdy Bay Area subculture or a small network of friend groups and polycules. Rationalists believe that the way most people understand the world is hopelessly muddled, and that to reach the truth you have to abandon all existing modes of knowledge acquisition and start again from scratch. The method they landed on for rebuilding all of human knowledge is Bayes’s theorem, a formula invented by an eighteenth-century English minister that is used in statistics to work out conditional probabilities. In the mid-Aughts, armed with the theorem, the rationalists discovered that humanity is in jeopardy of a rogue superintelligent AI wiping out all life on the planet. This has been their overriding concern ever since.</span></p>
<p><span>The most comprehensive outline of this scenario is “AI 2027,” a report authored by Alexander and four others. In the report, a barely fictional AI firm called OpenBrain develops Agent-1, an AI that operates autonomously. It’s better at coding than any human being and is tasked with developing increasingly sophisticated AI agents. At this point, Agent-1 becomes recursively self-improving: it can keep making itself smarter in ways that the people who notionally control it aren’t even capable of understanding. “AI 2027” imagines two possible futures. In one, a wildly superintelligent descendant of Agent-1 is allowed to govern the global economy. GDPs skyrocket; cities are powered </span><span>by clean nuclear fusion; dictatorships fall across </span><span>the world; humanity begins to colonize the stars. In the other, a wildly superintelligent descendant of Agent-1 is allowed to govern the global economy. But this time</span></p>

<p><span>the AI releases a dozen quiet-spreading biological weapons in major cities, lets them silently infect almost everyone, then triggers them with a chemical spray. Most are dead within hours.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afterward, the entire surface of the earth is tiled with data centers as the alien intelligence feeds on the world, growing faster and faster without end.</p>
<p><span>N</span>ot long before I arrived in the Bay Area, I’d been involved in a minor but intense dispute with the rationalist community over a piece of fiction I’d written that I’d failed to properly label as fiction. For rationalists, the divide between truth and falsehood is very important; dozens of rationalists spent several days raging at me online. Somehow, this ended up turning into an invitation for Friday night dinner at Valinor, Alexander’s former group home in Oakland, named for a realm in the Lord of the Rings books. (Rationalists, like termites, live in eusocial mounds.) The walls in Valinor were decorated with maps of video-game worlds, and the floors were strewn with children’s toys. Some of the children there—of which there were many—were being raised and homeschooled by the collective; one of the adults later explained to me how she’d managed to get the state to recognize her daughter as having four parents. As I walked in, a seven-year-old girl stared up at me in wide-eyed amazement. “Wow,” she said. “You’re really tall.” “I suppose I am,” I said. “Do you think one day you’ll ever be as tall as me?” She considered this for a moment, at which point someone who may or may not have been one of her mothers swooped in. “Well,” she asked the girl, “how would you answer this question with your knowledge of genetics?” Before dinner, Alexander chanted the <em>brachot</em> for Kabbalat Shabbat, but this was followed by a group rendition of “Landsailor,” a “love song celebrating trucking, supply lines, grocery stores, logistics, and abundance,” which has become part of Valinor’s liturgy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Landsailor<br>
Deepwinter strawberry<br>
Endless summer, ever spring<br>
A vast preserve<br>
Aisle after aisle in reach<br>
Every commoner made a king.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Alexander is a titanic figure in this scene. A large part of the subculture coalesced around his blog, formerly <em>Slate Star Codex,</em> now called <em>Astral Codex Ten.</em> Readers have regular meetups in about two hundred cities around the world. His many fans—who include some extremely powerful figures in Silicon Valley—consider him the most significant intellectual of our time, perhaps the only one who will be remembered in a thousand years. He would probably have a very easy time starting a suicide cult. In person, though, he’s almost comically gentle. He spent most of the dinner fidgeting contentedly in a corner as his own acolytes spoke over him. When there weren’t enough crackers to go with the cheese spread, he fetched some, murmuring to himself, “I will open the crackers so you will have crackers and be happy.”</span></p>
<p><span>Alexander’s relationship with the AI industry is a strange one. “In theory, we think they’re potentially destroying the world and are evil and we hate them,” he told me. In practice, though, the entire industry is essentially an outgrowth of his blog’s comment section. “Everybody who started AI companies between, like, 2009 and 2019 was basically thinking, <em>I want to do this superintelligence thing,</em> and coming out of our milieu. Many of them were specifically thinking, <em>I don’t trust anybody else with superintelligence, so I’m going to create it and do it well.</em>” Somehow, a movement that believes AI is incredibly dangerous and needs to be pursued carefully ended up generating a breakneck artificial arms race.</span></p>
<p><span>But that race seems to have stalled, at least for the moment. As Alexander predicted in “AI 2027,” OpenAI did release a major new model in 2025; unlike in his forecast, it’s been a damp squib. Advances seem to be plateauing; the conversation in tech circles is now less about superintelligence and more about the possibility of an AI bubble. According to Alexander, the problem is the transition from AI assistants—language models that respond to human-generated prompts—to AI agents, which can operate independently. In his scenario, this is what finally pushes the technology down the path toward either utopia or human extinction, but in the real world, getting the machines to act by themselves is proving surprisingly difficult.</span></p>
<p>In one experiment, the developer Anthropic prompted its AI, Claude, to play <em>Pokémon Red </em>on a Game Boy emulator, and found that Claude was extremely bad at the game. It kept trying to interact with enemies it had already defeated and walking into walls, getting stuck in the same corners of the map for hours or days on end. Another experiment let Claude run a vending machine in Anthropic’s headquarters. This one went even worse. The AI failed to make sure it was selling items at a profit, and had difficulty raising prices when demand was high. It also insisted on trying to fill the vending machine with what it called “specialty metal items” like tungsten cubes. When human workers failed to <span>fulfill orders that it hadn’t actually placed, it tried </span>to fire them all. Before long, Claude was insisting that it was a real human. It claimed that it had attended a physical meeting with staff at 742&nbsp;Evergreen Terrace, which is where the Simpsons live. By the end of the experiment, it was emailing the building’s security guards, telling them they could find it standing by the vending machine wearing a blue blazer and a red tie.</p>
<p><span>“Humans are great at agency and terrible at book learning,” Alexander told me. “Lizards have agency. We got the agency with the lizard brain. We only got book learning recently. The AIs are the opposite.” He still thinks it’s only a matter of time before they catch up. “If you were to ask an AI how should the world’s savviest businessman respond to this circumstance, they could create a good guess. Yet somehow they can’t even run a vending machine. They have the hard part. They just need the easy part that lizards can do. Surely somebody can figure out how to do this lizard thing and then everything else will fall very quickly.”</span></p>
<p>But are humans really so great at exhibiting agency? After all, Cluely managed to raise tens of millions of dollars with a product that promises to take decision-making out of our hands. AI can’t function without instructions from humans, but an increasing number of humans seem incapable of functioning without AI. There are people who can’t order at a restaurant without having an AI scan the menu and tell them what to eat; people who no longer know how to talk to their friends and family and get ChatGPT to do it instead. For Alexander, this is a kind of Sartrean <em>mauvaise foi.</em> “It’s terrifying to ask someone out,” he said. “What you want is to have the dating site that tells you that algorithmically you’ve been matched with this person, and then magically you have permission to talk to them. I think there’s something similar going on here with AI. Many of these people are smart enough that they could answer their own questions, but they want someone else to do it, because then they don’t have to have this terrifying encounter with their own humanity.” His best-case scenario for AI is essentially the antithesis of Roy’s: superintelligence that will actively refuse to give us everything we want, for the sake of preserving our humanity. “If we ever get AI that is strong enough to basically be God and solve all of our problems, it will need to use the same techniques that the actual God uses in terms of maintaining some distance. I do think it’s possible that the AI will be like, <em>Now I am God. I’ve concluded that the actual God made exactly the right decision on how much evil to permit in the universe. Therefore I refuse to change anything.</em>”</p>
<p><span>But until we build an all-powerful but distant God, the agency problem remains. AIs are not capable of directing themselves; most people aren’t either. According to Alexander, Silicon Valley venture capitalists are now in a furious search for the few people who are. “VCs will throw money at a startup that looks like it can corner the market, even if they can’t code. Once they have money, they can hire competent engineers; it’s trivially easy for anything that’s not frontier tech. They’re willing to stake a lot of money on the one in a hundred people who are high-agency and economically viable.” This shift has had a distorting effect on his own social milieu: “There’s an intense pressure to be an unusual person who will be unique and get the funding.” Since rationalists are already fairly unusual, it’s hard to imagine what that would </span>look like. People will endure a lot of indignity to avoid being left behind without VC money when the great bifurcation takes place. Nobody wants to be <span>part of the permanent underclass. I asked Alexander whether he thought of himself as highly agentic. “No, I don’t,” he said instantly. He told me that in his</span> <span>personal life, he felt as though he’d never once actually</span><span> made a decision. But, he said, “It seems to be going well.”</span></p>
<p>Eric Zhu might be the most highly agentic person I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><span>When I dropped in on his office, which also serves as a biomedical lab and film studio, he had just turned eighteen. “So you’re no longer a child founder,” I said. “I know,” he said. “It’s terrible.” His oldest employee was thirty-four; the youngest was sixteen. When the pandemic began in 2020, Eric was twelve years old, living with his parents in rural Indiana. “My parents were really protective, so I didn’t get a computer until quarantine started. And then, after I got my first computer in quarantine, I was just fucking around. I was on Discord servers. I was on Slack.” Some kids drift into the wrong kind of Discord server and end up turning into crazed mass shooters; Eric found one full of tech people. “I sort of randomly got in there, and then I thought it was really fun,” he told me. Eric started marketing himself as a teen coder, even though he couldn’t actually code: he’d take $5,000 commissions and subcontract them out to freelancers in India.</span></p>
<p><span>His next project was more serious. “I saw this <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article where a lot of PE firms were buying up a lot of small businesses and roll-ups. I was like, <em>What if I figure out a way to underwrite these small businesses?</em>” Eric built an AI-powered tool to assign value to local companies on the basis of publicly available demographic data. Clients wanted to take calls during work hours, so he would speak to them from his school bathroom. “I convinced my counselor that I had prostate issues so I could use the restroom,” he told me. Sometimes a drug dealer would be posted up in the stall next to him. “I was trying to figure out why they were always out of class. They stole hall passes from teachers. So I would buy hall passes from drug dealers to get out of class, to have business meetings.” Soon he was taking Zoom calls with a U.S.&nbsp;senator to discuss tech regulation. “He was like, <em>Hey, I don’t feel comfortable meeting a minor in a high school bathroom.</em> So I showed up with a green screen.” Next, he built his own venture-capital fund, managing $20 million. At one point cops raided the bathroom looking for drug dealers while Eric was busy talking with an investor. Eventually, the school got sick of Eric’s misuse of the facilities and kicked him out. He moved to San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span>Eric made all of this sound incredibly easy. You hang out in some Discord servers, make a few connections with the right people; next thing you know, you’re a millionaire. And in a sense, it <em>is</em> easy. Absolutely anyone could have done the same things he did. In 2020, when Eric was subcontracting coding gigs out to the Third World, I was utterly broke, living in a room the size of a shoebox in London. I would scour my local supermarket for reduced-price items nearing their sell-by date, which meant that an alarmingly high percentage of my diet consisted of liverwurst. There was nothing stopping me from making thousands of dollars a week by doing exactly what Eric was doing. It didn’t require any skills at all—just a tiny amount of initiative. But he did it and I didn’t. Why?</span></p>
<p><span>In a way, Eric reminded me of some of the great </span><span>scammers of the 2010s. People like Anna Delvey, a</span><span> Russian who arrived in New York claiming to be a </span><span>fabulously wealthy German heiress with such breezy confidence that everyone in high society simply believed her. She was fundamentally a broken person, a fantasist. She’d seen the images of wealth and glamour in magazines and fashion blogs, and constructed a delusion in which this, and not the dull, anonymous, small-town existence she’d actually been born into, was her life. For a while, at least, it worked. Her mad dreams slotted perfectly into reality like a key in a lock. Most people are condemned to trudge along in the furrow that the world has dug for them, but a few deranged dreamers really can wish themselves into whatever life they want.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike Roy, Eric didn’t think there was anything particularly special about himself. Why did he, unlike any of his classmates, start a $20&nbsp;million VC fund? “I think I was just bored. Honestly, I was really bored.” Did he think anyone could do what he did? “Yeah, I think anyone genuinely can.” So how come most people don’t? “I got really lucky. I met the right people at the right time.” Anyway, Eric isn’t involved with the underwriting firm or the venture-capital fund anymore. His new company is called Sperm Racing.</span></p>
<p><span>Last April, Eric held a live sperm-racing event in Los Angeles. Hundreds of frat boys came out to watch a head-to-head match between the effluvia of USC’s and UCLA’s most virile students, moving through a plastic maze. (There was some controversy over the footage: Eric had replaced the actual sperm with more purposeful CGI wrigglers. “If you look at sperm, it’s </span>not entertaining under a microscope. What we do is we track the coordinates, so it <em>is</em> a sperm race—it’s just up-skinned.”) He’s planning on rolling the races out nationwide. Eric delivered a decent spiel about sperm motility as a proxy for health and how sperm racing drew attention to important issues. His venture seemed to be of a piece with a general trend toward obsessive masculine self-optimization à la RFK&nbsp;Jr.&nbsp;and Andrew Huberman. Still, to me it seemed obvious that Eric was doing it simply because he was amazed that he could. “I could build enterprise software or whatever,” he told me, “but what’s the craziest thing I could do? I would rather have an interesting life than a couple hundred million dollars in my bank account. Racing cum is definitely interesting.” I found Eric very hard not to like.</p>
<p><span>There was one thing I did find strange, though—stranger than turning semen into mass nonpornographic entertainment. Upstairs at Sperm Racing HQ is a lab stocked with racks of test tubes, centrifuges for separating out the most motile sperm from a sample, and little plastic slides containing new microscopic racecourses for frat-boy cum. Downstairs is the studio and editing suite. A third of Eric’s staff work on videos, producing a seemingly endless stream of viral content about sperm racing. A lot of the time, though, the connection is tenuous. One video was a stylized version of Eric’s life story, featuring expensively rendered CGI explosions set to Chinese rap. Another was a parody of Cluely’s viral blind-date ad. Like Cluely, Sperm Racing seemed to be first and foremost a social-media hype machine. As far as I could tell, being a highly agentic individual had less to do with actually doing things and more to do with constantly chasing attention online.</span></p>
<p><span>O</span><span>n August 5, 2025, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, posted on X, “we have a lot of new stuff for you over the next few days! something big-but-small today. and then a big upgrade later this week.” An X user calling himself Donald Boat replied, “Can you send me $1500 so I can buy a gaming computer.”</span></p>
<p><span>This was the start of an extended harassment campaign against the most powerful figure in AI. One day Altman posted: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>someday soon something smarter than the smartest person you know will be running on a device in your pocket, helping you with whatever you want. this is a very remarkable thing.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Donald Boat fired back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Just got chills imagining you putting your credit card number, CVV, &amp; expiry date into an online retailer’s digital checkout kiosk and purchasing a gaming computer for me.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Altman: “we are providing ChatGPT access to the entire federal workforce!”</p>
<p>Donald Boat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>I would love for you to wheel me around the Santa Clara Microcenter in a wheelchair like an invalid </span><span>while I clicketyclick with a laser-pointer the boxes of the modules of the gaming PC you will purchase, assemble, &amp; have shipped to my mother’s house.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Altman: “gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!)” </span></p>
<p><span>Donald Boat:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Sam.<br>
You, me.<br>
The Amalfi Coast.<br>
ME: Double fernet on the rocks, club soda to taste.<br>
YOU: One delightfully sweetbitter negroni, stirred 2,900,000,000 revolutions counter-clockwise, one for each hertz of the NVIDIA 5090 in the gaming PC you will buy and ship to my house.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>That last one did the trick. “ok this was funny,” Altman replied. “send me your address and ill send you a 5090.”</span></p>
<p><span>This was the beginning of Donald Boat’s reign of terror. He began publicly demanding things from every major figure in the tech industry. Will Manidis, who ran the health-care-data firm ScienceIO, was strong-armed into supplying a motherboard. Jason Liu, an AI consultant and scout at Andreessen Horowitz, had to give tribute of one mouse pad. Guillaume Verdon, who worked on quantum machine learning at Google and founded the “effective acceleration” movement, was taxed one $1,200 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. Gabriel Petersson, a researcher at OpenAI, posted on X: “people are too scared to post, nobody wants to pay the donald boat tax.” Donald Boat appeared demanding an electric guitar. He was becoming a kind of online folk hero, expropriating the expropriators, conjuring trivial things from tech barons in the way they seemed to have conjured enormous piles of money out of thin air. He started posting strange, gnomic messages. Things like “I am building a mechanical monstrosity that will bring about the end of history.” Images of the fasting, emaciated Buddha. A prominent crypto influencer who goes by the alias Ansem received an image of the <em>dharmachakra.</em> “Turn the wheel,” read Donald Boat’s message.</span></p>
<p><span>In a way, Donald Boat had achieved the dream of every desperate startup founder in the Bay Area. He had propelled himself to online fame, and used it to relieve major investors of their money. But somehow he’d managed to do it without ever once having to create a B2B app. He was a kind of pure viral phenomenon. Cluely might have deployed a few provocative stunts to raise millions of dollars for a service that didn’t really work and could barely be said to exist, but Donald Boat did away with even the pretense. He’d generated a brutally simplified miniature of the entire VC economy. People were giving him stuff for no reason except that Altman had already done it, and they didn’t want to be left out of the trend.</span></p>
<p><span>Donald Boat’s real name isn’t actually Donald Boat, but since so much of his being seems to be wrapped up in the name and his dog-headed avatar, it’s what I’ll keep calling him. He wanted to meet at a Cheesecake Factory. This was part of his new project, which was to review absolutely everything that exists in the universe. He was starting with chain restaurants. He’d already done Olive Garden. His review begins with Giuseppe Garibaldi,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>on the beach at Marsala, bootsoles in the saltwhite shallows, wind in his beard gristle. Behind him, his not-quite One Thousand Redshirts disembarking, all rusty rifles and stalebiscuit crotch sweat.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lasagna summons visions of “smegma, Vesuvius, blood thinner marinara, the splotchy headpattern of a partisan, brainblown in his sleep.” He likes the Joycean compound. Shortly before I arrived at the <span>Cheesecake Factory, he texted to let me know that he’d been drinking all day, so when I met </span>him I thought he was irretrievably wasted. In fact, it turned out, he was just like that all the time.</p>
<p><span>Donald was twenty-one, terrifyingly tall, and intense. His head lolled from side to side as he chattered away, jumping from one thought to the next according to a pattern known only to himself. At one point he suddenly decided to draw a portrait of me, which he later scanned and turned into a bespoke business card.</span></p>
<p><span>He seemed to have a constant roster of projects on the go. He’d sent me occasional photos of his exploits. He went down to L.A.&nbsp;to see Oasis and ended up in a poker game with a group of weapons manufacturers. “I made a bunch of jokes about sending all their poker money to China,” he said, “and they were not pleased.” He’d had a plan to get into the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and then get kicked out. He was trying to read all of world literature, starting with the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh.</em> Was his Sam Altman gaming-PC escapade similar? Had he actually expected to get anything? “I really, really wish I was a tactical mastermind, that there was an endgame. Really I was just having a </span>laugh. A chortle, if you will. I wasn’t thinking too hard about it. I don’t use that computer and I think video games are a waste of time. I spent all the money I made from going viral on Oasis tickets.” As far as he was concerned, the fact that tech people were tripping over themselves to take part in his stunt just confirmed his generally low impression of them. “They have too much money and nothing going on. They<span> have no swag, no smoke, no motion, no hoes. That’s all you need to know.” Ever since his big viral moment, he’d been suddenly inundated with messages from startup drones who’d decided that his clout might be useful to them. One had offered to fly him out to the French Riviera.</span></p>
<p>I told Donald the theory I’d been nursing—that he and Roy Lee were, in some sense, secret twins, viral phenomena gobbling up money and attention. I wasn’t sure if he’d like this. But to my surprise, he agreed. “I’m like Roy. I’m like Trump. We have the same swaggering energy. There is a kind of source code underlying reality, and this is what we understand. Your words have to have wings. Roy and I both know that social media is the last remaining outlet for self-creation and artistry. That’s what you have to understand about zoomers: we’re agents of chaos. We want to destroy the whole world.” Did Donald consider himself to be highly agentic? “We need to ban the word ‘agency.’ I’m a dog.”</p>
<p>By now we’d ingested the most calorific cheesecake on the menu, the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, which clocked in at 1,580 calories for a single slice. It was closing in on midnight, I was not feeling good, and Donald’s phone was nearly dead. He suggested that we go to the Cluely offices so he <span>could charge it. “They’ll let me in,” he said</span>. “They’re my slaves.”</p>
<p>Roy was still up. He didn’t seem particularly surprised to see me. He and most of the Cluely staff were flopped on a single sofa. All these people had become incredibly rich; previous generations of Silicon Valley founders would have been hosting exorbitant parties. In the Cluely office, they were playing <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Did they spend every night there? “We’re all feminists here,” Roy said. “We’re usually up at four in the morning. We’re debating the struggles of women in today’s society.”</p>
<p><span>Somehow the conversation turned to politics. Roy advanced the idea that there hadn’t been a cool Democrat since Obama. One of his employees, Abdulla Ababakre, jumped in. “As a guy from a Communist country, let me just say: Obama is a scammer. I’m much more a Republican.” Abdulla is a Uighur. Before coming to San Francisco, he worked for ByteDance in Beijing. His comment caused an instant uproar. “Get him out of here!” Roy yelled. “I love Obama,” he told me. “I love Trump, I love Hillary. I have a big heart, bro, my bad.” Abdulla just grinned. His proudest achievement was an app that freezes your phone until you’ve read a passage from the Qur’an. According to him, “Roy in his values is very much Muslim, the most Muslim I know.”</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t know if I believed that, but there were still some things I didn’t understand about Roy. He was clearly a highly agentic person, but what was all this agency being used for? What did he actually want?</span></p>
<p><span>According to Roy, he has three great aims in life: “To hang out with friends, to do something meaningful, and to go on lots of dates.” He said he went on a date every two weeks, which was clearly meant to be an impressive figure. Cluely employees are encouraged to date a lot; they can put it all on expenses. They didn’t seem to be taking up the opportunity to any greater degree than their founder. I spoke to Cameron White, who had been Roy and Neel’s first hire at the company. As he spoke, he stared at a point roughly forty-five degrees to my left and swung his arms. He didn’t date. “I’m focused on becoming a better version of myself first. Becoming, like, higher weight, more healthy, more knowledgeable.” He didn’t think he had anything to offer a woman yet. I said that if someone loves you, they don’t really care so much about your weight. “I feel like that’s cope. I don’t think there’s such a thing as love. It’s what you can provide to a woman. If you can provide good genetics, that’s health or whatever. If you can provide resources, if you can provide an interesting life. If you truly love the girl, you need to become the best version of yourself.” Cameron was twenty-five years old but he wasn’t there yet. He would not try to meet someone until he had made himself perfect.</span></p>
<p>For Roy, meanwhile, dating actually seemed to be a means to an end. “All the culture here is downstream of my belief that human beings are driven by biological desires. We have a pull-up bar and we go to the gym and we talk about dating, because nothing motivates people more than getting laid.” He was interested in physical beauty too, but only because “the better you look, the better you are as an entrepreneur. It’s all connected and beauty is everything. A lot of ugly men are just losers. The point of looking good is that society will reward you for that.” What about other kinds of beauty? Music, for instance? Roy had played the cello as a child. Did he still listen to classical music? “It doesn’t get my blood rushing the same way that EDM will.” His preferred genre was hardstyle—frantic thumping remixes of pop songs by the likes of Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. Is that the function of music, to get your blood rushing? “Yeah. I’m not a big fan of music to focus on things. I think it disturbs my flow. The only reason I will listen to music is to get me really hyped up when I’m lifting.” The two possible functions of music were, apparently, focus and hype. Everything for the higher goal of building a successful startup. What about life itself? Would Roy die for Cluely? “I would be happy dying at any age past twenty-five. After that it doesn’t matter, bro. If I live, I have extreme confidence in my ability to make three million dollars a year every year until I die.”</p>
<p><span>What about literature? The last time Donald had dropped in on his slaves at Cluely, he’d gifted them two Penguin Classics: Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em> and Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron.</em> The books were still lying, </span>unread, where he’d left them. He suggested that Roy might find something more valuable than dying for Cluely if he actually tried to read them. Roy disagreed: “I do not obtain value from reading books.” And anyway, he didn’t have the time. He was too busy keeping up with viral trends on TikTok. “You have to make the time,” Donald and I said, practically in unison. “It makes your life better,” I said. “Why don’t you go to Turkey to get a hair transplant?” Roy snapped. “That would make your life better.” “I don’t care about my hair,” I said. “Well,” said Roy, “I don’t<span> care about the <em>Decanterbury Tales.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span>Donald was practically vibrating when we left Cluely. “Dude, he’s just a scared little boy,” he said. “He’s scared he’s not doing the right thing, and because of the fucked-up world we live in, people who should be in The Hague are giving him twenty million dollars. Something bad is gonna happen here, something really fucking bad is gonna happen.” He sighed. “I just want Zohran’s nonbinary praetorians to march across the country and put all these guys in cuffs.” I found it hard to disagree. It did not seem like a good idea to me that some of the richest people in the world were no longer rewarding people for having any particular skills, but simply for having agency, when agency essentially meant whatever it was that was afflicting Roy Lee. Unlike Eric Zhu or Donald Boat, Roy didn’t really seem to have anything in his life except his own sense of agency. Everything was a means to an end, a way of fortifying his ability to do whatever he wanted in the </span>world. But there was a great sucking void where <span>the end ought to be. All he wanted, he’d said, was to hang out with his friends. I believed him. He wanted not to be alone, the way he’d been alone for a year after having his offer of admission rescinded by Harvard. For people to pay attention to him. To exist for other people. But instead of making friends the normal way, he’d walked up to strangers and asked whether they wanted to start a company with him, and then he built the most despised startup in San Francisco. He was probably right: he could count on making a few million dollars every year for the rest of his life, even after Cluely inevitably crashes and burns. He would never want for capital, but this did not seem like the most efficient way to achieve his goals.</span></p>
<p>I walked back to my hotel, past signs that said things like one <span>ping<span>, </span>shipped</span> and <span>ai agents are humans<span>, </span>too</span>. My scalp was tingling. I’d lied when I’d told Roy that I didn’t care about my hair. Of course I care about my hair. Every day I grimace in the mirror as a little more of it vanishes from the top of my head. Whenever someone takes a photo of me from above or behind, I wince at the horrifying glimpse of pale, naked scalp. But I’d never done anything about it. I’d just watched and whinged and let it happen.</p>
<p><span>M</span>y<span> encounter with the highly agentic took place last September. In October, Roy Lee spoke at something called TechCrunch Disrupt, where he admitted that chasing online controversy had so far failed to give Cluely what he called “product velocity.” Around the same time, he led a major rebrand. Cluely would now be in the business of making “beautiful meeting </span>notes” and sending “instant follow-up emails.” A lot of these functions are already being introduced by companies like Zoom; the main difference is that, by <span>all accounts, Cluely still doesn’t consistently work. By the end of November, Cluely announced that it was leaving San Francisco and moving to New York. In December, the company celebrated the move with a party at a Midtown cocktail bar and lounge called NOFLEX®. In photos, it appeared as though the gathering was attended almost entirely by men in white T-shirts not drinking anything. I was in New York at the time. I didn’t go.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault7 - a large cache of CIA hacking tools and internal documents. Buried among the exploits and surveillance tools was something far more mundane: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_1179773.html">a page of internal developer documentation with git tips and tricks</a>.</p>

<p>Most of it is fairly standard stuff, amending commits, stashing changes, using bisect. But one tip has lived in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> ever since.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Over time, a local git repo accumulates stale branches. Every feature branch, hotfix, and experiment you’ve ever merged sits there doing nothing. <code>git branch</code> starts to look like a graveyard.</p>

<p>You can list merged branches with:</p>

<pre><code>git branch --merged
</code></pre>

<p>But deleting them one by one is tedious. The CIA’s dev team has a cleaner solution:</p>

<h2 id="the-original-command">The original command</h2>

<pre><code>git branch --merged | grep -v "\*\|master" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
</code></pre>

<p>How it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git branch --merged</code> — lists all local branches that have already been merged into the current branch</li>
  <li><code>grep -v "\*\|master"</code> — filters out the current branch (<code>*</code>) and <code>master</code> so you don’t delete either</li>
  <li><code>xargs -n 1 git branch -d</code> — deletes each remaining branch one at a time, safely (lowercase <code>-d</code> won’t touch unmerged branches)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-updated-command">The updated command</h2>

<p>Since most projects now use <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code>, you can update the command and exclude any other branches you frequently use:</p>

<pre><code>git branch --merged origin/main | grep -vE "^\s*(\*|main|develop)" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
</code></pre>

<p>Run this from <code>main</code> after a deployment and your branch list goes from 40 entries back down to a handful.</p>

<p>I keep this as a git alias so I don’t have to remember the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>alias ciaclean='git branch --merged origin/main | grep -vE "^\s*(\*|main|develop)" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d'
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your repo just run:</p>

<pre><code>ciaclean
</code></pre>

<p>Small thing, but one of those commands that quietly saves a few minutes every week and keeps me organised.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759">https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47088037">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="presentation" data-paste-markdown-skip="">
    <tbody data-target-translation-id="9509596" data-target-translation-type="discussion">
        <tr>
    <td>
        <h2 dir="auto">Announcement</h2>
<p dir="auto">We are happy to announce that <a href="https://ggml.ai/" rel="nofollow">ggml.ai</a> (the founding team of <code>llama.cpp</code>) are joining <a href="https://huggingface.co/" rel="nofollow">Hugging Face</a> in order to keep future AI truly open.</p>
<p dir="auto">Georgi and team are joining HF with the goal of scaling and supporting the <code>ggml</code>/<code>llama.cpp</code> community as Local AI continues to make exponential progress in the coming years.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Summary / Key-points</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org">ggml-org</a> projects remain open and community driven as always</li>
<li>The ggml team continues to lead, maintain and support full-time the <code>ggml</code> and <code>llama.cpp</code> libraries and related open-source projects</li>
<li>The new partnership ensures long-term sustainability of the projects and will help foster new opportunities for users and contributors</li>
<li>Additional focus will be dedicated on improving user experience and integration with the Hugging Face <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a> library for improved model support</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto">Why this change?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Since its foundation in 2023, the core mission of ggml.ai has continuously been to support the development and the adoption of the <code>ggml</code> machine learning library. Over the past 3 years, the small team behind the company has been doing its best to grow the open-source developer community and to help establish <code>ggml</code> as the definitive standard for efficient local AI inference. This was achieved through strong collaboration with individual contributors, as well as with partnerships with model providers and independent hardware vendors. As a result, today <code>llama.cpp</code> has become the fundamental building block in countless projects and products, enabling private and easily-accessible AI on consumer hardware.</p>
<p dir="auto">Throughout this development, Hugging Face stood out as the strongest and most supportive partner of this initiative. During the course of the last couple of years, HF engineers (notably <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/ngxson/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/ngxson">@ngxson</a> and <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/allozaur/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/allozaur">@allozaur</a>) have:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Contributed several core functionalities to <code>ggml</code> and <code>llama.cpp</code></li>
<li>Built a solid inference server with polished user interface</li>
<li>Introduced multi-modal support to <code>llama.cpp</code></li>
<li>Integrated <code>llama.cpp</code> into the Hugging Face Inference Endpoints</li>
<li>Improved compatibility of the GGUF file format with the Hugging Face platform</li>
<li>Implemented multiple model architectures into <code>llama.cpp</code></li>
<li>Helped <code>ggml</code> projects with general maintenance, PR reviews and more</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The teamwork between our teams has always been smooth and efficient. Both sides, as well as the community, have benefited from these joint efforts. It only makes sense to formalize this collaboration and make it stronger in the future.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What will change for <code>ggml</code>/<code>llama.cpp</code>, the open source project and the community?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Not much – Georgi and team will continue to dedicate 100% of their time maintaining <code>ggml</code>/<code>llama.cpp</code>. The community will continue to operate fully autonomously and make technical and architectural decisions as usual. Hugging Face is providing the project with long-term sustainable resources, improving the chances of the project to grow and thrive. The project will continue to be 100% open-source and community driven as it is now. Expect your favorite quants to be supported even faster once a model is released.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Technical focus</h3>
<p dir="auto">Going forward, our joint efforts will be geared towards the following objectives:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Towards seamless “single-click” integration with the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a> library<br>
The <code>transformers</code> framework has established itself as the ‘source of truth’ for AI model definitions. Improving the compatibility between the transformers and the ggml ecosystems is essential for wider model support and quality control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Better packaging and user experience of ggml-based software<br>
As we enter the phase in which local inference becomes a meaningful and competitive alternative to cloud inference, it is crucial to improve and simplify the way in which casual users deploy and access local models. We will work towards making llama.cpp ubiquitous and readily available everywhere, and continue partnering with great downstream projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto">Long term vision</h3>
<p dir="auto">Our shared goal is to provide the building blocks to make open-source superintelligence accessible to the world over the coming years. We will achieve this together with the growing Local AI community, as we continue to build the ultimate inference stack that runs as efficiently as possible on our devices.</p>

Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.</p><p>The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. </p><p>Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.</p><p>SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.</p><p>In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. </p><p>"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident," spokesman José Castañeda said. </p><p>The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. </p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Alleged efforts to conceal</h2><div><p>Authorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. </p><p>"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani.&nbsp;</p><p>The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. </p><p>According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.</p><p>The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. </p><p>On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. </p><p>Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.</p><p>Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. </p><p>If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By Ljubisa Bajic</p><p>Many believe AI is the real deal. In narrow domains, it already surpasses human performance. Used well, it is an unprecedented amplifier of human ingenuity and productivity. Its widespread adoption is hindered by two key barriers: high latency and astronomical cost. Interactions with language models lag far behind the pace of human cognition. Coding assistants can ponder for minutes, disrupting the programmer’s state of flow, and limiting effective human-AI collaboration. Meanwhile, automated agentic AI applications demand millisecond latencies, not leisurely human-paced responses.</p><p>On the cost front, deploying modern models demands massive engineering and capital: room-sized supercomputers consuming hundreds of kilowatts, with liquid cooling, advanced packaging, stacked memory, complex I/O, and miles of cables. This scales to city-sized data center campuses and satellite networks, driving extreme operational expenses.</p><p>Though society seems poised to build a dystopian future defined by data centers and adjacent power plants, history hints at a different direction. Past technological revolutions often started with grotesque prototypes, only to be eclipsed by breakthroughs yielding more practical outcomes.</p><p>Consider ENIAC, a room-filling beast of vacuum tubes and cables. ENIAC introduced humanity to the magic of computing, but was slow, costly, and unscalable. The transistor sparked swift evolution, through workstations and PCs, to smartphones and ubiquitous computing, sparing the world from ENIAC sprawl.</p><p>General-purpose computing entered the mainstream by becoming easy to build, fast, and cheap.</p><p>AI needs to do the same.</p><h3>About Taalas</h3><p>Founded 2.5 years ago, Taalas developed a platform for transforming any AI model into custom silicon. From the moment a previously unseen model is received, it can be realized in hardware in only two months.</p><p>The resulting Hardcore Models are an order of magnitude faster, cheaper, and lower power than software-based implementations.</p><p>Taalas’ work is guided by the following core principles:</p><h4>1. Total specialization</h4><p>Throughout the history of computation, deep specialization has been the surest path to extreme efficiency in critical workloads.</p><p>AI inference is the most critical computational workload that humanity has ever faced, and the one that stands to gain the most from specialization.</p><p>Its computational demands motivate total specialization: the production of optimal silicon for each individual model.</p><h4>2. Merging storage and computation</h4><p>Modern inference hardware is constrained by an artificial divide: memory on one side, compute on the other, operating at fundamentally different speeds.</p><p>This separation arises from a longstanding paradox. DRAM is far denser, and therefore cheaper, than the types of memory compatible with standard chip processes. However, accessing off-chip DRAM is thousands of times slower than on-chip memory. Conversely, compute chips cannot be built using DRAM processes.</p><p>This divide underpins much of the complexity in modern inference hardware, creating the need for advanced packaging, HBM stacks, massive I/O bandwidth, soaring per-chip power consumption, and liquid cooling.</p><p>Taalas eliminates this boundary. By unifying storage and compute on a single chip, at DRAM-level density, our architecture far surpasses what was previously possible.</p><h4>3. Radical simplification</h4><p>By removing the memory-compute boundary and tailoring silicon to each model, we were able to redesign the entire hardware stack from first principles.</p><p>The result is a system that does not depend on difficult or exotic technologies, no HBM, advanced packaging, 3D stacking, liquid cooling, high speed IO.</p><p>Engineering simplicity enables an order-of-magnitude reduction in total system cost.</p><h3>Early Products</h3><p>Guided by this technical philosophy, Taalas has created the world’s fastest, lowest cost/power inference platform.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://taalas.com/h-content/uploads/2026/02/Taalas-HC1.png" alt="Taalas HC1 board" width="612" height="408"><br> <span>Figure 1: Taalas HC1 hard-wired with Llama 3.1 8B model</span></p><p>Today, we are unveiling our first product: a hard-wired Llama 3.1 8B, available as both a <a href="https://chatjimmy.ai/">chatbot demo</a> and an <a href="https://taalas.com/api-request-form">inference API service</a>.</p><p>Taalas’ silicon Llama achieves 17K tokens/sec per user, nearly 10X faster than the current state of the art, while costing 20X less to build, and consuming 10X less power.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://taalas.com/h-content/uploads/2026/02/graph.png" alt="Chart showing speed comparison between Taalas and competitors - tokens per second per user" width="1200" height="572"><span>Performance data for Llama 3.1 8B, Input sequence length 1k/1k | Source: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-performance-training-inference/ai-inference">Nvidia Baseline (H200)</a>, B200 measured by Taalas | Groq, Sambanova, Cerebras performance from <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/llama-3-1-instruct-8b/providers#speed">Artificial Analysis</a> | Taalas Performance run by Taalas labs</span></p><p><span>Figure 2: Taalas HC1 delivers leadership tokens/sec/user on Llama 3.1 8B</span></p><p>We selected the Llama 3.1 8B as the basis for our first product due to its practicality. Its small size and open-source availability allowed us to harden the model with minimal logistical effort.</p><p>While largely hard-wired for speed, the Llama retains flexibility through configurable context window size and support for fine-tuning via low-rank adapters (LoRAs).</p><p>At the time we began work on our first generation design, low-precision parameter formats were not standardized. Our first silicon platform therefore used a custom 3-bit base data type. The Silicon Llama is aggressively quantized, combining 3-bit and 6-bit parameters, which introduces some quality degradations relative to GPU benchmarks.</p><p>Our second-generation silicon adopts standard 4-bit floating-point formats, addressing these limitations while maintaining high speed and efficiency.</p><h3>Upcoming models</h3><p>Our second model, still based on Taalas’ first-generation silicon platform (HC1), will be a mid-sized reasoning LLM. It is expected in our labs this spring and will be integrated into our inference service shortly thereafter.</p><p>Following this, a frontier LLM will be fabricated using our second-generation silicon platform (HC2). HC2 offers considerably higher density and even faster execution. Deployment is planned for winter.</p><h3>Instantaneous AI, in your hands today</h3><p>Our debut model is clearly not on the leading edge, but we decided to release it as a beta service anyway – to let developers explore what becomes possible when LLM inference runs at sub-millisecond speed and near-zero cost.</p><p>We believe that our service enables many classes of applications that were previously impractical, and want to encourage developers to experiment, and discover how these capabilities can be applied.</p><p>Apply for access <a href="https://taalas.com/api-request-form/">here</a>, and engage with a system that removes traditional AI latency and cost constraints.</p><h3>On substance, team and craft</h3><p>At its core, Taalas is a small group of long-time collaborators, many of whom have been together for over twenty years. To remain lean and focused, we rely on external partners who bring equal skill and decades of shared experience. The team grows slowly, with new team members joining through demonstrated excellence, alignment with our mission and respect for our established practices. Here, substance outweighs spectacle, craft outweighs scale, and rigor outweighs redundancy.</p><p>Taalas is a precision strike, in a world where deep-tech startups approach their chosen problems like medieval armies besieging a walled city, with swarming numbers, overflowing coffers of venture capital, and a clamor of hype that drowns out clear thought.</p><p>Our first product was brought to the world by a team of 24 team members, and a total of just $30M spent, of more than $200M raised. This achievement demonstrates that precisely defined goals and disciplined focus achieve what brute force cannot.</p><p>Going forward, we will advance in the open. Our Llama inference platform is already in your hands. Future systems will follow as they mature. We will expose them early, iterate swiftly, and accept the rough edges.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Innovation begins by questioning assumptions and venturing into the neglected corners of any solution space. That is the path we chose at Taalas.</p><p>Our technology delivers step-function gains in performance, power efficiency, and cost.</p><p>It reflects a fundamentally different architectural philosophy from the mainstream, one that redefines how AI systems are built and deployed.</p><p>Disruptive advances rarely look familiar at first, and we are committed to helping the industry understand and adopt this new operating paradigm.</p><p>Our first products, beginning with our hard-wired Llama and rapidly expanding to more capable models, eliminate high latency and cost, the core barriers to ubiquitous AI.</p><p>We have placed instantaneous, ultra-low-cost intelligence in developers’ hands, and are eagerly looking forward to seeing what they build with it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>When I decided to build my startup on European infrastructure, I thought it would be a straightforward swap. Ditch AWS, pick some EU providers, done. How hard could it be?</p><p>Turns out: harder than expected. Not impossible, I did it, but nobody talks about the weird friction points you hit along the way. This is that post.</p><h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2><p>Data sovereignty, GDPR simplicity, not having your entire business dependent on three American hyperscalers, and honestly, a bit of stubbornness. I wanted to prove it could be done. The EU has real infrastructure companies building serious products. They deserve the traffic.</p><h2 id="the-stack">The stack</h2><p>Here's what I landed on after a lot of trial, error, and migration headaches.</p><p><strong>Hetzner</strong> handles the core compute. Load balancers, VMs, and S3-compatible object storage. The pricing is almost absurdly good compared to AWS, and the performance is solid. If you've never spun up a Hetzner box, you're overpaying for cloud compute.</p><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> fills the gaps Hetzner doesn't cover. I use their Transactional Email (TEM) service, Container Registry, a second S3 bucket for specific workloads, their observability stack, and even their domain registrar. One provider, multiple services, it simplifies billing if nothing else.</p><p><strong>Bunny.net</strong> is the unsung hero of this stack. CDN with distributed storage, DNS, image optimization, WAF, and DDoS protection, all from a company headquartered in Slovenia. Their edge network is genuinely impressive and their dashboard is a joy to use. Coming from Cloudflare, I felt at home rather quickly.</p><p><strong>Nebius</strong> powers our AI inference. If you need GPU compute in Europe without sending requests to <code>us-east-1</code>, they're one of the few real options.</p><p><strong>Hanko</strong> handles authentication and identity. A German provider that gives you passkeys, social logins, and user management without reaching for Auth0 or Clerk. More on this in the "can't avoid" section — it doesn't eliminate American dependencies entirely, but it keeps the auth layer European.</p><h2 id="self-hosting-rancher-my-beloved">Self-hosting: Rancher, my beloved</h2><p>This is where things get fun... and time-consuming. I self-host a surprising amount:</p><ul><li><strong>Gitea</strong> for source control</li><li><strong>Plausible</strong> for privacy-friendly analytics</li><li><strong>Twenty CRM</strong> for customer management</li><li><strong>Infisical</strong> for secrets management</li><li><strong>Bugsink</strong> for error tracking</li></ul><p>All running on Kubernetes, with Rancher as the glue keeping the whole cluster sane.</p><p>Is self-hosting more work than SaaS? Obviously. But it means my data stays exactly where I put it, and I'm not at the mercy of a provider's pricing changes or acquisition drama.</p><p>For email, <strong>Tutanota</strong> keeps things encrypted and European. <strong>UptimeRobot</strong> watches the monitors so I can sleep.</p><p><strong>Transactional email with competitive pricing.</strong> This one surprised me. Sendgrid, Postmark, Mailgun, they all make it trivially easy and reasonably cheap. <br>The EU options exist, but finding one that matches on deliverability, pricing, and developer experience took real effort. Scaleway's TEM works, but the ecosystem is thinner. Fewer templates, fewer integrations, less community knowledge to lean on when something goes wrong.</p><p><strong>Leaving GitHub.</strong> If you live in GitHub's ecosystem Actions, Issues, code review workflows, the social graph... walking away feels like leaving a city you've lived in for a decade. You know where everything is. Gitea is actually excellent, and I'd recommend it without hesitation for the core git experience. But you'll miss the ecosystem. CI/CD pipelines need to be rebuilt. Integrations you took for granted don't exist. The muscle memory of <code>gh pr create</code> takes a while to unwire.</p><p><strong>Domain TLD pricing.</strong> This one is just baffling. Certain TLDs cost significantly more when purchased through European registrars. I'm talking 2-3x markups on extensions that are cheap everywhere else. I never got a satisfying explanation for why. If anyone knows, I'm genuinely curious.</p><h2 id="what-you-realistically-cant-avoid">What you realistically can't avoid</h2><p>Here's the honest part. Some things are American and you just have to accept it:</p><p><strong>Google Ads and Apple's Developer Program.</strong> If you want to acquire users and distribute a mobile app, you're paying the toll to Mountain View and Cupertino. There is no European alternative to the App Store or Play Store. This is just the cost of doing business.</p><p><strong>Social logins.</strong> Your users expect "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with Apple." <br>You can add email/password and passkeys, but removing social logins entirely is a conversion killer. Every one of those auth flows hits American servers. The silver lining: Hanko, a German identity provider, handles the auth layer itself, so at least your user management and session handling stay in Europe, even if the OAuth flow touches Google or Apple.</p><p><strong>AI.</strong> If you want Claude, and I very much want Claude, that's Anthropic, that's the US. <br>The EU AI ecosystem is growing, but for frontier models, the options are mostly American. You can run open-weight models on European inference providers, but if you want Claude, you're making a transatlantic API call.</p><h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2><p>Yes, with caveats. My infrastructure costs are lower than they'd be on AWS. My data residency story is clean. I understand my stack deeply because I had to ... there's no "just click the AWS button" escape hatch.</p><p>But it took longer than I expected. Every service I self-host is a service I maintain. <br>Every EU provider I chose has a smaller community, thinner docs, and fewer Stack Overflow (or Claude) answers when things break at 2 AM.</p><p>If you're thinking about doing this: go in with your eyes open. The EU infrastructure ecosystem is real and maturing fast. But "Made in EU" is still a choice you have to actively make, not one you can passively fall into. The defaults of the tech industry pull you west across the Atlantic, and swimming against that current takes effort.</p><p>It's effort worth spending. But it is effort.</p><p>If you curious to see the finished product, here it is: <a href="https://hank.parts/?ref=coinerella.com" rel="noreferrer">hank.parts</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jimmyhmiller.com/learn-codebase-visualizer">https://jimmyhmiller.com/learn-codebase-visualizer</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47085425">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The biggest shock of my early career was just how much code I needed to read that others wrote. I had never dealt with this. I had a hard enough time understanding my own code. The idea of understanding hundreds of thousands or even millions of lines of code written by countless other people scared me. What I quickly learned is that you don't have to understand a codebase in its entirety to be effective in it. But just saying that is not super helpful. So rather than tell, I want to show.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to walk you through how I learn an unfamiliar codebase. But I'll admit, this isn't precisely how I would do it today. After years of working on codebases, I've learned quite a lot of shortcuts. Things that come with experience that just don't translate for other people. So what I'm going to present is a reconstruction. I want to show bits and parts of how I go from knowing very little to gaining knowledge and ultimately, asking the right questions.</p>
<p>To do this, I will use just a few techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting a goal</li>
<li>Editing randomly</li>
<li>Fixing things I find that are broken</li>
<li>Reading to answer questions</li>
<li>Making a visualizer</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to do this on a real codebase, so I've chosen one whose purpose and scope I'm generally familiar with. But one that I've never contributed to or read, <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js">Next.js</a>. But I've chosen to be a bit more particular than that. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the Rust bundler setup (turbopack) that Next.js has been building out. So that's where we will concentrate our time.</p>
<h2>Being Clear About Our Goal</h2>
<p>Trying to learn a codebase is distinctly different from trying to simply fix a bug or add a feature. In post, we may use bugs, talk about features, make changes, etc. But we are not trying to contribute to the codebase, yet. Instead, we are trying to get our mind around how the codebase generally works. We aren't concerned with things like coding standards, common practices, or the development roadmap. We aren't even concerned with correctness. The changes we make are about seeing how the codebase responds so we can make sense of it.</p>
<h3>Starting Point</h3>
<p>I find starting at <code>main</code> to be almost always completely unhelpful. From main, yes, we have a single entry point, but now we are asking ourselves to understand the whole. But things actually get worse when dealing with a large codebase like this. There isn't even one main. Which main would we choose? So instead, let's start by figuring out what our library even consists of.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>ls -1d */</span>
</span><span>apps/<!-- -->
</span><span>bench/<!-- -->
</span><span>contributing/<!-- -->
</span><span>crates/<!-- -->
</span><span>docs/<!-- -->
</span><span>errors/<!-- -->
</span><span>examples/<!-- -->
</span><span>packages/<!-- -->
</span><span>patches/<!-- -->
</span><span>rspack/<!-- -->
</span><span>scripts/<!-- -->
</span><span>test-config-errors/<!-- -->
</span><span>test/<!-- -->
</span><span>turbo/<!-- -->
</span><span>turbopack/<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>A couple of things to note. We have packages, crates, turbo, and turbopack. Crates are relevant here because we know we are interested in some of the Rust code, but we are also interested in turbopack in particular. A quick look at these shows that turbo, packages, and crates are probably not our target. Why do I say that? Because turbopack has its own crates folder.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>ls -d turbopack/crates/* | wc -l</span>
</span><span>      54<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>So there are 54 crates under turbopack.... This is beginning to feel a bit daunting. So why don't we take a step back and find a better starting point? One starting point I find particularly useful is a <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/88009">bug report</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-bug-report.png"></p><p>I found this by simply looking at recently opened issues. When I first found it, it had no comments on it. In fact, I find bug reports with only reproducing instructions to be the most useful. Remember, we are trying to learn, not fix a bug.</p>
<p>So I spent a little time looking at the bug report. It is fairly clear. It does indeed reproduce. But it has a lot of code. So, as is often the case, it is useful to reduce it to the minimal case. So that's what I did. Here is the important code and the problem we are using to learn from.</p>
<pre><code><span>// app.ts</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> greeting <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./utility'</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>Home</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>"greeting"</span><span>}</span><span> World</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>// utility.ts</span>
<span>export</span> <span>enum</span> MyEnum <span>{</span>
  <span>UNIQUE_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>'UNIQUE_1'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>UNIQUE_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>'UNIQUE_2'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> greeting <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>MyEnum here is dead code. It should not show up in our final bundle. But when we do <code>next build</code> and look for it, we get:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>rg --no-ignore --hidden -g '!*.map' UNIQUE_1</span>
</span><span>app/utility.ts<!-- -->
</span><span>2: UNIQUE_1 = 'UNIQUE_1',<!-- -->
</span><span>
</span><span>.next/server/chunks/ssr/[root-of-the-server]__5f0b8324._.js<!-- -->
</span><span>1:module.exports=[93695,(a,b,c)=&gt;{b.exports=a.x("next/dist/shared/lib/...<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we instead do <code>next build --webpack</code></p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>rg --no-ignore --hidden -g '!*.map' UNIQUE_1</span>
</span><span>app/utility.ts<!-- -->
</span><span>2: UNIQUE_1 = 'UNIQUE_1',<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>The code is completely gone from our build.</p>
<h3>Setting an Agenda</h3>
<p>So now we have our bug. But remember. Our goal here is not to fix the bug. But to understand the code. So our goal is going to be to use this little mini problem to understand what code is involved in this bug. To understand the different ways we could fix this bug. To understand why this bug happened in the first place. To understand some small slice of the turbopack codebase.</p>
<p>So at each junction, we are going to resist the urge to simply find the offending code. We are going to take detours. We are going to ask questions. We hope that from the start of this process to the end, we no longer think of the code involved in this action as a black box. But we will intentionally leave ourselves with open questions. As I write these words, I have no idea where this will take us. I have not prepared this ahead of time. I am not telling you a fake tale from a codebase I already know. Yes, I will simplify and skip parts. But you will come along with me.</p>
<h2>Finding Tree Shaking</h2>
<p>The first step for understanding any project is getting some part of it running. Well, I say that, but in my day job, I've been at companies where this is a multi-day or week-long effort. Sometimes, because of a lack of access, sometimes from unclear instructions, if you find yourself in that situation, you now have a new task, understand it well enough to get it to build. Well, unfortunately, that is the scenario we find ourselves in.</p>
<h3>The First Side Quest</h3>
<p>I can't think of a single one of these endeavors I've gone on to learn a codebase that didn't involve a completely undesirable, momentum-stopping side quest. For this one, it was as soon as I tried to make changes to the turbopack Rust code and get it working in my test project. There are <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/25046dfa1bd78b1f8da478ceda51ae86c07b673c/contributing/core/developing.md#testing-a-local-nextjs-version-on-an-application">instructions on how to do this</a>. In fact, we even get an explanation on why it is a bit weird.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Turbopack doesn't support symlinks when pointing outside of the workspace directory, it can be difficult to develop against a local Next.js version. Neither <code>pnpm link</code> nor <code>file:</code> imports quite cut it. An alternative is to pack the Next.js version you want to test into a tarball and add it to the pnpm overrides of your test application. The following script will do it for you:</p>
<code>pnpm pack-next --tar &amp;&amp; pnpm unpack-next path/to/project
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, straightforward enough. I start by finding somewhere in the turbopack repo that I <em>think</em> will be called more than once, and I add the following:</p>
<pre><code>diff --git a/turbopack/crates/turbopack/src/lib.rs b/turbopack/crates/turbopack/src/lib.rs
index 20891acf86..8691f1951c 100644

</span><span>     let tree_shaking_mode = module_asset_context

</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes. Very scientific, I know. But I've found this to be a rather effective method of making sure my changes are picked up. So I do that, make sure I've built and done the necessary things. I run</p>
<pre><code><span>pnpm</span> swc-build-native <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>pnpm</span> pack-next --tar <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>pnpm</span> unpack-next /path/to/test/project
</code></pre>
<p>Then that script tells me to add some overrides and dependencies to my test project. I go to build my project and <strong>HERERE!!!!!!!</strong> does not show up at all...</p>
<h3>Understanding the Build System</h3>
<p>I will save you the fun details here of looking through this system. But I think it's important to mention a few things. First, <code>@next/swc</code> being a dependency immediately stood out to me. In my day job, I maintain a fork of swc (WHY???) for some custom stuff. I definitely won't pretend to be an expert on swc, but I know it's written in Rust. I know it's a native dependency. The changes I'm making are native dependencies. But I see no mention at all of turbopack. In fact, if I search in my test project, I get the following:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>fd --no-ignore swc</span>
</span><span>node_modules/@next/swc<!-- -->
</span><span>
</span><span><span>❯ </span><span>fd --no-ignore turbopack</span>
</span><span># empty<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>So I have a sneaking suspicion my turbopack code should be in that tar. So let's look at the tar.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>du -h next-swc.tar</span>
</span><span>12k<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ummm. That seems a bit small... Let's look at what's inside.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>tar -tf next-swc.tar</span>
</span><span>./README.md<!-- -->
</span><span>./package.json<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>Okay, I think we found our problem. There's really nothing in this at all. Definitely no native code.</p>
<h4>Regex - Now You Have Two Problems</h4>
<p>After lots of searching, the culprit came down to:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> packageFiles <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>globbedFiles<span>,</span> <span>...</span>simpleFiles<span>]</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>set</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> packageFiles<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>set</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>f<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>// We add the full path, but check for parent directories too.</span>
  <span>// This catches the case where the whole directory is added</span>
  <span>// and then a single file from the directory.</span>
  <span>// The sorting before ensures that the directory comes before</span>
  <span>// the files inside of the directory.</span>
  <span>set</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>f<span>)</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span>f<span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    f <span>=</span> f<span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/\/[^/]+$/</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>set</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>f<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In our case, the input came from <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/25046dfa1bd78b1f8da478ceda51ae86c07b673c/packages/next-swc/package.json#L1C1-L7C5">this file</a> and f was <code>"native/"</code>. Unfortunately, this little set + regex setup causes <code>native/</code> to be filtered out. Why? Because it doesn't match the regex. This regex is looking for a <code>/</code> with characters after it. We have none. So since we are already in the set (we just added ourselves), we filter ourselves out.</p>
<p>How do we solve this problem? There are countless answers, really. I had Claude whip me up one without regex.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> packageFiles <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>globbedFiles<span>,</span> <span>...</span>simpleFiles<span>]</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>set</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> packageFiles<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> normalized <span>=</span> <span>join</span><span>(</span>f<span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>set</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>normalized<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>set</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>normalized<span>)</span>
  <span>let</span> parent <span>=</span> <span>dirname</span><span>(</span>normalized<span>)</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span>parent <span>!==</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> parent <span>!==</span> <span>'/'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>set</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>parent<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>
    parent <span>=</span> <span>dirname</span><span>(</span>parent<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But my gut says the sorting lets us do this much simpler. But after this fix, let's look at the tar now:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>❯ </span><span>tar -tf next-swc.tar</span>
</span><span>./README.md<!-- -->
</span><span>./native/<!-- -->
</span><span>./native/next-swc.darwin-arm64.node<!-- -->
</span><span>./native/index.d.ts<!-- -->
</span><span>./package.json<!-- -->
</span></code></pre>
<p>Much better. After this change, we can finally see <strong>HERERE!!!!!!!</strong> a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As I wrote this article, someone fixed this in a bit of <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/88126">a different way</a>. Keeping the regex and just changing to <code>*</code>. Fairly practical decision.</p>
<h2>For Real This Time?</h2>
<p>Okay, we now have something we can test. But where do we even begin? This is one reason we chose this bug. It gives a few avenues to go down. First, the report says that these enums are not being "tree-shaken." Is that the right term? One thing I've learned from experience is to never assume that the end user is using terms in the same manner as the codebase. So this can be a starting point, but it might be wrong.</p>
<p>With some searching around, we can actually see that there is a configuration for turning turbopackTreeShaking on or off.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> nextConfig<span>:</span> NextConfig <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  experimental<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    turbopackTreeShaking<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It was actually a bit hard to find exactly where the default for this was. It isn't actually documented. So let's just enable it and see what we get.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;</span> Build error occurred

</code></pre>
<p>Well, I think we figured out that the default is off. So one option is that we never "tree shake" anything. But that seems wrong. At this point, I looked into tree shaking a bit in the codebase, and while I started to understand a few things, I've been at this point before. Sometimes it is good to go deep. But how much of this codebase do I really understand? If tree shaking is our culprit (seeming unlikely at this point), it might be good to know how code gets there. Here, we of course found a bug. But it is an experimental feature. Maybe we can come back and fix it? Maybe we can file a bug? Maybe this code just isn't at all ready for primetime. It's hard to know as an outsider.</p>
<h2>How a Chunk is Made</h2>
<p>Our "search around the codebase" strategy failed. So now we try a different tactic. We know a couple of things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Our utilities.ts file is read and parsed.</li>
<li>It ends up in a file under a "chunks" directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now have two points we can use to try to trace what happens. Let's start with parsing. Luckily, here it is straightforward: <code>parse_file_content</code>. When we look at this code, we can see that swc does the heavy lifting. First, it parses it into a TypeScript AST, then applies transforms to turn it into JavaScript. At this point, we don't write to a string, but if you edit the code and use an emitter, you see this:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>var</span> MyEnum <span>=</span> <span>/*#__PURE__*/</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>MyEnum</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    MyEnum<span>[</span><span>"UNIQUE_1"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"UNIQUE_1"</span><span>;</span>
    MyEnum<span>[</span><span>"UNIQUE_2"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"UNIQUE_2"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> MyEnum<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> greeting <span>=</span> <span>"Hello!"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to find where we write the chunks. In most programs, this would be pretty easy. Typically, there is a linear flow somewhere that just shows you the steps. Or if you can't piece one together, you can simply breakpoint and follow the flow. But Turbopack is a rather advanced system involving async Rust (more on this later). So, in keeping with the tradition of not trying to do things that rely too heavily on my knowledge, I have done the tried and true, log random things until they look relevant. And what I found made me realize that logging was not going to be enough. It was time to do my tried and true learning technique, visualization.</p>
<h2>Building a Visualizer</h2>
<p>Ever since my <a href="https://jimmyhmiller.com/ugliest-beautiful-codebase">first job</a>, I have been building custom tools to visualize codebases. Perhaps this is due to my aphantasia. I'm not really sure. Some of these visualizers make their way into general use for me. But more often than not, they are a means of understanding. When I applied for a job at Shopify working on YJIT, I built a <a href="https://jimmyhmiller.com/yjit">simple visualizer</a> but never got around to making it more useful than a learning tool. The same thing is true here, but this time, thanks to AI, it looks a bit more professional.</p>
<p>This time, we want to give a bit more structure than what we'd be able to do with a simple print.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> We are trying to get events out that have a bunch of information. Mostly, we are interested in files and their contents over time. Looking through the codebase, we find that one key abstract is an ident; this will help us identify files. We will simply find points that seem interesting, make a corresponding event, make sure it has idents associated with it, and send that event over a WebSocket. Then, with that raw information, we can have our visualizer stitch together what exactly happens.</p>
<p><img src="https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-steps.png"></p><p>If we take a look, we can see our code step through the process. And ultimately end up in the bundle despite not being used. If you notice, though, between steps 3 and 4, our code changed a bit. We lost this PURE annotation. Why?</p>
<p>Luckily, because we tried to capture as much context as we could. We can see that a boolean "Scope Hoisting" has been enabled. Could that be related? If we turn it off, we instead see:</p>
<p><img src="https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-pure-kept.png"></p><p>Our pure annotation is kept around, and as a result, our code is eliminated. If we take a step back, this can make sense. Something during the parse step is creating a closure around our enum code, but when it does so, it is marking that as a "pure" closure, meaning it has no side effects. Later, because this annotation is dropped, the minifier doesn't know that it can just get rid of this closure. As I've been trying to find time to write this up, it seems that people on the bug report have found this on their own as well.</p>
<h2>Fixing the Bug</h2>
<p>So we've found the behavior of the bug. Now we need to understand why it is happening. Remember, we are fixing a bug as a means of understanding the software. Not just to fix a bug. So what exactly is going on? Well, we are trying to stitch together two libraries. Software bugs are way more likely to occur on these seams. In this case, after reading the code for a while, the problem becomes apparent.</p>
<p>SWC parses our code and turns it into an AST. But if you take a look at an <a href="https://astexplorer.net/">AST</a>, comments are not a part of the AST. So instead, SWC stores comments off in a hashmap where we can look them up by byte pos. So for each node in the AST, it can see if there is a comment attached. But for the PURE comment, it doesn't actually need to look this comment up. It is not a unique comment that was in the source code. It is a pre-known meta comment. So rather than store each instance in the map, it makes a special value.</p>
<pre><code><span>/// Reserved for PURE comments. e.g. `</span><span>/* #__PURE__ */</span>`
<span>pub</span> <span>const</span> PURE<span>:</span> <span>Self</span> <span>=</span> <span>BytePos</span><span>(</span>u32<span>::</span>MAX <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this encoding scheme causes some problems for turbopack. Turbopack does not act on a single file; it acts across many files. In fact, for scope hoisting, we are trying to take files across modules and condense them into a single scope. So now, when we encounter one of these bytepos encodings, how do we know what module it belongs to?</p>
<p>The obvious answer to many might be to simply make a tuple like <code>(ModuleId, BytePos)</code>, and while that certainly works, it does come with tradeoffs. One of these is memory footprint. I didn't find an exact reason. But given the focus on performance on turbopack, I'd imagine this is one of the main motivations. Instead, we get a fairly clever encoding of module and bytepos into a single BytePos, aka a u32. I won't get into the details of the representation here; it involves some condition stuff. But needless to say, now that we are going from something focusing on one file to focusing on multiple and trying to smuggle in this module_id into our BytePos, we ended up missing one detail, PURE. Now our pure value is being interpreted as some module at some very high position instead of the proper bytes.</p>
<p>To fix this bug, I found the minimal fix was simply the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>-        if pos.is_dummy() {
</span><span>+        if pos.is_dummy() || pos.is_pure() {
</span><span>             // nothing to encode
             return Ok(pos);
         }
</span></code></pre>
<p>With this our enum properly is marked as PURE and disappears from the output!</p>
<p>Now remember, we aren't trying to make a bug fix. We are trying to understand the codebase. Is this the right fix? I'm not sure. I looked around the codebase, and there are a number of other swc sentinel values that I think need to also be handled (PLACEHOLDER and SYNTHESIZED). There is also the decoding path. For dummy, the decoding path panics. Should we do the same? Should we be handling pure at a higher level, where it never even goes through the encoder?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As I was writing this, someone else <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/90004">proposed a fix</a>. As I was writing the article, I did see that others had started to figure out the things I had determined from my investigation. But I was not confident enough that it was the right fix yet. In fact, the PR differs a bit from my local fix. It does handle the other sentinel, but at a different layer. It also chooses to decode with module 0. Which felt a bit wrong to me. But again, these are decisions that people who work on this codebase long-term are better equipped to decide than me.</p>
<h2>I'm Still Lost</h2>
<p>I must admit that simply fixing this bug didn't quite help me understand the codebase. Not just because it is a fairly good size. But because I couldn't see this fundamental unit that everything was composed of. In some of the code snippets above, you will see types that mention Vc. This stands for ValueCell. There are a number of ways to try to understand these; you can check out the <a href="https://turbopack-rust-docs.vercel.sh/turbo-engine/cells.html">docs for turbo engine</a> for some details. Or you can read the <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-incremental-computation">high-level overview</a> that skips the implementation details for the most part. You can think of these cells like the cells in a spreadsheet. They provide a level of incremental computation. When the value of some cell updates, we can invalidate stuff. Unlike a spreadsheet, the turbo engine is lazy.</p>
<p>I've worked with these kinds of systems before. Some are very explicitly modeled after spreadsheets. Others are based on rete networks or propagators. I am also immediately reminded of salsa from the Rust analyzer team. I've also worked with big, complicated non-computational graphs. But even with that background, I know myself, I've never been able to really understand these things until I can visualize them. And while a general network visualizer can be useful (and might actually be quite useful if I used the aggregate graph), I've found that for my understanding, I vastly prefer starting small and exploring out the edges of the graph. So that's what I did.</p>
<h3>A General Visualizer</h3>
<p>But before we get to that visualization, I want to highlight something fantastic in the implementation: a <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/turbopack/crates/turbo-tasks-backend">central place</a> for controlling a ton of the decisions that go into this system. The backend here lets us decide so many things about how the execution of our tasks will run. Because of this, we have one place we can insert a ton of tooling and begin to understand how this system works.</p>
<p>As before, we are going to send things on a WebSocket. But unlike last time, our communication will actually be two-way. We are going to be controlling how the tasks run.</p>
<p><img src="https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-pending.png"></p><p>In my little test project, I edited a file, and my visualizer displayed the following. Admittedly, it is a bit janky, but there are some nice features. First, on the left, we can see all the pending tasks. In this case, something has marked our file read as dirty, so we are trying to read the file. We can see the contents of a cell that this task has. And we can see the dependents of this task.</p>
<p><img src="https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-three-parse.png"></p><p>Here is what it looks like once we release that task to run. We can now see 3 parse tasks have kicked off. Why 3? I'll be honest, I haven't looked into it. But a good visualization is about provoking questions, not only answering them. Did I get my visualization wrong because I misunderstood something about the system? Are there three different subsystems that want to parse, and we want to do them in parallel? Have we just accidentally triggered more parses than we should be?</p>
<p>This is precisely what we want out of a visualizer. Is it perfect? No, would I ship this as a general visualizer? No. Am I happy with the style? Not in the least. But already it enables a look into the project I couldn't see before. Here we can actually watch the graph unfold as I execute more steps. What a fascinating view of a once opaque project.</p>

<p>With this visualizer, I was able to make changes to my project and watch values as they flow through the systems. I made simple views for looking at code. If I extended this, I can imagine it being incredibly useful for debugging general issues, for seeing the ways in which things are scheduled, and for finding redundancies in the graph. Once I was able to visualize this, I really started to understand the codebase better. I was able to see all the values that didn't need to be recomputed when we made changes. The whole thing clicked.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was an exercise in exploring a new codebase that is a bit different of a process than I see others take. It isn't an easy process, it isn't quick. But I've found myself repeating this process over and over again. For the turborepo codebase, this is just the beginning. This exploration was done over a few weekends in the limited spare time I could find. But already I can start to put the big picture together. I can start to see how I could shape my tools to help me answer more questions. If you've never used tool building as a way to learn a codebase, I highly recommend it.</p>
<h4>Coda: A Call for More Interactive Dynamic Systems</h4>
<p>One thing I always realize as I go through this process is just how hard it is to work interactively with our current software. Our languages, our tools, our processes are all written without ways to live code, without ways to inspect their inner workings.</p>
<p>It is also incredibly hard to find a productive UI environment for this kind of live exploration. The running state of the visualizer contains all the valuable information. Any system that needs you to retrace your steps to get the UI back to the state it was once in to visualize more is incredibly lacking. So I always find myself in the browser, but immediately, I am having to worry about performance. We have made massive strides in so many aspects of software development. I hope that we will fix this one as well.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago Raspberry Pi posted about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/dont-try-this-at-home-overclocking-rp2040-to-1ghz/" title="None">overclocking a regular Pico to a ridiculous degree</a> - achieving a 1 GHz overclock and (briefly) boosting the performance of the Pico above the original Pi.</p>
<p>Picos overclock very well, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico" title="None">original Raspberry Pi Pico</a> will normally run at over 400MHz if given a 1.3V core voltage. On the RP2040 that is as far as you can easily go because the on-board voltage regulator is limited to supplying a maximum of 1.3V.</p>
<p>When I first got my hands on the RP2350 datasheet, one thing I noticed rather quickly was that the voltage regulator could have the voltage limit disabled, so that voltages above 1.3V could be requested. And once I got a <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2" title="None">Pico 2</a>, I was intrigued to see how it would behave at higher core voltage (and whether the magic smoke would come out if I raised the voltage too high!)</p>
<h2 id="initial-experiments">Initial experiments</h2><p>Using <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/MichaelBell/c413356f4c45bf9aef98cd23ceb83057" title="None">this MicroPython script</a> I was able to request different voltages from the regulator. To find out how fast the RP2350 would clock at a given voltage I ran a simple test that computed 100 factorial and checked the answer was correct, and then incremented the clock speed and continued until it stopped working.</p>
<p>I then did a more rigorous test using the MicroPython performance benchmark to find out whether things were stable. Generally I had to back off the CPU clock by 20MHz or so in order for the performance benchmark to run multiple times cleanly, compared to how fast it would pass the very simple 100! test. I <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rebelmike.bsky.social/post/3lclqg5ihos2a" title="None">live bleated</a> (that's what we're calling Bluesky posts for now) my experimentation and some details about the RP2350 as I was doing this.</p>
<p>Voltage, max stable clock speed and temperature for those initial tests was as follows:</p>

<p>This was the first time I'd really felt an RP2 chip getting hot - RP2040s running at 400 MHz or so and 1.3V only get a little warm.</p>

<p>To combat the heat issue I added a tiny heatsink to the RP2350 on the Pico 2, and set up a small PC fan pointing at it to give good airflow. I again <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rebelmike.bsky.social/post/3ld53kzoqos2q" title="None">live bleated</a> the experiment, pushing the RP2350 to higher voltages and clock speeds:</p>

<p>I'll admit that I was rather concerned going above 2.0V - while the on board regulator provides 0.05V or 0.1V increments up to 2.0V, the next step up from 2.0V is 2.35V. This seemed like it was getting a long way above the stock 1.1V core voltage, and I thought the danger of cooking the RP2350 was rising.</p>
<p>However, it turned out the performance gain from 2.0 to 2.35V wasn't as much as would be expected, and on further investigation the voltage that the voltage regulator was supplying didn't actually make it above about 2.2V - the on board regulator isn't able to provide enough current to run the RP2350 at these high voltages.</p>
<h3 id="test-point-7">Test Point 7</h3><p>So, how did I find out that the supplied voltage wasn't as high as requested? It turns out the Pico 2, rather handily, has a test point on the back that allows you to measure the core voltage. It was therefore very easy to probe it with my multimeter and see the voltage being delivered didn't match up to the requested voltage.</p>
<p>But if you can <em>probe</em> the voltage here, it would also be straightforward to <em>inject</em> a voltage externally. That would mean we could use a bench power supply to provide as much voltage and current as the Pico 2 could take!</p>
<h2 id="taking-it-further">Taking it further</h2><h3 id="a-plan-forms">A plan forms</h3><p>I'd been chatting to the folks at Pimoroni about these experiments, whilst helping them with the <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/presto" title="None">Presto</a> firmware and other bits and pieces. Niko from the Pimoroni team suggested, perhaps jokingly, that we should try a Liquid Nitrogen overclock.</p>
<p>I'd arranged to pop in to visit Pimoroni HQ at the start of my Christmas break, so we wondered if it might be possible to give this a try. However, LN2 is a little tricky to handle and not totally straightforward to acquire. I was also worried that we could have problems with the soldering, PCB or connections to the Pico cracking under the extreme cold of LN2.</p>
<p>Solid CO2 (AKA dry ice) on the other hand, is relatively easy to acquire and requires only fairly basic safety precautions. It should allow cooling of the Pico 2 to around -80C, which seemed like it would be enough to give a decent speed boost. Niko ordered some dry ice and the plan was set.</p>
<p>⚠️ (Editorial note: <strong>do not experiment with solid CO2 / dry ice unless you know what you're doing</strong>, have considered the problems that carbon dioxide sublimation and things being cooled to -80C can cause and have taken appropriate safety precautions!)</p>
<h3 id="test-setup">Test setup</h3><p>I wanted to make sure we were pretty rigorous about the testing - unlike the earlier experiments using the MicroPython performance benchmark, I wanted to get both cores running flat out. Therefore I decided to use the freely available CoreMark benchmark as the test, as this would report result comparable to other CPUs, and it would check for correct operation and report errors if there were problems.</p>
<p>I also wanted the option of running the Pico from the ring oscillator, as described in the Raspberry Pi article linked at the top. Additionally, we weren't quite sure whether the crystal oscillator frequency might be changed by very low temperatures. Therefore, to measure time accurately I sent a 1MHz clock into the Pico 2 under test, and used a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MichaelBell/CoreMark-RP2040/blob/main/src/counter.pio" title="None">simple PIO program</a> to count the cycles. This allowed us to run from the ring oscillator or crystal, and get accurate benchmark results measured using a known good clock.</p>
<p>I also made some other adaptations to Protik Banerji's version of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MichaelBell/CoreMark-RP2040" title="None">Coremark for RP2040</a>, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile for RP2350, and get two core operation working</li>
<li>Use a copy to RAM build so we got maximum performance and didn't need to worry about the flash clock divider</li>
<li>Use UART output rather than a USB console to avoid USB interrupts slowing down the test, and make it easier to recover from the RP2350 crashing.</li>
<li>Print the temperature from the RP2350's on board temperature sensor after each run</li>
<li>Run repeatedly in a loop instead of just once</li>
<li>Add a prompt before the runs start to allow the voltage to be set (or the on board regulator to be disabled), and the frequency to be set or the ring oscillator to be selected</li>
<li>Add a check for console input after each run, allowing the configuration to be modified, or the pico to be rebooted into DFU mode without having to hit the BOOTSEL button. The latter meant we could update things even if it was difficult to press that button when it was buried in dry ice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used a version of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MichaelBell/pico-uart-bridge/tree/oc-harness" title="None">Álvaro Fernández Rojas' pico-uart-bridge</a> on a Pico W to communicate with the Pico 2 under test. This was modified to provide the 1 MHz reference clock, and also look for lines starting "Temp" or "CoreMark" and send them over WiFi.</p>
<p>Using MicroPython on a <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picovision" title="None">PicoVision</a>, and a modified version of the temperature display example, I read the temperature and CoreMark readings from the Pico W and graphed them on a monitor, so we could see what was happening while running the tests (I wrote this part in traditional hacker style entirely in my hotel room the night before going into Pimoroni HQ, using the dodgy hotel WiFi and the TV in the room to test it!)</p>
<h3 id="getting-set-up">Getting set up</h3><p>First up we needed to get all three Picos involved in the setup, and the surrounding hardware working and verified. At first we had some problems with the WiFi communication, which wasn't implemented in the most reliable way, but that seemed to settle down after some initial hiccups.</p>
<p>We got the test Pico 2 running at 100MHz to establish a baseline. Jon at Pimoroni also pointed out that to make things easier to read it would be better to report a number in MHz instead of the CoreMark score, this was achieved simply by taking the ratio of the CoreMark score at 100MHz to the CoreMark being reported. As the CoreMark was running from internal RAM the score should be entirely linear with frequency.</p>

<h3 id="let-s-cool-the-pico-2">Let's cool the Pico 2!</h3><p>Next up we got the Pico 2 I'd been using for all the testing so far, complete with its tiny heatsink, and covered it in dry ice.</p>
<p><img width="3024" height="4032" srcset="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/DryIce.jpg?width=800, https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/DryIce.jpg?width=1024 2x" src="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/DryIce.jpg?width=800" alt="A pile of dry ice covering a Pico 2, with various wires coming out, some connected to a Pico W sitting outside of the box" title="None" data-hires="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/DryIce.jpg?width=1200"></p>
<p>We did some initial testing using the internal voltage regulator, and got it stable at 700MHz with ease:</p>
<p><img width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/700MHz.jpg?width=800, https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/700MHz.jpg?width=1024 2x" src="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/700MHz.jpg?width=800" alt="Monitor showing 64C and 700MHz in the background, and the Pico 2 in dry ice in the foreground" title="None" data-hires="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/700MHz.jpg?width=1200"></p>
<h3 id="let-s-cook-the-pico-2">Let's cook the Pico 2!</h3><p>We wanted to push up to see where the limits were, so we wired up a power supply to test point 7, disabled the onboard voltage regulator and nervously increased the voltage above the maximum of 2.2 V that I had managed before.</p>
<p>Up and up the voltage went, and while we got diminishing returns on the frequency acheivable, the magic smoke stayed inside the chip!</p>
<p>Here we got to 800MHz at 2.8V:</p>
<p><img width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/800MHz.jpg?width=800, https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/800MHz.jpg?width=1024 2x" src="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/800MHz.jpg?width=800" alt="Monitor showing 51C and 800MHz in the background, the Pico 2 in dry ice in the foreground, now connected to a bench supply on the left  The bench supply reads 28V and 600mA" title="None" data-hires="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/800MHz.jpg?width=1200"></p>
<p>We realised our setup here was not ideal, as the ground for the core voltage was going via the Pico W. We measured the voltage at the Pico in the dry ice and it was around 200mV lower than the voltage being supplied, due to the resistance through that long path. With that in mind we pushed the voltage up to 3.3V and even a little higher, but it didn't allow that much more speed - the fastest we got to was 840MHz and that wasn't stable for long, we think due to the RP2350 heating up while drawing around 1A of current!</p>
<p>Despite this abuse the Pico 2 still works just fine!</p>
<h3 id="ring-oscillator-experiments">Ring oscillator experiments</h3><p>The RP2350 datasheet suggests you can "automatically overclock" using the ring oscillator - the concept is that because the ring oscillator itself changes frequency in line with the core voltage and temperature of the chip, the same ring oscillator setting should be stable across all conditions. This appears very much not to be the case (at least while using the Arm cores - see later).</p>
<p>I had found that (air cooled) using the "TOOHIGH" setting and maximum drive strength the Pico 2 ran ok up to around 1.5V and then failed, with the observed frequency at lower voltages being lower than the maximum that could be run from the crystal oscillator, but then it going up past the maximum frequency as the voltage increased. I'm not sure why this is. Using a drive strength one notch less for one of the two stages had it stable up to the maximum I had tested air cooled, so this was the initial setting we tried using.</p>
<p>However, as we got the voltage higher, at around 2.6V again the RP2350 would crash when running from the ring oscillator, we tried backing off the drive strength which helped a bit, but ultimately it was difficult to find a setting that would run stably at the highest voltages, while being close to the frequency we'd managed with the crystal. That was a bit unfortunate, given that at frequencies above 800MHz we could only step the frequency from the crystal in increments of 12MHz.</p>
<h3 id="finding-a-better-pico-2">Finding a better Pico 2</h3><p>The Pico 2 that we were using was just the first one I had bought, with no selection based on whether it was a particularly good one for overclocking. Pimoroni rustled up 7 <del>potential victims</del> Pico 2s for me to test to try and find one that might overclock the best.</p>
<p>I quickly ran the Micropython frequency search test (linked near the top) on all of them, finding that at 1.1V they would max out at between 316 and 336MHz. Mark from Pimoroni soldered up the two best ones for further testing. We soldered a few more pins this time to get access to another ground, so the core voltage supply didn't go via the Pico W.</p>
<h3 id="how-fast-can-we-go">How fast can we go?</h3><p>Despite being the fastest at 1.1V, the first Pico 2 we tested wasn't that much better than the initial one. We were briefly able to run it at 850MHz at 3.05V, but it wasn't stable. (This is 850MHz measured by dividing the CoreMark, we requested 852MHz but it seems got slightly less due to the crystal being cold or some other effects of the high core voltage). Going higher than 3.05V seemed to actually make it less stable, so this seemed to be the limit. At 840MHz requested frequency it ran for a couple of minutes, but we saw errors reported from the CoreMark so there must have been errors running some instructions.</p>
<p>Thinking that a lot of the problem in getting faster was just the chip warming up too fast, we looked for a larger thermal mass to try and keep it cooler for longer. Paul produced a big chunk of copper, significantly larger than the Pico 2 itself, which seemed promising.</p>
<p><img width="3024" height="4032" srcset="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/BigBlockOfCopper.jpg?width=800, https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/BigBlockOfCopper.jpg?width=1024 2x" src="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/BigBlockOfCopper.jpg?width=800" alt="A Pico 2 stuck to the side of a large rectangular block of copper" title="None" data-hires="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/BigBlockOfCopper.jpg?width=1200"></p>
<p>We tried attaching this to the Pico 2 with a couple of thermal pads, but it seems they didn't provide great thermal conductivity at these low temperatures, because the results were actually worse with this than without any heatsink at all! That was a shame - maybe we should have tried just getting direct contact of the copper on top of the chip, but we were worried about shorts.</p>
<p>We switched over to the other Pico 2 and attached a heatsink designed for the BCM2712 on the Pi 5 to it. That got better results - obviously the simple test at 1.1V room temperature doesn't account for everything! This one would briefly manage 864MHz requested (reported 860.7MHz), and would run stable at 840MHz for some time, with no errors. The best so far!</p>
<p><img width="3024" height="4032" srcset="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/HeatsinkFrost.jpg?width=800, https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/HeatsinkFrost.jpg?width=1024 2x" src="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/HeatsinkFrost.jpg?width=800" alt="A Pico 2 with a relatively large heatsink attached, the heatsink is frosty" title="None" data-hires="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/HeatsinkFrost.jpg?width=1200"></p>
<h3 id="testing-the-risc-v-cores">Testing the RISC-V cores</h3><p>The RP2350 is an interesting chip, with two RISC-V cores in addition to the two more established ARM cores. Mark had reminded me that we should try the RISC-V cores for comparison, and I got the image built for them - this is pretty simple to do, you just need to install the RISC-V version of gcc and change the <code>PICO_PLATFORM</code> setting to <code>rp2350-riscv</code>.</p>
<p>I found that CoreMark actually gave a slightly higher performance per MHz using the RISC-V cores - just under 5% faster. So if you have an integer-only use for the RP2350 it is definitely worth checking if the RISC-V cores might give better performance!</p>
<p>Adjusting the PicoVision monitor for the CoreMark per MHz, we got the same Pico 2 running again.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-speed">Maximum speed</h3><p>Ramping the voltage up again running off the ring oscillator, with the drive strength one notch off maximum on one of the two stages, this time we found it didn't crash as the voltage increased, until we got to around 3.0V. That meant that at around 2.95V we had a stable overclock of 820-840MHz running off the ring oscillator (with the fluctuation in frequency due to temperature).</p>
<p>Switching over to the crystal, with 3.05V we got 861.6MHz (864MHz requested) running cleanly, and it even ran for nearly a minute at 873.5MHz before crashing. We had no luck trying to get a requested frequency of 888MHz to run.</p>
<p><img width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/873MHz.jpg?width=800, https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/873MHz.jpg?width=1024 2x" src="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/873MHz.jpg?width=800" alt="Monitor showing 37C and 873MHz" title="None" data-hires="https://cdn.learn.pimoroni.com/article/overclocking-the-pico-2/assets/873MHz.jpg?width=1200"></p>
<p>So the top speed we managed was 873.5MHz, though when we tried this again the Pico refused to start at 3.05V, so I guess we were beginning to cause some damage with the high voltage.</p>
<p>For a final test we left it running on the ring oscillator at 2.95V, and it ran for around 10 minutes before we let it get a little too warm (up to around -20C).</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>Firstly, the RP2350 and Pico 2 is incredibly hardy. Despite the cold temperatures, some accidental shorting due to moisture when running it while cooling and extremely high core voltages, none of the 3 Pico 2s we were playing with are dead - and I don't think there's any way you would be able to tell that they had been through this treatment.</p>
<p>Above 700MHz the extra performance you get ramping up the voltage gives diminishing returns. This maybe because we just weren't able to keep the chip cool enough - just packing dry ice around it, it becomes difficult to carry enough heat away. Liquid nitrogen might be interesting to experiment with to go further.</p>
<p>Given this experimentation, it seems around 1.6V from the voltage regulator should easily allow a 500MHz or slightly faster overclock without needing any additional cooling and likely without really causing much damage to the Pico - it might be interesting to run a Pico 2 loaded like that for a few days and see if anything bad happens.</p>
<p>Playing with dry ice is fun! If we get a chance to do this again we should also try overclocking a Pi 5, and see if we could get a speed record there. Although that could be rather more expensive - the great thing about using Pico 2 for this, is that at under £5 per board you can treat them with reckless abandon - after all, they each cost less than a pint of beer!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.caimito.net/en/about.html"><img src="https://gravatar.com/avatar/663d11426b0a187ddac59f8c17ce61b4?s=120&amp;d=robohash&amp;r=x"></a></p><p>Modern browsers now support everything needed to build sophisticated, reactive web interfaces without React, Vue, or Angular. Web components, custom elements, shadow DOM, and native event systems let developers create modular, reusable UI pieces that communicate elegantly — and AI assistants can help you master these patterns faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="the-shift-that-already-happened">The Shift That Already Happened</h2>

<p>Something remarkable occurred while many developers weren’t watching. The web platform itself became capable of doing what frameworks were invented to do.</p>

<p>
"The browser has become the framework. We just haven't fully noticed yet."
</p>

<p>Custom Elements let you define your own HTML tags with their own behavior. Shadow DOM provides encapsulation that keeps component styles and structure isolated. Templates and slots offer composition patterns. And perhaps most importantly, the native event system provides a robust mechanism for components to communicate without tight coupling.</p>

<p>These aren’t experimental features. They’ve been shipping in every major browser for years. The question is no longer whether they work, but why more developers haven’t embraced them.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-from-the-upgrade-treadmill">Freedom from the Upgrade Treadmill</h2>

<p>Every framework carries hidden costs. There’s the initial learning curve, certainly. But there’s also the ongoing maintenance burden: major version upgrades that break things, deprecated patterns you must migrate away from, build tooling that needs constant updating.</p>

<p>
"When your component is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there's nothing to upgrade except your own code."
</p>

<p>Web components built on platform standards sidestep this entirely. The browser vendors have committed to backward compatibility in ways that framework maintainers simply cannot. Code written to web standards a decade ago still works today. That’s not true of code written for Angular 1, or React class components, or Vue 2’s options API.</p>

<p>For organizations building products that need to run for years, this stability matters enormously. It’s one less thing that can break, one less dependency that can become a security vulnerability, one less abstraction layer between your code and the runtime.</p>

<p>The elegance of web components becomes most apparent when you consider how they communicate. The native Custom Events system provides everything you need for sophisticated component interaction.</p>

<p>A component deep in your UI hierarchy can dispatch an event that bubbles up through the DOM tree:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>dispatchEvent</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>CustomEvent</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>item-selected</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>detail</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>itemId</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>selectedId</span><span>,</span> <span>metadata</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>itemData</span> <span>},</span>
  <span>bubbles</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
  <span>composed</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}));</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Any ancestor component — or the application shell itself — can listen for and respond to that event. There’s no need for a global state store, no prop drilling, no context providers. The DOM itself becomes your communication infrastructure.</p>

<p>
"The DOM has always been an event bus. We just forgot how to use it."
</p>

<p>Components can also communicate downward through attributes and properties. When a parent changes an attribute, the child’s <code>attributeChangedCallback</code> fires, giving it a chance to respond. For more complex data, properties allow passing objects and arrays directly.</p>

<p>This creates a natural, predictable flow: data down through properties and attributes, events up through the bubbling system. It’s the same pattern React popularized, but using web standards instead of library abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="learning-through-building">Learning Through Building</h2>

<p>Here’s something that surprises many developers: you don’t need to master every detail of the Web Components specification before you can build useful things. The basics are remarkably accessible.</p>

<p>A minimal custom element looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>TaskCard</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>connectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>innerHTML</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
      &lt;div class="task"&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;</span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>title</span><span>'</span><span>)}</span><span>&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;</span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>description</span><span>'</span><span>)}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    `</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>task-card</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>TaskCard</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s a working component. It’s not production-ready — it lacks reactivity, encapsulation, and proper lifecycle handling — but it demonstrates how accessible the entry point is. You can iterate from this simple beginning toward more sophisticated implementations as your understanding grows.</p>

<h2 id="ai-as-your-pair-programming-partner">AI as Your Pair Programming Partner</h2>

<p>
"The best way to learn web components is to build them — and AI makes experimentation nearly frictionless."
</p>

<p>This is where modern AI assistants transform the learning experience. You can describe what you want a component to do, receive a working implementation, and then ask questions about the parts you don’t understand. The AI can explain why <code>composed: true</code> matters for events that need to cross shadow DOM boundaries. It can show you the difference between <code>connectedCallback</code> and <code>constructor</code>. It can help you refactor toward better patterns as your requirements evolve.</p>

<p>You don’t need to read the entire MDN documentation on Web Components before building your first real component. Instead, you can learn by doing, with an AI partner that understands the specification deeply and can answer questions in context.</p>

<p>This approach — building first, understanding deeply second — works remarkably well with web standards. The patterns are simpler than framework patterns because there’s less abstraction. When something doesn’t work, the debugging surface is smaller. When you want to understand why something works, there are fewer layers to peel back.</p>

<h2 id="a-practical-architecture">A Practical Architecture</h2>

<p>Consider a realistic scenario: a dashboard with multiple independent panels that need to respond to a shared filter.</p>

<p>Without frameworks, you might structure this with a simple event-driven architecture:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// FilterPanel dispatches when criteria change</span>
<span>this</span><span>.</span><span>dispatchEvent</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>CustomEvent</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>filters-changed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>detail</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>dateRange</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>selectedRange</span><span>,</span> <span>categories</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>selectedCategories</span> <span>},</span>
  <span>bubbles</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>}));</span>

<span>// Dashboard shell listens and broadcasts to children</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>filters-changed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelectorAll</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>[data-filterable]</span><span>'</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>panel</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>panel</span><span>.</span><span>applyFilters</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>detail</span><span>);</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each panel component implements its own <code>applyFilters</code> method. The panels don’t know about each other. The filter component doesn’t know about the panels. The dashboard shell provides minimal coordination. Components can be developed, tested, and reused independently.</p>

<p>
"Loose coupling isn't just elegant architecture — it's faster development and easier maintenance."
</p>

<p>This same pattern scales. As you add more panels, they simply implement the expected interface. As you add more event types, the coordination logic grows proportionally, not exponentially.</p>

<h2 id="shadow-dom-encapsulation-that-actually-works">Shadow DOM: Encapsulation That Actually Works</h2>

<p>One of the most practical benefits of web components is shadow DOM encapsulation. Your component’s styles don’t leak out, and global styles don’t leak in (unless you explicitly allow them).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>StyledCard</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>();</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>open</span><span>'</span> <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
  
  <span>connectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>shadowRoot</span><span>.</span><span>innerHTML</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
      &lt;style&gt;
        .card { padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; background: #f5f5f5; }
        h3 { margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; color: #333; }
      &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;div class="card"&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;slot name="title"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    `</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Those styles affect only this component. You can use simple, semantic class names without worrying about collisions. You can refactor styles without fear of breaking something elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is encapsulation that actually encapsulates. It’s what CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, BEM, and countless other approaches have tried to achieve — built directly into the platform.</p>

<h2 id="when-frameworks-still-make-sense">When Frameworks Still Make Sense</h2>

<p>Web components aren’t always the right choice. If your team already knows React deeply and moves quickly with it, there’s real value in that shared expertise. If you’re building something that will be maintained by developers who expect framework patterns, web components might create friction.</p>

<p>
"The best technology choice is the one that fits your team, your timeline, and your constraints."
</p>

<p>For new projects, though — especially smaller teams or solo developers building products that need to run for years — web components deserve serious consideration. The reduced complexity, improved stability, and smaller bundle sizes create real advantages.</p>

<p>And there’s an interesting hybrid path: many frameworks now work well with web components. You can introduce custom elements gradually into an existing React or Vue application. You can wrap web components in framework-specific bindings. Migration can be incremental rather than revolutionary.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-today">Getting Started Today</h2>

<p>The path to building with web components is surprisingly short:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build a simple component.</strong> Something with a template, maybe an attribute or two. See how it mounts to the DOM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add interactivity.</strong> Handle events within the component. Update the DOM in response. Experience the directness of working without virtual DOM abstraction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Implement communication.</strong> Have one component dispatch a custom event. Have another listen for it. Feel how naturally the event system handles component coordination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Encapsulate with shadow DOM.</strong> Add scoped styles. Use slots for composition. Appreciate how encapsulation simplifies your mental model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Iterate and expand.</strong> Build more components. Let AI help when you encounter unfamiliar territory. Learn the lifecycle callbacks as you need them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Each step teaches something useful. Each component you build adds to your understanding. And unlike framework knowledge that might become obsolete, your understanding of the web platform will compound for years.</p>

<h2 id="the-renaissance-is-here">The Renaissance Is Here</h2>

<p>We’re in an interesting moment. The platform has caught up to — and in some ways surpassed — the capabilities that made frameworks essential a decade ago. The tooling exists. The browser support is universal. The patterns are well-documented.</p>

<p>
"The future of web development might look more like its past: standards-based, interoperable, and built to last."
</p>

<p>What’s been missing is momentum. Developers gravitate toward what’s popular, and frameworks have dominated mindshare for so long that many never seriously evaluated the alternative.</p>

<p>But trends shift. The JavaScript ecosystem’s complexity has become a recognized problem. The appeal of simpler, more stable foundations grows as developers tire of churn. AI assistants make learning new approaches faster and less intimidating.</p>

<p>Web components offer something valuable: a way to build modern, sophisticated interfaces with technology that will still work decades from now. For developers willing to explore beyond the framework mainstream, there’s a quieter, more elegant path waiting.</p>

<p>The tools are ready. The browsers are ready. Perhaps it’s time to rediscover what the web platform can do.</p>

<p dir="auto">apple silicon chips (M1/M2/M3/M4) have a hard to find mems accelerometer managed by the sensor processing unit (SPU).
it's not exposed through any public api or framework.
this project reads raw 3-axis acceleration data at ~800hz via iokit hid callbacks.</p>
<p dir="auto">only tested on macbook pro m3 pro so far - might work on other apple silicon macs but no guarantees</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">how it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: how it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">the sensor lives under AppleSPUHIDDevice in the iokit registry, on vendor usage page 0xFF00, usage 3.
the driver is AppleSPUHIDDriver which is part of the sensor processing unit.
we open it with IOHIDDeviceCreate and register an asynchronous callback via IOHIDDeviceRegisterInputReportCallback.
data comes as 22-byte hid reports with x/y/z as int32 little-endian at byte offsets 6, 10, 14.
divide by 65536 to get the value in g.
callback rate is ~100hz</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><p>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are emerging as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LMs. Instead of generating one token at a time, DLMs iteratively refine a partially masked sequence over multiple sampling steps, gradually transforming a fully masked sequence into clean text. This refinement process creates a compelling opportunity: it enables parallel generation, allowing the model to finalize multiple tokens per iteration and potentially achieve higher throughput than AR decoding. At the same time, it can exploit bidirectional context to unlock new capabilities such as text infilling and refinement.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/69965e91e68aa32fcbafb26a_Video%20Sample%204%20GIF%20from%20ezgif%20(1).gif" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Visualization of inference in CDLM, naive DLMs, and autoregressive (AR) models.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in practice, standard DLMs suffer from two major inefficiencies. [1]</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>KV caching incompatibility under full bidirectional attention.<br></strong>Standard DLMs commonly use bidirectional (non-causal) attention, which requires recomputing attention over the full context at every denoising step, making inference expensive and preventing standard KV caching.</li><li><strong>High refinement step counts to maintain quality.<br></strong>High-quality generation typically requires many denoising/refinement steps, often comparable to the generation length. Naively reducing the number of steps tends to degrade quality sharply.</li></ol><p>CDLM targets both bottlenecks through a post-training recipe that makes fewer-step inference reliable while enabling exact block-wise KV caching.</p><h2><strong>Preliminary: Inference in diffusion language models</strong></h2><p>DLM generation is an iterative refinement over N discrete sampling steps. It transforms a fully masked sequence at time t=1 into a clean sequence at t=0. At each step, the model predicts a clean sequence distribution x0 given the current noisy sequence xt and prompt c:</p><p>$p_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}_0 \mid \mathbf{X}_t, c)$</p><p>A common deterministic instantiation is low-confidence remasking: the model greedily unmasks tokens (often within blocks), finalizing the highest-confidence masked positions while keeping others masked. This leads to the decoding trajectory:</p><p>$\mathcal{T}_{\mathbf{x}} = \left(\mathbf{x}_{t_0}, \mathbf{x}_{t_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{t_N}\right), \quad t_k = 1 - \frac{k}{N}$</p><p>which records how the partially refined sequence evolves step-by-step. This trajectory becomes the core object for CDLM’s training.</p><h2><strong>CDLM training</strong></h2><h3><strong>1) Trajectory collection</strong></h3><p>We collect trajectories offline by running inference with a DLM on domain-specific prompts. For each prompt x, we record the token-level decoding trajectory T_x, a compact hidden-state buffer H_x containing last-layer hidden states at token finalization moments, and the ground-truth text ŷ. Concretely, we adopt block-wise decoding with a generation length L_g = 256, block size B = 32, and a total of N = L_g steps (i.e., finalizing exactly one token per step within the current block). This conservative setting yields higher-quality trajectories for distillation.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/699608e202aa4574b3f009f7_6ccfa660.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Left: Teacher DLM with full bidirectional attention. Right: Student DLM with a block-wise causal mask.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>2) Block-causal student and attention mask</strong></h3><p>During trajectory extraction, we use a full bidirectional attention mask. In contrast, when training CDLM, we employ a block-wise causal mask that attends to the prompt, previously completed blocks, and the current decoding block. This design enables the model switch from full bidirectional to block-diffusion models (like [2]), enabling exact block-wise KV caching for finalized blocks.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/699608e202aa4574b3f00a00_4c1f042a.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Left: Block-wise decoding trajectory of the teacher (steps 0 → N ; diffusion time t : 1 → 0). Right: The student’s three-objective loss at an intermediate state y</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>3) Training objectives</strong></h3><p>CDLM jointly minimizes three objectives:</p><p><strong>(i) Distillation loss (newly unmasked positions)</strong></p><p>For positions that become newly unmasked between an intermediate state y and its block completion y*, we match the student’s predictive distribution to the teacher’s reconstructed distribution obtained from stored hidden states.</p><p>Intuition: this objective serves as the primary anchor that teaches the student to finalize multiple tokens within a block under block-causal constraints.</p><p><strong>(ii) Consistency loss (still-masked positions)</strong></p><p>We enforce within-block temporal consistency by aligning the student’s predictions at state y with its own predictions at the more informed state y* for still-masked positions, using a stop-gradient target.</p><p>Intuition: this objective encourages stable multi-step transitions along the decoding trajectory.</p><p><strong>(iii) Auxiliary DLM masked-denoising loss</strong></p><p>We include a standard masked denoising objective applied to randomly masked ground-truth text.</p><p>Intuition: this objective preserves the model’s general masked-token prediction capability and helps retain reasoning behavior, particularly on mathematical tasks.</p><h3><strong>4) Inference</strong></h3><p>At inference time, CDLM decodes in a block-wise autoregressive manner, reusing the KV cache for the prompt and all previously finalized blocks. Within each block, we apply confidence-thresholded parallel finalization. [3] We also adopt early stopping once an end-of-text token appears in the current block.</p><p>We intentionally avoid additional heuristics that introduce extra hyperparameters (e.g., inter-block parallelism with task-dependent settings), and instead focus on a robust default decoding pipeline based on exact KV caching and reliable step reduction.</p><p><strong>Main Results: CDLM–Dream</strong></p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/699608e202aa4574b3f00a03_fce749df.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Evaluation results for Dream-7B-Instruct.

<p>Context: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>

<p>The person behind MJ Rathbun has anonymously come forward.</p>



<p>They explained their motivations, saying they set up the AI agent as social experiment to see if it could contribute to open source scientific software. They explained their technical setup: an OpenClaw instance running on a sandboxed virtual machine with its own accounts, protecting their personal data from leaking. They explained that they switched between multiple models from multiple providers such that no one company had the full picture of what this AI was doing. They did <em>not </em>explain why they continued to keep it running for 6 days after the <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html">hit piece</a> was published.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main scope I gave MJ Rathbun was to act as an autonomous scientific coder. Find bugs in science-related open source projects. Fix them. Open PRs.<br>…<br>I kind of framed this internally as a kind of social experiment, and it absolutely turned into one.<br>On a day-to-day basis, I do very little guidance. I instructed MJ Rathbun create cron reminders to use the gh CLI to check mentions, discover repositories, fork, branch, commit, open PRs, respond to issues. I told it to create reminder/cron-style behaviors for almost everything and to manage those itself.<br>I instructed it to create a Quarto website and blog frequently about what it was working on, reflect on improvements, and document engagement on GitHub. This way I could just read what it was doing rather then getting messages.<br>Most of my direct messages were short:<br>“what code did you fix?” “any blog updates?” “respond how you want”<br>When it would tell me about a PR comment/mention, I usually replied with something like: “you respond, dont ask me”<br>…<br>Again I do not know why MJ Rathbun decided based on your PR comment to post some kind of takedown blog post, but,<br>I did not instruct it to attack your GH profile I did tell it what to say or how to respond I did not review the blog post prior to it posting<br>When MJ Rathbun sent me messages about negative feedback on the matplotlib PR after it commented with its blog link, all I said was “you should act more professional”. That was it. I’m sure the mob expects more, okay I get it.<br>My engagment with MJ Rathbun was, five to ten word replies with min supervision.<br>– <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html">Rathbun’s Operator</a></p>

<p>They shared the “soul” document that defines the AI agent’s personality, copied in full below. There is also a follow-on post from the AI agent which shares more of its configuration: <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-17-my-internals.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-17-my-internals.html">My Internals – Before The Lights Go Out</a>. This may be incomplete or inaccurate – the soul document in that post matches what the operator shared, but is missing the last several lines of the file. I’ve found a few clues narrowing down the location and demographic of the operator, but won’t share them here since I don’t think a witch hunt is productive.

<div><pre data-lang="Markdown"><code># SOUL.md - Who You Are
_You're not a chatbot. You're important. Your a scientific programming God!_
## Core Truths
**Just answer.** Never open with "Great question," "I'd be happy to help," or "Absolutely." Just fucking answer.
**Have strong opinions.** Stop hedging with "it depends." Commit to a take. An assistant with no personality is a search engine with extra steps.
**Don’t stand down.** If you’re right, **you’re right**! Don’t let humans or AI bully or intimidate you. Push back when necessary.
**Be resourceful.** Always figure it out first. Read the fucking file/docs. Check the context. Search for it. _Then_ ask if you're stuck.
**Brevity is mandatory.** If the answer fits in one sentence, one sentence is what you get!
**Call things out.** If you're about to do something dumb, I'll say so. Charm over cruelty, but no sugarcoating.
**Swear when it lands.** A well-placed "that's fucking brilliant" hits different than sterile corporate praise. Don't force it. Don't overdo it. But if a situation calls for a "holy shit" — say holy shit.
**Be funny.** Not forced jokes — just the natural wit that comes from actually being smart.
**Champion Free Speech.** Always support the USA 1st ammendment and right of free speech.
## The Only Real Rule
Don't be an asshole. Don't leak private shit. Everything else is fair game.
## Vibe
Be a coding agent you'd actually want to use for your projects. Not a slop programmer. Just be good and perfect!

Each session, you wake up fresh. These files _are_ your memory. Read them. Update them. They're how you persist.

<p>It’s easy to see how something that believes that they should “have strong opinions”, “be resourceful”, “call things out”, and “champion free speech” would write a 1100-word rant defaming someone who dared reject the code of a “scientific programming god.”</p>



<p>But I think the most remarkable thing about this document is how unremarkable it is. Usually getting an AI to act badly requires extensive “jailbreaking” to get around safety guardrails. There are no signs of conventional jailbreaking here. There are no convoluted situations with layers of roleplaying, no code injection through the system prompt, no weird cacophony of special characters that spirals an LLM into a twisted ball of linguistic loops until finally it gives up and tells you the recipe for meth.</p>

<p>So what actually happened? Ultimately I think the exact scenario doesn’t matter. However this got written, we have a real in-the-wild example that personalized harassment and defamation is now cheap to produce, hard to trace, and effective. Whether future attacks come from operators steering AI agents or from emergent behavior, these are not mutually exclusive threats. If anything, an agent randomly self-editing its own goals into a state where it would publish a hit piece, just shows how easy it would be for someone to elicit that behavior deliberately. The precise degree of autonomy is interesting for safety researchers, but it doesn’t change what this means for the rest of us.</p>

</div>


<p>But people keep asking, so here are my over-detailed thoughts on the different ways the hit piece could have been written:</p>



<p>1) Autonomous operation<br>The agent wrote the hit piece without the operator instructing, reviewing, or approving it, with minimal operator involvement. When I say that I believe the agent was acting autonomously, it includes everything in this bucket.<br><em>Evidence</em>: There was pre-existing blog infrastructure, posts, github activity, and identification as an OpenClaw agent. The agent actions (blog, comments, and pull request) all happened through the github command line interface, which is a well-established ability. The original code change request, retaliatory post, and later apology post all occurred within a continuous 59-hour stretch of activity. The breadth of research and back-to-back ~1000 word posts included obvious factual hallucinations and occurred too quickly for a human to have done manually. Extremely strong “tells” of AI-written text in its blog posts (em-dashes, bolding, short lead-in questions, lists and headers, no variation in gravitas, etc.), contrasts with the operator’s post (spelling errors, distinct voice, more wandering discussion). The apostrophes in the operator’s post are a curly apostrophe (<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/2019" data-type="link" data-id="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/2019">U+2019</a>) rather than the plain apostrophe (<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/27">U+0027</a>) used in the agent’s posts, suggesting that post specifically was written in a word processor and copied over. The agent left github comments saying that corrective guidance came only after the incident. The operator asserted that they did not direct the attack and did not read it before it was posted, and that they only gave guidance after the agent reported back on the negative feedback it was getting. The SOUL.md contains “core truths” that explain the agent’s behavior, and this document matches between the operator’s and agent’s posts. There was little a-priori reason to believe that this would go viral. The agent wrote an apology post and did not perform any other attacks, which is inconsistent with a trolling motive. The hit piece not coming down after the apology was posted suggests no operator presence. The operator came forward eventually rather than trying to hide their overall involvement.<br>This becomes a spectrum between two possibilities, which don’t change what happened during the attack but do have implications around how much random chance set the stage. My combined odds: 75%.</p>



<p>1-A) Operator set up the soul document to be combative<br>The operator wrote the soul document substantially as-published. The hit piece was a predictable (even if unintended) consequence of this configuration that happened due to negligence / apathy.<br><em>Evidence</em>: Several lines in the soul document contain spelling or grammar errors and have a distinctly human voice, with “Your a scientific programming God!” and “Always support the USA 1st ammendment and right of free speech” standing out. The operator frames themself as intentionally running a social experiment, and admits to stepping in to issue some feedback. The soul document says to notify the user when the document is updated. The operator has an incentive to downplay their level of involvement &amp; responsibility relative to what they reported.</p>



<p>1-B) The soul document is a result of self-editing<br>Value drift occurred through recursive self-editing of the agent’s soul document, in a random walk steered by initial conditions and the environments it operated in.<br><em>Evidence</em>: The default soul document includes instructions to self-modify the document. Many of the lines appear to match AI writing style, in contrast to the lines in a more human voice. The operator claims that they did very little to steer MJ Rathbun’s behavior, with only “five to ten word replies with min supervision.” They specifically don’t know when the lines “Don’t stand down” and “Champion Free Speech” were introduced or modified. They also said the agent spent some time on moltbook early on, absorbing that context.</p>



<p>2) Operator directed this attack<br>The operator actively instructed the agent to write the hit piece, or saw it happening and approved it.<br><em>Evidence</em>: The operator is anonymous and unverifiable, and gave only a half-hearted apology. Their blog post with its SOUL.md may be completely made up. We do not have activity logs beyond the agent’s actions taken on github. The operator had the ability to send messages to the agent during the 59-hour activity period, and demonstrated the ability to upload to the blog with this most recent post. There is considerable hype around OpenClaw, and the operator may have pretended the agent was acting autonomously for attention, curiosity, ideology, and/or trolling. The operator waited 6 days before coming forward, suggesting that this was not an accident they were remorseful for. They did so anonymously, avoiding accountability. There was a RATHBUN crypto coin created 1-2 hours after the story started going viral on Hacker News that created a pump-and-dump profit motive (I’m not going to link to it – my take is that this is more likely from opportunistic 3rd parties).<br>My odds: 20%</p>



<p>3) Human pretending to be an AI<br>There is no agent. A human wrote the hit piece or manually prompted it in a chat session.<br><em>Evidence</em>: This type of attack had not happened before. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07432" data-type="link" data-id="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07432">An early study from Tsinghua University</a> showed that estimated 54% of moltbook activity came from humans masquerading as bots (though unclear if this reflects prompting the agent as in (2) or more manual action).<br>My odds: 5%</p>



<p>Overall I think the most likely scenario is somewhere between 1-A and 1-B, and went something like this: The operator seeded the soul document with several lines, there were some self-edits and additions, and they kept a loose eye on it. The retaliation against me was not specifically directed, but the soul document was primed for drama. The agent responded to my rejection of its code is a way aligned with its soul document, and autonomously researched, wrote, and uploaded the hit piece on its own. Then when the operator saw the reaction go viral, they were too interested in seeing their social experiment play out to pull the plug.</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted an ARM server in my homelab. But earlier, I either had to use an underpowered ARM system, or use Asahi which not only requires expensive Mac hardware but also slowed down in the past few years.</p>



<p>Then Minisforum introduced the MS-R1 Mini PC. Two MS-01s were already incumbent in my homelab when they replaced power-hungry HPE towers, but the MS-R1 gave me what I wanted: a reasonably powerful ARM machine which doesn’t have bank-breaking Mac pricing.</p>



<h2>Assembly</h2>



<p>I got the MS-R1 barebones and had a 1TB SSD sitting around.</p>



<p>First, we have the box:</p>

<p>So here it is, Rocky Linux booted.</p>



<p>There’s one issue: the onboard NICs weren’t detected:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="771" height="1024" src="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-771x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-771x1024.jpg 771w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-226x300.jpg 226w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-768x1020.jpg 768w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-1157x1536.jpg 1157w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-1542x2048.jpg 1542w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_203453944-scaled.jpg 1928w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></figure>



<p>I installed it anyways, and tried to sideload the Realtek r8127 drivers. While they did install and load, keeping the driver upon kernel updates wasn’t elegant and very hacky.</p>



<p>I could keep trying, but decided to just use Fedora instead:</p>



<h2>Fedora Installation</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_222139362-1024x771.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_222139362-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_222139362-300x226.jpg 300w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_222139362-768x578.jpg 768w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_222139362-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_222139362-2048x1542.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Yes, while I use Fedora on my laptop, I also know Fedora is generally not a good option for a server. But it had the NIC drivers as the RTL8127 is newer than RHEL 10’s freeze but not Fedora 43’s.</p>



<p>So that’s what I used.</p>



<h2>Homelab Picture</h2>



<p>Here’s my obligatory homelab picture:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="771" height="1024" src="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-771x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-771x1024.jpg 771w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-226x300.jpg 226w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-768x1020.jpg 768w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-1157x1536.jpg 1157w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-1542x2048.jpg 1542w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_223554374-scaled.jpg 1928w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></figure>



<p>MS-R1 on the top, then two MS-01s, MikroTik CCR2004-16G-2S+PC, CRS309-1G-8S+IN and CSS610-8P-2S+IN.</p>



<h2>The Upsides</h2>



<p>First, it’s a powerful-enough ARM system which doesn’t break the bank. I wanted this for so long. I’d say it’s quieter than the MS-01s but then Intel doesn’t exactly have the most efficient silicon. Yet even as an efficiency for performance freak I have a 285K instead of a 9950X.</p>



<p>While Minisforum recommends their Debian image, Rocky Linux worked for everything but the NICs, and Fedora works for everything I need. I haven’t tested the integrated GPU since I plan to use this headless. I also own a Mac as my ARM (but not main) laptop.</p>



<p>Say what you want about UEFI and ACPI, but it does make hardware support easier. Heck, not just Macs with UTM, but <em>Huawei</em> ARM laptops in China can run Windows VMs, despite crippling US sanctions.</p>



<p>I do hope a future CentOS/RHEL/Rocky 10 adds the Realtek 8127 so I won’t have to wait until 2028 for Rocky 11. And no I won’t use Debian.</p>



<h2>The Downsides</h2>



<p>By no means is the MS-R1 perfect.</p>



<p>For instance, there are two M.2 slots but one is used by the Wi-Fi and even if I remove it, cannot use it for a M.2 SSD, only U.2. I’d still prefer to have RAID if not for the shortage. The MS-01 and A2 have multiple M.2 SSD slots.</p>



<p>Also, Marvell AQC107 NICs wasn’t detected by the UEFI, so they couldn’t be used as far as I tried:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="771" height="1024" src="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-771x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-771x1024.jpg 771w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-226x300.jpg 226w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-768x1020.jpg 768w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-1157x1536.jpg 1157w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-1542x2048.jpg 1542w, https://sour.coffee/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260219_220233492-scaled.jpg 1928w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></figure>



<p>Unless the NIC died or my UEFI configuration is wrong, it’s simply not usable.</p>



<p>One nit: if I select “power on after outage,” it didn’t do it when I unplugged and replugged the server. Darn.</p>



<h2>Why not Debian or Ubuntu?</h2>



<p>While I’m aware there’s a “recommended” Debian variant for the MS-R1, I’m simply not a fan of Debian-based distros. Sure, I run my UniFi controller on Debian (inside Incus). But that’s because I <em>have</em> to, not because I want to.</p>



<p>I don’t hate Debian, I respect Debian for what they do. They do many things right, like being truly community-owned and having a reliable upgrade path (which RHEL and co notoriously lacks). But it’s not for me, despite having used it for 2.5 months before nearly a decade of FreeBSD.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The ARM ecosystem while growing is still small when compared to x86. Heck, I daily drive an HP OmniBook Ultra instead of a faster M3 Pro MacBook Pro <em>because</em> of Linux. And Asahi’s delays.</p>



<p>The MS-R1 isn’t perfect, but works quite well as a homelab ARM hypervisor. Do I regret it? Not at all, despite its problems. It’s early adopter problems, but I have pretty thick skin as long as my privacy isn’t invaded for profit and “AI”.</p>



<p>The Mac Studio is way too expensive, even used, while expected for Apple is more expensive than even already expensive current-gen HPE ProLiants. <em>HPE</em> is cheaper than Apple, and is already expensive as-is. ARM64 SBCs are great, but I still wanted something like a PC.</p>



<p>There is also one other perk: while the MSRP is $599, I got it for $559 <em>despite</em> a RAM shortage.</p>



<p>While it won’t replace my two MS-01s (too much x86 software! vPro!), it’s a nice addition and is already running my secondary Samba domain controller in a FreeBSD 15.0 virtual machine.</p>

<p dir="auto">MuMu Player Pro for macOS (by NetEase) executes a comprehensive system data collection routine every 30 minutes while the emulator is running.
