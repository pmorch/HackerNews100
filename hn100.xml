            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.

<p>Tenstorrent, the firm led by legendary chip architect Jim Keller, the mastermind behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amd" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amd">AMD</a>'s Zen architecture and Tesla's original self-driving chip, has launched its first hardware. Grayskull is a RISC-V alternative&nbsp;to GPUs that is designed to be easier to program and scale, and reportedly excels at handling run-time sparsity and conditional computation.</p><p>Off the back of this, Tenstorrent has also unveiled its Grayskull-powered DevKits - the standard Grayskull e75 and the more powerful Grayskull e150. Both are inference-only hardware designed for AI development, and come with TT-Buda and TT-Metalium software. The former is for running models right away, while the latter is for users who want to customize their models or write new ones.</p><p>The Santa Clara-based tech firm's milestone launch comes hot on the heels of a partnership with Japan's Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC). Tenstorrent's RISC-V and Chiplet IP will be used to build a state-of-the-art 2nm AI Accelerator, with the ultimate goal of revolutionizing AI performance in Japan.</p><h2 id="by-the-power-of-grayskull-3">By the power of Grayskull!</h2><p>The Grayskull e75 model is a low-profile, half-length PCIe Gen 4 board with a single Grayskull processor, operating at 75W. The more advanced e150 model is a standard height, 3/4 length PCIe Gen 4 board containing one Grayskull processor operating at up to 200W, and balancing power and throughput.</p><p>Tenstorrent processors comprise a grid of cores known as Tensix Cores and come with network communication hardware so they can talk with one another directly over networks, instead of through DRAM.</p><p>The Grayskull DevKits support a wide range of models, including BERT for natural language processing tasks, ResNet for image recognition, Whisper for speech recognition and translation, YOLOv5 for real-time object detection, and U-Net for image segmentation.</p><p>The Grayskull e75 and e150 DevKits are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tenstorrent.com/cards/" target="_blank" data-url="https://tenstorrent.com/cards/">available for purchase</a> now at $599 and $799, respectively.</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/virtually-unhackable-chip-could-make-gpu-more-power-efficient-and-much-faster-at-ai-by-combining-light-and-silicon-for-a-fundamental-mathematical-operation" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/virtually-unhackable-chip-could-make-gpu-more-power-efficient-and-much-faster-at-ai-by-combining-light-and-silicon-for-a-fundamental-mathematical-operation">Virtually unhackable' chip could make GPU power efficient and faster at AI</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/exclusive-nvidias-fastest-ai-chip-ever-is-finally-available-for-preorder-and-you-can-get-the-gh200-for-as-little-as-dollar499-per-hour" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/exclusive-nvidias-fastest-ai-chip-ever-is-finally-available-for-preorder-and-you-can-get-the-gh200-for-as-little-as-dollar499-per-hour">Nvidia's fastest AI chip ever is finally available for preorder</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/will-arm-start-to-build-its-own-chips-soon-strategic-cortex-x-collaboration-with-samsung-may-well-be-first-step-in-that-direction" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/will-arm-start-to-build-its-own-chips-soon-strategic-cortex-x-collaboration-with-samsung-may-well-be-first-step-in-that-direction">Will Arm start to build its own chips soon?</a></li></ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In some Amish communities these days, e-bikes are beginning to outnumber buggies on the roads. Horse-drawn buggies, long a symbol of the Amish lifestyle, are finding less use as more people in Amish communities adopt electric-powered bicycles.</p>
<p>In small Amish towns across America such as Sugarcreek, Ohio, Napponee, Indiana, and Kalona, Iowa, e-bikes are gaining in popularity as a practical means of everyday transportation. In the Amish faith, members do not drive cars and trucks, so they have traditionally relied on horse-drawn buggies for commuting to work, shopping, and other local errands.</p>
<p>E-bikes are changing this tradition.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot quicker to jump on your bike and go into town than it is to bring your horse into the barn, harness it to the buggy, and go,” said David Mullett, owner of <a href="https://ebikesofholmescounty.com/">E-Bikes of Holmes County</a>, a popular bike shop in Holmes County, Ohio. “It’s a lot quicker and you travel faster too.”</p>
<p>A member of the Old Order Amish Church, Mullett has seen phenomenal growth in the popularity of e-bikes among the Amish in Holmes County, Ohio, which rivals Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, as one of the largest Amish settlements in the world.</p>
<p>“Back when I started the company (in 2016) only a small percentage of the Amish community were riding bikes in this area,” Mullett said. “Since 2017 to 2018, it really grew in our community.”</p>
<h4><span>From Push Scooters to E-Bikes</span></h4>

<p>Not all Amish ride bicycles of any type, let alone electric-powered ones. It depends on local church teachings. In Lancaster County, for instance, bike usage is confined largely to push scooters, a bike design unique to the Amish that resembles a full-size bicycle but without pedals or gears. Most local transportation there is still by horse-drawn buggies.</p>
<p>“Some (Amish) are starting to use e-bikes here,” said Randy Martin, owner of <a href="https://www.lancasterbicycleshop.com/">Lancaster Bicycle Shop</a>. “It varies quiete a bit from one district (of the church) to the other.” He confirmed, however, that most Amish there still use push scooters, if they ride at all.</p>
<p>Mullett explained why some Amish are using e-bikes while others are not.</p>
<p>“There are different denominations of Amish. Some don’t have any sort of bicycles. Each church can make their own set of guidelines. Just because one church has it doesn’t mean the neighboring church has allowed it. That’s not just for e-bikes but for anything.”</p>
<h4><span>Commuting to Work</span></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?resize=736%2C468&amp;ssl=1" width="736" height="468" alt="Amish adapting to e-bikes" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?resize=1024%2C651&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?resize=768%2C488&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?resize=610%2C388&amp;ssl=1 610w, https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?resize=1080%2C687&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amish-woman-e-bike-feature-image.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>While many cyclists enjoy their bikes for recreation and fitness, for the Amish the e-bike is a practical choice for daily transportation.</p>
<p>“Commuting to work is probably the No. 1 way that electric bikes are being used,” Mullett said, nothing that he commutes by bike to the bike shop. “Some people are commuting eight to 10 miles, some only one or two miles, but they jump on their bike and go. With a traditional bike, that would never have been considered.”</p>
<p>An e-bike is faster than the traditional buggie and cheaper than hiring a non-Amish motorist to drive them to work, a common practice in Amish communities.&nbsp; They are allowed to ride in cars that they neither own nor drive.</p>
<p>“They would have had to hire a driver or the place of work would have had to hire a driver to bring in their employees,” Mullett said.&nbsp; “That still happens, but there are more people who commute to work every day on e-bikes.”</p>
<h4><span>Riding to Walmart</span></h4>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/thisebikelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG-0004.jpg?resize=740%2C555&amp;ssl=1" width="740" height="555" alt="Amish e-bikes at Walmart in Ohio" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Another common use for electric bikes is for shopping. The local Walmart store in Millersburg, Ohio, has covered parking for e-bikes and buggies that includes charging stations for bikes. Many Amish cyclists use trailers to carry groceries or use specially made storage bags like these <a href="https://ebikesofholmescounty.com/product/carry-all-bag/">Carry-All Pannier Bags</a> made locally and sold in Mullet’s shop.</p>
<p>“We sell a lot of trailers for kids, child carriers,” Mullett said. “Women can go shopping and take their kids along and put the groceries in the trailer as well for the commute home.”</p>
<p>Three-wheel versions of electric bikes, often called e-trikes, are another popular option. They are ideal for carrying cargo or for riders who aren’t as confident about balancing a bike.</p>

<h4><span>How the Amish Charge Their E-bike Batteries</span></h4>
<p>Traditionally, Amish homes and businesses did not have electricity. This raises the question of how do the Amish keep their e-bike batteries charged? The answer is that many homes and businesses in the same Amish communities that approve of e-bike use also have adopted solar power and natural-gas generators. Mullett’s bike shop, for instance, has all the modern trappings that use electricity including computers, printers, lights, and power tools. The store is totally off the grid, something that is important to Amish families, but it is not lacking in electric power. It has 24 solar panels on the roof, a natural-gas backup generator, powerful lithium batteries, and twin 5,500-watt inverters.</p>

<p>Many homes, shops, barns, and offices in Ohio’s picturesque Amish Country have similar electric systems, which has helped transform Amish life in recent years. Not only are most of his customers able to charge their e-bikes at home, but Mullett said many employers and other locations in the community provide charging stations.</p>
<p>“A lot of businesses are doing this (charging stations) as a favor for their customers,” Mullett said.</p>
<p>As an aside, Mullet noted that Amish communities are probably the “greenest” communities in America with their absence of gas-guzzling autosmobiles and widespread use of solar power, bicycles, and buggies.</p>
<h4><span>Safety Issues</span></h4>
<p>As with buggies, safety issues are a paramount concern to the Amish who ride e-bikes on roads shared with cars and trucks. Most roads in Ohio’s Amish Country are two-lane rural roads and do not have wide shoulders. Due to the hilly terrain, many of the roads are twisty and do not provide good visibility when motorists come over crests.</p>
<p>Adding to the problem is that when e-bikes first became popular many Amish did not have experience riding bicycles, so safe riding techniques had to be learned.&nbsp; Mullett said Amish community leaders and county government officials have cooperated to teach safe-riding habits and to make the roads safer. Wide shoulders suitable for buggies and bikes are being added to many roads.</p>
<p>“Safety vests and helmets are both gaining in popularity,” Mullett said.</p>
<p>At the same time, helmets pose special problems for Amish women. They grow their hair long and keep it wrapped in a bun covered with a cap. For this reason, most bike helmets do not fit Amish women. Mullett said he has talked with some helmet manufacturers and encouraged them to build helmets suitable for Amish women, so far without success. For now, far more men wear helmets than women.</p>
<h4><span>The Future of Amish Buggies</span></h4>
<p>Now that e-bikes have arrived in many Amish communities, what will happen to the traditional horse-drawn buggies? Mullet said he doesn’t foresee the end of buggies but thinks the popularity of e-bikes will continue to grow.</p>
<p>“Horse and buggies will probably always be a part of the Amish community, but bike transportation is becoming more popular than the horse and buggy in the denominations that have allowed it,” Mullett said.</p>
<p>Even with families who ride e-bikes during the week to work and shop, Mullett said they typically still take the buggy to church services on Sundays. Buggies are also better for longer commutes and for those people who, for various reasons, do not enjoy riding a bike.</p>
<h4><span>E-Bikes Are Part of a Changing Lifestyle for the Amish</span></h4>
<p>E-bikes may be the most visible change, but they are just one indication of a significant transformation in the everyday life of Amish people. Coupled with the use of power tools in their shops, solar power in their homes, and other modern innovations, daily life for the Amish people is changing perhaps more now than it has at any time in the past century or more. It’s still a very distinctive, faith-based culture that rejects much of the materialism and secularism of the broader Western culture, but change is still occurring.</p>
<p>Just as horse-and-buggies symbolized Amish life in the past, the e-bike is the symbol of changing times in many Amish communities today.</p>
<h4><span><strong>Lessons for the Rest of Us</strong></span></h4>
<p>Ironically, the Amish may now be ahead of most of the rest of American society when it comes to their embrace of e-bikes for routine, daily transportation. This is the way of e-bikes are increasingly being used in Europe and in parts of Asia. Not just for fun and recreation, but as a practical, serious means of transportation for short, everyday errands. Think about the benefits to public health if more people followed the Amish example and hopped on an e-bike for quick errands to the drug or grocery store. Imagine how much we could improve the environment if more of us rode e-bikes for short trips versus cranking up a gas-guzzling SUV or pickup truck?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s much we can learn from the Amish lifestyle, and that definitely includes their integration of e-bikes into their everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>

                    My very own "object store"
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Amazon S3 is the original cloud technology: it came out in 2006.
            "Objects" were popular at the time and S3 was labelled an "object store",
            but everyone really knows that S3 is for files. S3 is a cloud filesystem,
            not an object-whatever.</p>
            <p>I think idea that S3 is <em>really</em> "Amazon Cloud Filesystem" is a
            bit of a load bearing fiction. It's sort of true: S3 can store files. It's
            also a very useful belief in getting people to adopt S3, a fundamentally
            good technology, which otherwise they might not. But it's false: S3 is not
            a filesystem and can't stand in for one.</p>
            <h2>What filesystems are about, and module "depth"</h2>
            <p>The unix file API is pretty straightforward. There are just five basic
            functions. They don't take many arguments.</p>
            <p>Here are (the Python versions of) these five basic functions:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><span></span><span># open a file</span>
<span>open</span><span>(</span><span>filepath</span><span>)</span> <span># returns a `file`</span>

<span># read from that file (moving the position forward)</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span># returns 100 bytes</span>

<span># write to that file (moving the position forward)</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"hello, world"</span><span>)</span>

<span># move the position to byte 94</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>seek</span><span>(</span><span>94</span><span>)</span>

<span># close the file</span>
<span>file</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Well, perhaps I should add an asterisk: I am simplifying a bit. There
            are loads more calls than that. But still, those five calls are the
            irreducible nub of the file API. They're all you need to read and write
            files.</p>
            <p>Those five functions handle a lot of concerns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>buffering</li>
                <li>the page cache</li>
                <li>fragmentation</li>
                <li>permissions</li>
                <li>IO scheduling</li>
                <li>and whatever else</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even though the file API <em>handles</em> all those concerns, but it
            doesn't <em>expose</em> them to you. A narrow interface handling a large
            number of concerns - that makes the unix file API a "deep" module.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://calpaterson.com/assets/wide-vs-narrow.svg" alt="diagram of a deep vs a shallow diagram">
            </figure>
            <p>Deep modules are great because you can benefit from their features -
            like wear-levelling on SD cards - but without bearing the psychic toll of
            thinking about any of it as you save a jpeg to your phone. Happy days.</p>
            <p>But if the file API is "deep", what sorts of things are "shallow"?</p>
            <p>A shallow module would have a relatively large API surface in proportion
            to what it's handling for you. One hint these days that a module is shallow
            is that the interface to it is YAML. YAML <em>appears</em> to be a mere
            markup language but in practice is a reuseable syntax onto which almost any
            semantics can be plonked.</p>
            <p>Often YAML works as the "Programming language of DevOps" and programming
            languages provide about the widest interface possible. Examine your YAML
            micro-language closely. Does it offer a looping construct? If so, it's
            likely Turing complete.</p>
            <p>But sometimes it is hard to package something up nicely with a bow on
            top. SQL ORMs are inherently a leaky abstraction. You can't use them
            without some understanding of SQL. So being shallow isn't inherently a
            criticism. Sometimes a shallow module is the best that can be done. But all
            else equal, deeper is better.</p>
            <h2>What S3 is about (it is deep too)</h2>
            <p>The unix file API was in place by the early 1970s. The interface has
            been retained and the guts have been re-implemented many times for
            compatibility reasons.</p>
            <p>But Amazon S3 <em>does not</em> reimplement the unix filesystem API.</p>
            <p>It has a wholly different arrangement and the primitives are only partly
            compatible. Here's a brief description of the calls that are analogous to
            the above five basic unix calls:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><span></span><span># Read (part) of an object</span>
<span>GetObject</span><span>(</span><span>Bucket</span><span>,</span> <span>Key</span><span>,</span> <span>Range</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>)</span> <span># contents is the HTTP body</span>

<span># Write an (entire) object</span>
<span>PutObject</span><span>(</span><span>Bucket</span><span>,</span> <span>Key</span><span>)</span> <span># send contents as HTTP body</span>

<span># er, that's it!</span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Two functions versus five. That's right, the S3 API is simpler than the
            unix file API. There is one additional concept ("buckets") but I think when
            you net it out, S3's interface-to-functionality ratio is even better than
            the unix file API.</p>
            <p>But something is missing. While you can partially read an object using
            the <code>Range</code> argument to <code>GetObject</code>, <strong>you
            can't overwrite partially</strong>. Overwrites have to be the whole
            file.</p>
            <p>That sounds minor but actually scopes S3 to a subset of the old usecases
            for files.</p>
            <h2>Filesystem software, especially databases, can't be ported to Amazon
            S3</h2>
            <p>Databases of all kinds need a place to put their data. Generally, that
            place has ended up being various files on the filesystem. Postgres
            maintains two or three files per table, plus loads of others for
            bookkeeping. SQLite famously stores everything in a single file. MySQL,
            MongoDB, Elasticsearch - whatever - they all store data in files.</p>
            <p>Crucially, these databases overwhelmingly <em>rely</em> on the ability
            to do partial overwrites. They store data in <a href="https://calpaterson.com/how-a-sql-database-works.html">"pages"</a> (eg 4 or 8 kilobytes long) in
            "heap" files where writes are done page by page. There might be thousands
            of pages in a single file. Pages are overwritten as necessary to store
            whatever data is required. That means partial overwrites are absolutely
            essential.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://calpaterson.com/assets/heap.svg" alt="diagram of a database heap file">
                <figcaption>
                    A heap file is full of pages (and empty slots). Pages are
                    overwritten individually as necessary.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Some software projects start with a dream of storing their data in a
            'simple' way by combining two well tested technologies: Amazon S3 and
            SQLite (or DuckDB). Afterall, what could be simpler and more
            straightforward? Sadly, they go together like oil and water.</p>
            <p>When your SQLite database is kept in S3, each write suddenly becomes a
            total overwrite of the entire database. While S3 can do big writes fast,
            even it isn't fast enough to make that strategy work for any but the
            smallest datasets. And you're jettisoning all the transactional integrity
            that the database authors have painstakingly implemented: rewriting the
            database file each time throws out all that stuff. On S3, the last write
            wins.</p>
            <h2>What S3 is good at and what it is bad at</h2>
            <p>The joy of S3 is that bandwidth ("speed") for reads and writes is
            extremely, extremely high. It's not hard to find examples online of people
            who have written to or read from S3 at over 10 gigabytes per second. In
            fact I once saturated a financial client's office network with a set of S3
            writes.</p>
            <p>But the lack of partial overwrites isn't the only problem. There are a
            few more.</p>
            <p>S3 has no rename or move operation. Renaming is <code>CopyObject</code>
            and then <code>DeleteObject</code>. <code>CopyObject</code> takes linear
            time to the size of the file(s). This comes up fairly often when someone
            has written a lot of files to the wrong place - moving the files back is
            very slow.</p>
            <p>And listing files is slow. While the joy of Amazon S3 is that you can
            read and write at extremely, extremely, high bandwidths, listing out what
            is there is much much slower. Slower than a slow local filesystem.</p>
            <p>But S3 is much lower maintenance than a filesystem. You just name the
            bucket, name the key and the cloud elves will sort out everything else.
            This is worth a lot as setting backups, replicating offsite, provisioning
            (which, remember is for IO ops as well as capacity) is pure drudgework.</p>
            <h2>Module depth is even more important across organisations</h2>
            <p>In retrospect it is not a surprise the S3 was the first popular cloud
            API. If deep APIs are helpful in containing the complexity between
            different modules with a single system (like your computer) they are even
            more helpful in containing the complexity of an interaction between two
            different businesses, where the costs of interacting are so much
            higher.</p>
            <p>Consider a converse example. Traditionally when one business wants to
            get it's computers working with those of another they call it
            "integration". It is a byword for suffering. Imagine you are tasked with
            integrating some Big Entreprise software horror into your organisation.
            Something like SAP. Is SAP a deep module? No. The tragedy of SAP is that
            almost your entire organisation has to understand it. Then you have to
            reconcile it with everything you're doing. At all times. SAP integration
            projects are consequently expensive, massive <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/millercoors-sues-hcl-tech-for-100-million-over-failure-to-implement-erp-project/">
            and</a> <a href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2020/01/project-failure-case-study-leaseplan-sap.html">
            regularly</a> <a href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2020/05/case-study-lidl-sap-debacle.html">fail</a>.</p>
            <p>There isn't much less complexity in S3 than there is in a SAP
            installation. Amazon named it the "Simple Storage Service" but the amount
            of complexity in S3 is <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/03/23/economics.html">pretty
            frightening</a>. Queueing theory, IO contention, sharding, the list of
            problems just goes on and on - in addition too all the stuff I listed above
            that filesystems deal with. (And can you believe they do it all
            on-prem?)</p>
            <p>The "simple" in S3 is a misnomer. S3 is not actually simple. It's
            deep.</p>

            <p>I don't mean to suggest in any way via this article that S3 is not
            <a href="https://calpaterson.com/amazon-premium.html">overpriced for what it is</a>. To rephrase a

            book</a>. The book is effectly a list of ideas on software design. Some are
            real hits with me, others not, but well worth reading overall. Praise for
            making it succinct.</p>
            <p>A few databases are explicitly designed from the start to us the S3 API
            for storage. <a href="https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/papers/p215-dageville-snowflake.pdf">Snowflake
            was.</a> So it's possible - but not transparently. But snowflake is one of
            the few I'm aware of (and they made this decision very early, at least by
            2016). If you know of others - let me know by email.</p>
            <p>It isn't just databases that struggle on S3. Many file formats assume
            that you'll be able to seek around cheaply and are less performant on S3
            than on disk. Zipfiles are a key example.</p>
            <h3>Other stuff about S3 that is a matter for regret</h3>
            <p>I genuinely like S3 so did not want to create the wrong impression by
            including a laundry list of complaints in the middle of the post but anyway
            here are the other major problems I didn't mention above:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The S3 API is <em>only</em> available as XML. JSON was around in
                    2006 but XML was still dominant and so it's probably not a surprise
                    that Amazon picked XML originally. It is a surprise that Amazon
                    never released a JSON version though - particularly when they made
                    the switch from SOAP to REST, which would have been a good
                    time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It's also a matter for regret that Amazon <a href="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.xsd">gave up</a>
                    on maintaining the XSD schema as this is one of the key benefits of
                    XML for APIs. The canonical documentation is just a website
                    now.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Criminally, Amazon - like many cloud service providers - have
                    never produced any kind of local test environment. In Python, the
                    more diligent test with the <a href="https://github.com/getmoto/moto">moto</a> library. moto is
                    maintained by volunteers which is weird given that it's a testing
                    tool for a commercial offering.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Amazon S3 <em>does</em> support checksums. For whatever reason
                    they are not turned on by default. Amazon makes many claims about
                    durability. I haven't heard of people having problems but equally:
                    I've never seen these claims tested. I am at least a bit curious
                    about these claims.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For years Amazon S3 held one other trap for the unwary: eventual
                    consistency. If you read a file, then overwrote it, you might read
                    it back and find it hadn't changed yet. Particularly because it
                    only happened sometimes, for short periods of time, this caused all
                    manner of chaos. Other implementors of S3 didn't copy this property
                    and a few years ago <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/">
                    Amazon fixed it in their implementation</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">When it comes to pipes in shells many tutorials introduce
<code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> which
map to file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 respectively.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to know how many lines contains the word <em>bird</em> in
chapter 1 and 2 of your text, you can use a command like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ cat Chap1.txt Chap2.txt | grep bird | wc -l"><pre><code>$ cat Chap1.txt Chap2.txt | grep bird | wc -l
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And pictures like this are shown to explain what happens internally:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Advanced</h3><a id="user-content-advanced" aria-label="Permalink: Advanced" href="#advanced"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The more advanced sections provide information how to use constructs
like <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> to redirect <code>stderr</code> to
<code>stdout</code>.  And then you might come to the sections for the
pros and nerds. There is explained that you can build up a whole tree
of processes like</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ find / 1> >(grep .txt) 2> >(wc >/tmp/w.log)"><pre><code>$ find / 1&gt; &gt;(grep .txt) 2&gt; &gt;(wc &gt;/tmp/w.log)

<p dir="auto">Nobody will tell you:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are
artificial definitions.</li>
<li>Also the relation to file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 is artificial.</li>
<li>There are more than three file descriptors. On a typical Linux
system each process has by default 1024 - which can be increased if
needed.</li>
<li>From starting up processes and generating pipes between them there
is mostly no limitation on system level; shells only support this in a
very limited way.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This is the moment when <em>pipexec</em> drops in: with <em>pipexec</em> you can
start up any kind of processes and build up pipes between them as you want.</p>

<p dir="auto">Most systems to start and run processes during system start-up time do
not support pipe.  If you need to run a pipe of programs from an
/etc/init.d script you are mostly lost.</p>
<p dir="auto">Depending on your distribution you can be happy if it starts up - but
when it comes to stopping, at least the current Debian
start-stop-daemon and RHEL 6 daemon function fail.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also here <em>pipexec</em> comes in: it starts up processes piped together,
acts like a single process and supports pid file handling.</p>

It incorporates central QA workers at Activision offices in Texas, Minnesota, and California, and is distinct from other recent QA unions under Microsoft such as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize">Zenimax QA union</a> and groups at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-qa-employees-activision-blizzards-first-union">Raven Software</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-albany-workers-officially-form-second-union-under-activision-blizzard">Blizzard Albany</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/08/dallas-hpim4448-1709941567238.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Activision's office in Dallas, Texas.

This is notable especially in light of the hurdles faced by Raven Software and Blizzard Albany in forming their unions prior to the acquisition, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-shut-down-again-in-argument-against-blizzard-albany-union">both groups</a> accused Activision Blizzard of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-entire-raven-software-qa-unionization-story">union busting efforts</a>.</p><p>"There was no one specific catalyst, but more so just recognizing as QA workers we often have the lowest protections and lowest pay of any workers in the industry even though our work requires expertise, skill, and is absolutely essential to the success of the companies where we work," said Tom Shelley, technical requirements specialist at Activision and member of the newly formed AQAU. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The CWA Labor Neutrality Agreement is a historic agreement and unprecedented at a tech company of Microsoft’s size</p></div><p>"The CWA Labor Neutrality Agreement is a historic agreement and unprecedented at a tech company of Microsoft’s size. By recognizing our union, Microsoft is making good on its promise to respect our ability to decide for ourselves about union representation. We encountered no union-busting at a time when most US companies - especially tech companies — regularly spend millions on anti-union consultants to prevent workers from speaking up for themselves. We hope this will inspire other workers to form unions and raise industry-wide expectations for pay, benefits, and respect for workers' rights."</p><p>The group expects to bargain with Microsoft over a new contract, particularly over asks such as better pay and benefits, more promotional opportunities, and a clear career development track. Currently, Zenimax QA workers are bargaining over their first contract with the company, which thus far includes agreements on subjects such as <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/subcontractors-incorporated-microsoft-bargaining-unit-cwa-signaling-new-pathway" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subcontracting</a> and <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/zenimax-workers-united-cwa-collective-bargaining-yields-first-its-kind-tentative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The aircraft was operated by two pilots and four flight attendants.</p><p>As the aircraft reached the cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, both pilots took their headsets off and the cockpit loudspeaker volume was increased. The PIC then asked permission to rest from the SIC and was granted. A few seconds later, the PIC slept and the SIC then took over the PIC duty as PM.</p><p>The PIC woke up and at 0122 UTC, asked whether the SIC wanted to rest. The SIC responded that he did not want to rest.

There was no reply from the pilots.</p><p>28 minutes after the last recorded transmission from the SIC, the PIC woke up and was aware that the aircraft was not in the correct flight path. The PIC then saw the SIC was sleeping and woke him up. About the same time, the PIC responded to the call from another pilot and Jakarta ACC. The PIC advised the Jakarta ACC that BTK6723 experienced radio communication problem and currently the problem has been resolved.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Mar 3rd, 2024 | 14 minute read</span></p><p>A few years ago I released <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/protodump" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">protodump</a>, a CLI for extracting full source protobuf definitions from compiled binaries (regardless of the target architecture). This can come in handy if you’re trying to reverse engineer an API used by a closed source binary, for instance. In this post I’ll explain how it works, but first, a demo:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkadiyt/protodump/main/demo/demo.gif" alt="Demo of protodump"></p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3><p>To understand how it works, lets take a look at a small <code>test.proto</code> example:</p><div><pre><code><span>syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>"proto3"</span><span>;</span>

<span>option</span> <span>go_package</span> <span>=</span> <span>"./;helloworld"</span><span>;</span>

<span>message</span> <span>HelloWorld</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If we compile this with protoc to golang we’ll get some golang code that defines the object type, creates getters and setters for the <code>name</code> field, and so on. We can use it as follows:</p><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>obj</span> <span>:=</span> <span>helloworld</span><span>.</span><span>HelloWorld</span><span>{</span>
		<span>Name</span><span>:</span> <span>"myname"</span><span>,</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>obj</span><span>.</span><span>GetName</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>However protobuf also supports runtime reflection. Rather than invoking the getter method at compile time, we can fetch the list of fields and query them at runtime:</p><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>obj</span> <span>:=</span> <span>helloworld</span><span>.</span><span>HelloWorld</span><span>{</span>
		<span>Name</span><span>:</span> <span>"myname"</span><span>,</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>fields</span> <span>:=</span> <span>obj</span><span>.</span><span>ProtoReflect</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Descriptor</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Fields</span><span>()</span>
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>fields</span><span>.</span><span>Len</span><span>();</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>fields</span><span>.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
		<span>value</span> <span>:=</span> <span>obj</span><span>.</span><span>ProtoReflect</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>field</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>String</span><span>()</span>
		<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Field %d has value '%v'</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>go run main.go
Field 0 has value <span>'myname'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>How can the generated golang code know the field names and types at runtime like this? The protoc compiler stores a whole copy of the protobuf definition in the generated output code. <a href="https://gist.github.com/arkadiyt/c0853bcfdd966d06f574664ce33689d3" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">Here</a> is the complete protoc output for our HelloWorld message type, and in particular, <a href="https://gist.github.com/arkadiyt/c0853bcfdd966d06f574664ce33689d3#file-helloworld-go-L72-L78" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">lines 72-78</a> store this protobuf definition:</p><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>file_test_proto_rawDesc</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This byte array stores the field names and types, messages, services, enums, options, and so on. It’s a little meta because the format of this object is <em>itself</em> a protobuf object, called a <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/7a51eb5370905dec1943c5f1f6b4381fecb04116/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L92-L127" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">FileDescriptor</a>, and is encoded into a byte array using the protobuf wire format.</p><p>With this knowledge in hand, the strategy for extracting protobuf definitions from binaries becomes the following:</p><ul><li>Iterate over the contents of a program binary</li><li>Find sequences of bytes that look like they might be FileDescriptors, such as the example above</li><li>Extract these bytes and decode them into “.proto” source definitions</li></ul><h3 id="finding-bytes-that-look-like-filedescriptors">Finding bytes that look like FileDescriptors</h3><p>To find FileDescriptors I take the naive approach of simply searching the program binary for the ascii string “.proto”. The FileDescriptor object has a field for the <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto#L94" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">file name</a> of the proto file it was compiled from, so if engineers are naming their files with a “.proto” extension then it’ll be present in the output.</p><p>We can imagine a program binary as a sequence of bytes laid out as follows:</p><p><img src="https://arkadiyt.com/images/protodump/program_memory.png" alt="Program memory"></p><p>So when we find a “.proto” string, to capture the entire FileDescriptor (the entire purple segment) we need to first move backward to the start of the object and then read until the end.</p><p>To determine how far back to read, it’s helpful to understand the protobuf <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">wire format</a>. Protobuf makes heavy use of variable-length integers (“varints”), which allow encoding unsigned 64-bit integers using anywhere between 1-10 bytes (in little-endian), with smaller integers using fewer bytes. When such a varint is encountered, if the most significant bit of a byte is set then this indicates that the following byte is also part of the varint:</p><div><pre><code># Value is 8:
  00001000
# ^ MSB is not set, end of varint

# Value is 150:
  10010110 00000001
# ^ MSB is set, varint continues to next byte
#          ^ MSB is not set, end of varint
# How to calculate 150:
# 10010110 00000001       // Original inputs
# 0010110  0000001        // Drop continuation bits
# 0000001  0010110        // Convert to big-endian
# 00000010010110          // Concatenate
# 128 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 150  // Interpret as an unsigned 64-bit integer
</code></pre></div><p>Protobuf Messages are encoded using a “Tag-Length-Value” scheme, where a message with some fields is encoded as the following structure, repeated:</p><ul><li>A varint for the index and type of the field (the “tag”)<ul><li>This is defined as the field number of a field within a message, bit-shifted left 3 times and OR-ed with the type. Protobuf defines <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/#structure" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">6 types</a>, with string types having value 2</li></ul></li><li>A varint for the byte-length of the payload</li><li>The payload itself</li></ul><p>and this gets repeated for every field in the message. Using the byte array from the HelloWorld example above, we have the following structure:</p><p><img src="https://arkadiyt.com/images/protodump/file_descriptor.png" alt="Annotated file descriptor"></p><p>So the search strategy is:</p><ul><li>Loop over program memory looking for the ascii string “.proto”. When we find one:<ul><li>Assume that this is the start of an encoded file descriptor object. Move back to the previous <code>0x0a</code> byte (the tag for the file name field)</li><li>If the file name is exactly 10 bytes long, move back 1 byte further (otherwise the <code>0x0a</code> byte we found is actually the string length and not the tag)</li><li>Now that we’re at the beginning of the FileDescriptor object, keep consuming bytes so long as they are a valid protobuf wire encoding</li><li>Take all the bytes we’ve consumed and attempt to unmarshal them into a FileDescriptor object<ul><li>If successful, convert the FileDescriptor object to a source “.proto” file and output it</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>To convert the FileDescriptor object to a source “.proto” file, I couldn’t find any existing code in the protoc compiler to do that so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/protodump/blob/main/pkg/protodump/proto.go" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">my own implementation</a>.</p><p>Finally, for unit testing, I wrote a small harness that takes proto files as input, executes the protoc compiler on them, takes that FileDescriptor output and reserializes it as proto, and checks that the input proto and output proto are byte-for-byte identical.</p><h3 id="shortcomings">Shortcomings</h3><p>There are a number of limitations to this approach. First and foremost, everything written above is specific to Google’s protoc compiler; it does not apply to the more general protobuf specification. If someone uses a non-protoc compiler, it may have a completely different mechanism for implementing reflection.</p><p>Even when using protoc:</p><ul><li>People can name their files with an extension other than “.proto”</li><li>They can obfuscate the file descriptor in program memory</li><li>Protobuf <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/#order" target="_blank" rel=" noopener external">explicitly does not guarantee</a> field ordering on the wire format, so moving the file name field to a different location other than the start of the FileDescriptor would break the scanning</li></ul><p>Additionally many protobuf compilers offer the option to suppress this embedding completely (at the cost of losing runtime reflection capabilities).</p><p>Despite all these shortcomings, I’ve found that the 99% of binaries I examine use protoc and don’t have any obfuscation, and all their protobuf definitions are extracted in full.</p><p>P.S.
