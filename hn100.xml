            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs' capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman (NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> has now begun testing solid-state EV batteries in its Tesla Model 3-rivalling Seal. Initial tests suggest that the total driving range could reach nearly 1,200 miles (1,875 km).</p>



<h2 id="h-byd-begins-testing-solid-state-ev-batteries-in-the-seal">BYD begins testing solid-state EV batteries in the Seal</h2>



<p>It has been over a decade since BYD first began researching and developing the promising new EV battery technology.</p>



<p>Last year, the company reached a milestone by testing its first solid-state battery cells with capacities of 20 Ah and 60 Ah. We knew BYD was planning to launch its first vehicles powered by the new batteries in 2027 after Sun Huajun, the CTO of BYD’s battery business, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/17/byd-confirms-evs-all-solid-state-batteries-2027/">confirmed the timeline</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>At the 2025 China All-Solid-State Battery Innovation and Development Summit, Sun stated that BYD has officially installed solid-state batteries in its popular Seal EV and is now testing them on roads.</p>	
	



<p>Once testing is finalized, which is expected to occur in 2027, BYD plans to begin installing solid-state batteries in its production vehicles.</p>

<p>Between 2027 and 2029, production will be limited during the first two years. However, in 2030, BYD plans to begin mass production. BYD has previously said that by the end of the decade, it expects “liquid and solid to be the same price.” In other words, solid-state batteries will be about the same cost as current liquid lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>The Seal, BYD’s Tesla Model 3-rivalling electric sedan, is expected to be the first EV available with solid-state batteries, starting in 2027. Other models will begin to hit the market in 2028 and the following years.</p>

<p>BYD’s solid-state batteries have an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, or nearly twice that of current lithium-ion batteries.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://post.smzdm.com/p/a0zp33or/">local reports</a>, BYD’s solid-state EV batteries set a record by gaining 1,500 km (932 miles) range in just 12 minutes of charging. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" height="512" width="1024" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="BYD-Seal-solid-state-EV-batteries" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg 1400w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=1024,512 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=350,175 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=140,70 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/BYD-Seal-Toyota-3.jpeg?resize=290,145 290w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>BYD Seal EVs models in Japan (Source: BYD)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The test charged the battery to just 80%, meaning total EV range could reach upwards of 1,875 km (1,165 miles). Keep in mind, that is CLTC range. On the EPA scale, it would be closer to 1,300 km (808 miles), which is still way more than enough.</p>



<p>BYD’s Seal currently starts at just 175,800 yuan in China, or about $25,000. When it initially hits the market in 2027 with solid-state batteries, the Seal will likely be priced higher.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>BYD is already dominating the global EV market. It just surpassed Tesla in Europe and the UK in monthly registrations for the first time, and this could be just the start.</p>



<p>With several new batteries and plenty of other EV technologies, including ultra-fast chargers, smart driving features, and advanced new platforms, BYD is laying the groundwork for more growth over the next few years.</p>



<p>Not only that, BYD is already known for its low-cost cars like the Seagull (Dolphin Surf in Europe), priced under $10,000 in China. The new tech is expected to unlock longer driving range, faster charging, and lower costs.</p>



<p>BYD will compete with CATL, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Nissan, and several others that are also aiming to launch their first EVs with solid-state batteries around 2027 or 2028. Nissan’s director of product planning in Europe, Christop Ambland, confirmed the company’s timeline this week with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/nissan/367112/nissan-deliver-solid-state-battery-tech-production-car-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auto Express</a></em>, saying, “We will be ready for SSB (solid-state batteries) in 2028.”</p>

        <p>As we’re all celebrating the <a href="https://www.jaws50th.com/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">50th anniversary</a> of the movie <em>Jaws</em>, here’s something I bet you didn’t know: Due to a fluke of publishing and copyright law, the <em>Jaws</em> shark is public domain.</p><p>It’s not the <em>character</em> of the shark that’s public domain – or someone would surely be making a low-budget horror prequel about how he became the Amity Island Killer. But I’m talking about the famous shark painting from the movie poster:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/poster.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="889" height="1358" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/poster.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/poster.jpg 889w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yep. That painting, the same one that appeared on the cover of the paperback edition of the novel, is public domain.</p><p>This is kind of a wild story.</p><p>When the book first came out, it didn’t have this cover art. An old <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/04/21/119458470.html?pageNumber=266&amp;ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">article</a> about the book’s origin explains that the author, Peter Benchley, actually had his own idea for the cover. He thought it should show “a peaceful unsuspecting town through the bleached jaws of a shark.” He pitched his idea to Doubleday, who was publishing the hardcover version of the book.</p><p>So Doubleday senior editor Tom Congdon worked with art director Alex Gotfryd and had an artist produce this mock-up:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="330" height="482"><figcaption><span>Art by Wendell Minor</span></figcaption></figure><p>Congdon didn’t like it. He said, “the shark’s bones look too liplike and pendulous.” A preview of the cover was shown at a book sales manager’s conference, and there was “considerable resistance” from the salesmen who said it resembled a vagina with teeth.</p><p>The book was supposed to come out in January, 1974, but publication was delayed until February to rework the cover.</p><p>Congdon asked, “Can we have just a fish on the cover?”</p><p>But Gotfryd said no. “The cover’s not big enough. It will look like a sardine.”</p><p>So they settled on no image at all. The first printed cover was just black:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/original-cover.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="1858" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/original-cover.jpg 1270w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>From an eBay listing that was asking for $7,500. It didn’t sell.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bantam had purchased the paperback rights to the book, but when Bantam president Oscar Dystal saw the empty cover, he didn’t like it. He said, “Without an image, no one would know what <em>Jaws</em> was. It could have been a book about dentistry.” It needed a shark.</p><p>So Gotfryd contacted an artist named Paul Bacon who made a rough sketch of the shark’s head, and at Gotfryd’s suggestion added a swimmer for scale. The next day, Bacon came back with the finished artwork that became the new hardcover dust jacket:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="925" height="1381" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/image-2.png 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png 925w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Congdon later said, “We realized that the new version looked like a penis with teeth. But was that bad?”</p><p>Has any other design project ever gone from “we can’t use that because it looks like a vagina with teeth” to “that looks like a penis with teeth but let’s go with it?”</p><p>A year later, when Bantam was preparing to publish the paperback edition, they hired artist Roger Kastel to make an updated version of the cover. He went to the Museum of Natural History to study sharks, and he had a model pose across a couple of stools for reference of what someone looks like swimming. He used those elements in creating the now-famous illustration:</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/paperback-cover.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="989" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/paperback-cover.jpg 600w"><figcaption><span>Here’s a whole other rabbit hole: The snow leopard exhibit in the Central Park Zoo is actually </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/nyregion/13snow.html?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><span>named after</span></a><span> the model who posed for this cover, Allison Maher. She married billionaire philanthropist Leonard Stern, and she’s a trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society. She talked about posing for this poster recently in a pretty good episode of </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wcs-wild-audio-summer-series-part-1-posing-for-the/id1630987446?i=1000661838727&amp;ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><span>their podcast</span></a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are slightly different accounts of how Universal acquired permission to use the illustration on the movie poster. Kastel’s <a href="http://www.rogerkastel.com/biography.htm?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">official website</a> says that “Universal Studios, so impressed by the work, purchased the right to use this image as the poster for the movie.”</p><p>But a 2012 <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/jaws-unsung-heroes/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">article</a> in <em>Empire</em> says that Universal actually got the rights from Bantam for free:</p><blockquote>Impressed by the cover, Universal purloined Kastel’s work for the movie poster — Bantam books chief Oscar Dystel gave it to the filmmakers for free, losing out on millions of dollars — and it quickly became iconic.</blockquote><p>Whether Universal paid for the rights or not, Kastel became bitter about all the places it was showing up.</p><p>In 2015, he <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/07/26/how-the-famous-poster-from-jaws-was-created-and-lost/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">told</a> the New York Post, “What really bothered me was that they used the image for merchandising. You see that poster on everything.” And in 2020, Kastel <a href="https://michaelpcoleman.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/jaws-iconic-artwork-and-the-artist-behind-it/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">told</a> writer Michael P. Coleman, “We were floored by how they merchandised that image, from t-shirts to cartoons.”</p><p>It’s unclear when exactly Kastel realized that there was something fishy about the painting’s copyright situation. I can only speculate that at some point he wondered if he was entitled to some of the money from all the licensing, and discovered that the copyright to the image had never been properly established.</p><p>See, when he made the painting in 1975, copyright was still ruled by a 1909 law that said you had to include a copyright notice upon publication of a work, and that notice had to include your name. When the book was published, it carried no such notice for the artwork. It only had a copyright notice for the text. That meant that the painting became public domain as soon as it was published.</p><p>In a bit of timing bad luck, a new copyright law enacted just a year after the book came out eliminated the notice requirement.</p><p>So in early 2013, almost 40 years after <em>Jaws</em> was published, Kastel filed a copyright application for the <em>Jaws</em> illustration. But the copyright office denied it.</p><p>He filed an appeal. They denied that, too.</p><p>In 2014, he submitted a final appeal to the Copyright Office Review Board, and the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/2014-appeal-JawsIllustration2014.pdf?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">decision</a> from the board is <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Jaws_Illustration_%28USCO_Review_Board%2C_2014%29?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">available</a> to read online. The main points are:</p><ul><li>The image was published without a proper copyright notice, so it became public domain under the law at the time.</li><li>The fact that the book said “Copyright © 1974 Peter Benchley” isn’t good enough to let the public know that the cover is copyrighted because that’s not the name of the cover art’s copyright owner.</li><li>This situation is not like magazines and anthologies, which are collective works with multiple contributors that can be covered by a single copyright notice. One illustration on the cover of a novel doesn’t make it a collective work.</li><li>If Benchley had licensed the artwork from Kastel or had some other legal relationship, that might make a difference. But he didn’t, so the works are unrelated and require separate notices.</li></ul><p>So the review board unambiguously rejected the claim:</p><blockquote>The Board has concluded that the copyright notice in the Book, which includes only Peter Benchley’s name, does not meet the statutory notice requirement under the 1909 Act and, as such, the Work was forfeited to the public domain upon its publication.</blockquote><p>So whether Universal paid anything for permission to use the artwork becomes a moot point because it turns out that they didn’t need permission. And anyone could have sold merchandise with the image without paying any licensing fees to Universal, Bantam, or Kastel.</p><p>Kastel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/roger-karl-kastel-dead-jaws-poster.html?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">died</a> in 2023 and, while he didn’t see any <em>Jaws</em> royalties from merchandise that featured his artwork, he did get more work as a result of it, including illustrating the <em>Gone With The Wind-</em>inspired poster for <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1000" srcset="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 600w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 1000w, https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/wind-empire.jpg 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>How did I never notice this before?</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that Kastel definitely did own is the original artwork used for the <em>Jaws</em> book cover and poster. Unfortunately, the painting went missing in 1976 and nobody knows where it is.</p><p>One story goes that the painting went on a national tour to promote the book, making stops to appear in various book store windows, and then disappeared somewhere in Hollywood. Or it may have been last seen hanging in an exhibit at the Society of Illustrators in New York.</p><p>Kastel’s son Matthew thinks it was last seen at the New York Historical Society. At least that’s what he said in an article a few years back for <a href="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/jaws-missing-painting/?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Daily Art Magazine</a> but I suspect he was actually thinking of the Society of Illustrators. Either way, he wrote:</p><blockquote>But the question remains. What happened to my father’s work?<p>Where is one to start on a mystery over 45 years old with no clues? Outside of putting my father’s&nbsp;<em>Jaws</em>&nbsp;illustration on the back of milk cartons under the caption&nbsp;<em>MISSING</em>, I have no clue.</p><p>Was the painting simply lost, misplaced, or thrown away like an old movie prop by Universal out of lack of care or ignorance? Or was it stolen somewhere in Universal’s care by an admirer and/or enterprising thief?</p><p>My recourse is limited. By writing this article, I am taking a longshot approach that someone out there reading this may know about its whereabouts or fate and step forward. </p></blockquote><p>If you happen to know where the original <em>Jaws</em> painting is, <a href="http://thirdstrikeproductions.com/contact.htm?ref=ironicsans.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">here</a> is where you can reach out to Matthew Kastel.</p><p>So that’s the story of how a pop culture icon became freely available for anyone to use. It’s good that creative works eventually become public domain, but I also believe an artist should be able to enjoy the fruits of his work in his lifetime if he wants to. So while I’m usually in favor of the commons, I feel like this time... it’s personal.</p><p>Fin.</p><figure><img src="https://ironicsans.ghost.io/content/images/2025/06/horiz-2.gif" alt="" loading="lazy" width="295" height="22"></figure><p>What a story.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="metered-article"><p>
<strong>The European Commission is in advanced business negotiations with OVHcloud, the France-based major European cloud service provider, to transition its cloud services away from Microsoft, according to three senior sources with internal knowledge of the matter who spoke to Euractiv on condition of anonymity.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The infrastructure shift is being driven by a push for European digital sovereignty in the cloud market, following <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/microsofts-email-shutdown-of-icc-prosecutor-fuels-eu-fears-of-us-tech-blackmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerns raised</a> by a US executive order that led to the shutdown of Microsoft services for an employee of a European-based institution.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the move would be to ensure that European institutions have greater control over their digital infrastructure and data – an idea that has been championed by the <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/european-industry-big-win-germany-france-both-support-sovereign-eu-based-tech-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EuroStack initiative</a>. It is also a blow for US tech behemoth Microsoft, which has been striving to reassure its European customers in the past weeks.
</p>
<p>
Once the European Commission "gets its house into order," it is expected to set a precedent for national public administrations to direct public procurement funds towards homegrown cloud providers, one source said. The Commission sees itself as a trend setter, they added, aligning with its broader strategy to enhance the EU's digital autonomy and reduce reliance on non-European tech giants.
</p>
<p>
We understand the Commission has been in discussions with OVHcloud for several weeks. However, an unknown number of other European cloud providers, including Germany's IONOS, France's Scaleway and Italy's Aruba, are also being considered as potential alternatives.
</p>
<p>
A unique aspect of this situation is that, for the first time, the two key digital departments of the Commission – DG CNECT, which drafts and enforces digital policies, and DG DIGIT, the IT department – are under the oversight of a single Commissioner (Henna Virkkunen) with a tech sovereignty portfolio.
</p>
<p>
This consolidation has made it easier to harmonise the political and technical priorities of the European executive, our sources told us.
</p>
<p>
"Discussions are indeed underway, both with the Commission and with other public and private institutions and organisations that are evaluating projects to migrate to a sovereign cloud," an OVHcloud spokesperson told Euractiv when we sought comment.
</p>
<p>
The Commission is "constantly scanning the market" and already "has a contract with OVHcloud" a Commission spokesperson said in response to Euractiv's request for comment. It did not confirm whether the Commission will actually switch away from Microsoft Azure.
</p>
<p>
In January, Euractiv <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/internal-documents-reveal-commission-fears-over-microsoft-dependency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;that the Commission was concerned about its reliance on Microsoft, quoting internal documents.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the EU institutions watchdog, the European Data Protection Supervisor <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/eu-commission-breached-data-protection-rules-using-microsoft-365-eu-watchdog-found/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> last year that the EU's executive is in breach of data protection rules that apply to EU institutions over its use of Microsoft Azure cloud for some of its data.

          <p>Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need to manually add the filter.)</p>
<p>One thing that people have ran into is “fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re still saving time using an adblocker.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>InnerTube is YouTube’s first party internal API that the web client and mobile apps use to interact with videos and get details about them. There are some legacy API endpoints that don’t go through InnerTube, but none of those are relevant today. InnerTube endpoints look like <code>https://www.youtube.com/youtubei/</code>. One of those endpoints is <code>/youtubei/v1/player</code>, which the web client calls when you click on a video to get data about the URL and GVS stream URLs.</p>
<p>GVS (Google Video Services) is a service that serves video streams for YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Photos. To stream a video from GVS, you need to get a GVS <code>/videoplayback</code> URL from InnerTube (or the Drive/Photos internal API). GVS URLs are signed and have an expiry time (usually 6 hours), so you can’t construct them on your own, you need to get one from InnerTube. One weird thing about GVS is that it isn’t only hosted from Google’s data center: ISPs can put <a href="https://support.google.com/interconnect/answer/9058809">Google Global Cache</a> servers in their infrastructure so that they can serve YouTube videos without needing to send traffic outside the ISP’s network (only public/unlisted YouTube videos are served by GGC; private YT videos and Drive/Photos videos are always served from Google data centers). GVS URLs look like <code>https://rr1---sn-gvbxgn-tt1e6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1750321185&amp;...</code> (but with a lot more query parameters).</p>
<p>Originally the web client streamed video by just using some query parameters to the GVS URL to specify what range of video it wanted, and GVS responded with the video contents for that range. But for complicated reasons, YouTube decided to improve on this with SABR (Server ABR (Adaptive Bit Rate)), which is YouTube’s proprietary binary protocol for streaming video data, which is better at avoiding buffering than today’s open formats (e.g. MPEG-DASH). One thing that SABR supports is the server sending a backoff to the client, instructing the client to wait some amount of time before trying again instead of sending video/audio data.</p>
<h2 id="the-source-of-fake-buffering">The source of fake buffering</h2>
<p>What’s happening is that InnerTube is providing GVS streams that will give a backoff of 80% of the ad duration for ads for the first <code>/videoplayback</code> request (for the content video, not the ads), so for example if the ad is 15 seconds you’ll get 12 seconds of backoff when blocking ads. If you have an unskippable 6 second ad AND a 15 second unskippable ad together the backoff will be 16.8 seconds. To be clear this isn’t server-side ad insertion; the ad and content streams are still separate (YouTube <em>is</em> doing a server-side ad insertion experiment, but that’s separate from fake buffering). The “Experiencing interruptions” dialogs are likely triggered by long backoffs from GVS.</p>
<p>This backoff <em>always</em> happen if you’re in the A/B test, regardless of if YouTube thinks you’re using an adblocker. You just don’t notice it if you’re not blocking ads, because the web client starts loading the content video while the ad plays, so the only difference for non-ad-blocking users is that the content video doesn’t start buffering until the ad is 80% over.</p>
<p>I’ve seen claims online that YouTube is “DAMAGING Computers By SPIKING CPU Usage If You Use Ad Block”. This is completely false; YouTube doesn’t use CPU usage waiting for the backoff to expire (and even if they used a spinloop to implement the wait, maxing a single core for &lt;30 seconds won’t damage any CPU).</p>
<h2 id="become-unadvertisable">Become unadvertisable</h2>
<p>How can you avoid getting backoffed until the unskippable ad is over? Don’t get served an ad in the first place. If you set the <code>playbackContext.<wbr>contentPlaybackContext.<wbr>isInlinePlaybackNoAd</code> property in player requests to true, InnerTube won’t serve you any ads and thus won’t include any backoff in the GVS streams.</p>
<p>We can write a filter rule that makes it so whenever the web client stringifies JSON bound for a server request, we add <code>"isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true</code> to the stringified JSON.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="adb"><span><span>www.youtube.com<span>##</span><span>+</span>js(trusted<span>-</span>replace<span>-</span>outbound<span>-</span>text, JSON.stringify, '<span>contentPlaybackContext</span><span>":{', 'contentPlaybackContext"</span>:<span>{</span><span>"isInlinePlaybackNoAd"</span>:<span>true</span>,', condition, '<span>contentPlaybackContext</span>')
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How did I know to set that property? It’s referenced in the frontend JavaScript, so I could have spent a bunch of time reading all that. But there’s an easier way - while the web client interacts with InnerTube using JSON, that JSON API is actually generated from a Protocol Buffers definition, and there’s a way you can extract most of the underlying protobuf definition. I used <a href="https://github.com/ddd/req2proto">req2proto</a>, which is a tool to extract protobuf definitions from Google’s internal APIs to get the full definitions used in the <code>/youtubei/v1/player</code> call, and used that to find the <code>isInlinePlaybackNoAd</code> property.</p>
<p>This method only works for warm navigation, where you’ve already loaded the YouTube single page app and are clicking around within it. When you navigate directly to a watch page, the YouTube backend embeds a player response directly into the page as <code>ytInitialPlayerResponse</code>. Since the player request is made on the backend, we can’t set <code>isInlinePlaybackNoAd</code> on it.  One way to fix this for cold loads is to just remove that initial data to force YouTube to make a player request we can control (but see below before using these):</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="adb"><span><span>www.youtube.com<span>##</span><span>+</span>js(set, ytInitialData, undefined) <span>!</span> bad idea, see below
</span></span><span><span>www.youtube.com<span>##</span><span>+</span>js(set, ytInitialPlayerResponse, undefined) <span>!</span> bad idea<span>!</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This approach has some problems though, so you might not want to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It completely breaks livestreams, and probably some other things I haven’t tested</li>
<li>It causes the video player to briefly flash</li>
<li>It slows the page loading time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bypassing-the-locker-script">Bypassing the locker script</h2>
<p>So that filter kinda worked, but sometimes uBlock Origin wasn’t hooking <code>JSON.stringify</code>. I investigated further and it turns out YouTube is running an A/B test where sometimes they add this to the frontend HTML as the very first thing in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"bc-def"</span> <span>nonce</span><span>=</span><span>"[variable]"</span>&gt;<span>'use strict'</span>;<span>function</span> <span>a</span>(<span>b</span>,<span>c</span>){<span>try</span>{Object.<span>defineProperty</span>(<span>b</span>,<span>c</span>,{<span>writable</span><span>:!</span><span>1</span>,<span>configurable</span><span>:!</span><span>1</span>})}<span>catch</span>(<span>d</span>){}}<span>a</span>(window,<span>"fetch"</span>);<span>a</span>(window,<span>"JSON"</span>);<span>a</span>(window.<span>JSON</span>,<span>"stringify"</span>);<span>a</span>(window.<span>JSON</span>,<span>"parse"</span>);<span>a</span>(window,<span>"Array"</span>);<span>a</span>(Array.<span>prototype</span>,<span>"push"</span>);<span>a</span>(Array.<span>prototype</span>,<span>"forEach"</span>);<span>try</span>{<span>const</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span>document.<span>getElementById</span>(<span>"bc-def"</span>);<span>b</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>b</span>.<span>remove</span>()}<span>catch</span>(<span>b</span>){};
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This locks a few global objects by using <code>Object.defineProperty</code> to set them as non-writable, which prevents later code from overwriting them with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">Proxy</a> that alters their behaviour. So uBlock Origin can only proxy JSON.stringify if it can run before this locker script does. On Firefox this is easily resolvable - you can use a <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/ublock/wiki/static-filter-syntax#html-filters">HTML filter</a> to filter out the script tag from the source HTML before the page even starts being parsed. But that relies on extension APIs that Chromium doesn’t support.</p>
<p>The “fix” for the locker script so far is to hook <code>Object.assign</code> instead of <code>JSON.stringify</code>. <code>Object.assign</code> is another function that handles the request body before it gets fetched. It would be nice if there was a way to actually defuse the locker script, instead of working around it. The version of the filter that hooks <code>Object.assign</code> instead is more complicated because uBO’s scriptlets don’t let you replace text on a key of an object, so the filter in uBO’s filter list injects this JS:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="js"><span><span>(() =&gt; {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>const</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> {
</span></span><span><span>        <span>apply</span><span>:</span> (<span>e</span>, <span>n</span>, <span>arguments</span>) =&gt; {
</span></span><span><span>            <span>let</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Reflect</span>.<span>apply</span>(<span>e</span>, <span>n</span>, <span>arguments</span>);
</span></span><span><span>            <span>return</span> <span>3</span> <span>===</span> <span>arguments</span>.<span>length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>t</span><span>?</span>.<span>body</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>"string"</span> <span>==</span> <span>typeof</span> <span>t</span>.<span>body</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span><span>t</span>.<span>body</span>.<span>includes</span>(<span>`"isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true`</span>) <span>&amp;&amp;</span> (<span>t</span>.<span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span>.<span>body</span>.<span>replace</span>(<span>`"contentPlaybackContext":{`</span>, <span>`"contentPlaybackContext":{"isInlinePlaybackNoAd":true,`</span>)), <span>t</span>
</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>    };
</span></span><span><span>    window.Object.<span>assign</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Proxy(window.Object.<span>assign</span>, <span>e</span>)

<hr>


<p>In the spring of 1996, Brian Reynolds and Jeff Briggs took a long, hard look around them and decided that they’d rather be somewhere else.</p>
<p>At that time, the two men were working for MicroProse Software, for whom they had just completed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/01/sequels-in-strategy-gaming-part-1-civilization-ii"><em>Civilization II</em></a>, with Reynolds in the role of primary designer and programmer and Briggs in that of co-designer, producer, and soundtrack composer. They had brought the project in for well under $1 million, all that their bosses were willing to shell out for what they considered to be a game with only limited commercial potential. And yet the early sales were very strong indeed, proof that the pent-up demand for a modestly modernized successor to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-1-making-civilization">Sid Meier’s masterstroke</a> that Reynolds and Briggs had identified had been very, very real. Which is not to say that they were being given much credit for having proved their managers wrong.</p>
<p>MicroProse’s executives were really Spectrum Holobyte’s executives, ever since the latter company had acquired the former in December of 1993, in a deal lubricated by oodles of heedless venture capital and unsustainable levels of debt. Everything about the transaction seemed off-kilter; while MicroProse had <a href="https://www.filfre.net/tag/microprose/?order=asc">a long and rich history</a> and product portfolio, Spectrum Holobyte was known for <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/group/230/falcon-series/sort:date/">the <em>Falcon</em> series</a> of ultra-realistic combat flight simulators, for the first version of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/06/a-tale-of-the-mirror-world-part-3-a-game-of-falling-shapes"><em>Tetris</em></a> to run on Western personal computers, and for not a whole lot else. Seeing the writing on the wall, “Wild Bill” Stealey, the partner in crime <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/03/microproses-simulation-industrial-complex-or-the-ballad-of-sid-and-wild-bill">with whom Sid Meier had founded MicroProse</a> back in 1982, walked out the door soon after the shark swallowed the whale. The conjoined company went on to lose a staggering $57.8 million in two years, despite such well-received, well-remembered, and reasonably if not extraordinarily popular games as <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/09/x-com"><em>XCOM</em></a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/10/transport-tycoon"><em>Transport Tycoon</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/ethics-in-strategy-gaming-part-2-colonization"><em>Colonization</em></a>. By the spring of 1996, the two-headed beast, which was still publishing games under both the Spectrum Holobyte and MicroProse banners, was teetering on the brink of insolvency, with, in the words of its CEO Stephen M. Race, a “negative tangible net worth.” It would require a last-minute injection of foreign investment capital that June to save it from being de-listed from the NASDAQ stock exchange.</p>
<p>The unexpectedly strong sales of <em>Civilization II</em> — the game would eventually sell 3 million copies, enough to make it MicroProse’s best seller ever by a factor of three — were a rare smudge of black in this sea of red ink. Yet Reynolds and Briggs had no confidence in their managers’ ability to build on their success. They thought it was high time to get off the sinking ship, time to get away from a company that was no longer much fun to work at. They wanted to start their own little studio, to make the games they wanted to make their way.</p>
<p>But that, of course, was easier said than done. They had a proven track record inside the industry, but neither Brian Reynolds nor Jeff Briggs was a household name, even among hardcore gamers. Most of the latter still believed that <em>Civilization II</em> was the work of Sid Meier — an easy mistake to make, given how prominently Meier’s name was emblazoned on the box. Reynolds and Briggs needed investors, plus a publisher who would be willing to take a chance on them. Thankfully, the solution to their dilemma was quite literally staring them in the face every time they looked at that <em>Civilization II</em> box: they asked Sid Meier to abandon ship with them. After agonizing for a while about the prospect of leaving the company he had co-founded in the formative days of the American games industry, Meier agreed, largely for the same reason that Reynolds and Briggs had made their proposal to him in the first place: it just wasn’t any fun to be here anymore.</p>
<p>So, a delicate process of disentanglement began. Keenly aware of the legal peril in which their plans placed them, the three partners did everything in their power to make their departure as amicable and non-dramatic as possible. For instance, they staggered their resignations so as not to present an overly united front: Briggs left in May of 1996, Reynolds in June, and Meier in July. Even after officially resigning, Meier agreed to continue at MicroProse for some months more as a part-time consultant, long enough to see through <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/09/magic-and-loss-part-2-magic-on-the-screen">his computerized version</a> of the ultra-popular <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/09/magic-and-loss-part-1-magic-in-the-cards"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> collectible-card game. He didn’t even complain when, in an ironic reversal of the usual practice of putting Sid Meier’s name on things that he didn’t actually design, his old bosses made it clear that they intended to scrub him from the credits of this game, which he had spent the better part of two years of his life working on. In return for all of this and for a firm promise to stay in his own lane once he was gone, he was allowed to take with him all of the code he had written during the past decade and a half at MicroProse. “They didn’t want to be making detailed strategy titles any more than we wanted to be making <em>Top Gun</em> flight simulators,” writes Meier in his memoir. On the face of it, this was a strange attitude for his former employer to have, given that <em>Civilization II</em> was selling so much better than any of its other games. But Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs, and Sid Meier were certainly not inclined to look the gift horse in the mouth.</p>
<p>They decided to call their new company Firaxis Games, a name that had its origin in a piece of music that Briggs had been tinkering with, which he had dubbed “Fiery Axis.” Jason Coleman, a MicroProse programmer who had coded on <em>Civilization II</em>, quit his job there as well and joined them. Sid Meier’s current girlfriend and future second wife Susan Brookins became their office manager.</p>
<p>The first office she was given to manage was a cramped space at the back of Absolute Quality, a game-testing service located in Hunt Valley, Maryland, just a stone’s throw away from Microprose’s offices. Their landlords/flatmates were, if nothing else, a daily reminder of the need to test, test, test when making games. Brian Reynolds (who writes of himself here in the third person):</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Jeff Briggs worked the phones to rustle up some funding and did all the hard work of actually putting a new company together. Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds worked to scrape together some playable prototype code, and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of JACKAL, the engine which these days pretty much holds everything together. Office-manager Susan Brookins found us some office furniture and bought crates of Coke, Sprite, and Dr. Pepper to stash in a mini-fridge Brian had saved from his college days. We remembered that at some indeterminate point in the past we were considered world-class game designers, but our day-to-day lives weren’t providing us with a lot of positive reinforcement on that point. So, for the first nine months of our existence as a company, we clunked over railroad tracks in the morning, played Spy Hunter in the upstairs kitchen, and declared “work at home” days when Absolute Quality had competitors in the office.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once the necessary financing was secured, the little gang of five moved into a proper office of their own and hired more of their former colleagues, many of whom had been laid off in a round of brutal cost-cutting that had taken place at MicroProse the same summer as the departure of the core trio. These folks bootstrapped Firaxis’s programming and art departments. Thanks to the cachet of the Sid Meier name/brand, the studio was already being seen as a potential force to be reckoned with. Publishers flew out to them instead of the other way around to pitch their services. In the end, Firaxis elected to sign on with Electronic Arts, the biggest publisher of them all.</p>
<p>The three founding fathers had come into the venture with a tacit understanding about the division of labor. Brian Reynolds would helm a sprawlingly ambitious but fundamentally iterative 4X strategy game, a “spiritual successor” to <em>Civilization I</em> and <em>II</em>. This was the project that had gotten Electronic Arts’s juices flowing; its box would, it went without saying, feature Sid Meier’s name prominently on its box, no matter how much or how little Meier ultimately had to do with it. Meanwhile Meier himself would have free rein to pursue the quirkier, more esoteric ideas that he had been indulging in ever since finishing <em>Civilization I</em>. And Briggs would be the utility player, making sure the business side ran smoothly, writing the music, and pitching in wherever help was needed on either partner’s project.</p>
<p>Sid Meier has a well-earned reputation for working rapidly and efficiently. It’s therefore no surprise that he was the first Firaxis designer to finish a game, and by a wide margin at that. Called simply <em>Gettysburg!</em> — or rather&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/6/sid-meiers-gettysburg/"><em>Sid Meier’s Gettysburg!</em></a> — it was based upon the battle that took place in that Pennsylvania city during the American Civil War. More expansively, it was an attempt to make a wargame that would be appealing to grognards but accessible enough to attract newcomers, by virtue of being real-time rather than turn-based, of being audiovisually attractive, and of offering a whole raft of difficulty levels and tutorials to ease the player into the experience. Upon its release in October of 1997, <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine called it “a landmark, a real-time-strategy game whose unique treatment of its subject matter points to a [new] direction for the whole genre.” For my own part, being neither a dedicated grognard nor someone who shares the fascination of so many Americans for the Civil War, I will defer to the contemporary journal of record. I’m sure that <em>Gettysburg!</em> does what it does very well, as almost all Sid Meier games do. On the broader question of whether it brought new faces into the grognard fold, the verdict is more mixed. Meier writes today that “it was a success,” but it was definitely not a hit on the scale of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/11/ethics-in-strategy-gaming-part-1-panzer-general">SSI’s <em>Panzer General</em></a>, the last wargame to break out of its ghetto in a big way.</p>
<p>To the hungry eyes of Electronic Arts, <em>Gettysburg!</em> was just the appetizer anyway. The main dish would be <em>Alpha Centauri</em>.</p>
<p>The idea for&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> had been batted around intermittently as a possible “sequel to&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>” ever since Sid Meier had made one of the two possible victory conditions of that game the dispatching of a spaceship to that distant star, an achievement what was taken as a proof that the nation so doing had reached the absolute pinnacle of terrestrial achievement. In the wake of the original <em>Civilization’</em>s release and success, Meier had gone so far as to prototype some approaches to what happens after humanity becomes a star-faring species, only to abandon them for other things. Now, though, the old idea was newly appealing to the principals at Firaxis, for commercial as much as creative reasons. They had left the rights to the <em>Civilization</em> franchise behind them at MicroProse, meaning that a Firaxis&nbsp;<em>Civilization III</em> was, at least for the time being, not in the cards. But if they made a game called&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> that used many of the same rules, systems, and gameplay philosophies, and that sported the name of Sid Meier on the box… well, people would get the message pretty clearly, wouldn’t they? This would be a sequel to <em>Civilization</em> in all but its lack of a Roman numeral.</p>
<p>When he actually started to try to make it happen, however, Brian Reynolds learned pretty quickly why Sid Meier had abandoned the idea. What seemed like a no-brainer in the abstract proved beset with complications when you really engaged. The central drama of <em>Civilization</em> was the competition and conflict <em>between</em> civilizations — which is also, not coincidentally, the central drama of human history itself. But where would the drama come from for a <em>single</em> group of enlightened emissaries from an earthly Utopia settling an alien planet? Whom would they compete against? Just exploring and settling and building weren’t enough, Reynolds thought. There needed to be a source of tension. There needed to be an Other.</p>
<p>So, Brian Reynolds started to read — not history this time, as he had when working on <em>Civilization II</em>, but science fiction. The eventual manual for <em>Alpha Centauri</em> would list seven authors that Reynolds found particularly inspiring, but it seems safe to say that his lodestar was Frank Herbert, the first writer on the list. This meant not only the inevitable <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/11/controlling-the-spice-part-1-dune-on-page-and-screen"><em>Dune</em></a>, but also — and perhaps even more importantly — a more obscure Herbert novel called&nbsp;<em>The Jesus Incident</em> that wasn’t even still in print at the time. One of its author’s more polarizing creations,&nbsp;<em>The Jesus Incident</em> is an elliptical, intensely philosophical and even spiritual novel about the attempt of a group of humans to colonize a planet that begins to manifest a form of sentience of its own, and proves more than capable of expressing its displeasure at their presence on its surface. This same conceit would become the central plot hook of <em>Alpha Centauri</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I just used the word “plot.” And make no mistake about its significance. Of the threads that have remained unbroken throughout Sid Meier’s long career in game design, one of the most prominent is this mild-mannered man’s deep-seated antipathy toward any sort of set-piece, pre-scripted storytelling in games. Such a thing is, he has always said, a betrayal of computer games’ defining attribute as a form of media, their interactivity. For it prevents the player from playing her way, having her own fun, writing her own personal story using the sandbox the designer has provided. Firaxis had never been intended as exclusively “Sid Meier’s company,” but it had been envisioned as a studio that would create, broadly speaking, his type of games. For Reynolds to suggest injecting strong narrative elements into the studio’s very first 4X title was akin to Deng Xiaoping <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2022/12/30/chapter-25-the-passing-of-the-old-guard/">suggesting to his politburo</a> that what post-Cultural Revolution China could really use was a shot of capitalism.</p>
<p>And yet Meier and the others around Reynolds let him get away with it, just as those around Deng did. They did so because he had proven himself with <em>Colonization</em> and&nbsp;<em>Civilization II</em>, because they trusted him, and because <em>Alpha Centauri</em> was at the end of the day his project. They hadn’t gone to the trouble of founding Firaxis in order to second-guess one another.</p>
<p>Thus Reynolds found himself writing far more snippets of static text for his strategy game than he had ever expected to. He crafted a series of textual “interludes” — they’re described by that word in the game — in which the planet’s slowly dawning consciousness and its rising anger at the primates swarming over its once-pristine surface are depicted in ways that mere mechanics could not entirely capture. They appear when the player reaches certain milestones, being yet one more attempt in the annals of gaming history to negotiate the tricky terrain that lies between emergent and fixed narrative.</p>

<div>
<p><em>Walking alone through the corridors of Morgan Industries, you skim the security reports on recent attacks by the horrific native “mind worms.” Giant swarms, or “boils,” of these mottled 10cm nightmares have wriggled out of the fungal beds of late, and now threaten to overwhelm base perimeters in several sectors. Victims are paralyzed with psi-induced terror, and then experience an unimaginably excruciating death as the worms burrow into the brain to implant their ravenous larvae.</em></p>
<p><em>Only the most disciplined security squads can overcome their fear long enough to trigger the flame guns which can keep the worms at bay. Clearly you will have to tend carefully to the morale of the troops.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, since terror and surprise increase human casualties dramatically in these encounters, it will be important to strike first when mind-worm boils are detected. You consider ordering some Former detachments to construct sensors near vulnerable bases to aid in such detection efforts.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>Alpha Centauri</em> became a darker game as it became more story-oriented, separating itself in the process from the sanguine tale of limitless human progress that is <em>Civilization</em>. Reynolds subverted&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s original backstory about the perfect society that had finally advanced so far as to colonize the stars. In his new version, progress on Earth has not proved all it was cracked up to be. In fact, the planet his interstellar colonists left behind them was on its last legs, wracked by wars and environmental devastation. It’s strongly implied if not directly stated that earthly humanity is in all likelihood extinct by the time the colonists wake up from cryogenic sleep and look down upon the virgin new world that the game calls simply “Planet.”</p>
<hr>


<hr>

<p>Although the plot was destined to culminate in a reckoning with the consciousness of Planet itself, Brian Reynolds sensed that the game needed other, more grounded and immediate forms of conflict to give it urgency right from the beginning. He created these with another piece of backstory, one as contrived as could possibly be, but not ineffective in its context for all that. As told at length in <a href="https://ia904600.us.archive.org/20/items/alpha_centauri_books_download/Sid%20Meier%27s%20Alpha%20Centauri_%20Short%20Stories%20-%20Michael%20Ely.pdf">a novella</a> that Firaxis began publishing in installments on the game’s website more than six months before its release, mishaps and malevolence aboard the colony ship, which bore the sadly ironic name of <em>Unity</em>, led the colonists to split into seven feuding factions, each of whom inflexibly adhere to their own ideology about the best way to organize human society. The factions each made their way down to the surface of Planet separately, to become <em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s equivalent of&nbsp;<em>Civilization’</em>s nations. The player chooses one of them to guide.</p>
<p>So, in addition to the unusually strong plot, we have a heaping dose of political philosophy added to the mix; <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is an unapologetically heady game. Brian Reynolds had attended graduate school as a philosophy major in a previous life, and he drew from that background liberally. The factions’ viewpoints are fleshed out largely through a series of epigrams that appear as you research new technologies, that are attributed to whichever of the seven leaders would likely approve most of that development, with an occasional quote from Aristotle or Nietzsche dropped in for good measure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6378"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>

<p><em>Fossil fuels in the last century reached their extreme prices because of their inherent utility: they pack a great deal of potential energy into an extremely efficient package. If we can but sidestep the 100 million year production process, we can corner this market once again.</em></p>
<p><em>— CEO Nwabudike Morgan,<br>
Strategy Session</em></p>
</div>
<p>The factions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaia’s Stepdaughters, staunch environmentalists who believe that humanity must learn to live in harmony with nature to avoid repeating the mistakes that led to the ruination of Earth.</li>
<li>The Human Hive, hardcore collectivists whose only complaint about <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2022/12/16/chapter-24-the-cultural-revolution/">Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution</a> is that it didn’t go far enough.</li>
<li>Morgan Industries, hardcore capitalists whose only complaint about Ayn Rand is that she didn’t go far enough.</li>
<li>The University of Planet, STEM specialists who are convinced that scientific and technological progress alone would correct all that ails society if people would just let it run unfettered and go where it takes them.</li>
<li>The Lord’s Believers, a fundamentalist sect who are convinced that God will deliver humanity to paradise if we all just pray really hard and abide by a set of stringent, arbitrary dictates.</li>
<li>The Spartan Federation, who train their children from birth to be hardened, self-sacrificing warriors like <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2020/03/27/chapter-12-the-reforms-of-lycurgus/">the Spartans of old</a>.</li>
<li>The Peacekeepers, the closest thing to pragmatists in this rogue’s gallery of ideologues; they value human rights, democracy, dialog, and consensus-building, and can sometimes seem just as wishy-washy and ineffectual in the face of militant extremism as the earthly United Nations that spawned them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the nations that appear in <em>Civilization I</em> and&nbsp;<em>II</em>, each of the factions in&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> has a very significant set of systemic advantages and disadvantages that to a large extent force even a human player to guide them in a certain direction. For example, the Human Hive is excellent at building heavy infrastructure and pumping out babies, but poor at research, and can never become a democracy; the University of Planet is crazily great at research, but its populace has little patience for extended wars and is vulnerable to espionage. Trying to play a faction against type is, if not completely impossible for the advanced player, not an exercise for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>There is a lot of food for thought in the backstory of a ruined Earth and the foreground story of an angry Planet, as there is in the factions themselves and their ideologies, and trust me when I say that plenty of people have eaten their fill. Even today, more than a quarter-century after <em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s release, YouTube is full of introspective think-pieces purporting to tell us What It All Means.</p>
<p>Indeed, if anything, the game’s themes and atmosphere resonate more strongly today than they did when it first came out in February of 1999, at which time the American economy was booming, our world was as peaceful and open as it has ever been, and the fantasy that liberal democracy had won the day and we had reached the end of history could be easily maintained by the optimistic and the complacent. Alas, today <em>Alpha Centuari</em> feels far more believable than<em> Civilization</em> and its <em>sang-froid</em> about the inevitability of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-3-civilization-and-the-narrative-of-progress">perpetual progress</a>. These days,&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s depiction of bickering, bitterly entrenched factions warring over the very nature of truth, progressing not at all spiritually or morally even as their technology runs wild in a hundred different perilous directions, strikes many as the more accurate picture of the nature of our species. People play <em>Alpha Centauri</em> to engage with modern life; they play&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em> to escape from it.</p>
<div id="attachment_6384"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha9/" rel="attachment wp-att-6384"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6384" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha9.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6384">The original <em>Civilization</em> was ahead of the curve on <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/05/the-game-of-everything-part-10-civilization-and-the-limits-of-progress">global warming</a>, prompting accusations of “political correctness” from some gamers. Paying heed to the environment is even more important in <em>Alpha Centauri</em>, since failing to do so can only aggravate Planet’s innate hostility. The “Eo-Damage” statistic is key.</p></div>
<p>That said, we must also acknowledge that <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is disarmingly good at mirroring the beliefs of its players back at them. Many people like to read a strong environmentalist message in the game, and it’s not hard to see why. Your struggles with the hostile Planet, which is doing everything it can to protect itself against the alien parasites on its surface, is an extreme interpretation of the Gaia hypothesis about Earth, even as <em>Alpha Centauri’</em>s &nbsp;“transcendence” victory — the equivalent of&nbsp;<em>Civilization’</em>s tech victory that got us here in the first place — sees humanity overcoming its estrangement from its surroundings to literally become one with Planet.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, though, in his “Designer’s Notes” at the back of the <em>Alpha Centauri</em> manual, the one message that Brian Reynolds explicitly states that he wishes for the game to convey is a very different one: that we ought to be getting on with the space race. “Are we content to stew in our collective juices, to turn inward as our planet runs inexorably out of resources?” he asks. “The stars are waiting for us. We have only to decide that it’s worth the effort to go there.” Personally, although I have nothing against space exploration in the abstract, I must say that I find the idea of space colonization as the solution to the problem of a beleaguered Planet Earth shallow if not actively dangerous. Even in the best-case scenario, many, many generations will pass before a significant number of humans will be able to call another celestial object their permanent home. In the meantime, there is in fact nothing “inexorable” about polluting our own planet and bleeding it dry; we have the means to stop doing so. To steal a phrase from Reynolds, we have only to decide that it’s worth the effort.</p>
<p>But enough with the ideology and the politics, you might be saying — how does <em>Alpha Centauri</em> play as a game? Interestingly, Brian Reynolds himself is somewhat ambivalent on this subject. He recalls that he set aside a week just to play <em>Civilization II</em> after he pronounced that game done, so thrilled was he at the way it had come out. Yet he says that he could barely stand to look at <em>Alpha Centauri</em> after it was finished. He was very proud of the world-building, the atmosphere, the fiction. But he didn’t feel like he had quite gotten the gameplay mechanics sorted so that they fully supported the fiction. And I can kind of see what he means.</p>
<p>To state the obvious: the gameplay of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is deeply indebted to&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>. Like, really, really indebted. So indebted that, when you first start to play it, you might be tempted to see it as little more than a cosmetic reskin. The cities of <em>Civilization</em> are now “bases”; the “goody-hut” villages are now supply pods dropped by the&nbsp;<em>Unity</em> in its last hours of life; barbarian tribes are native “mind worms”; settler engineers are terraformers; money is “energy credits”; Wonders of the World are Secret Projects; etc., etc. It is true that, as you continue to play, some aspects will begin to separate themselves from their inspiration. For example, and perhaps most notably, the mind worms prove to be more than just the early-game annoyance that <em>Civilization’</em>s barbarians are; instead they steadily grow in power and quantity as Planet is angered more and more by your presence. Still, the apple never does roll all that far from the tree.</p>
<div id="attachment_6379"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha3/" rel="attachment wp-att-6379"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6379" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6379">Very early in a game of <em>Alpha Centauri</em>, when only a tiny part of the map has been revealed. Of all the contrivances in the fiction, this idea that you could have looked down on Planet from outer space and still have no clue about the geography of the place might be the most absurd.</p></div>
<p>Where&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> does innovate in terms of its mechanics, its innovations are iterative rather than transformative. An isometric view replaces <em>Civilization’</em>s top-down view; this allows you to see the topography of the landscape, which is now important, as the solar farms you use to generate energy function best at higher elevations. The most welcome improvement might be the implementation of territorial borders for each faction, drawn automatically around each cluster of bases. To penetrate the borders of another faction with your own units is considered a hostile act. This eliminates the weirdness that dogged the first two iterations of <em>Civilization</em>, which essentially saw your empire as a linked network of city-states rather than a contiguous territorial holding. No longer do the computer players walk in and plop down a city… err, base right in the middle of five of your own; no longer do the infantry units of your alleged allies decide to entrench themselves on the choicest tile of your best base. Unsurprisingly given the increased verisimilitude they yielded, national borders would show up in every iteration of the main <em>Civilization </em>series after <em>Alpha Centauri</em>.</p>
<p>Other additions are of more dubious value. Brian Reynolds names as one of his biggest regrets his dogged determination to let you design your own units out of the raw materials — chassis, propulsion systems, weapons, armor, and so on — provided by your current state of progression up the tech tree, in the same way that galaxy-spanning 4X games like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/10/master-of-magic"><em>Master of Orion</em></a> allowed. It proved a time-consuming nightmare to implement in this uni-planetary context. And, as Reynolds admits, it’s doubtful how much it really adds to the game. All that time and effort could likely have been better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>When I look at it in a more holistic sense, it strikes me that&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> got itself caught up in what had perchance become a self-defeating cycle for grand-strategy games by the end of the 1990s. Earlier games had had their scope and complexity strictly limited by the restrictions of the relatively primitive hardware on which they ran. Far from being a problem, these limits often served to keep the game manageable for the player. One thinks of 1990’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/03/railroad-tycoon"><em>Railroad Tycoon</em></a>, another Sid Meier classic, which only had memory enough for 35 trains and 35 stations; as a result, the growth of your railroad empire was stopped just before it started to become too unwieldy to micro-manage. Even the original&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em> was arguably more a beneficiary than a victim of similar constraints. By the time Brian Reynolds made <em>Civilization II</em>, however, strategy games could become a whole lot bigger and more complex, even as less progress had been made on finding ways to hide some of their complexity from the player who didn’t want to see it and to give her ways of automating the more routine tasks of empire management. Grand-strategy games became ever huger, more intricate machines, whose every valve and dial still had to be manipulated by hand. Some players love this sort of thing, and more power to them. But for a lot of them — a group that includes me — it becomes much, much too much.</p>
<p>To its credit,&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> is aware of this problem, and does what it can to address it. If you start a new game at one of the two lowest of the six difficulty levels, it assumes you are probably new to the game as a whole, and takes you through a little tutorial when you access each screen for the first time. More thoroughgoingly, it gives you a suite of automation tools that at least nod in the direction of letting you set the high-level direction for your faction while your underlings sweat the details. You can decide whether each of your cities… err, bases should focus on “exploring,” “building,” “discovering,” or “conquering” and leave the rest to its “governor”; you can tell your terraforming units to just, well, terraform in whatever way they think best; you can even tell a unit just to go out and “explore” the blank spaces on your map.</p>
<div id="attachment_6382"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha7/" rel="attachment wp-att-6382"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6382" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha7.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6382">Is the cure worse than the disease?</p></div>
<p>Sadly, though, these tools are more limited than they might first appear. The tutorials do a decent job of telling you what the different stuff on each screen is and does, but do almost nothing to explain the concepts that underlie them; that is to say, they tell you how to twiddle a variety of knobs, but don’t tell you <em>why</em> you might want to twiddle them. Meanwhile the automation functions are undermined by being abjectly stupid more often than not. Your governor will happily continue researching string theory while his rioting citizens are burning the place down around his ears. You can try to fine-tune his instructions, but there comes a point when you realize that it’s easier just to do everything yourself. The same applies to most of the automated unit functions. The supreme booby prize has to go to the aforementioned “explore” function. As far as I can determine, it just causes your unit to move in a random direction every turn, which tends to result in it chasing its tail like a dog that sat down in peanut butter rather than charging boldly into the unknown.</p>
<p>This, then, is the contradiction at the heart of&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em>, which is the same one that bothers me in <em>Civilization II</em>. A game that purports to be about Big Ideas demands that you spend most of your time engaged in the most fiddly sort of busywork. I hasten to state once again that this is not automatically a bad thing; again, some people enjoy that sort of micro-management very much. For my own part, I can get into it a bit at the outset, but once I have a dozen bases all demanding constant attention and 50 or 60 units pursuing their various objectives all over the map, I start to lose heart. For me, this problem is the bane of the 4X genre. I’m not enough of an expert on the field to know whether anyone has really come close to solving it; I look forward to finding out as we continue our journey through gaming history. As of this writing, though, my 4X gold standards remain <em>Civilization I</em> and&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion I</em>, because their core systems are simple enough that the late game never becomes completely overwhelming.</p>
<p>Speaking of&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>: alongside the questionable idea of custom-built units, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> also lifts from that game the indubitably welcome one of a “diplomatic victory,” which eliminates the late-game tedium of having to hunt down every single enemy base and unit for a conquest victory that you know is going to be yours. If you can persuade or intimidate enough of the other factions to vote for you in the “Planetary Council” — or if you can amass such a large population of your own that you can swamp the vote — you can make an inevitability a reality by means of an election. Likewise, you can also win an “economic” victory by becoming crazy rich. These are smart additions that work as advertised. They may only nibble at the edges of the central problem I mentioned above, but, hey, credit where it’s due.</p>

<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> is a marked improvement over&nbsp;<em>Civilization II</em>, which, trapped in the Windows 3.1 visual paradigm as it was, could feel a bit like “playing” a really advanced Excel spreadsheet. But <em>Alpha Centauri</em> also exhibits a cold — not to say sterile — personality, with none of the goofy humor that has always been one of <em>Civilization’</em>s most underrated qualities, serving to nip any pretentiousness in the bud by reminding us that the designers too know how silly a game that can pit Abraham Lincoln against Mahatma Gandhi in a nuclear-armed standoff ultimately is. There’s nothing like that understanding on display in <em>Alpha Centauri</em> — much less the campy troupe of live-action community-theater advisors who showed up to chew the scenery in <em>Civilization II</em>. The look and feel of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is more <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/11/the-prophet-of-cyberspace">William Gibson</a> than Mel Brooks.</p>
<p>While the aesthetics of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> represent a departure from what came before, we’re back to the same old same old when it comes to the actual interface, just with more <em>stuff</em> packed into the menus and sub-menus. I’m sure that Brian Reynolds did what he could, but it will nevertheless come off as a convoluted mess to the uninitiated modern player. It’s heavily dependent on modes, a big no-no in GUI design since the days when <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2014/02/macintosh">the Apple Macintosh was a brand new product</a>. If you’re anything like me, you’ll accidentally move a unit about ten times in any given evening of play because you thought you were in “view” mode when you were actually in “move” mode. And no, there is no undo function, a feature for which I’d happily trade the ability to design my own units.</p>
<div id="attachment_6380"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha4/" rel="attachment wp-att-6380"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6380" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha4.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6380">The exit dialog is one of the few exceptions to <em>Alpha Centauri</em> as a humor-free zone. “Please don’t go,” says a passable imitation of HAL from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. “The drones need you.” Note that this is a game in which you click “OK” to cancel. Somewhere out there a human-factors interface consultant is shuddering in horror.</p></div>
<p>As so often happens in reviews like these, I find now that I’ve highlighted the negative here more than I really intended to. <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is by no means a bad game; on the contrary, for some players it is a genuinely great one. It is, however, a sharply bifurcated game, whose fiction and gameplay are rather at odds with one another. The former is thoughtful and bold, even disturbing in a way that <em>Civilization</em> never dared to be. The latter is pretty much what you would expect from a game that was promoted as “<em>Civilization</em> in space,” and, indeed, that was crafted by the same man who gave us <em>Civilization II</em>. A quick survey of YouTube reveals the two halves of the whole all too plainly. Alongside those earnest think-pieces about What It All Means, there are plenty of videos that offer tips on the minutiae of its systems and show off the host’s skill at beating it at superhuman difficulty levels, untroubled by any of its deeper themes or messages.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably gathered from the tone of this article, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> leaves me with mixed feelings. I’m already getting annoyed by the micro-management by the time I get into the mid-game, even as I miss a certain magic sauce that is part and parcel of <em>Civilization</em>. There’s something almost mythical or allegorical about going from inventing the wheel to sending a colony ship on its way out to the stars. Going from Biogentics to the “Threshold of Transcendence” in <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is less relatable. And while the story and the additional philosophical textures that <em>Alpha Centauri</em> brings to the table are thought-provoking, they can only really be appreciated once. After that, you’re just clicking past the interludes and epigrams to get on to building the next thing you need for your extraterrestrial empire.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems to me that <em>Alpha Centauri</em> at the gameplay level favors the competitive player more than <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/the-rise-of-experiential-games">the experiential one</a>; being firmly in the experiential camp myself, this may explain why it doesn’t completely agree with me. It’s a more fiercely zero-sum affair than <em>Civilization</em>. Those players most interested in the development side of things can’t ensure a long period of peaceful growth by choosing to play against only one or two rivals. All seven factions are always in this game, and they seem to me far more prone to conflict than those of <em>Civilization</em>, what with the collection of mutually antithetical ideologies that are such inseparable parts of their identities. Suffice to say that the other faction leaders are exactly the self-righteous jerks that rigid ideological extremists tend to be in real life. This does not lend itself to peace and harmony on Planet even before the mind worms start to rise up en masse. Even when playing as the Peacekeepers, I found myself spending a lot more time fighting wars in <em>Alpha Centauri</em> than I ever did in&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>, where I was generally able to set up a peaceful, trustworthy democracy, forge strong diplomatic and trading links with my neighbors, and ride my strong economy and happy and prosperous citizenry to the stars. Playing <em>Alpha Centuari</em>, by contrast, is more like being one of seven piranhas in a fishbowl than a valued member of a community of nations. If you can find one reliable ally, you’re doing pretty darn well on the diplomatic front. Intervals of peace tend to be the disruption in the status quo of war rather than the other way around.</p>
<div id="attachment_6381"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/06/alpha-centauri/alpha5/" rel="attachment wp-att-6381"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6381" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/alpha5.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6381">The other factions spend an inordinate amount of time trying to extort money out of you.</p></div>
<p>There was always an understanding at Firaxis that, for all that&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> was the best card they had to play at that point in time from a commercial standpoint, its sales probably weren’t destined to rival those of <em>Civilization II</em>. For the <em>Civilization</em> franchise has always attracted a fair number of people from outside the core gaming demographics, even if it is doubtful how many of them really buckle down to play it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> did about as well as one could possibly expect after its release in February of 1999. (Electronic Arts would surely have preferred to have the game a few months earlier, to hit the Christmas buying season, but one of the reasons Firaxis had been founded had been to avoid such compromises.) Sales of up to 1 million units have been claimed for it by some of the principals involved. Even if that figure is a little inflated, as I suspect it may be, the game likely sold well into the high hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>By 1999, an expansion pack for a successful game like&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri</em> was almost obligatory. And indeed, it’s hard to get around the feeling that&nbsp;<em>Alpha Centauri: Alien Crossfire</em>, which shipped in October of that year, was created more out of obligation than passion. Neither the navel-gazers nor the zero-summers among the original game’s fan base seem all that hugely fond of it. Patched together by a committee of no fewer than eight designers, with the name of Brian Reynolds the very last one listed, it adds no fewer than seven new factions, which only serve to muddy the narrative and gameplay waters without adding much of positive interest to the equation; the two alien factions that appear out of nowhere seem particularly out of place. If you ask me, <em>Alpha Centauri</em> is best played in its original form — certainly when you first start out with it, and possibly forever.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the end of the second millennium saw Firaxis now firmly established as a studio and a brand, both of which would prove very enduring. The company remains with us to this day, still one of the leading lights in the field of 4X strategy, the custodian of the beloved <em>Civilization</em>…</p>
<p>Yes,&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em>. For their next big trick, Firaxis was about to get the chance to make a game under the name that they thought they’d left behind forever when they said farewell to MicroProse.</p>

<p dir="auto">We saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet the browser—where we spend our entire day—feels stuck and we're constantly fighting it. I constantly have 70+ tabs open and lose track of them. Can't AI help group or close them? Simple workflows, like "order Tide Pods from my Amazon order history," should just work with agents right now. And form-filling is another huge pain that AI should be able to solve.</p>

<p dir="auto">We know there are other browsers. Here's why Nxtscape stands out:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Chrome</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-chrome" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Chrome" href="#nxtscape-vs-chrome"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, the Chrome browser hasn't evolved much over the last 10 years and it lacks meaningful AI features (agentic automation, MCP support, ...).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Brave</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-brave" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Brave" href="#nxtscape-vs-brave"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs, and other projects. Nxtscape is <strong>laser-focused</strong> on building the best <strong>AI-powered, productivity-focused, private browser</strong>. We want to bring you latest AI features sooner, like <strong>agentic automation and integrating MCP!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Arc/Dia</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-arcdia" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Arc/Dia" href="#nxtscape-vs-arcdia"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When the company abandoned it, users were left behind. That <strong>will never happen</strong> with Nxtscape. We are <strong>100% open source</strong>. If you don't like the direction we're going, you or the community can fork the code and build your own version. Power to the people!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nxtscape vs Perplexity Comet</h3><a id="user-content-nxtscape-vs-perplexity-comet" aria-label="Permalink: Nxtscape vs Perplexity Comet" href="#nxtscape-vs-perplexity-comet"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Perplexity is a search company. Your browser history will likely be used for ad targeting eventually. We are <strong>NOT</strong> a search company. If you're switching from Chrome, choose a truly privacy-first browser instead of another data collector. Choose Nxtscape.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Acknowledgments 🙏</h2><a id="user-content-acknowledgments-" aria-label="Permalink: Acknowledgments 🙏" href="#acknowledgments-"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Nxtscape is inspired by these amazing open-source projects: <a href="https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use">browser-use</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nanobrowser/nanobrowser">Nanobrowser</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand">Stagehand</a> and of course wouldn't have been possible without <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium">Chromium</a>.

    <p>Cloth is one of the most important goods a society can produce. Clothing is instrumental for culture, expression, and for protecting one's modesty. Historically, cloth was one of the most expensive items on the market. People bought one or two outfits at most and then wore them repeatedly for the rest of their lives. Clothing was treasured and passed down between generations the same way we pass jewelry down between generations. This cloth was made in factories by highly skilled weavers. These weavers had done the equivalent of PhD studies in weaving cloth and used state of the art hardware to do it.</p>
<p>As factories started to emerge, they were able to make cloth so much more cheaply than skilled weavers ever could thanks to inventions like the power loom. Power looms didn't require skilled workers operating them. You could even staff them with war orphans, which there was an abundance of thanks to all the wars. The quality of the cloth was absolutely terrible in comparison, but there was so much more of it made so much more quickly. This allowed the price of cloth to plummet, meaning that the wages that the artisans made fell from six shillings a day to six shillings per week over a period of time where the price of food doubled.</p>
<p>Mind you, the weavers didn't just reject technological progress for the sake of rejecting it. They tried to work with the ownership class and their power looms in order to produce the same cloth faster and cheaper than they had before. For a time, it did work out, but the powers that be didn't want that. They wanted more money at any cost.</p>
<p>At some point, someone had enough and decided to do something about it. Taking up the name Ned, he led a movement that resulted in riots, destroying factory equipment, and some got so bad they had to call the army in to break them up. Townspeople local to those factory towns were in full support of Ned's followers. Heck, even the soldiers sent to stop the riots ended up seeing the points behind what Ned's followers were doing and joined in themselves.</p>
<p>The ownership class destroyed the livelihood of the skilled workers so that they could make untold sums of money producing terrible cloth that people would turn their one-time purchase of clothing into a de-facto subscription that they had to renew every time their clothing wore out. Now we have fast fashion and don't expect our clothing to last more than a few years. I have a hoodie from AWS Re:Invent in 2022 that I'm going to have to throw out and replace because the sleeves are dying.</p>
<p>We only remember them as riots because their actions affected those in power. This movement was known as the Luddites, or the followers of Ned Ludd. The word "luddite" has since shifted meaning over time and is now understood as "someone who is against technological development". The Luddites were not against technology like the propaganda from the ownership class would have you expect, they fought against how it was implemented and the consequences of its rollout. They were skeptical that the shitty cloth that the power loom produced would be a net benefit to society because it meant that customers would inevitably have to buy their clothes over and over again, turning a one-time purchase into a subscription. Would that really benefit consumers or would that really benefit the owners of the factories?</p>
<p>Nowadays the Heritage Crafts Association of the United Kingdom lists many forms of weaving as <a href="https://www.heritagecrafts.org.uk/categories-of-risk/">Endangered or Critically Endangered crafts</a>, meaning that those skills are either at critical risk of dying out without any "fresh blood" learning how to do it, or the last generation of artisans that know how to do that craft are no longer teaching new apprentices. All that remains of that expertise is now contained in the R&amp;D departments of the companies that produce the next generations of power looms, and whatever heritage crafts practitioners remain.</p>
<p>Remember the Apollo program that let us travel to the moon? It was mostly powered by the Rocketdyne F1 engine. We have all of the technical specifications to build that rocket engine. We know all the parts you need, all the machining you have to do, and roughly understand how it would be done, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ovD0aLdRUs0">we can't build another Rocketdyne F1</a> because all of the finesse that had been built up around manufacturing it no longer exists. Society has moved on and we don't have expertise in the tools that they used to make it happen.</p>
<p>What are we losing in the process? We won't know until it's gone.</p>
<h2>We're going to run out of people with the word "Senior" in their title</h2>
<p>As I've worked through my career in computering, I've noticed a paradox that's made me uneasy and I haven't really been able to figure out why it keeps showing up: the industry only ever seems to want to hire people with the word Senior in their title. They almost never want to create people with the word Senior in their title. This is kinda concerning for me. People get old and no longer want to or are able to work. People get sick and become disabled. Accidental deaths happen and remove people from the workforce.</p>
<figure><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.webp"><img alt="A meme based on the format where the dog wants to fetch the ball but doesn't want to give the ball to the human to throw it, but with the text saying 'Senior?', 'Train Junior?', and 'No train junior, only hire senior'." loading="lazy" src="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/dog-meme.jpg"></picture></a><figcaption>A meme based on the format where the dog wants to fetch the ball but doesn't want to give the ball to the human to throw it, but with the text saying 'Senior?', 'Train Junior?', and 'No train junior, only hire senior'.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the industry at large isn't actively creating more people with the word Senior in their title, we are eventually going to run out of them. This is something that I want to address with Techaro at some point, but I'm not sure how to do that yet. I'll figure it out eventually. The non-conspiratorial angle for why this is happening is that money isn't free anymore and R&amp;D salaries are no longer taxable business expenses in the US, so software jobs that don't "produce significant value" are more risky to the company. So of course they'd steal from the future to save today. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Is this how we end up losing the craft of making high quality code the same
way we lost the craft of weaving high quality cloth?</p></div></div>
<p>However there's another big trend in the industry that concerns me: companies releasing products that replace expertise with generative AI agents that just inscrutably do the thing for you. This started out innocently enough - it was just better ways to fill in the blanks in your code. But this has ballooned and developed from better autocomplete to the point where you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159068">just assign issues to GitHub Copilot</a> and have the issue magically get solved for you in a pull request. Ask the AI model for an essay and get a passable result in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>At some level, this is really cool. Like, think about it. This reduces toil and drudgery to waiting for half an hour at most. In a better world I would really enjoy having a tool like this to help deal with the toil work that I need to do but don't really have the energy to. Do you know how many more of these essays would get finished if I could offload some of the drudgery of my writing process to a machine?</p>
<p>We are not in such a better world. We are in a world where I get transphobic hate sent to the Techaro sales email. We are in a world where people like me are intentionally not making a lot of noise so that we can slide under the radar and avoid attention by those that would seek to destroy us. We are in a world where these AI tools are being pitched as the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/agentic-ai-reshapes-workforce/">next Industrial Revolution</a>, one where foisting our expertise away into language models is somehow being framed as a good thing for society.</p>
<p>There's just one small problem: who is going to be paid and reap the benefits from this change as expectations from the ownership class change? A lot of the ownership class only really experiences the work product outputs of what we do with computers. They don't know the struggles involved with designing things such as <a href="https://youtu.be/y8OnoxKotPQ">the user getting an email on their birthday</a>. They don't want to get pushback on things being difficult or to hear that people want to improve the quality of the code. They want their sparkle emoji buttons to magically make the line go up and they want them yesterday.</p>
<p>We deserve products that aren't cheaply made mass produced slop that incidentally does what people want instead of high quality products that are crafted to be exactly what people need, even if they don't know they need it.</p>
<p>Additionally, if this is such a transformational technology, why are key figures promoting it by talking down to people? Why wouldn't they be using this to <em>lift people up</em>?</p>

a lot better than hope ever will. Amygdala responses are pretty strong
right? So aren't a lot of your fears of the technology really feeding into
the hype and promoting the technology by accident?</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>I don't fear the power loom.

<h2>Vibe coding is payday loans for technical debt</h2>
<p>As a technical educator, one of the things that I want to imprint onto people is that programming is a skill you can gain and that you too can both program things and learn how to program things. I want there to be more programmers out there. What I am about to say is not an attempt to gatekeep the skill and craft of computering; however, the ways that proponents of vibe coding are going about it are simply not the way forward to a sustainable future.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Cognition teased an AI product named <a href="https://devin.ai/">Devin</a>, a completely automated software engineer. You'd assign Devin tasks in Slack or Jira and then it would spin up a VM and plod its way through fixing whatever you asked it to. This demo deeply terrified me, as it was nearly identical to a story I wrote for the Techaro lore: <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/protos/">Protos</a>. The original source of that satire was experience working at a larger company that shall remain unnamed where the product team seemed to operate under the assumption that the development team had a secret "just implement that feature button" and that we as developers were working to go out of our way to <strong>NOT</strong> push it.</p>
<p>Devin was that "implement that feature" button the same way Protos mythically did. From what I've seen with companies that actually use Devin, it's nowhere near actually being useful and usually needs a lot of hand-holding to do anything remotely complicated, thank God.</p>
<p>The thing that really makes me worried is that the ownership class' expectations about the process of developing software are changing. People are being put on PIPs for not wanting to install Copilot. Deadlines come faster because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1kchah5/they_finally_started_tracking_our_usage_of_ai/">"the AI can write the code for you, right?"</a> Twitter and Reddit contain myriads of stories of "idea guys" using Cursor or Windscribe to generate their dream app's backend and then making posts like "some users claim they can see other people's stuff, what kind of developer do I need to hire for this?" Follow-up posts include gems such as "lol why do coders charge so much???"</p>
<p>By saving money in the short term by producing shitty software that doesn't last, are we actually spending more money over time re-buying nearly identical software after it evaporates from light use? This is the kind of thing that makes Canada not allow us to self-identify as Engineers, and I can't agree with their point more.</p>
<h3>Vibe Coding is just fancy UX</h3>
<p>Vibe coding is a distraction. It's a meme. It will come. It will go. Everyone will abandon the vibe coding tools eventually. My guess is that a lot of the startups propping up their vibe coding tools are trying to get people into monthly subscriptions as soon as possible so that they can mine passive income as their more casual users slowly give up on coding and just forget about the subscription.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna lie though, the UX of vibe coding tools is top-notch. From a design standpoint it's aiming for that subtle brilliance where it seems to read your mind and then fill in the blanks you didn't even know you needed filled in. This is a huge part of how you can avoid the terror of the empty canvas. If you know what you are doing, an empty canvas represents infinite possibilities. There's nothing there to limit you from being able to do it. You have total power to shape everything.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a really effective tool to help you get past that fear of having no ground to stand on. This helps you get past executive dysfunction and just ship things already. That part is a good thing. I genuinely want people to create more things with technology that are focused on the problems that they have. This is the core of how you learn to do new things. You solve small problems that can be applied to bigger circumstances. You gradually increase the scope of the problem as you solve individual parts of it.</p>
<p>I want more people to be able to do software development. I think that it's a travesty that we don't have basic computer literacy classes in every stage of education so that people know how the machines <strong>that control their lives</strong> work and how to use them to their advantage. Sure it's not as dopaminergic as TikTok or other social media apps, but there's a unique sense of victory that you get when things just work. Sometimes that feeling you get when things Just Work™ is the main thing that keeps me going. Especially in anno dominium two thousand and twenty five.</p>
<p>The main thing I'm afraid of is people becoming addicted to the vibe coding tools and letting their innate programming skills atrophy. I don't know how to suggest people combat this. I've been combating it by removing all of the automatic AI assistance from my editor (IE: I'll use a language server, but I won't have my editor do fill-in-the-middle autocomplete for me), but this isn't something that works for everyone. I've found myself more productive without it there and asking <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/685430cf-79ec-800c-9ea2-251301066f3d">a model for the missing square peg to round hole</a> when I inevitably need some toil code made. I ended up not shipping that due to other requirements, but you get what I'm going at.</p>
<h3>The "S" in MCP stands for Security</h3>
<p>The biggest arguments I have against vibe coding and all of the tools behind it boil down to one major point: these tools have a security <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:24-27&amp;version=NIV">foundation of sand</a>. Most of the time when you install and configure a <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> server, you add some information to a JSON file that your editor uses to know what tools it can dispatch with all of your configuration and API tokens. These MCP servers run as normal OS processes with absolutely no limit to what they can do. They can easily delete all files on your system, install malware into your autostart, or exfiltrate all your secrets without any oversight.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, that whole "it's all in one JSON file with all your secrets" problem? That's now seen as a load-bearing feature so that scripts can automatically install MCP servers for you. You don't even need to get expertise in how the tools work! There's a MCP server installer MCP server so that you can say "Hey torment nexus, install GitHub integration for me please" and then it'll just do it with no human oversight or review on what you're actually installing. Seems safe to me! What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>If this is seriously the future of our industry, I wish that the people involved would take one trillionth of an iota of care about the security of the implementation. This is the poster child for something like the <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">WebAssembly Component Model</a>. This would let you define your MCP servers with strongly typed interfaces to the outside world that can be granted or denied permissions by users with strong capabilities. Combined with the concept of <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources">server resources</a>, this could let you expand functionality however you wanted. Running in WebAssembly means that the no MCP server can just read <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> and exfiltrate your SSH key. Running in WebAssembly means that it can't just connect to <code>probably-not-malware.lol</code> and then evaluate JavaScript code with user-level permissions on the fly. We shouldn't have to be telling developers "oh just run it all in Docker". We should have designed this to be fundamentally secure from the get-go. Personally, I only run MCP ecosystem things when contractually required to. Even then, I run it in a virtual machine that I've already marked as known compromised and use separate credentials not tied to me. Do with this information as you will.</p>
<p>I had a lot of respect for Anthropic before they released this feculent bile that is the Model Context Protocol spec and initial implementations to the public. It just feels so half-baked and barely functional. Sure I don't think they expected it to become the Next Big Meme™, but I thought they were trying to do things ethically above board. Everything I had seen from Anthropic before had such a high level of craft and quality, and this was such a huge standout.</p>
<p>We shouldn't have to be placing fundamental concerns like secret management or sandboxing as hand-waves to be done opt-in by the user. They're not gonna do it, and we're going to have <a href="https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-yolo-deleted-everything-in-my-computer/103131">more incidents where Cursor goes rogue and nukes your home folder</a> until someone cares enough about the craft of the industry to do it the right way.</p>
<h2>Everyone suffers so the few can gain</h2>
<p>I have a unique view into a lot of the impact that AI companies have had across society. I'm the CEO of <a href="https://techaro.lol/">Techaro</a>, a small one-person startup that develops <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/">Anubis</a>, a Web AI Firewall Utility that helps mitigate the load of automated mass scraping so that open source infrastructure can stay online. I've had sales calls with libraries and universities that are just being <em>swamped</em> by the load. There's stories of GitLab servers eating up <em>64 cores</em> of high-wattage server hardware due to all of the repeated scraping over and over in a loop. I swear a lot of this scraping has to be some kind of dataset arbitrage or something, that's the only thing that makes sense at this point.</p>
<p>And then in the news the AI companies claim "oh no we're just poor little victorian era orphans, we can't possibly afford to fairly compensate the people that made the things that make our generative AI models as great as they are". When the US copyright office <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/05/29/us-copyright-office-shocks-big-tech-with-ai-fair-use-rebuke/">tried to make AI training not a fair use</a>, the head of that office suddenly found themselves jobless. Why must these companies be allowed to take everything without recourse or payment to the people that created the works that fundamentally power the models?</p>
<p>The actual answer to this is going to sound a bit out there, but stay with me: they believe that we're on the verge of creating artificial superintelligence; something that will be such a benevolent force of good that any strife in the short term will ultimately be cancelled out by the good that is created as a result. These people unironically believe that a machine god will arise and we'd be able to delegate all of our human problems to it and we'll all be fine forever. All under the thumb of the people that bought the GPUs with dollars to run that machine god.</p>
<p>As someone that grew up in a repressed environment full of evangelical christianity, I recognize this story instantly: it's the second coming of Christ wrapped in technology. Whenever I ask the true believers entirely sensible questions like "but if you can buy GPUs with dollars, doesn't that mean that whoever controls the artificial superintelligence thus controls everyone, even if the AI is fundamentally benevolent?" The responses I get are illuminating. They sound like the kinds of responses that evangelicals give when you question their faith.</p>
<h3>Artists suffer first</h3>
<p>Honestly though, the biggest impact I've seen across my friends has been what's happened to art commissions. I'm using these as an indicator for how the programming industry is going to trend. Software development is an art in the same vein as visual/creative arts, but a lot of the craft and process that goes into visual art is harder to notice because it gets presented as a flat single-dimensional medium.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can take days to get something right for a drawing. But most of the time people just see the results of the work, not the process that goes into it. This makes things like prompting "draw my Final Fantasy 14 character in Breath of the Wild" with images as references and getting a result in seconds look more impressive. If you commissioned a human to get a painting like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/rolling-ladder-behind-us/zamqo-botw.webp"><img alt="An AI-generated illustration of my Final Fantasy 14 character composited into a screenshot of Breath of the Wild.

Generated by GPT-4o through the ChatGPT interface. Inputs were a screenshot of Breath of the Wild and reference photos of my character.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It'd probably take at least a week or two as the artist worked through their commission queue and sent you in-progress works before they got the final results. By my estimates between the artists I prefer commissioning, this would cost somewhere between 150 USD and 500 EUR at minimum. Probably more when you account for delays in the artistic process and making sure the artist is properly paid for their time. It'd be a masterpiece that I'd probably get printed and framed, but it would take a nonzero amount of time.</p>
<p>If you only really enjoy the products of work and don't understand/respect any of the craftsmanship that goes into making it happen, you'd probably be okay with that instantly generated result. Sure the sun position in that image doesn't make sense, the fingers have weird definition, her tail is the wrong shape, it pokes out of the dress in a nonsensical way (to be fair, the reference photos have that too), the dress has nonsensical shading, and the layering of the armor isn't like the reference pictures, but you got the result in a minute!</p>
<p>A friend of mine runs <a href="https://furbooru.org/">an image board for furry art</a>. He thought that people would use generative AI tools as a part of their workflows to make better works of art faster. He was wrong, it just led to people flooding the site with the results of "wolf girl with absolutely massive milkers showing her feet paws" from their favourite image generation tool in every fur color imaginable, then with different characters, then with different anatomical features. There was no artistic direction or study there. Just an endless flood of slop that was passable at best.</p>
<p>Sure, you can make high quality art with generative AI. There's several comic series where things are incredibly temporally consistent because the artist trained their own models and took the time to genuinely gain expertise with the tools. They filter out the hallucination marks. They take the time to use it as a tool to accelerate their work instead of replacing their work. The boards they post it to go out of their way to excise the endless flood of slop and by controlling how the tools work they actually get a better result than they got by hand, much like how the skilled weavers were able to produce high quality cloth faster and cheaper with the power looms.</p>
<p>We are at the point where the artists want to go and destroy the generative image power looms. Sadly, they can't even though they desperately want to. These looms are locked in datacentres that are biometrically authenticated. All human interaction is done by a small set of trusted staff or done remotely by true believers.</p>
<p>I'm afraid of this kind of thing happening to the programming industry. A lot of what I'm seeing with vibe coding leading to short term gains at the cost of long term toil is lining up with this. Sure you get a decent result now, but long-term you have to go back and revise the work. This is a great deal if you are producing the software though; because that means you have turned one-time purchases into repeat customers as the shitty software you sold them inevitably breaks, forcing the customer to purchase fixes. The one-time purchase inevitably becomes a subscription.</p>
<p>We deserve more in our lives than good enough.</p>
<h2>Stop it with the sparkle emoji buttons</h2>
<p>Look, CEOs, I'm one of you so I get it. We've seen the data teams suck up billions for decades and this is the only time that they can look like they're making a huge return on the investment. Cut it out with shoving the sparkle emoji buttons in my face. If the AI-aided product flows are <em>so good</em> then the fact that they are using generative artificial intelligence should be <em>irrelevant</em>. You should be able to replace generative artificial intelligence with another technology and then the product will still be as great as it was before.</p>
<p>When I pick up my phone and try to contact someone I care about, I want to know that I am communicating with them and not a simulacrum of them. I can't have that same feeling anymore due to the fact that people that don't natively speak English are much more likely to filter things through ChatGPT to "sound professional".</p>
<p>I want your bad English. I want your bad art. I want to see the raw unfiltered expressions of humanity. I want to see your soul in action. I want to communicate with you, not a simulacrum that stochastically behaves like you would by accident.</p>
<p>And if I want to use an LLM, I'll use an LLM. Now go away with your sparkle emoji buttons and stop changing their CSS class names so that my uBlock filters keep working.</p>
<h2>The human cost</h2>
<p>This year has been a year full of despair and hurt for me and those close to me. I'm currently afraid to travel to the country I have citizenship in because the border police are run under a regime that is dead set on either elimination or legislating us out of existence. In this age of generative AI, I just feel so replaceable at my dayjob. My main work product is writing text that convinces people to use globally distributed object storage in a market where people don't realize that's something they actually need. Sure, this means that my path forward is simple: show them what they're missing out on. But I am just so tired. I hate this feeling of utter replaceability because you can get 80% as good of a result that I can produce with a single invocation of OpenAI's Deep Research.</p>
<p>Recently a decree came from above: our docs and blogposts need to be optimized for AI models as well as humans. I have domain expertise in generative AI, I know exactly how to write SEO tables and other things that the AI models can hook into seamlessly. The language that you have to use for that is nearly identical to what the cult leader used that one time I was roped into a cult. Is that really the future of marketing? Cult programming? I don't want this to be the case, but when you look out at everything out there, you can't help but see the signs.</p>
<p>Aspirationally, I write for humans. Mostly I write for the version of myself that was struggling a decade ago, unable to get or retain employment. I create things to create the environment where there are more like me, and I can't do that if I'm selling to soulless automatons instead of humans. If the artificial intelligence tools were…well…intelligent, they should be able to derive meaning from unaltered writing instead of me having to change how I write to make them hook better into it. If the biggest thing they're sold for is summarizing text and they can't even do that without author cooperation, what are we doing as a society?</p>
<p>Actually, what are we going to do when everyone that cares about the craft of software ages out, burns out, or escapes the industry because of the ownership class setting unrealistic expectations on people? Are the burnt out developers just going to stop teaching people the right ways to make software? Is society as a whole going to be <em>right</em> when they look back on the good old days and think that software used to be more reliable?</p>
<h2>The Butlerians had a point</h2>
<p>Frank Herbert's Dune world had superintelligent machines at one point. It led to a galactic war and humanity barely survived. As a result, all thinking machines were banned, humanity was set back technologically, and a rule was created: Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind. For a very long time, I thought this was very strange. After all, in a fantasy scifi world like Dune, thinking machines could automate so much toil that humans had to process. They had entire subspecies of humans that were functionally supercomputers with feelings that were used to calculate the impossibly complicated stellar draft equations so that faster-than-light travel didn't result in the ship zipping into a black hole, star, moon, asteroid, or planet.</p>
<p>After seeing a lot of the impact across humanity in later 2024 and into 2025, I completely understand the point that Frank Herbert had. It makes me wish that I could leave this industry, but this is the only thing that pays enough for me to afford life in a world where my husband gets casually laid off after being at the same company for six and a half years because some number in a spreadsheet put him on the shitlist. Food and rent keeps going up here, but wages don't. I'm incredibly privileged to be able to work in this industry as it is (I make enough to survive, don't worry), but I'm afraid that we're rolling the ladder up behind us so that future generations won't be able to get off the ground.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem isn't the AI tools, but the way they are deployed, who benefits from them, and what those benefits really are. Maybe the problem isn't the rampant scraping, but the culture of taking without giving anything back that ends up with groups providing critical infrastructure like FFmpeg, GNOME, Gitea, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and the United Nations having to resort to increasingly desperate measures to maintain uptime.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem really is winner-take-all capitalism.</p>
<hr>
<p>The deployment of generative artificial intelligence tools has been a disaster for the human race. They have allowed a select few to gain "higher productivity"; but they have destabilized society, have made work transactional, have subjected artists to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering for the hackers that build the tools AI companies rely on, and inflict severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of this technology will worsen this situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in "advanced" countries.</p>

<p>Past studies on <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> (風の谷のナウシカ; Topcraft, 1984) have primarily focused on its ecological themes and anti-war messages through analysis of the narrative as a whole or Nausicaä’s character. These studies address the ethical and environmental consequences of war shown through the dystopian nature of the film’s setting and its religious symbolism. However, I have seen almost no research on how visual storytelling contributes to these messages.</p>
<p>This paper addresses how the visual representation of the environmental consequences of war in <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> can impact our views of those issues in our world. The paper will show that the visuals in the film are not simply aesthetic decisions, but a crucial narrative device to convey the effects of war on both people and nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, this paper explores how Miyazaki uses elements of mise-en-scène such as color, lighting, body language and other visual storytelling elements to communicate and add emphasis to the anti-war messaging of the film; especially those that display both the ecological and human consequences of war. I argue that the film’s use of visuals not only supports the anti-war themes of the film as a whole but also adds a stronger emotional and moral weight to the story by reflecting real-life war technologies in its visuals. This allowed audiences to reflect on real-life issues regarding the environmental and human consequences of warfare. In this way, the film created a bridge between fantasy and reality, urging its viewers to strive for a more peaceful and environmentally conscious world.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Animated films, like many other art forms, can convey so much emotion and be filled to the brim with meaningful messages and ideas. Especially with animation, the director is able to display a myriad of stunning visuals that can be impossible to recreate in live action film. Throughout history we as humans have used storytelling and art to reflect on and understand the world and the current issues we face. With the state of our world being as it is, with conflict at every corner, with global warming and other environmental issues being more pressing matters than ever before, it is clear that the environmental messages in <em>Nausicaä</em> are of the utmost importance to our society today. This is why it is important to ask, how can the depiction of the environmental impact of war in this film help us change our view of and approach to these issues in real life?</p>
<p>Hayao Miyazaki’s 1984 film <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind </em>follows the pacifistic and kindhearted princess of the Valley of the Wind as she navigates the apocalyptic landscape of the film, searching for a way to undo the damage caused by the wars of the past and prevent further damage in the present. Miyazaki’s filmography as a whole contains many important messages regarding the way in which humans interact with and affect the natural world. His films, including <em>Nausicaä</em>, focus on the relationships between humans and animals, exploring the imbalance between the human and natural worlds. With <em>Nausicaä</em> being the only film directed by Miyazaki that depicts a more modern style of warfare, this film could help to open people’s eyes to the damage war puts not just on the humans involved but on the environment which we all share.</p>
<p><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> was originally a manga of the same name that Hayao Miyazaki wrote for Animage, with it being released from February 1982 to March 1994. It saw great success amongst Japanese readers through its run. This prompted the manga’s adaptation into an animated film which was directed by Miyazaki and released to Japanese audiences in 1984. Due to the extreme inconsistencies between the original film and Showmen Inc.’s English dub of <em>Nausicaä </em>–renamed <em>Warriors of the Wind</em>– Miyazaki considered never releasing his films to foreign audiences again. This dub had changed the names of most characters, cut nearly 30 minutes off of the film and completely altered its message. Later, a deal was made between Studio Ghibli and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, and Miayzaki allowed them to dub his films under the condition that they make no cuts and keep the original meaning intact (Cinematheque, 2016). Because of this, Disney’s English dub will be the main focus of this paper (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, 1985).</p>
<h2>Keywords &amp; Terms</h2>
<p>For the purpose of this article, when referring to the natural world it would more specifically be described as the surrounding elements that are essential for the well-being of both human and non-human life which includes green spaces, wildlife habitats, biodiversity and clean air, water and soil. Additionally, there are several terms which one who has not watched the film would not be able to understand, and these terms are as follows.</p>
<p>The ohmu (Fig. 1) are enormous, powerful and intelligent pill bug-like animals which are feared by the people in the film due to the fact that they could be considered the kings of the toxic jungle.</p>

<p>The Toxic Jungle is a vast forest where the air, water, soil and plants are poisonous to all but the giant arthropods which inhabit it. The toxic jungle only became so poisonous after the Giant Warriors were used in the last days of the Ceramic War. The Giant Warriors (Fig. 2) are giant, biomechanical lifeforms which are treated, and act, more as weapons rather than as independent beings.</p>
<p>The Ceramic War is an apocalyptic war that occurred 1000 years before the events of the film in what was called the Ceramic Period, which destroyed civilization, caused an ecocide and created the vast Toxic Jungle during the Seven Days of Fire. The Seven Days of Fire was a seven-day period at the end of the Ceramic War in which the Giant Warriors were deployed.</p>

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<p>When analyzing Miyazaki’s films, including <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em>, often the messages regarding warfare’s effects on the natural world focus more on the direct impacts rather than the indirect ones. Additionally, many researchers look at the film from a spiritual lens with DeWeese-Boyd (2009) believing Nausicaä serves as a Christ-like figure, while both Morgan (2015) and Nunes (2021) believe that Nausicaä serves as an example of how to restore balance between humans and nature. Despite that, these authors see her role in restoring balance differently. Nunes believes that Nausicaä gave herself to nature, sacrificing her free will in order to heal the earth without personal bias. On the other hand, Morgan believes that she serves as an example of how the fragmentation between the mind, body, spirit and nature can be restored through respect and care for the natural world.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are some researchers who believe that <em>Nausicaä</em> can be used as a teaching tool, with Kleese (2024) believing that, since the film is not directly associated with any singular real-life issue but with many different events and issues, it can be used in classrooms to help children understand the importance of nature and finding a democratic solution to both environmental and political issues in a more digestible way.</p>
<p>It is no wonder the previous research on Nausicaä has such a spiritual focus, as Miyazaki’s filmography as a whole often focuses on the relationship and imbalance between humans and the natural world in a very spiritual manner. However, <em>Nausicaä</em> not only explores the direct impacts of war and other human activities, but also their indirect ramifications. Thus, this paper will hopefully fill a gap in the existing <em>Nausicäa </em>literature by analyzing the film’s messages regarding warfare’s indirect effects on the environment and how this exercise can give us insight to our real-world problems.</p>
<h2>The importance of the environment</h2>
<p>Climate change and other environmental crises such as soil and water contamination are all issues which have been recognized as important by the public eye. From everyday people to those in important positions, most can agree that the health of the natural world is important to the health and survival of life on earth. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said at the biodiversity COP in Montreal 2022, “Without nature, we have nothing” (Abbasi et al., 2023). Access to clean water is undeniably fundamental to life on Earth, be it human or not. Even with this being common knowledge, pollution has damaged water quality to a point where it is causing a rise in waterborne diseases and damaging the health of both freshwater and saltwater ecosystems (Abbasi et al., 2023). Additionally, the rising temperatures, extreme weather events, air pollution and the heightened spread of infectious diseases are just a few examples of major health issues exacerbated by climate change (Abbasi et al., 2023). As the human population grows, we see that demands on Earth’s ecosystems are becoming more unsustainable; with the way that we currently treat our environment, long-term human and non-human security are clearly at stake (dos Santos, 2024).</p>
<h2>The importance of war</h2>
<p>The ever-worsening health of our natural world impacts us in many ways. Land degradation and other environmental issues which may cause an area to be less habitable can lead to the disruption of social and economic systems. Shortages of land, shelter, food and water exacerbate poverty and the poor living conditions in many areas of the world (Anonymous, 2004), this in turn leads to mass migration and conflict over usable land and resources necessary for life (Abbasi et al., 2023). While the degradation of land can in itself cause wars to erupt between peoples disputing over the usable land, war can and has caused additional land degradation. In Afghanistan, for example, forests have been leveled and its land and farmlands polluted from the years of use of fuel, chemicals and mines during wartime (Bonds, 2015).</p>
<p>Certain practices of war have more devastating impacts on the longevity of our natural world. One poignant example of how destructive war can be to our planet can be seen in the burning of Kuwaiti oil wells that took place during the The Gulf War as a part of their scorched earth tactics. This resulted both in the soil becoming contaminated with excessive amounts of hydrocarbons and heavy metals and in the release of massive amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants into the atmosphere (Aldawsari, 2024).</p>
<h2>The importance of film</h2>
<p>Everything from the way a shot is framed to the smallest detail captured within the shot can have an effect on the viewers of a film. Displaying intense emotional imagery has been proven to have significant psychological effects on viewers. For instance, the Kuleshov effect is a famous example of how film influences viewers’ emotional perception; it has shown that point-of-view editing practices influence viewers’ emotional interpretation of neutral facial expressions in a face-scene-face sequence (Cao et al., 2024). With this in mind it is evident that the things that films show their viewers can and do impact how they view the world.</p>
<p>At the same, time films utilize the elements of mise-en-scène to convey messages to their audience. Mise-en-scène is a French term meaning what is put into a scene or frame and consists of all the visual information in front of the camera (Caprio, 2021). Understanding these elements may help understand what the director of a film wants to convey with any given scene and understand how the visuals impact the audience.</p>
<h2>Why anime?</h2>
<p>All forms of filmography are capable of affecting their audiences with the previously mentioned methods. However, animation is often able to employ visuals and different types of shots which can often be extremely difficult or expensive to replicate in live action film. Because of this and because animated films in the West are often avoidant of more serious topics, seeing as they are viewed as being only for small children, that Japanese animation, or anime, can be an immensely powerful and impactful type of filmmaking. Several studies have shown that anime can influence its audience and evoke positive changes in them (e.g., Yusof et al., 2024). With the unique perspective that anime provides, which is more provocative, tragic and contains far more complicated storylines than the ones seen in American popular cinema, anime has proven itself to be a tool for understanding the complex human–environment relationship and environmental problems (Mumcu &amp; Yılmaz, 2018).</p>
<h2>Why Miyazaki?</h2>
<p>Within the anime community Hayao Miyazaki has carved out an image for himself as a masterful director who is skilled in creating both enchanting fantasies and incredibly thought-provoking films (Mumcu &amp; Yılmaz, 2018). He is quite well renowned for his beautiful landscapes, heavy ecological themes and overall beautiful and touching storytelling. Several of his films such as <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> and even <em>Ponyo</em> feature themes of ecological imbalance as the main plot points of the films. Even those which do not have these themes quite as ingrained in the plot still have some commentary on the matter or feature more lighthearted takes on nature’s relationship with humanity. This can be seen in the stories of <em>Spirited Away</em> and <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>. Additionally, many of his films also approach themes of war and conflict, such as <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em>, <em>Porco Rosso</em>, <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> and <em>The Wind Rises</em>. This leaves only six of his fifteen films, all of which have seen great success, with no themes of interest to this paper. For this reason, it is evident that Miyazaki is a perfect choice for the subject matter of this paper.</p>
<h2>Why Nausicaä?</h2>
<p>With only six of the fifteen films Miyazaki has directed or written having no themes of interest to this paper, one may wonder what it is that makes <em>Nausicaä</em> more suitable than any of his other films. Well, though many of his films touch on environmental issues with Miyazaki even going as far as saying “I’ve come to a point where I just can’t make a movie without addressing the problem of humanity as part of an ecosystem” in an interview with Asia Pulse, May 16, 1997, not many of his films include war in the main storyline. Only five do, as mentioned above. There are only two films, <em>Nausicaä </em>and <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, that cover both environmental issues and war. The major factor which puts <em>Nausicaä</em> over <em>Princess Mononoke</em> is the setting; <em>Princess Mononoke </em>is set in Japan’s late Muromachi Period, which was characterized by rapid industrialization and frequent conflicts. On the other hand, <em>Nausicaä </em>is set in the post-apocalyptic future which bears much resemblance to our world, with some current technologies such as guns, grenades and tanks being included, as well as fictitious technologies which closely mirror real-life technologies (e.g., how the Giant Warriors function similarly to nuclear bombs).</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>As previously stated, the Kuleshov effect demonstrates that intense visuals can alter one’s interpretation of the world and this in itself proves that analysis via the elements of mise-en-scène is a viable method for breaking down <em>Nausicaä</em> with the purpose of determining how the visual depiction of the environmental impact of war can affect our view of and approach to these issues in real life. However, this isn’t the only reason mise-en-scène analysis was used within this study, since it has been used for teaching aspiring filmmakers how films communicate messages with visuals; as my question focuses on visual depictions in film, mise-en-scène analysis was perfectly suited for my project. The elements of mise-en-scène are as follows: settings and props, costume, hair and makeup, facial expressions and body language, lighting and color and lastly positioning. Each of the 38 scenes of the film were analyzed to see how these elements are utilized and what effect it can have on the audience.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>Throughout the film the elements of mise-en-scène can be seen in use in many ways. Despite the subtle differences in the amount each element is used in the different parts of the story, the overall message urges viewers to rethink their stance on warfare and its technologies, not just for the impact it directly has on humans, but also for the sake of the natural world.</p>
<h2>War technologies</h2>
<p>One example of how body language, facial expressions and color are used to push the film’s message regarding the use of war technologies can be perfectly seen in the opening credits, which appear in scene two directly after the narrator introduces the world reading aloud the words that can be seen in figure one that state “One thousand years have passed since the collapse of industrialized civilization. The Toxic Jungle now spreads, threatening the survival of the last of the human race.” Right after this is read as the credits roll a tapestry is panned over, shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p>The tapestry shows how the creation of the Giant Warriors led to the creation of the Toxic Jungle and the fall of humanity. Within this tapestry, while in the process of building the warriors they appear confident in their body language and facial expressions, they are clearly calm and all is well. However, the colors of the warrior are bright and clash with that of the people which are more muted browns rather than the bright blues reds and yellows of the warrior. This itself already sets up for the destructive and overpowering nature of the Giant Warriors before they have even been finished and this is only confirmed when they are soon after in the tapestry shown wreaking havoc on the very same people who created them. In contrast to their poised expression and way of holding themselves previously in the tapestry, here they appear to be in great distress and panic. While this on its own is a striking visual representation of how dangerous technologies can be, even to their own creators, these visuals are given new meaning when we see the Giant Warriors in actual use towards the end of the film.</p>
<p>The audience was shown the similarities between the Giant Warriors and nuclear bombs in several instances towards the end of the film; in particular, there is one which really drives home the parallels between them (Figs. 4 and 5). In this scene, the Giant Warrior is being used by the main antagonist, its form being completely fictional and bearing no resemblance to real-life technologies, with the warrior shooting a beam of light from its mouth. The explosion that this caused very closely resembles the mushroom shape of nuclear bombs. Other aspects of this scene that help to draw similarities between this fictional tool of destruction and the very real nuclear weapons we have, such as the fact that before it dies the warrior only sets off two explosions. This could be a reflection of the fact that these technologies have only seen practical use twice, once in Hiroshima and once in Nagasaki. While these parallels alone drive a case for the film’s anti-war messaging, other elements regarding the Giant Warriors in other scenes help to push this narrative as well.</p>

Screen capture from the film.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every scene which has the Giant Warrior in it, from the beginning to the end of the film, is decisively negative. Around the middle of the film there is a scene where the warrior is in a sort of incubation. The film explains that the warrior needs time to develop before it is able to be used as a war machine and walk on its own. The warrior is depicted within this scene with its colors being both muddy and bloody, with the lighting highlighting not only its strange shape but also how slimy it appears. This all helps to show how grotesque it is, even when it hasn’t started to be destructive. With the clear parallels it has to nuclear weapons, it becomes obvious from nearly every mention and appearance of the Giant Warrior that if it is so grotesque and dangerous, then nuclear weapons must be just as horrifying. This specific scene very well pushes the idea that not only is the use of nuclear weapons immoral but so too is the development of them.</p>
<p>Aside from nuclear weapons, there are other very real weapons displayed in the film that we continue to use to this day. Such weapons include machine guns, shotguns, hand grenades, flash grenades and even larger things like gunships or tanks. While nearly all of these are represented in a very realistic way, the gunships are undoubtedly designed with significant creative liberty as the bodies of these aircrafts do not resemble any real aircraft. However, this does not mean these do not give a good representation of the flaws of such technologies. For examples, see Figures 6 and 7.</p>

<p>All of the previously mentioned technologies of war are portrayed within the film in a distinctly negative way. However, this does not mean that the film means to say there is absolutely no acceptable use of such things; there are also times when these are shown to be neutral or even positive. In truth there is a strong possibility that this film means to say that these technologies themselves are not evil, but the way that we as humans interact with them can make them that way. Nausicaä herself uses her gun towards the beginning of the film to remove part of an ohmu shell and she uses flash grenades to stun an ohmu, saving Lord Yupa. In the former instance, the use of the gun is shown in a completely neutral context, with it not even being used on any living thing and with the entire scene remaining quite peaceful; even the choices of lighting and colors being brighter than other parts of the Toxic Jungle adding to the serenity of the scene. This scene shows that such things can be used without causing any harm whatsoever. In the other instance the grenades are clearly used to stun the ohmu in order to protect and reduce harm for both parties.</p>
<p>In the instances in which these technologies are used in a harmful way, the negativity of it is conveyed both in the expression of the characters witnessing it or by the colors shown in the scene. With the scene of the Giant Warrior being used towards the end of the film, the characters on both sides are clearly in shock and awe of just how destructive this technology can be. Additionally, the use of color in that scene helps in pushing just how the use of these technologies causes far more harm than good. The warrior itself is melting into this dark bloody red sludge; this nasty red is contrasted with its sharp green eyes that appear completely devoid of any sort of soul. Its visage is utterly grotesque and it remains that way till it falls apart.</p>
<p>Other technologies that are more often used in warfare today are also critiqued. Towards the end of the film conflicts arise in the Valley with the people finally fighting back against the Tolmakian forces that have been occupying their land. Prior to this, the valley is shown to be a very peaceful and beautiful place with plenty of lush greenery and farmlands; the downfall of this serene environment begins when spores are found in the forest surrounding the valley. See Figures 8 and 9 for the before and after, respectively.</p>

<p>Initially, the people mean only to use their tools to burn the spores, using fire in moderation in order to solve their problem. However, things quickly get out of hand and they realize that they have no choice but to burn the entire forest down if they don’t want the Toxic Jungle to spread into the valley. This is the first time in the film that the valley is shown with colors like black, brown and others that are associated with decay, being more prevalent than greens and other more natural or lively colors. Throughout the entire film the use of fire is heavily frowned upon with Ohbaba warning the Tolmekians of why they should not even attempt to burn down the toxic jungle and, towards the end of the film, several characters going on about why they prefer the ways of the water and the wind over the way of fire since “Too much fire gives birth to nothing. Fire can reduce a forest to ashes in a day, while it takes the water and the wind 100 years to grow one”. With this film Miyazaki is urging us to stop relying on fire to solve our problems, both in a literal and figurative sense. This is shown not just through the speech of the characters but also in the way that the scenery changes and the way the characters react to the use of excess fire.</p>
<h2>Human &amp; environmental impact</h2>
<p>In the film the human and environmental impact of human activities such as war are explored in many scenes. One example of this can be seen in one scene towards the end of the film where Nausicaä and another character, Asbel, fly into the city of Pejite together on Nausicaä’s glider (Figs. 10, 11). It had previously been occupied by the Tolmekian forces but as they fly over it, the city is desolate and run down. The film reveals that the people of Pejite baited some of the ohmu into the city and let them wreak havoc in order to drive out the Tolmekians occupying the city. The film tries to show the audience how immoral this decision was not just from the sorrowful and ashamed expressions on the faces of the Pejite refugees and Asbel, the prince of Pejite. It also shows the impact these actions have had on the fauna, as the scenery is full of deceased animals of the Toxic Jungle. Additionally, while it is apparent that the city was once livable, now the characters need to use their masks to even be able to breathe within its premises. This shows that the damage done here was severe as some buildings were broken down, lives were lost and the land has been made uninhabitable for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The Pejite use the same strategy again later in the film. In this second instance, they lure the ohmu into the Valley of the Wind in order to keep the Giant Warrior out of the hands of the Tolmekians. There were several scenes which depict this event since it is the major conflict of the film; however, since the previous scene examined focused more on the environmental impact of this act, here the focus is on the human impact. In the scene Mito, who serves sort of as the assistant to Princess Nausicaä, returns to the Valley of the Wind and informs both the people of the valley and the occupying forces of the Tolmekians of the ohmu horde heading towards them. The audience is shown in this scene how much panic and distress the news brings both to the innocent citizens of the occupied territory and to the occupying forces, who were the only real target of this attack. The expressive use of facial expression and body language in this scene helps drive home just how impactful this is, even to the people who were never meant to be a target of this attack. Another scene that comes soon after reinforces this idea, when the insects begin their attack on the valley. This scene is utter chaos, the people attempt to seek shelter and the Tolmekian soldiers who were previously standing without shelter, emboldened by their control of the Giant Warrior, now scramble seeking shelter and clearly fearing for their lives. The expressiveness of this scene comes not only from the facial expressions and body language but also from the shaky and strange positioning of the camera which gives the scene a more panicked feel. In addition, the colors were muddled and the lighting was quite dim, with sudden flashes of bright blaring light that fed into the chaotic nature of the scene. This all works to show just how impactful efforts of war can be to humans, their environment and the other creatures who share it.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Certain aspects of the method I chose when designing this project limited the results of my research. For instance, because I focused only on the visuals, my data does not take into account the role that the script, voice acting (especially the original) or soundtrack played in delivering certain messages to the audience. Additionally, while one can analyze, interpret, and hypothesize the main message(s) in the film and in each scene, it is impossible to extrapolate for all audiences. During the research process for this study, many additional questions have come up, including the following. Firstly, what effects do the audio elements of <em>Nausicaä</em> have on the audience? Secondly, can <em>Nausicaä</em> even be compared to Western religions given the fact that it was made in Japan? Lastly, how is the film interpreted by younger viewers versus older viewers?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through its stunning visual story-telling, <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> invites its audience to reconsider the toll war takes not just on people, but also the environment. With color, body language, facial expressions, and the overall environment of scenes, Miyazaki warns against the dangers of harmful technology and the moral implications of its use. From the violent and gruesome images of the Giant Warrior and destroyed landscape as a result of the use of war technology, to the depleted and unsafe landscapes and fearful gazes of terrified civilians robbed of their homes and any sense of normalcy, the film seeks to depict the enormous destructiveness that results from war. Additionally, Miyazaki’s illustrations are much more than fantasy, nodding toward the real world where parallel destruction occurs via nuclear weapons, environmental crises and modern warfare. The overarching message of the film’s visuals serves not only to paint a narrative, but to urge us to meet conflict with empathy, to protect our natural environment, and understand that it takes more courage and wisdom to find peace than to wage war. Although this data is subjective, seeing as it was based on my interpretation of the film’s visuals, it still suggests that visual storytelling has the potential to convey the ecologically damaging effects of war. Additionally, this discussion makes a contribution to the academic conversations on film, war and environmental sustainability all at the same time. Offering a visual, scene-based approach to analyzing storytelling that depicts war and environmental crisis in anime. Despite all this, further research is needed on large audience reception of these visual messages, cultural responses to these messages, or the influence auditory elements of film can have in delivering these messages.</p>

          <p>I’m Chris McCord, the creator of Elixir’s Phoenix framework. For the past several months, I’ve been working on a skunkworks project at Fly.io, and it’s time to show it off.</p>
<p>I wanted LLM agents to work just as well with Elixir as they do with Python and JavaScript. Last December, in order to figure out what that was going to take, I started a little weekend project to find out how difficult it would be to build a coding agent in Elixir.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I had it spitting out working Phoenix applications and driving a full in-browser IDE. I knew this wasn’t going to stay a weekend project.</p>

<p>If you follow me on Twitter, you’ve probably seen me teasing this work as it picked up steam. We’re at a point where we’re pretty serious about this thing, and so it’s time to make a formal introduction.</p>

<p>World, meet <a href="https://phoenix.new/" title="">Phoenix.new</a>, a batteries-included fully-online coding agent tailored to Elixir and Phoenix. I think it’s going to be the fastest way to build collaborative, real-time applications.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="whats-interesting-about-phoenix-new"><a href="#whats-interesting-about-phoenix-new" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What’s Interesting About Phoenix.new</span></h2>
<p>First, even though it runs entirely in your browser, Phoenix.new gives both you and your agent a root shell, in an ephemeral virtual machine (a <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/overview/" title="">Fly Machine</a>) that gives our agent loop free rein to install things and run programs  — without any risk of messing up your local machine. You don’t think about any of this; you just open up the VSCode interface, push the shell button, and there you are, on the isolated machine you share with the Phoenix.new agent.</p>

<p>Second, it’s an agent system I built specifically for Phoenix. Phoenix is about real-time collaborative applications, and Phoenix.new knows what that means. To that end, Phoenix.new includes, in both its UI and its agent tools, a full browser. The Phoenix.new agent uses that browser “headlessly” to check its own front-end changes and interact with the app. Because it’s a full browser, instead of trying to iterate on screenshots, the agent sees real page content and JavaScript state – with or without a human present.</p>
<h2 id="what-root-access-gets-us"><a href="#what-root-access-gets-us" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Root Access Gets Us</span></h2>
<p>Agents build software the way you did when you first got started, the way you still do today when you prototype things. They don’t carefully design Docker container layers and they don’t really do release cycles. An agent wants to pop a shell and get its fingernails dirty.</p>

<p>A fully isolated virtual machine means Phoenix.new’s fingernails can get <em>arbitrarily dirty.</em> If it wants to add a package to <code>mix.exs</code>, it can do that and then run <code>mix phx.server</code> or <code>mix test</code> and check the output. Sure. Every agent can do that. But if it wants to add an APT package to the base operating system, it can do that too, and make sure it worked. It owns the whole environment.</p>

<p>This offloads a huge amount of tedious, repetitive work.</p>

<p>At his <a href="https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?si=sR_bdu6-AqPXSNmY&amp;t=1902" title="">startup school talk last week</a>, Andrej Karpathy related his experience of building a restaurant menu visualizer, which takes camera pictures of text menus and transforms all the menu items into pictures. The code, which he vibe-coded with an LLM agent, was the easy part; he had it working in an afternoon. But getting the app online took him a whole week.</p>

<p>With Phoenix.new, I’m taking dead aim at this problem. The apps we produce live in the cloud from the minute they launch. They have private, shareable URLs (we detect anything the agent generates with a bound port and give it a preview URL underneath <code>phx.run</code>, with integrated port-forwarding), they integrate with Github, and they inherit all the infrastructure guardrails of Fly.io: hardware virtualization, WireGuard, and isolated networks.</p>
<p>Github’s <code>gh</code> CLI is installed by default. So the agent knows how to clone any repo, or browse issues, and you can even authorize it for internal repositories to get it working with your team’s existing projects and dependencies.</p>
<p>Full control of the environment also closes the loop between the agent and deployment. When Phoenix.new boots an app, it watches the logs, and tests the application. When an action triggers an error, Phoenix.new notices and gets to work.</p>
<h2 id="watch-it-build-in-real-time"><a href="#watch-it-build-in-real-time" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Watch It Build In Real Time</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://phoenix.new/" title="">Phoenix.new</a> can interact with web applications the way users do: with a real browser.</p>

<p>The Phoenix.new environment includes a headless Chrome browser that our agent knows how to drive. Prompt it to add a front-end feature to your application, and it won’t just sketch the code out and make sure it compiles and lints. It’ll pull the app up itself and poke at the UI, simultaneously looking at the page content, Javascript state, and serverside logs.</p>

<p>Phoenix is all about <a href="https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/" title="">“live” real-time</a> interactivity, and gives us seamless live reload. The user interface for Phoenix.new itself includes a live preview of the app being worked on, so you can kick back and watch it build front-end features incrementally. Any other <code>.phx.run</code> tabs you have open also update as it goes. It’s wild.</p>
<video title="agent interacting with web" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="muted" playsinline="playsinline" disablepictureinpicture="true" src="https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/assets/webjs.mp4"></video>

<h2 id="not-just-for-vibe-coding"><a href="#not-just-for-vibe-coding" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Not Just For Vibe Coding</span></h2>
<p>Phoenix.new can already build real, full-stack applications with WebSockets, Phoenix’s Presence features, and real databases. I’m seeing it succeed at business and collaborative applications right now.</p>

<p>But there’s no fixed bound on the tasks you can reasonably ask it to accomplish. If you can do it with a shell and a browser, I want Phoenix.new to do it too. And it can do these tasks with or without you present.</p>

<p>For example: set a <code>$DATABASE_URL</code> and tell the agent about it. The agent knows enough to go explore it with <code>psql</code>, and it’ll propose apps based on the schemas it finds. It can model Ecto schemas off the database. And if MySQL is your thing, the agent will just <code>apt install</code> a MySQL client and go to town.</p>

<p>Frontier model LLMs have vast world knowledge. They generalize extremely well. On stage at ElixirConfEU, I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojL_VHc4gLk&amp;t=3923s" title="">demo vibe-coding Tetris</a> on stage. Phoenix.new nailed it, first try, first prompt. It’s not like there’s gobs of Phoenix LiveView Tetris examples floating around the Internet! But lots of people have published Tetris code, and lots of people have written LiveView stuff, and 2025 LLMs can connect those dots.</p>

<p>At this point you might be wondering – can I just ask it to build a Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?</p>

<p>Yes, you can.</p>

<p>Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care about are already installed. We’re still figuring out where to take this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in my plans.</p>
<h2 id="our-async-agent-future"><a href="#our-async-agent-future" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Our Async Agent Future</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/" title="">We’re at a massive step-change in developer workflows</a>.</p>

<p>Agents can do real work, today, with or without a human present. Buckle up: the future of development, at least in the common case, probably looks less like cracking open a shell and finding a file to edit, and more like popping into a CI environment with agents working away around the clock.</p>

<p>Local development isn’t going away. But there’s going to be a shift in where the majority of our iterations take place. I’m already using Phoenix.new to triage <code>phoenix-core</code> Github issues and pick problems to solve. I close my laptop, grab a cup of coffee, and wait for a PR to arrive — Phoenix.new knows how PRs work, too. We’re already here, and this space is just getting started.</p>

<p>This isn’t where I thought I’d end up when I started poking around. The Phoenix and LiveView journey was much the same. Something special was there and the projects took on a life of their own. I’m excited to share this work now, and see where it might take us. I can’t want to see what folks build.</p>

To see her patients in Queens and Manhattan she sometimes drives across the East River a couple of times a day. The idea of paying a $9 toll each day infuriated her. Yet since the policy was actually implemented, she has changed her mind. A journey which used to take an hour or more can now be as quick as 15 minutes. “Well, this is very nice,” she admits thinking. Ms Ryan is not alone.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Meta is announcing its next pair of smart glasses with Oakley. The limited-edition Oakley Meta HSTN (pronounced “how-stuhn”) model costs $499 and is <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/">available for preorder</a> starting July 11th. Other Oakley models with Meta’s tech will be available starting at $399 later this summer. </p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">existing Meta Ray-Ban glasses</a>, the Oakley model features a front-facing camera, along with open-ear speakers and microphones that are built into the frame. After they are paired with a phone, the glasses can be used to listen to music or podcasts, conduct phone calls, or chat with Meta AI. By utilizing the onboard camera and microphones, Meta AI can also answer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667613/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-ai-detailed-responses-call-a-volunteer">questions about what someone is seeing</a> and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351013/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-translation-wearables">translate languages</a>. </p><p>Given the Oakley design, Meta is positioning these new glasses as being geared towards athletes. They have an IPX4 water resistance rating and offer double the battery life of the Meta Ray-Bans, providing 8 hours of use, along with a charging case that can power them for up to 48 hours. The built-in camera now shoots in 3K video, up from 1080p for the Meta Ray-Bans. </p><p>The new lineup comes in five Oakley frame and lens combos, all of which are compatible with prescriptions for an extra cost. The frame colors are warm grey, black, brown smoke, and clear, with several lens options available, including transitions. The limited-edition $499 model, available for order starting July 11th, features gold accents and gold Oakley <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oakley.com%2Fen-us%2Flp%2Fprizm" rel="sponsored">PRIZM</a> lenses. The glasses will be on sale in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.</p><p>Meta recently signed a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253481/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-orion-ray-bans-ai-decoder-interview">multi-year deal with EssilorLuxottica</a>, the parent company behind Ray-Ban, Oakley, and other eyewear brands.

Are you </span><em>very</em><span> profitable because you made reckless cuts? Absent context, it’s impossible to tell what a “good” margin is at all - are you a restaurant during the pandemic or a SaaS company in 2015?</span></p><p><span>As ludicrous as it sounds, this is the reality of how most companies manage engineering today. Tiny startups copy the DevOps of huge enterprises. PMs mindlessly allocate 20% of the backlog to maintenance - regardless of how much maintenance </span><em>actually</em><span> needs to be done. </span></p><p><span>This is all because </span><a href="https://blog.godfreyai.com/p/productive-teams-dont-measure-productivity" rel="">the Agile Industrial Complex</a><span> has seriously messed up the way we understand engineering, which in turn has transformed engineering management into a madhouse. </span></p><p>And AI is about to make it all much worse. </p><p><span>Because AI code gen </span><strong>absolutely excels</strong><span> at producing byproducts. </span></p><p>You can watch any number of flashy demos that show agents conjuring slick interfaces out of thin air. CEOs, founders, and investors are quick to push the narrative of human replacement. Every other LinkedIn influencer is trying to become a “one-man unicorn” - a billion-dollar company of one person, supercharged by AI.</p><p><span>I’ve written before on why </span><a href="https://blog.godfreyai.com/p/ai-a-vibe-check" rel="">the vibe is all wrong</a><span>, but the tl;dr here is that AI is </span><strong>nowhere near</strong><span> true human replacement. The things an AI can do, while amazing for a machine, are trivial in the grand scheme of a career. </span></p><p><span>Ex: Building surface-level features is the equivalent of installing a sink or toilet in a house. A machine that can do this is certainly helpful, but it doesn’t encompass the field of plumbing or construction. You still need </span><strong>someone who knows what they’re doing</strong><span> in order to operate the machine at all. </span></p><p>This should be intuitive, but the Agile Industrial Complex has scrambled the very concept of engineering work. </p><p>Imagine if you believed that the work of building a house were a series of disconnected tasks - ex: wallpapering, installing toilets, and putting in new cabinets. Now imagine an AI machine that could do all of this for free, instantly. </p><p>Best of all, you don’t need to go through your very human, very expensive, (and often grumpy) contractor. You don’t need to negotiate on timelines, pricing, and specs. You don’t need to hear some tirade on “structural integrity” when you just want to try a new paint color. </p><p>Instead, you get to work with an ever-obliging AI agent who delivers endless permutations of anything you could ask for. Frictionless, free, and seemingly miraculous. You’ve long forgotten a simple truth:</p><p><span>Decorating is only possible if you have </span><strong>a standing structure </strong><span>to work with. </span></p><p>So you fire your expensive, grumpy human team and request larger and larger additions from your AI: a new guestroom, built-ins, and a walk-in closet. </p><p>You feel great, until…you realize that your new powder room doesn’t have running water; it was never connected to the water main. </p><p>You ask the AI to fix it. In doing so, it breaks the plumbing in the kitchen. It can’t tell you why because it doesn’t know. Neural systems are inherently black boxes; they can’t recognize their own hallucinations and gaps in logic. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png" width="750" height="375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Artificial hallucinations - what's real? - Bosch Digital Blog&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Artificial hallucinations - what's real? - Bosch Digital Blog" title="Artificial hallucinations - what's real? - Bosch Digital Blog" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ce5d674-b039-4583-98a0-7a3bd3a0440a_750x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>AI hallucinations usually look just fine at first blush because </span><strong>the AI understands and presents them as fact. </strong><span>You need expertise to identify these fault lines before the AI builds upon them.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>There’s no “undo” button.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<hr>
<img src="https://t3x.org/klong/klong.png" alt="Klong Logo">


<h2>A Simple Array Language</h2>

<p><big><a href="https://t3x.org/klong/book.html">The Klong Book</a></big>
</p>

<p><a href="#docs">Documentation</a> | <a href="#dl">Download</a>
</p>

<p>Klong is an array language, like K, but without the <a href="https://t3x.org/klong/ambiguity.html">ambiguity</a>. If
you know K or APL, you may be disappointed by Klong. If you don't
know any array languages, it might explode your brain. Use at your
own risk!
</p>

<h2>Programming in Klong</h2>

<p>A Klong program is a set of functions that use various pre-defined
operators to manipulate lists (vectors) and (multi-dimensional)
arrays. Here is a program that checks whether a number <em>x</em> is prime
(for <em>x&gt;2</em>):
</p>

<pre>{&amp;/x!:\2+!_x^1%2}
</pre>

<p>Note that Klong is a mathematical notation rather than a programming
language. If you try to use it like your favorite functional/procedural/OO
programming language, you will only get frustrated. Here's an
<a href="https://t3x.org/klong/prime.html">explanation of the above program</a>.
</p>

<a name="docs"></a>
<h2>Learn More About Klong</h2>

<p>The Reference Manual (<a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong-ref.txt.html">klong-ref.txt</a>) provides a complete and detailed
semi-formal description of the Klong language. It is probably the
best starting point for exploring Klong.
</p>

<p><a href="https://t3x.org/klong/book.html">An Introduction to Array Programming in Klong</a> is a book
that offers a detailed explanation of problem solving in Klong and
array languages in general.
</p>

<p>The Quick Reference (<a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong-qref.txt.html">klong-qref.txt</a>) summarizes the syntax and
semantics of the language. It will probably only make sense if you
already know K or APL.
</p>

<p>Then there is a Really Short Introduction to Klong (<a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong-intro.txt.html">klong-intro.txt</a>),
which you might want to read if you have never used an array language
before.
</p>

<p>Finally, if you already know K, here is a (probably incomplete)
summary of differences between Klong and K: <a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong-vs-k.txt.html">klong-vs-k.txt</a>.
</p>

<a name="dl"></a>
<h2>Compiling and Installing Klong</h2>

<p>You can download Klong here: <a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong20221212.tgz">klong20221212.tgz</a> (~170KB, recent changes).
</p>

<p>Just in case, here are the previous stable versions: <a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong20190926.tgz">klong20190926.tgz</a>
(~156KB), <a href="https://t3x.org/klong/klong20171119.tgz">klong20171119.tgz</a> (~120KB, old syntax).
</p>

<p>Klong is written in pure ANSI C (C99), so it should compile on any
system providing a C compiler. Just run make and make test. It also
compiles natively on Plan 9!
</p>

<p>To install Klong, just copy the <code>kg</code> binary to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> or some
similar place and point the <code>KLONGPATH</code> environment variable to the
<code>lib/</code> directory of the Klong source tree.
</p>

<p>Files ending in <code>.kg</code> are Klong programs, you can load them with
<code>]lname</code> or <code>./kg -l name</code> (with or without the suffix).
</p>

<p>Good luck!
</p>

<h2>KlongPy</h2>

<p>In case my Klong interpreter is not fast enough for you, Brian
Gurraci has created a vectorized version of Klong named KlongPy.
You can find it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/briangu/klongpy">https://github.com/briangu/klongpy</a>

    <p>Physicist Francis Perrin sat at a nuclearfuel-processing plant down in the south of France, thinking to himself: “This cannot be possible.” It was 1972. On the one hand, there was a dark piece of radioactive natural uranium ore, extracted from a mine in Africa. On the other, accepted scientific data about the constant ratio of radioactive uranium in ore.</p>
<p>Examination of this high-grade ore from a mine in Gabon was found to contain a lower proportion of uranium-235 (U-235) — the fissile sort. Only a tiny bit less, but enough to make the researchers sit back and scratch their heads.</p>
<p>The physicists’ first, logical response to such an unusual ratio of U-235 was that this was not natural uranium. All natural uranium today contains 0.720% of U-235. If you were to extract it from the Earth’s crust, or from rocks from the moon or in meteorites, that’s what you would find. But that bit of rock from Oklo contained only 0.717%.</p>
<p>What did this mean? At first, all the physicists could think of was that the uranium ore had gone through artificial fission, i.e.&nbsp;that some of the U-235 isotopes had been forced to split in a nuclear chain reaction. This could explain why the ratio was lower than normal.</p>
<p>But after complementary analyses, Perrin and his peers confirmed that the uranium ore was completely natural. Even more bedazzling, they discovered a footprint of fission products in the ore. The conclusion: the uranium ore was natural and had gone through fission. There was only one possible explanation — the rock was evidence of natural fission that occurred over two billion years ago.</p>
<p>“After more studies, including on-site examinations, they discovered that the uranium ore had gone through fission on its own,” said Ludovic Ferrière, curator of the rock collection at Vienna’s Natural History Museum, where a part of the curious rock will be presented to the public in 2019. “There was no other explanation.”</p>
<p>For such a phenomenon to have happened naturally, these uranium deposits in western Equatorial Africa must have had to contain a critical mass of U-235 to start the reaction. Back in those days, they did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A second contributing factor was that, for a nuclear chain reaction to happen and be maintained, there needed to be a moderator. In this case: water. Without water to slow the neutrons down, controlled fission would not have been possible. The atoms would simply not have split.</p>
<p>“Like in a man-made light-water nuclear reactor, the fission reactions, without anything to slow down the neutrons, to moderate them, simply stop,” said Peter Woods, team leader in charge of uranium production at the IAEA. “The water acted in Oklo as a moderator, absorbing the neutrons, controlling the chain reaction.”</p>
<p>The specific geological context in what today is Gabon also helped. The chemical concentrations of total uranium (including U-235) were high enough, and the individual deposits thick and large enough. And, lastly, Oklo managed to survive the passing of time. Experts suspect there may have been other such natural reactors in the world, but these must have been destroyed by geological processes, eroded away or subducted — &nbsp;or simply not yet found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s what makes it so fascinating: that &nbsp;the circumstances of time, geology, water came together for this to happen at all,” Woods said. “And that it was preserved until today. The detective story has been successfully solved.”</p>

      <p>Homelessness in America has reached crisis levels, and I am determined to do everything in my power to fix the problem as long as it doesn’t involve changing zoning laws or my ability to drive alone to work or, well, changing anything, really. I’m more than happy to give a hungry man a sandwich once a year and then brag to my friends about it as long as he doesn’t sit down anywhere in my line of sight to eat it. Same goes for hungry women because I’m also a feminist.</p>
<p>This is so important because everyone should have a bed to sleep in at night, and also, nothing destroys property values faster than a desperate person on a sidewalk asking for change. I’m not saying I don’t care about human suffering; I just care much, much more about my immediate self-interest because I’m the kind of person who contributes to society by starting companies that leverage technology to build smart tea kettles that brew themselves while you sleep at night. I’m a fucking innovator.</p>
<p>I’m innovating for win-win-whatever solutions where I win, my community wins, and we do whatever to get rid of homelessness. Fixing the problem means lots of things: letters to the editor of my local newspaper, bombastic statements to the press that will make the fruit of my loins cringe for generations, and especially writing vaguely discriminatory, definitely ugly posts on social media about the crisis as it unfolds in my community. Also, I call the police a lot.</p>
<p>Ending homelessness doesn’t mean building more homes because this town is full of homes already, especially mine, which is a single-family mini-mansion on an acre lot that I inherited from my parents and/or managed to purchase with the kind of job and bank terms and economic equality that don’t exist anymore for anyone and only ever really existed for well-educated white Americans. Either that or it’s a magnificent luxury condo with expansive views that I don’t want marred by more luxury condos or—god forbid—affordable housing.</p>
<p>Every room in my Instagram-worthy abode is either filled with clutter or rented out nightly to hipsters from another gentrified, monotone city also suffering from a homelessness crisis—this is a national epidemic, after all. I’m a good person, a generous person, and what made me the person I am is having to work hard for everything my parents gave me, and everything I will, in turn, give to my children.</p>
<p>Listen, I know that the unholy concentration of wealth in America is a big, big problem, but so is having to constantly say no to people asking for change as I whizz into Whole Foods in my Tesla or Prius (depending on how my startup investments pan out). What’s the point of having all this money if I have to feel bad about it? Also, has anyone actually verified that the homeless people claiming to be veterans aren’t just pulling some elaborate fraud? I’ve never actually met a veteran and I forget for, like, decades at a time that the military even exists because the bubble of privilege where I reside is literally impregnable, but I’m suspicious nonetheless.</p>
<p>I know we need more housing, but I was here first, and I’m not giving up even one blade of grass on my water-guzzling, pesticide-leaching lawn or a single burner on my twelve-burner Viking range that I never actually use to house another human soul. Tough luck, homeless people. You and your allies can call me names, but I won’t hear you over the lushness of my climate-inappropriate rose bushes and the stucco walls I’m paying some desperate immigrant under the table to build for me on the cheap before I low-key call <span>ICE</span> and have them deported.</p>
<p>Look, if you give people homes, the next thing you know, they’re going to start to get their lives together and then get jobs and start organizing. Then they’ll expand Medicare to everyone and build a fucking light rail line instead of a goddamn border wall, and no one will drive anymore, and cars will die out, and the air will get clean, and can you imagine the problems we’ll have then?</p>
<p>No. Stop it with the new housing; I’d rather have a homeless crisis.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="right">
                                <p><b>I built this guide because I could never quite wrap my head around Makefiles.</b> They seemed awash with hidden rules and esoteric symbols, and asking simple questions didn’t yield simple answers. To solve this, I sat down for several weekends and read everything I could about Makefiles. I've condensed the most critical knowledge into this guide. Each topic has a brief description and a self contained example that you can run yourself.</p>
<p>If you mostly understand Make, consider checking out the <a href="#makefile-cookbook">Makefile Cookbook</a>, which has a template for medium sized projects with ample comments about what each part of the Makefile is doing.</p>
<p>Good luck, and I hope you are able to slay the confusing world of Makefiles!</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<h2 id="why-do-makefiles-exist">Why do Makefiles exist?</h2>
<p>Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make. Make can also be used beyond compilation too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed. This tutorial will focus on the C/C++ compilation use case.</p>
<p>Here's an example dependency graph that you might build with Make. If any file's dependencies changes, then the file will get recompiled:</p>
<p><img src="https://makefiletutorial.com/assets/dependency_graph.png">
</p>

<h2 id="what-alternatives-are-there-to-make">What alternatives are there to Make?</h2>
<p>Popular C/C++ alternative build systems are <a href="https://scons.org/">SCons</a>, <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, and <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a>. Some code editors like <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio</a> have their own built in build tools. For Java, there's <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html">Maven</a>, and <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>. Other languages like Go, Rust, and TypeScript have their own build tools.</p>
<p>Interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, and raw Javascript don't require an analogue to Makefiles. The goal of Makefiles is to compile whatever files need to be compiled, based on what files have changed. But when files in interpreted languages change, nothing needs to get recompiled. When the program runs, the most recent version of the file is used.</p>
<h2 id="the-versions-and-types-of-make">The versions and types of Make</h2>
<p>There are a variety of implementations of Make, but most of this guide will work on whatever version you're using. However, it's specifically written for GNU Make, which is the standard implementation on Linux and MacOS. All the examples work for Make versions 3 and 4, which are nearly equivalent other than some esoteric differences.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-examples">Running the Examples</h2>
<p>To run these examples, you'll need a terminal and "make" installed. For each example, put the contents in a file called <code>Makefile</code>, and in that directory run the command <code>make</code>. Let's start with the simplest of Makefiles:</p>
<pre><code><span>hello:</span>
	echo <span>"Hello, World"</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Makefiles <strong>must</strong> be indented using TABs and not spaces or <code>make</code> will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the output of running the above example:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> make</span>
echo "Hello, World"
Hello, World</code></pre>
<p>That's it! If you're a bit confused, here's a video that goes through these steps, along with describing the basic structure of Makefiles.</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2 id="makefile-syntax">Makefile Syntax</h2>
<p>A Makefile consists of a set of <em>rules</em>. A rule generally looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>targets: prerequisites</span>
	command
	command
	command</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <em>targets</em> are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.</li>
<li>The <em>commands</em> are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These <em>need to start with a tab character</em>, not spaces.</li>
<li>The <em>prerequisites</em> are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called <em>dependencies</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-essence-of-make">The essence of Make</h2>
<p>Let's start with a hello world example:</p>
<pre><code><span>hello:</span>
	echo <span>"Hello, World"</span>
	echo <span>"This line will print if the file hello does not exist."</span></code></pre>
<p>There's already a lot to take in here. Let's break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have one <em>target</em> called <code>hello</code></li>
<li>This target has two <em>commands</em></li>
<li>This target has no <em>prerequisites</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We'll then run <code>make hello</code>. As long as the <code>hello</code> file does not exist, the commands will run. If <code>hello</code> does exist, no commands will run.</p>
<p>It's important to realize that I'm talking about <code>hello</code> as both a <em>target</em> and a <em>file</em>. That's because the two are directly tied together. Typically, when a target is run (aka when the commands of a target are run), the commands will create a file with the same name as the target. In this case, the <code>hello</code> <em>target</em> does not create the <code>hello</code> <em>file</em>.</p>
<p>Let's create a more typical Makefile - one that compiles a single C file. But before we do, make a file called <code>blah.c</code> that has the following contents:</p>
<pre><code><span>// blah.c</span>
<span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> </span>{ <span>return</span> <span>0</span>; }</code></pre>
<p>Then create the Makefile (called <code>Makefile</code>, as always):</p>
<pre><code><span>blah:</span>
	cc blah.c -o blah</code></pre>
<p>This time, try simply running <code>make</code>. Since there's no target supplied as an argument to the <code>make</code> command, the first target is run. In this case, there's only one target (<code>blah</code>). The first time you run this, <code>blah</code> will be created. The second time, you'll see <code>make: 'blah' is up to date</code>. That's because the <code>blah</code> file already exists. But there's a problem: if we modify <code>blah.c</code> and then run <code>make</code>, nothing gets recompiled.</p>
<p>We solve this by adding a prerequisite:</p>
<pre><code><span>blah: blah.c</span>
	cc blah.c -o blah</code></pre>
<p>When we run <code>make</code> again, the following set of steps happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first target is selected, because the first target is the default target</li>
<li>This has a prerequisite of <code>blah.c</code></li>
<li>Make decides if it should run the <code>blah</code> target. It will only run if <code>blah</code> doesn't exist, or <code>blah.c</code> is <em>newer than</em> <code>blah</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This last step is critical, and is the <strong>essence of make</strong>. What it's attempting to do is decide if the prerequisites of <code>blah</code> have changed since <code>blah</code> was last compiled. That is, if <code>blah.c</code> is modified, running <code>make</code> should recompile the file. And conversely, if <code>blah.c</code> has not changed, then it should not be recompiled.</p>
<p>To make this happen, it uses the filesystem timestamps as a proxy to determine if something has changed. This is a reasonable heuristic, because file timestamps typically will only change if the files are
modified. But it's important to realize that this isn't always the case. You could, for example, modify a file, and then change the modified timestamp of that file to something old. If you did, Make would incorrectly guess that the file hadn't changed and thus could be ignored.</p>
<p>Whew, what a mouthful. <strong>Make sure that you understand this. It's the crux of Makefiles, and might take you a few minutes to properly understand</strong>. Play around with the above examples or watch the video above if things are still confusing.</p>
<h2 id="more-quick-examples">More quick examples</h2>
<p>The following Makefile ultimately runs all three targets. When you run <code>make</code> in the terminal, it will build a program called <code>blah</code> in a series of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make selects the target <code>blah</code>, because the first target is the default target</li>
<li><code>blah</code> requires <code>blah.o</code>, so make searches for the <code>blah.o</code> target</li>
<li><code>blah.o</code> requires <code>blah.c</code>, so make searches for the <code>blah.c</code> target</li>
<li><code>blah.c</code> has no dependencies, so the <code>echo</code> command is run</li>
<li>The <code>cc -c</code> command is then run, because all of the <code>blah.o</code> dependencies are finished</li>
<li>The top <code>cc</code> command is run, because all the <code>blah</code> dependencies are finished</li>
<li>That's it: <code>blah</code> is a compiled c program</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>blah: blah.o</span>
	cc blah.o -o blah <span># Runs third</span>

<span>blah.o: blah.c</span>
	cc -c blah.c -o blah.o <span># Runs second</span>

<span># Typically blah.c would already exist, but I want to limit any additional required files</span>
<span>blah.c:</span>
	echo <span>"int main() { return 0; }"</span> &gt; blah.c <span># Runs first</span></code></pre>
<p>If you delete <code>blah.c</code>, all three targets will be rerun. If you edit it (and thus change the timestamp to newer than <code>blah.o</code>), the first two targets will run. If you run <code>touch blah.o</code> (and thus change the timestamp to newer than <code>blah</code>), then only the first target will run. If you change nothing, none of the targets will run. Try it out!</p>
<p>This next example doesn't do anything new, but is nontheless a good additional example. It will always run both targets, because <code>some_file</code> depends on <code>other_file</code>, which is never created.</p>
<pre><code><span>some_file: other_file</span>
	echo <span>"This will always run, and runs second"</span>
	touch some_file

<span>other_file:</span>
	echo <span>"This will always run, and runs first"</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="make-clean">Make clean</h2>
<p><code>clean</code> is often used as a target that removes the output of other targets, but it is not a special word in Make. You can run <code>make</code> and <code>make clean</code> on this to create and delete <code>some_file</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>clean</code> is doing two new things here:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a target that is not first (the default), and not a prerequisite. That means it'll never run unless you explicitly call <code>make clean</code></li>
<li>It's not intended to be a filename. If you happen to have a file named <code>clean</code>, this target won't run, which is not what we want. See <code>.PHONY</code> later in this tutorial on how to fix this</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>some_file: </span>
	touch some_file

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f some_file</code></pre>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Variables can only be strings. You'll typically want to use <code>:=</code>, but <code>=</code> also works. See <a href="#variables-pt-2">Variables Pt 2</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of using variables:</p>
<pre><code>files := file1 file2
<span>some_file: <span>$(files)</span></span>
	echo <span>"Look at this variable: "</span> <span>$(files)</span>
	touch some_file

<span>file1:</span>
	touch file1
<span>file2:</span>
	touch file2

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f file1 file2 some_file</code></pre>
<p>Single or double quotes have no meaning to Make. They are simply characters that are assigned to the variable. Quotes <em>are</em> useful to shell/bash, though, and you need them in commands like <code>printf</code>. In this example, the two commands behave the same:</p>
<pre><code>a := one two<span># a is set to the string "one two"</span>
b := 'one two' <span># Not recommended. b is set to the string "'one two'"</span>
<span>all:</span>
	printf '$a'
	printf $b</code></pre>
<p>Reference variables using either <code>${}</code> or <code>$()</code></p>
<pre><code>x := dude

<span>all:</span>
	echo <span>$(x)</span>
	echo ${x}

	<span># Bad practice, but works</span>
	echo $x </code></pre>
<h2 id="targets">Targets</h2>
<h2 id="the-all-target">The all target</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.4) -->
<p>Making multiple targets and you want all of them to run? Make an <code>all</code> target.
Since this is the first rule listed, it will run by default if <code>make</code> is called without specifying a target.</p>
<pre><code><span>all: one two three</span>

<span>one:</span>
	touch one
<span>two:</span>
	touch two
<span>three:</span>
	touch three

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f one two three
</code></pre>
<h2 id="multiple-targets">Multiple targets</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.8) -->
<p>When there are multiple targets for a rule, the commands will be run for each target. <code>$@</code> is an <a href="#automatic-variables">automatic variable</a> that contains the target name.</p>
<pre><code><span>all: f1.o f2.o</span>

f1.o f2.o:
	echo <span>$@</span>
<span># Equivalent to:</span>
<span># f1.o:</span>
<span>#	 echo f1.o</span>
<span># f2.o:</span>
<span>#	 echo f2.o</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="automatic-variables-and-wildcards">Automatic Variables and Wildcards</h2>
<h2 id="-wildcard">* Wildcard</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.2) -->
<p>Both <code>*</code> and <code>%</code> are called wildcards in Make, but they mean entirely different things. <code>*</code> searches your filesystem for matching filenames. I suggest that you always wrap it in the <code>wildcard</code> function, because otherwise you may fall into a common pitfall described below.</p>
<pre><code><span># Print out file information about every .c file</span>
<span>print: $(wildcard *.c)</span>
	ls -la  <span>$?</span></code></pre>
<p><code>*</code> may be used in the target, prerequisites, or in the <code>wildcard</code> function.</p>
<p>Danger: <code>*</code> may not be directly used in a variable definitions</p>
<p>Danger: When <code>*</code> matches no files, it is left as it is (unless run in the <code>wildcard</code> function)</p>
<pre><code>thing_wrong := *.o <span># Don't do this! '*' will not get expanded</span>
thing_right := <span>$(<span>wildcard</span> *.o)</span>

<span>all: one two three four</span>

<span># Fails, because $(thing_wrong) is the string "*.o"</span>
<span>one: <span>$(thing_wrong)</span></span>

<span># Stays as *.o if there are no files that match this pattern :(</span>
<span>two: *.o </span>

<span># Works as you would expect! In this case, it does nothing.</span>
<span>three: <span>$(thing_right)</span></span>

<span># Same as rule three</span>
<span>four: $(wildcard *.o)</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="-wildcard-1">% Wildcard</h2>
<p><code>%</code> is really useful, but is somewhat confusing because of the variety of situations it can be used in.</p>
<ul>
<li>When used in "matching" mode, it matches one or more characters in a string. This match is called the stem.</li>
<li>When used in "replacing" mode, it takes the stem that was matched and replaces that in a string.</li>
<li><code>%</code> is most often used in rule definitions and in some specific functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>See these sections on examples of it being used:</p>

<h2 id="automatic-variables">Automatic Variables</h2>
<!--  (Section 10.5) -->
<p>There are many <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html">automatic variables</a>, but often only a few show up:</p>
<pre><code><span>hey: one two</span>
	<span># Outputs "hey", since this is the target name</span>
	echo <span>$@</span>

	<span># Outputs all prerequisites newer than the target</span>
	echo <span>$?</span>

	<span># Outputs all prerequisites</span>
	echo <span>$^</span>

	<span># Outputs the first prerequisite</span>
	echo <span>$&lt;</span>

	touch hey

<span>one:</span>
	touch one

<span>two:</span>
	touch two

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f hey one two
</code></pre>
<h2 id="fancy-rules">Fancy Rules</h2>
<h2 id="implicit-rules">Implicit Rules</h2>
<!--  (Section 10) -->
<p>Make loves c compilation. And every time it expresses its love, things get confusing. Perhaps the most confusing part of Make is the magic/automatic rules that are made. Make calls these "implicit" rules. I don't personally agree with this design decision, and I don't recommend using them, but they're often used and are thus useful to know. Here's a list of implicit rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling a C program: <code>n.o</code> is made automatically from <code>n.c</code> with a command of the form <code>$(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@</code></li>
<li>Compiling a C++ program: <code>n.o</code> is made automatically from <code>n.cc</code> or <code>n.cpp</code> with a command of the form <code>$(CXX) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) $^ -o $@</code></li>
<li>Linking a single object file: <code>n</code> is made automatically from <code>n.o</code> by running the command <code>$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $^ $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS) -o $@</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The important variables used by implicit rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CC</code>: Program for compiling C programs; default <code>cc</code></li>
<li><code>CXX</code>: Program for compiling C++ programs; default <code>g++</code></li>
<li><code>CFLAGS</code>: Extra flags to give to the C compiler</li>
<li><code>CXXFLAGS</code>: Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler</li>
<li><code>CPPFLAGS</code>: Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor</li>
<li><code>LDFLAGS</code>: Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how we can now build a C program without ever explicitly telling Make how to do the compilation:</p>
<pre><code>CC = gcc <span># Flag for implicit rules</span>
CFLAGS = -g <span># Flag for implicit rules. Turn on debug info</span>

<span># Implicit rule #1: blah is built via the C linker implicit rule</span>
<span># Implicit rule #2: blah.o is built via the C compilation implicit rule, because blah.c exists</span>
<span>blah: blah.o</span>

<span>blah.c:</span>
	echo <span>"int main() { return 0; }"</span> &gt; blah.c

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f blah*</code></pre>
<h2 id="static-pattern-rules">Static Pattern Rules</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.10) -->
<p>Static pattern rules are another way to write less in a Makefile. Here's their syntax:</p>
<pre><code><span>targets...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...</span>
   commands</code></pre>
<p>The essence is that the given <code>target</code> is matched by the <code>target-pattern</code> (via a <code>%</code> wildcard). Whatever was matched is called the <em>stem</em>. The stem is then substituted into the <code>prereq-pattern</code>, to generate the target's prereqs.</p>
<p>A typical use case is to compile <code>.c</code> files into <code>.o</code> files. Here's the <em>manual way</em>:</p>
<pre><code>objects = foo.o bar.o all.o
<span>all: <span>$(objects)</span></span>
	<span>$(CC)</span> <span>$^</span> -o all

<span>foo.o: foo.c</span>
	<span>$(CC)</span> -c foo.c -o foo.o

<span>bar.o: bar.c</span>
	<span>$(CC)</span> -c bar.c -o bar.o

<span>all.o: all.c</span>
	<span>$(CC)</span> -c all.c -o all.o

<span>all.c:</span>
	echo <span>"int main() { return 0; }"</span> &gt; all.c

<span># Note: all.c does not use this rule because Make prioritizes more specific matches when there is more than one match.</span>
<span>%.c:</span>
	touch <span>$@</span>

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f *.c *.o all</code></pre>
<p>Here's the more <em>efficient way</em>, using a static pattern rule:</p>
<pre><code>objects = foo.o bar.o all.o
<span>all: <span>$(objects)</span></span>
	<span>$(CC)</span> <span>$^</span> -o all

<span># Syntax - targets ...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...</span>
<span># In the case of the first target, foo.o, the target-pattern matches foo.o and sets the "stem" to be "foo".</span>
<span># It then replaces the '%' in prereq-patterns with that stem</span>
<span>$(objects)</span>: %.o: %.c
	<span>$(CC)</span> -c <span>$^</span> -o <span>$@</span>

<span>all.c:</span>
	echo <span>"int main() { return 0; }"</span> &gt; all.c

<span># Note: all.c does not use this rule because Make prioritizes more specific matches when there is more than one match.</span>
<span>%.c:</span>
	touch <span>$@</span>

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f *.c *.o all</code></pre>
<h2 id="static-pattern-rules-and-filter">Static Pattern Rules and Filter</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.10) -->
<p>While I introduce the <a href="#the-filter-function">filter function</a> later on, it's common to use in static pattern rules, so I'll mention that here. The <code>filter</code> function can be used in Static pattern rules to match the correct files. In this example, I made up the <code>.raw</code> and <code>.result</code> extensions.</p>
<pre><code>obj_files = foo.result bar.o lose.o
src_files = foo.raw bar.c lose.c

<span>all: <span>$(obj_files)</span></span>
<span># Note: PHONY is important here. Without it, implicit rules will try to build the executable "all", since the prereqs are ".o" files.</span>
<span><span>.PHONY</span>: all </span>

<span># Ex 1: .o files depend on .c files. Though we don't actually make the .o file.</span>
<span>$(<span>filter</span> %.o,<span>$(obj_files)</span>)</span>: %.o: %.c
	echo <span>"target: <span>$@</span> prereq: <span>$&lt;</span>"</span>

<h2 id="pattern-rules">Pattern Rules</h2>
<p>Pattern rules are often used but quite confusing. You can look at them as two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to define your own implicit rules</li>
<li>A simpler form of static pattern rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with an example first:</p>
<pre><code><span># Define a pattern rule that compiles every .c file into a .o file</span>
%.o : %.c
		<span>$(CC)</span> -c <span>$(CFLAGS)</span> <span>$(CPPFLAGS)</span> <span>$&lt;</span> -o <span>$@</span></code></pre>
<p>Pattern rules contain a '%' in the target. This '%' matches any nonempty string, and the other characters match themselves. ‘%’ in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that was matched by the ‘%’ in the target.</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code><span># Define a pattern rule that has no pattern in the prerequisites.</span>
<span># This just creates empty .c files when needed.</span>
<span>%.c:</span>
   touch <span>$@</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="double-colon-rules">Double-Colon Rules</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.11) -->
<p>Double-Colon Rules are rarely used, but allow multiple rules to be defined for the same target. If these were single colons, a warning would be printed and only the second set of commands would run.</p>
<pre><code><span>all: blah</span>

<span>blah::</span>
	echo <span>"hello"</span>

<span>blah::</span>

	@echo <span>"This make line will not be printed"</span>
	echo <span>"But this will"</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="command-execution">Command Execution</h2>
<!--  (Section 5.2) -->
<p>Each command is run in a new shell (or at least the effect is as such)</p>
<pre><code><span>all: </span>
	cd ..
	<span># The cd above does not affect this line, because each command is effectively run in a new shell</span>
	echo `pwd`

	<span># This cd command affects the next because they are on the same line</span>
	cd ..;echo `pwd`

	<span># Same as above</span>
	cd ..; \
	echo `pwd`
</code></pre>
<h2 id="default-shell">Default Shell</h2>
<!--  (Section 5.2) -->
<p>The default shell is <code>/bin/sh</code>. You can change this by changing the variable SHELL:</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash

<span>cool:</span>
	echo <span>"Hello from bash"</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="double-dollar-sign">Double dollar sign</h2>
<p>If you want a string to have a dollar sign, you can use <code>$$</code>. This is how to use a shell variable in <code>bash</code> or <code>sh</code>.</p>
<p>Note the differences between Makefile variables and Shell variables in this next example.</p>
<pre><code>make_var = I am a make variable

<h2 id="recursive-use-of-make">Recursive use of make</h2>
<!--  (Section 5.6) -->
<p>To recursively call a makefile, use the special <code>$(MAKE)</code> instead of <code>make</code> because it will pass the make flags for you and won't itself be affected by them.</p>

<h2 id="export-environments-and-recursive-make">Export, environments, and recursive make</h2>
<!--  (Section 5.6) -->

<pre><code><span># Run this with "export shell_env_var='I am an environment variable'; make"</span>
<span>all:</span>
	<span># Print out the Shell variable</span>
	echo $$shell_env_var

	<span># Print out the Make variable</span>
	echo <span>$(shell_env_var)</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>export</code> directive takes a variable and sets it the environment for all shell commands in all the recipes:</p>
<pre><code>shell_env_var=Shell env var, created inside of Make
<span>export</span> shell_env_var
<span>all:</span>
	echo <span>$(shell_env_var)</span>
	echo $$shell_env_var</code></pre>
<p>As such, when you run the <code>make</code> command inside of make, you can use the <code>export</code> directive to make it accessible to sub-make commands. In this example, <code>cooly</code> is exported such that the makefile in subdir can use it.</p>
<pre><code>new_contents = <span>"hello:\n\techo \$<span>$(cooly)</span>"</span>

<span>all:</span>

<h2 id="variables-pt-2">Variables Pt. 2</h2>
<h2 id="flavors-and-modification">Flavors and modification</h2>
<!-- (6.1, 6.2, 6.3) -->
<p>There are two flavors of variables:  </p>
<ul>
<li>recursive (use <code>=</code>) - only looks for the variables when the command is <em>used</em>, not when it's <em>defined</em>.  </li>
<li>simply expanded (use <code>:=</code>) - like normal imperative programming -- only those defined so far get expanded</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span># Recursive variable. This will print "later" below</span>
one = one ${later_variable}
<span># Simply expanded variable. This will not print "later" below</span>
two := two ${later_variable}

later_variable = later

<span>all: </span>
	echo <span>$(one)</span>
	echo <span>$(two)</span></code></pre>
<p>Simply expanded (using <code>:=</code>) allows you to append to a variable. Recursive definitions will give an infinite loop error.  </p>
<pre><code>one = hello
<span># one gets defined as a simply expanded variable (:=) and thus can handle appending</span>
one := ${one} there

<span>all: </span>
	echo <span>$(one)</span></code></pre>
<p><code>?=</code> only sets variables if they have not yet been set</p>
<pre><code>one = hello
one ?= will not be set
two ?= will be set

<span>all: </span>
	echo <span>$(one)</span>
	echo <span>$(two)</span></code></pre>
<p>Spaces at the end of a line are not stripped, but those at the start are. To make a variable with a single space, use <code>$(nullstring)</code></p>
<pre><code>with_spaces = hello   <span># with_spaces has many spaces after "hello"</span>
after = <span>$(with_spaces)</span>there

nullstring =
space = <span>$(nullstring)</span> <span># Make a variable with a single space.</span>

<span>all: </span>
	echo <span>"<span>$(after)</span>"</span>
	echo start<span>"<span>$(space)</span>"</span>end</code></pre>
<p>An undefined variable is actually an empty string!</p>
<pre><code><span>all: </span>
	<span># Undefined variables are just empty strings!</span>
	echo <span>$(nowhere)</span></code></pre>
<p>Use <code>+=</code> to append</p>

<h2 id="string-substitution">String Substitution</h2>
<p><code>$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)</code> does the following:</p>
<p>"Finds whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and replaces them with replacement. Here pattern may contain a ‘%’ which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word. If replacement also contains a ‘%’, the ‘%’ is replaced by the text that matched the ‘%’ in pattern. Only the first ‘%’ in the pattern and replacement is treated this way; any subsequent ‘%’ is unchanged." (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions">GNU docs</a>)</p>
<p>The substitution reference <code>$(text:pattern=replacement)</code> is a shorthand for this.</p>
<p>There's another shorthand that replaces only suffixes: <code>$(text:suffix=replacement)</code>. No <code>%</code> wildcard is used here.</p>
<p>Note: don't add extra spaces for this shorthand. It will be seen as a search or replacement term.</p>
<pre><code>foo := a.o b.o l.a c.o

<h2 id="the-foreach-function">The foreach function</h2>
<!--  (Section 8.4) -->
<p>The foreach function looks like this: <code>$(foreach var,list,text)</code>. It converts one list of words (separated by spaces) to another. <code>var</code> is set to each word in list, and <code>text</code> is expanded for each word.<br>This appends an exclamation after each word:</p>
<pre><code>foo := who are you
<span># For each "word" in foo, output that same word with an exclamation after</span>
bar := <span>$(<span>foreach</span> wrd,<span>$(foo)</span>,<span>$(wrd)</span>!)</span>

	@echo <span>$(bar)</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-if-function">The if function</h2>
<!--  (Section 8.5) -->
<p><code>if</code> checks if the first argument is nonempty. If so, runs the second argument, otherwise runs the third.</p>
<pre><code>foo := <span>$(<span>if</span> this-is-not-empty,then!,else!)</span>
empty :=
bar := <span>$(<span>if</span> <span>$(empty)</span>,then!,else!)</span>

	@echo <span>$(foo)</span>
	@echo <span>$(bar)</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-call-function">The call function</h2>
<!--  (Section 8.6) -->
<p>Make supports creating basic functions. You "define" the function just by creating a variable, but use the parameters <code>$(0)</code>, <code>$(1)</code>, etc. You then call the function with the special <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Call-Function.html#Call-Function"><code>call</code></a> builtin function. The syntax is <code>$(call variable,param,param)</code>. <code>$(0)</code> is the variable, while <code>$(1)</code>, <code>$(2)</code>, etc. are the params.</p>
<pre><code>sweet_new_fn = Variable Name: $(0) First: $(1) Second: $(2) Empty Variable: $(3)

<span>all:</span>

<p>shell - This calls the shell, but it replaces newlines with spaces!</p>
<pre><code><span>all: </span>
	@echo <span>$(<span>shell</span> ls -la)</span> <span># Very ugly because the newlines are gone!</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-filter-function">The filter function</h2>
<p>The <code>filter</code> function is used to select certain elements from a list that match a specific pattern. For example, this will select all elements in <code>obj_files</code> that end with <code>.o</code>.</p>
<pre><code>obj_files = foo.result bar.o lose.o
filtered_files = <span>$(<span>filter</span> %.o,<span>$(obj_files)</span>)</span>

<span>all:</span>
	@echo <span>$(filtered_files)</span></code></pre>
<p>Filter can also be used in more complex ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Filtering multiple patterns</strong>: You can filter multiple patterns at once. For example, <code>$(filter %.c %.h, $(files))</code> will select all <code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code> files from the files list.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Negation</strong>: If you want to select all elements that do not match a pattern, you can use <code>filter-out</code>. For example, <code>$(filter-out %.h, $(files))</code> will select all files that are not <code>.h</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Nested filter</strong>: You can nest filter functions to apply multiple filters. For example, <code>$(filter %.o, $(filter-out test%, $(objects)))</code> will select all object files that end with <code>.o</code> but don't start with <code>test</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>
<h2 id="include-makefiles">Include Makefiles</h2>
<p>The include directive tells make to read one or more other makefiles. It's a line in the makefile that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>include</span> filenames...</code></pre>
<p>This is particularly useful when you use compiler flags like <code>-M</code> that create Makefiles based on the source. For example, if some c files includes a header, that header will be added to a Makefile that's written by gcc. I talk about this more in the <a href="#makefile-cookbook">Makefile Cookbook</a></p>
<h2 id="the-vpath-directive">The vpath Directive</h2>
<!--  (Section 4.3.2) -->
<p>Use vpath to specify where some set of prerequisites exist. The format is <code>vpath &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;directories, space/colon separated&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> can have a <code>%</code>, which matches any zero or more characters.
You can also do this globallyish with the variable VPATH</p>
<pre><code><span>vpath</span> %.h ../headers ../other-directory

<span># Note: vpath allows blah.h to be found even though blah.h is never in the current directory</span>
<span>some_binary: ../headers blah.h</span>
	touch some_binary

<span>../headers:</span>
	mkdir ../headers

<span># We call the target blah.h instead of ../headers/blah.h, because that's the prereq that some_binary is looking for</span>
<span># Typically, blah.h would already exist and you wouldn't need this.</span>
<span>blah.h:</span>
	touch ../headers/blah.h

<span>clean:</span>
	rm -rf ../headers
	rm -f some_binary
</code></pre>
<h2 id="multiline">Multiline</h2>
<p>The backslash ("\") character gives us the ability to use multiple lines when the commands are too long</p>
<pre><code><span>some_file: </span>
	echo This line is too long, so \
		it is broken up into multiple lines</code></pre>
<h2 id="phony">.phony</h2>
<p>Adding <code>.PHONY</code> to a target will prevent Make from confusing the phony target with a file name. In this example, if the file <code>clean</code> is created, make clean will still be run. Technically, I should have used it in every example with <code>all</code> or <code>clean</code>, but I wanted to keep the examples clean. Additionally, "phony" targets typically have names that are rarely file names, and in practice many people skip this.</p>
<pre><code><span>some_file:</span>
	touch some_file
	touch clean

<span><span>.PHONY</span>: clean</span>
<span>clean:</span>
	rm -f some_file
	rm -f clean</code></pre>
<h2 id="delete_on_error">.delete_on_error</h2>
<!-- (Section 5.4) -->

<p>The make tool will stop running a rule (and will propogate back to prerequisites) if a command returns a nonzero exit status.<br><code>DELETE_ON_ERROR</code> will delete the target of a rule if the rule fails in this manner. This will happen for all targets, not just the one it is before like PHONY. It's a good idea to always use this, even though make does not for historical reasons.  </p>
<pre><code><span>.DELETE_ON_ERROR:</span>

	false

<span>two:</span>
	touch two

<h2 id="makefile-cookbook">Makefile Cookbook</h2>
<p>Let's go through a really juicy Make example that works well for medium sized projects.</p>
<p>The neat thing about this makefile is it automatically determines dependencies for you. All you have to do is put your C/C++ files in the <code>src/</code> folder.</p>
<pre><code><span># Thanks to Job Vranish (https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/26/makefile-c-projects/)</span>
TARGET_EXEC := final_program

BUILD_DIR := ./build
SRC_DIRS := ./src

<span># Find all the C and C++ files we want to compile</span>
<span># Note the single quotes around the * expressions. The shell will incorrectly expand these otherwise, but we want to send the * directly to the find command.</span>
SRCS := <span>$(<span>shell</span> find <span>$(SRC_DIRS)</span> -name '*.cpp' -<span>or</span> -name '*.c' -<span>or</span> -name '*.s')</span>

<span># Prepends BUILD_DIR and appends .o to every src file</span>
<span># As an example, ./your_dir/hello.cpp turns into ./build/./your_dir/hello.cpp.o</span>
OBJS := $(SRCS:%=<span>$(BUILD_DIR)</span>/%.o)

<span># String substitution (suffix version without %).</span>
<span># As an example, ./build/hello.cpp.o turns into ./build/hello.cpp.d</span>
DEPS := $(OBJS:.o=.d)

<span># Every folder in ./src will need to be passed to GCC so that it can find header files</span>
INC_DIRS := <span>$(<span>shell</span> find <span>$(SRC_DIRS)</span> -type d)</span>
<span># Add a prefix to INC_DIRS. So moduleA would become -ImoduleA. GCC understands this -I flag</span>
INC_FLAGS := <span>$(<span>addprefix</span> -I,<span>$(INC_DIRS)</span>)</span>

<span># The -MMD and -MP flags together generate Makefiles for us!</span>
<span># These files will have .d instead of .o as the output.</span>
CPPFLAGS := <span>$(INC_FLAGS)</span> -MMD -MP

<span># The final build step.</span>
<span>$(BUILD_DIR)</span>/<span>$(TARGET_EXEC)</span>: <span>$(OBJS)</span>
	<span>$(CXX)</span> <span>$(OBJS)</span> -o <span>$@</span> <span>$(LDFLAGS)</span>

<span># Build step for C source</span>
<span>$(BUILD_DIR)</span>/%.c.o: %.c
	mkdir -p <span>$(<span>dir</span> <span>$@</span>)</span>
	<span>$(CC)</span> <span>$(CPPFLAGS)</span> <span>$(CFLAGS)</span> -c <span>$&lt;</span> -o <span>$@</span>

<span># Build step for C++ source</span>
<span>$(BUILD_DIR)</span>/%.cpp.o: %.cpp
	mkdir -p <span>$(<span>dir</span> <span>$@</span>)</span>
	<span>$(CXX)</span> <span>$(CPPFLAGS)</span> <span>$(CXXFLAGS)</span> -c <span>$&lt;</span> -o <span>$@</span>


<span><span>.PHONY</span>: clean</span>
<span>clean:</span>
	rm -r <span>$(BUILD_DIR)</span>

<span># Include the .d makefiles. The - at the front suppresses the errors of missing</span>
<span># Makefiles. Initially, all the .d files will be missing, and we don't want those</span>
<span># errors to show up.</span>
<span>-include</span> <span>$(DEPS)</span></code></pre>
<!--
TODO: This example fails initially because blah.d doesn't exist. I'm not sure how to fix this example, there are probably better ones out there..

# Generating Prerequisites Automatically (Section 4.12)
Example requires: blah.c  
Generating prereqs automatically  
This makes one small makefile per source file  
Notes:  
1) $$ is the current process id in bash. $$$$ is just $$, with escaping. We use it to make a temporary file, that doesn't interfere with others if there is some parallel builds going on.  
2) cc -MM outputs a makefile line. This is the magic that generates prereqs automatically, by looking at the code itself  
3) The purpose of the sed command is to translate (for example):  
    main.o : main.c defs.h  
    into:  
    main.o main.d : main.c defs.h  
4) Running `make clean` will rerun the rm -f ... rule because the include line wants to include an up to date version of the file. There is such a target that updates it, so it runs that rule before including the file.  
```makefile
# Run make init first, then run make
# This outputs
all: blah.d

clean:
    rm -f blah.d blah.c blah.h blah.o blah

%.d: %.c
    rm -f $@; \
     $(CC) -MM $(CPPFLAGS) $< > $@.$$$$; \
     sed 's,\($*\)\.o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' < $@.$$$$ > $@; \
     rm -f $@.$$$$

init:
    echo "#include \"blah.h\"; int main() { return 0; }" > blah.c
    touch blah.h

sources = blah.c

include $(sources:.c=.d)
```

<p>We, people and civil society organisations from Europe and around the world, call on the European Commission to act now to break up the powerful Big Tech monopolies that have a stranglehold over our digital world. Big Tech isn’t just dominating markets – it’s dominating European democracy.</p>



<p>Europe needs a thriving and diverse digital economy that serves the needs of European citizens, not billionaire tech CEOs. President von der Leyen has affirmed that in the EU, “<a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/2025-04/ursula-von-der-leyen-eu-usa-donald-trump-english/komplettansicht"><u>we don’t have bros or oligarchs making the rules</u></a>.” The Commission must now stand up to the tech oligarchy by strongly enforcing the EU’s digital rules and competition law.</p>



<p>Right now, the Commission has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to dismantle Google’s advertising monopoly, which is destroying the news media, ripping off consumers, and was ruled illegal in a landmark US judgement.</p>



<h2>Big Tech’s monopoly power threatens democracy</h2>



<p>We cannot address Big Tech’s harms without first confronting its power. A handful of tech giants have concentrated control of our core digital infrastructure – including search engines, social media, app stores, and cloud. The companies’ unchecked power over their digital empires enables them to abuse people’s rights, exploit businesses, and crush competitors.</p>



<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has warned that tech billionaires want “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/spain-pedro-sanchez-big-tech-billionaires-democracy-social-media/"><u>to overthrow democracy</u></a>”. When a small number of billionaires and tech giants control the internet, they wield their power – and their vast profits – to influence political discourse and interfere with democratic laws. This year, tech CEOs and the Trump administration have <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/tracking-recent-statements-on-the-enforcement-of-eu-tech-laws/#US-Leaders"><u>worked hand in glove</u></a> to try to thwart the EU’s landmark digital laws that hold Big Tech to account.</p>



<h2>Break up Big Tech monopolies</h2>



<p>Teresa Ribera, the EU’s competition chief, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-05/google-split-still-on-the-table-eu-s-new-antitrust-chief-says"><u>recognises</u></a> that break-ups can prevent Big Tech from grabbing too much market power. These corporations treat billion-euro fines as the cost of doing business, while behavioural remedies are ineffective and often flouted by the companies. Forcing these giants to sell off parts of their businesses will curb conflicts of interest, level the digital playing field, and make the companies easier to hold accountable for their growing societal harms.</p>



<p>Breaking up Google’s advertising monopoly is an open goal for the EU, backed by <a href="https://clubmadrid.org/former-eu-leaders-breaking-up-googles-adtech-monopoly-is-vital-for-democracy/"><u>eighteen former European presidents and prime ministers</u></a>. Google’s monopoly unfairly sucks revenue from publishers, killing journalism and the news media, while forcing consumers to pay more through an “adtech tax” to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9ee0ebd3-346f-45b1-8b92-aa5c597d4389">industry middlemen</a>. In its final ruling on Google ad-tech, the Commission must reaffirm that “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3207"><u>only the mandatory divestment</u></a>” by Google of part of its services will address competition concerns.</p>



<p>Breaking up tech monopolies is a step towards a freer, fairer internet. Europe can and must resist threats from Big Tech and the Trump administration, and stand firm in upholding EU law against Big Tech. Break up Google. Break up Big Tech.</p>

<p>Most websites are&nbsp;awful.</p>



<p>Not just slow – <em>awful</em>. Bloated, fragile, over-engineered disasters. They load slowly, render erratically, and hide their content behind megabytes of JavaScript. They glitch on mobile. They frustrate users and confuse search engines. They’re impossible to maintain. And somehow, we’re calling this <em>progress</em>.</p>



<p>The tragedy is, none of this is necessary. Once upon a&nbsp;time, we had a&nbsp;fast, stable, resilient web. But we replaced it with a&nbsp;JavaScript cargo&nbsp;cult.</p>



<p>Now it takes four engineers, three frameworks, and a&nbsp;CI/CD pipeline just to change a&nbsp;heading. It’s inordinately complex to simply <em>publish a&nbsp;webpage</em>.</p>



<p>This isn’t evolution. It’s self-inflicted complexity. And we’ve normalised it – because somewhere along the way, we started building websites for <em>developers</em>, not for <em>users</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-we-got-here">How we got&nbsp;here</h2>



<p>Around 2010, something shifted. The iPhone was ascendant. Native apps were sleek, fast, fluid. Angular, the first mainstream javascript framework for the web, elhad just emerged. And suddenly, every CMO started saying the same thing in website briefs: <em>“Can we make it feel like an&nbsp;app?”</em></p>



<p>Developers, armed with new frameworks and good intentions, said yes. JavaScript could, in theory, do seamless transitions and slick UI. So we built towards that promise. Or tried&nbsp;to.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: we didn’t get app-like performance. We didn’t get better user experiences. What we got was an <em>arms race of complexity</em>.</p>



<p>We started solving simple problems – like navigation or layout – with tools built for full-blown applications.</p>



<p>At the same time, JavaScript stopped being just a&nbsp;front-end language. With the rise of Node.js, JS moved server-side, and with it came a&nbsp;wave of app developers entering the web ecosystem. These weren’t web designers or content publishers. They were engineers, trained to build applications, not documents. And they brought with them an architecture-first mindset: patterns, state management, dependency injection, abstracted logic. The result? A&nbsp;slow cultural shift from building pages to engineering systems – even when all the user needed was to load an article.</p>



<p>And so, we rewrote the rules of web development around entirely different needs, almost overnight. Not content, not speed, not interoperability, not discoverability. Just&nbsp;code.</p>



<p>The further we went down this road, the more the stack drifted from the fundamentals. Semantic HTML? Optional. Server-side rendering? Rebuilt from scratch. Accessibility? Maybe, if there’s time. Performance? Who cares, when you can save costs by putting loading burdens onto the user’s device, instead of your server?</p>



<p>So gradually, the web became something you had to <em>compile</em> before you could publish. Not because users needed it. But because developers wanted it to feel modern.</p>



<p>And we’re still paying for that decision.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-cult-of-developer-experience">The cult of developer experience</h2>



<p>Today, we optimise for “DX” – developer experience. Not user experience. Not performance. Not outcomes.</p>



<p>Today’s popular frameworks are sold on their DX. The docs are slick. The onboarding is smooth. The tooling is smart, integrated, clever. You can spin up a&nbsp;new app with a&nbsp;CLI command and feel productive before you’ve even written a&nbsp;line of content.</p>



<p>But good DX doesn’t guarantee good UX. In fact, it’s often the opposite. Because the more comfortable we make things for developers, the more abstraction we add. And every abstraction creates distance between the thing being built and the people it’s&nbsp;for.</p>



<p>Now we have component libraries generating button markup. We have page metadata managed in JavaScript functions. We have image loading strategies buried in config files.</p>



<p>Everything’s optimised for developers – and hostile to everyone else.</p>



<p>This isn’t accidental. It’s cultural. We’ve created an industry where complexity is celebrated. Where cleverness is rewarded. Where engineering sophistication is valued more than clarity, usability, or commercial effectiveness.</p>



<p>It’s easier to win an argument by citing SSR compatibility issues than it is to ask, “<em>Why are we using React for a&nbsp;blog?</em>”</p>



<p>And so we keep optimising for the wrong things. Because it feels good. Because it’s fun. Because it looks modern. And because nobody stops&nbsp;us.</p>



<h2 id="h-complexity-becomes-the-default">Complexity becomes the default</h2>



<p>This is how it spirals.</p>



<p>We don’t just tolerate complexity anymore – we expect it. We assume that every site needs a&nbsp;build step, a&nbsp;bundler, a&nbsp;hydration strategy, a&nbsp;routing layer, an API layer, a&nbsp;design system, and some clever cache invalidation logic. We build in microservices, host on edge networks, and deploy pipelines to ship basic content.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re publishing a&nbsp;blog post or an ecommerce site – the stack is the same. Heavy, abstract, engineered to the edge of usefulness.</p>



<p>And nobody understands it. Not&nbsp;fully.</p>



<p>Not the marketers, not the SEOs, not even the developers who built it six months ago. Every new tool brings new abstractions, new syntax, new mental models. Making a&nbsp;simple tweak to a&nbsp;headline, a&nbsp;meta tag, or a&nbsp;layout becomes a&nbsp;three-step deployment process.</p>



<p>It’s madness.</p>



<p>We’ve rebuilt the web like an air traffic control system – just to serve a&nbsp;few kilobytes of&nbsp;text.</p>



<p>And the worst part? Most of this complexity exists just to retrofit things we used to get by <em>default</em>: routing, metadata, caching, templating, layout.</p>



<p>We’re not innovating. We’re rebuilding broken versions of tools the web already gave us – and doing it&nbsp;badly.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-stack-is-rebuilding-itself-in-its-own-image">The stack is rebuilding itself in its own&nbsp;image</h2>



<p>Fast forward to today. Ironically, after years of chasing abstraction and complexity, the JavaScript ecosystem is now scrambling to reintroduce the things we&nbsp;lost.</p>



<p>Server-side rendering? Back in fashion. Routing? Carefully managed. URL structures, metadata, even HTML output – all being rebuilt, one plugin at a&nbsp;time.</p>



<p>It all looks increasingly like the thing we started with: a&nbsp;conventional CMS, serving HTML, rendered on the server, cached close to the&nbsp;user.</p>



<p>Except now it’s slower, harder to maintain, and dependent on a&nbsp;brittle ecosystem of packages, compilers, and edge handlers.</p>



<p>We’re (re)building platforms like WordPress and it’s features, but with 10x the overhead and none of the usability.</p>



<p>Worse, every new layer introduces new bugs, new compatibility issues, and new cognitive burden. Now we’re maintaining hydration logic <em>and</em> cache strategies <em>and</em> build pipelines just to get a&nbsp;homepage online.</p>



<p>It would be funny if it weren’t so exhausting.</p>



<p>This is the endgame of a&nbsp;development culture obsessed with novelty. We’re not shipping better sites. We’re reinventing basic infrastructure in increasingly convoluted ways – then celebrating the fact that it <em>almost works</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-cycle-of-iteration-and-instability">The cycle of iteration and instability</h2>



<p>The stack never settles.</p>



<p>Nothing is stable. Nothing is finished. Every sprint, every roadmap, every quarter brings a&nbsp;new initiative: migrate to the latest framework, adopt the new bundler, refactor the routing layer, replace the CMS integration, rebuild the&nbsp;cache.</p>



<p>It never ends. And it rarely helps.</p>



<p>Most of this churn isn’t solving real user problems. It’s solving the problems created by the last round of architecture decisions. We’re not iterating toward impact – we’re iterating just to stay afloat.</p>



<p>And while the stack is busy trying to fix itself, everything else slows&nbsp;down.</p>



<p>Marketing campaigns get delayed because the component library isn’t flexible enough. A/B tests get scrapped because the analytics layer isn’t compatible with the hydration strategy. Content updates wait days for a&nbsp;build. Basic SEO tweaks get buried in backlog.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the users still can’t load the&nbsp;page.</p>



<p>This is what happens when complexity becomes the product. We don’t optimise for outcomes anymore. We optimise the optimisation layer.</p>



<p>And then we do it&nbsp;again.</p>



<h2 id="h-collateral-damage-to-marketers-and-users">Collateral damage to marketers and&nbsp;users</h2>



<p>All this complexity doesn’t just frustrate developers. It locks everyone else&nbsp;out.</p>



<p>Marketers can’t update copy or run experiments without raising tickets. They can’t preview content, test layouts, or launch pages. Every change has to go through developers, pipelines, approvals, and rebuilds.</p>



<p>SEOs are stuck trying to diagnose rendering issues they can’t control. Pages load empty, or late, or not at all. Crawl traps appear. Metadata disappears. Structured data gets bundled into a&nbsp;JavaScript object and forgotten.</p>



<p>Content strategists and editors are left editing JSON blobs, Markdown files, or headless CMS forms that have no connection to the thing the user actually sees.</p>



<p>Even basic QA is a&nbsp;mess. Does the page show the right headline? Does the canonical tag resolve correctly? You won’t know until you’ve deployed it.&nbsp;Maybe.</p>



<p>And users? They’re stuck staring at loading spinners. Tapping broken buttons. Waiting for the back button to un-break itself. Watching text reflow as the layout shuffles into&nbsp;place.</p>



<p>This isn’t the future of the web. It’s a&nbsp;slow-motion disaster.</p>



<p>We’ve made websites harder to publish, harder to find, harder to use, and harder to maintain – all in the name of modern development.</p>



<h2 id="h-javascript-is-powerful-but-misused">JavaScript is powerful – but misused</h2>



<p>Let’s be clear: JavaScript isn’t the villain. It’s powerful. It’s essential. It enables rich interactivity, dynamic content, real-time updates. It lets us build tools, not just&nbsp;pages.</p>



<p>Used wisely, it elevates the&nbsp;web.</p>



<p>But most websites don’t need to be tools. They don’t need complex state. They don’t need real-time data or dynamic routing. They’re not apps. They’re brochures, catalogs, portfolios, articles.</p>



<p>And for those use cases, the modern JS stack is complete overkill.</p>



<p>Even ecommerce sites – with product options, variation pickers, add-to-cart functionality, and modal overlays – don’t need full frameworks. These can all be built with minimal, lean, well-targeted JavaScript. No client-side routing. No hydration. No component trees.</p>



<p>A few lines of well-written vanilla JavaScript (or yes, even jquery) can handle 95% of what most websites actually need. Faster. Simpler. More accessibly.</p>



<p>Modern CSS alone can now handle many of the tasks we used to need JavaScript for – like toggles, modals, and even carousels – reducing the need for scripting altogether.</p>



<p>And yes, some sites do have genuine client-side state needs login states, currency selectors, regional availability, and so on. But even those can often be handled more cleanly and performantly with server-side logic, or simple asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX. We don’t need a&nbsp;full reactive runtime to show a ‘logged in’ button or switch from USD to&nbsp;EUR.</p>



<p>But instead, we default to frameworks. We reach for React to build a&nbsp;contact page. We deploy hydration strategies for static content. We compile, bundle, transpile, and optimise code that doesn’t need to&nbsp;exist.</p>



<p>It’s not just wasteful. It’s damaging.</p>



<p>We’re burning user attention, developer time, and business resources to simulate interactivity that nobody asked&nbsp;for.</p>



<p>JavaScript should be the icing. Not the cake. And certainly not the oven, the recipe, and the kitchen sink.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-power-problem">The power problem</h2>



<p>The more complex the stack becomes, the more power it concentrates.</p>



<p>Marketers, content editors, SEOs, designers – they’re all locked out of the process. Because now, even simple tasks require technical fluency. Want to change a&nbsp;title tag? Talk to engineering. Want to launch a&nbsp;campaign? Raise a&nbsp;ticket and wait two sprints.</p>



<p>Everything flows through the dev team. Which means the dev team gets to decide what matters, what ships, and what gets deprioritised indefinitely.</p>



<p>And the more complexity they add, the more indispensable they become.</p>



<p>It’s not (usually) malicious. It’s structural. The stack is built by devs, for devs. So when something breaks, or needs changing, or needs explaining – it goes back to the people who built it. Which reinforces the model. Which deepens the dependency. Which justifies more abstraction. And more control.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a&nbsp;technical issue. It’s an organisational one. We’ve handed control of the web to the only people who understand the machinery. And they’re too busy fixing the machine to stop and ask whether we needed it in the first&nbsp;place.</p>



<h2 id="h-websites-that-work">Websites that&nbsp;work</h2>



<p>There is a&nbsp;better way. And it doesn’t require a&nbsp;complete rewrite of the internet or a&nbsp;return to&nbsp;2005.</p>



<p>We don’t need to abandon CMSs. We don’t need to ban JavaScript. We just need to stop treating every website like a&nbsp;software product.</p>



<p>Most sites need to load fast, be easy to navigate, show up in search, and let users do simple things – read, click, scroll, buy. That’s it. And we already have the tools to build&nbsp;that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Server-rendered HTML.</li>



<li>Semantic markup.</li>



<li>Clean URLs.</li>



<li>Lightweight templates.</li>



<li>Edge caching.</li>



<li>Sensible use of JavaScript where it adds real&nbsp;value.</li>
</ul>



<p>That could be WordPress. That could be Eleventy. That could be a&nbsp;custom setup. The point isn’t the tool – it’s the mindset.</p>



<p>Build for the user. Build for performance. Build for maintainability.</p>



<p>Choose simplicity over cleverness. Choose transparency over abstraction. Choose outcomes over architecture.</p>



<p>We can still have modern workflows. We can still version control content. We can still preview, collaborate, deploy, iterate. But the foundation has to be the web – not an app, not a&nbsp;shell, not a&nbsp;simulation.</p>



<p>It’s not about going backwards. It’s about stopping the freefall.</p>



<p>The web can work again. We just have to let&nbsp;it.</p>



<h2 id="h-reclaiming-the-web">Reclaiming the&nbsp;web</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever felt like your website is harder to manage than it should be – you’re not imagining it.</p>



<p>If it takes days to update a&nbsp;title tag, if your product pages glitch, if your blog can’t load without JavaScript… that’s not “just how it works.” That’s a&nbsp;choice. One made without you in the&nbsp;room.</p>



<p>So ask questions. Push&nbsp;back.</p>



<ul>
<li>“Why are we using a&nbsp;full JS framework for a&nbsp;mostly static site?”</li>



<li>“Why can’t I&nbsp;update this content without engineering help?”</li>



<li>“Why does it take a&nbsp;build pipeline to change a&nbsp;headline?”</li>



<li>“Why isn’t this just&nbsp;HTML?”</li>
</ul>



<p>You don’t need to write code to challenge architecture. You just need to make outcomes the priority.</p>



<p>And remember – complexity isn’t just a&nbsp;technical burden. It’s a&nbsp;financial one. More engineers. Slower launches. Higher maintenance. Less agility. When the stack bloats, so do the&nbsp;costs.</p>



<p>Faster sites. Easier publishing. Better rankings. Happier users.</p>



<p>You can demand those things.</p>



<p>Because they’re not unreasonable. They’re what the web was built&nbsp;for.</p>



<p>And it’s time to start demanding better.</p>



<p>Ask more. Expect more. Push for outcomes, not architecture.</p>



<p>The web isn’t broken by accident. It’s broken by design. And we don’t have to accept it.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean frameworks have no place. Large or distributed teams often benefit from architectural scaffolding, shared conventions, and modular approaches. But that scaffolding is rarely right-sized. More often, it justifies itself by growing – and creates the need for even more engineers to maintain the complexity it introduced.</p>



<p>And yes, frameworks <em>can</em> be fast, accessible, and SEO-friendly. But let’s be honest: they almost never are. Not in the wild. Not without significant expertise, time, and care. Most developers don’t know what they don’t know. They rely on default configurations and magic middleware that silently breaks the basics.</p>



<p>The result?<br>Broken back buttons.<br>Image bloat.<br>Inaccessible markup.<br>URLs that don’t behave like URLs.<br>Metadata that disappears.<br>Content you can’t copy.<br>Buttons you can’t keyboard to.<br>Modals that trap you.<br>Scroll positions that reset for no reason.<br>Headlines that shift mid-read.<br>Analytics that don’t match reality.<br>Preview environments that lie.<br>And pages that load… eventually.</p>



<p>All fixable.<br>All avoidable.<br>All caused by choosing tools that were never built for this&nbsp;job.</p>



<p>This isn’t about going back to table layouts or banning JavaScript.<br>It’s about building with intent.<br>Understanding what the web gives us by default – and resisting the urge to rebuild it from scratch.</p>



<p>It’s not about purity. It’s about outcomes.<br>Use what&nbsp;works.<br></p>



<p>But question whether it’s working for your users, or just for your developers.&nbsp;</p>
