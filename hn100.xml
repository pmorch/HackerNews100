<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) supports the three hackers who explained in detail at 37C3 how the Polish rail vehicle manufacturer Newag had manipulated its trains in such a way that they could only be repaired in the company's own workshops. The manufacturer reacted to the publications with an attitude not seen since the 90s and sued the hackers under both criminal and civil law. At 38C3, the hackers are now reporting on their legal odyssey, which cost so far around 30,000 euros. The CCC is calling for donations to cover the legal and other resulting costs incurred so far.</p><div><p>In <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-12142-breaking_drm_in_polish_trains">one of the most popular presentations at 37C3</a>, the three hackers uncovered something monstrous: Newag trains went into hibernation using a sophisticated game of hide-and-seek if they were parked for too long within the geocoordinates of competitors‘ or customers’ workshops or were left in conditions that indicated they underwent an unregistered repair. Only by calling in a Newag technician could such deactivated trains be ‘rescued’. All of this was uncovered without the potentially illegal replacement of train components which would require certifications.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Newag's reaction was thin-skinned. We assume that the current lawsuits are aimed at preventing these - and future - publications about such ‘illegal instructions‘. But at Congress, it is not small-minded company lawyers or locomotive builders stuck in the past who decide who is allowed to speak on our stages. Only the content teams do. It is therefore a matter for us to support the three speakers that were presenting at the last congress and now - almost unfortunately - this one, too, so that they can continue researching fearlessly in the future!</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute, please make a transfer to the regular bank account of the Chaos Computer Club e.V. (<tt>DE41 2001 0020 0599 0902 01</tt> / <tt>PBNKDEFFXXX</tt>) with the reference ‘Lokomotive’.</p>
<p>If more than the € 30,000 required to date is donated, if the legal costs are lower or if court costs are repaid, all payments received in excess will be used for the statutory purposes of the Chaos Computer Club e.V.. Please note that the CCC e.V. is not formally recognised as a non-profit organisation.</p>
<p>The sequel will be presented this Friday at 38C3 in Hamburg.

<p>A massive data leak involving over 800,000 Volkswagen electric vehicles (EVs) has left sensitive user information, including location data and personal contact details, unprotected on the internet. Discovered by a whistleblower and reported by Der Spiegel, the breach highlights significant security shortcomings at VW’s software subsidiary Cariad, exposing vulnerabilities in modern vehicle data handling.</p>



<h3 id="h-gps-locations-exposed">GPS locations exposed</h3>



<p>The data breach, which remained unnoticed by VW for months, involved precise GPS data and personal information linked to owners of VW, Audi, Seat, and Škoda vehicles. Stored on an unprotected Amazon Cloud server, this dataset allowed anyone with basic technical skills to access:</p>



<ul>
<li>Detailed location logs showing exactly where and when cars were parked.</li>



<li>Personal information of owners, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers.</li>



<li>Insights into users’ routines, workplaces, leisure spots, and even sensitive visits, such as government offices, hospitals, and private establishments.</li>
</ul>



<p>This exposed data posed risks for exploitation by criminals, espionage actors, or hackers, according to Linus Neumann of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), who equated the situation to leaving “a massive keychain under a flimsy doormat.”</p>



<p>The breach impacted not only individual users but also institutional entities. <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/volkswagen-konzern-datenleck-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-a-e12d33d0-97bc-493c-96d1-aa5892861027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Der Spiegel's report</a> highlights the following cases:</p>



<ol>
<li>Politician Nadja Weippert, a member of the Green Party and privacy advocate, discovered her movements were meticulously recorded and linked to identifiable personal details. She described the situation as “shocking.”</li>



<li>Markus Grübel, a CDU Bundestag member, expressed similar concerns, noting the event undermines trust in the auto industry.</li>



<li>The Hamburg Police, with 35 EVs in their fleet, were among the affected parties.</li>
</ol>



<p>Data from several countries, including Germany, Israel, and Ukraine, was accessible. In some cases, the GPS data was precise to within 10 centimeters.</p>



<h3 id="h-cariad-s-response"><strong>Cariad’s Response</strong></h3>



<p>In response to the breach, Cariad, Volkswagen’s software arm, acknowledged the issue, stating that the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) had pointed out a misconfiguration in two IT applications on November 26, 2024. The company acted promptly to close the vulnerability the same day. The misconfiguration, which had allowed access to pseudonymized vehicle data, no longer exists.</p>



<p>Cariad emphasized that the data involved was not sensitive personal information like passwords or payment details, and no vehicles or services were impacted. Only certain vehicle data from online-connected cars were affected. The company also confirmed that no unauthorized third-party access occurred, and they have reported the incident to relevant authorities.</p>



<p>Cariad clarified that the data, such as charging behavior and habits, was anonymized and used to improve future vehicle features, such as battery and charging software. No personal user profiles were created, and customers had the option to disable online services at any time.</p>



<p>VW assured customers that all data processing is conducted in compliance with legal requirements and customer consent, with strong privacy measures in place, including data separation, pseudonymization, and strict data usage limits.</p>



<p>However, this latest security lapse at Volkswagen underscores an ongoing pattern of systemic vulnerabilities in the company’s IT infrastructure and data handling practices.</p>



<h3 id="h-vw-s-security-failures">VW's security failures</h3>



<p>Similar concerns have been raised in past reports, including <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/vw-and-audi-customers-exposed-for-years-by-dealership-software-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 20-year flaw</a> in dealership software that exposed customer data, a five-year <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/chinese-hackers-breached-into-german-carmaker-vw-for-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">espionage operation</a> by Chinese hackers targeting VW’s intellectual property, and critical <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/volkswagen-and-skoda-flaws-allow-engine-disruption-and-owner-data-theft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulnerabilities in vehicle systems</a> that allowed remote engine disruption and data theft. Collectively, these incidents highlight the urgent need for VW and other automakers to prioritize cybersecurity as a foundational aspect of their digital and connected services.</p>

                    <p>There is a bit more intrigue around the tragic death late last month of former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji, who was found dead in his Lower Haight apartment of an apparent suicide.</p><p>Balaji had only recently become a whistleblower about OpenAI and its use of copyrighted material to train its ChatGPT AI model, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/openai-copyright-law.html">speaking to the New York Times</a> in an interview published in October. In addition to the legal issues around consuming copyrighted material, Balaji told the Times it was also "not a sustainable model for the internet ecosystem as a whole."</p><p>On November 26, two days before Thanksgiving, Balaji was <a href="https://sfist.com/2024/12/13/openai-whistleblower-found-dead-in-his-sf-apartment/">found dead in his apartment on Buchanan Street</a>. The medical examiner deemed it a death by suicide, and the SFPD has said there is "no evidence of foul play."</p><p>Balaji's mother, Poornima Ramarao, who lives in the Bay Area, tells Bay Area News Group this week that she and her husband are "demanding a thorough investigation" into their son's death. They do not believe he would have taken his own life, and they say there had been zero indication in his mental state that this could be a possibility.</p><p>"No one believes that he could do that," Ramarao tells the news group. The mother says that she and her husband had last spoken to their son on November 22, in a 10-minute phone call in which he had not indicated anything was wrong. He said he was heading out to get dinner.</p><p>Ramarao said that when she had asked Balaji, who had quit his job at OpenAI over the summer, how he would make a living, he assured he wasn't concerned, and said "money is not important to me — I want to offer a service to humanity."</p><p>Balaji was reportedly working to establish a nonprofit that was centered on machine learning.</p><p>Balaji also reportedly reassurred his parents about his decision to go public with his concerns about OpenAI, and they say they were proud of him and that he was untroubed by his decision. Days before his death, Balaji was named in a legal filing by the New York Times as a person with significant documents to support their case. The Times is among multiple companies suing OpenAI over the use of copyrighted materials.</p><p>"He was very happy," Ramarao tells Bay Area News Group, adding that he had just turned 26 less than a week earlier, and he had spent his birthday backpacking with high school friends in the Catalina Islands. "He had a blast. He had one of the best times of his life," the mother says.</p><p>The parents have hired an attorney, Phil Kearney, and they have commissioned a second, independent autopsy.</p><p><strong>Previously:</strong> <a href="https://sfist.com/2024/12/13/openai-whistleblower-found-dead-in-his-sf-apartment/">OpenAI Whistleblower Found Dead In His SF Apartment</a></p><p><em>If you or someone you know is struggling with feelings of depression or suicidal thoughts, the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline offers free, round-the-clock support, information and resources for help.

  <h2><em>1:60 SCALE MODEL OF AN AIR INDIA BOEING 777-300ER, MADE ENTIRELY FROM MANILA FOLDERS</em></h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559266243734_6718">
  <p>This project traces its beginnings to an <a href="https://www.lucaiaconistewart.com/architecture"><span>architecture class</span></a> in high school where we learned to use manila file folders to roughly model our building ideas. The more I worked with paper, the more I fell in love with its versatility. At some point, I got the idea to make a model of an airplane as a way of challenging myself with an unconventional shape.</p><p>Though the project began on a much smaller and simpler scale in mid-2008, it has since evolved through multiple revisions to become a highly detailed, true-to-life representation of a Boeing 777. I originally drew my plans by hand, but my desire to increase the accuracy and amount of detail led me to start using Adobe Illustrator to design and print increasingly intricate parts directly onto the folder.</p><p><em>The project has been in progress since May 2008</em></p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559270348562_9530">

  <h2>HOW THE *#%! DO I DO IT?</h2>
</p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559711406501_11179">
  <h2>RESEARCH</h2><p>I start with as much source material as I can. Often that means photos and videos found on the web, but sometimes I’m lucky enough to get my hands on technical drawings as well. I study these materials to form an understanding of the intrinsic shape and function of the particular section I’m working on. Once I feel confident in my basic understanding of the part, I can begin the design process.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559711406501_13965">
  <h2>DESIGN</h2><p>Much of my work consists of figuring out how to flatten 3-D shapes into 2-D slices that can be printed onto paper and assembled. I work in Adobe Illustrator to create 2-D plans for all the parts of which the final product will be comprised. I typically start the process by working out the general shape and dimensions of the piece, then I drill down, adding more detail and functionality. Once the design has been “frozen,” I work to break it down into individual pieces and arrange them for printing. Often, if a piece is complex and I’m unsure of how well it will function in reality, I build a small test section to verify my designs.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1559711406501_16684">
  <h2>PRINTING &amp; ASSEMBLY</h2><p>This stage is as time-consuming as the design process. I cut folders down to printer-friendly sizes and print my plans directly onto them. Then, I cut out the individual pieces using an <a href="http://www.xacto.com/products/cutting-solutions/knives/detail/X3201" target="_blank"><span>Xacto knife</span></a>, arrange them into sections, and glue them together with <a href="https://www.aleenes.com/aleenes-clear-gel-tacky-glue" target="_blank"><span>Tacky Glue</span></a>. Often, a complex piece is actually a collection of much smaller sub-sections that each needs to be assembled separately before being joined together; this is especially true of something like the wing, which contains many articulating functions and thousands of parts.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1561353870131_383468">
  <h2>TOOLS</h2><p>My tools of choice include the aforementioned Xacto knife, a cutting mat, straight edges, squares, and a toothpick for the precise application of glue.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In late September, Dominik “Domtendo” Neumayer received a troubling email. He had just featured <em>The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> in a series of videos on his YouTube channel. Now, those videos were gone.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of your videos have been removed,” YouTube explained matter-of-factly. The email said that Domtendo had now received a pair of copyright strikes. He was now just one copyright strike away from losing his 17-year-old channel and the over 1.5 million subscribers he’d built up.&nbsp;</p><p>At least, he would have been, if Domtendo hadn’t spotted something fishy about the takedown notice —&nbsp;something YouTube had missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo had been a little bit confused right from the start;<strong> </strong>the strikes didn’t make sense. Like countless other creators, Domtendo specializes in “Let’s Play” videos, a well-established genre where streamers play through the entirety of a game on camera.</p><div><p>“The next copyright strike will close your channel”</p></div><p>Nintendo has a complicated relationship with the fans who use its copyrighted works, infamously shutting down all sorts of unauthorized projects by sending cease-and-desists. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">It has gone after YouTubers</a>, too. But both the Japanese gaming giant and the broader gaming industry typically leave Let’s Plays alone, because they serve as free marketing for their games.</p><p>And yet, YouTube had received a legit-looking request apparently justifying these takedowns under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), signed “Tatsumi Masaaki, Nintendo Legal Department, Nintendo of America.”</p><p>It was in a second email from YouTube that Domtendo spotted something off. The takedown requests came from a <em>personal</em> account at an encrypted email service: “tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com”.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="YouTube took action on Domtendo’s videos, even though the requests cited a personal email address." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/376x352/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/384x359/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/415x388/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/480x449/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/540x505/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/640x599/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/750x702/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/828x775/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/1080x1011/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/1200x1123/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/1440x1347/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/1920x1796/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/2048x1916/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/2400x2246/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:948x887/2400x2246/filters:focal(474x444:475x445):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799995/domtendo_tatsumi_protonmail_hint.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>YouTube took action on Domtendo’s videos, even though the requests cited a personal email address.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Domtendo</cite></p></div></div><p>Fake takedowns are real. <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-copyright/summary?hl=en">YouTube says</a> over six percent of takedown requests through its public webform are likely fake, and the company accepts requests via plain email too, meaning anyone can file them. Fighting fake takedowns can cost creators time, money, and stress. But creators can’t easily be sure that a takedown is fake — and they can lose their entire channel if they get it wrong and clash with a company that has a legitimate copyright claim.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">When the well-respected Retro Game Corps</a> received his second Nintendo copyright strike, he publicly declared he would self-censor all his future work to hopefully escape the company’s wrath. But first, he checked that Nintendo’s threat was real. He checked to see who YouTube listed as the complaining party, and that it came from a Nintendo email address. Then he checked with his YouTube Partner Manager to be extra safe.</p><div><p>Rumors of fake Nintendo takedowns have swirled in the past. Earlier this year, <em>Garry’s Mod </em>developer Garry Newman removed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca"> 20 years’ worth of Nintendo-related fan content from his sandbox video game</a> over takedown threats. Fans speculated that it may actually have been someone posing as a Nintendo lawyer. But Newman eventually revealed <a href="https://garry.net/posts/aaron-peters">Nintendo was legitimately behind those takedowns</a> despite using seemingly suspicious names and emails.</p></div><p>Domtendo thought he might have an actual case of a Nintendo faker. So he decided to push back. At first, it seemed to work. He emailed YouTube, and it soon reinstated his videos. But Tatsumi was back the next day —&nbsp;this time, emailing Domtendo directly.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dear Domtendo, I represent Nintendo of America Inc. (“Nintendo”) in intellectual property matters,” the first email began. After a bunch of legalese, Tatsumi eventually explains why he’s reaching out: “I submitted a notice through YouTube’s legal copyright system, but the infringing content still appears.”</p><p>He wouldn’t let it go.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo wasn’t about to risk his livelihood just in case Tatsumi was real. He got spooked, and began voluntarily pulling his videos off YouTube. But his new pen pal just kept asking for more removals. Tatsumi reached out day after day, sometimes multiple times a day, according to emails shared with <em>The Verge</em>. The threats got weirder, too:</p><p><strong>October 3rd:</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>I ask for your expeditious removal of all infringing material that use Nintendo Switch game emulators by 6th October 2024. Please note that the amount of videos infringing Nintendo’s copyrights is too high to be able to list them all in this e-mail and we hope that you will conscientiously remove all infringing videos before the next week.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>October 8th:&nbsp;</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>Nintendo hereby prohibits you from any future use of its intellectual and copyrighted property. Existing content may remain as long as there is no request to remove it. Nintendo of America Inc. would like to avoid further legal action and therefore hopes that their intellectual property will no longer be used by you. This cease-and-desist declaration is valid immediately and has been approved by President of Nintendo of America Doug Spencer Bowser.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>October 12th:</strong>&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>Nintendo of America Inc. (“Nintendo”) will no longer tolerate this behavior and is now on the verge of filing a lawsuit. Note that we work closely with our subsidiary Nintendo of Europe, located in Germany and therefore already have your address from the time you have been Nintendo Partner and/or will receive your new address from the residents’ registration office.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Domtendo began reaching out to friends and fellow content creators, and discovered he wasn’t alone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Waikuteru">Waikuteru</a>, a streamer who develops Zelda mods, had been targeted by Tatsumi as well. Only that time, the takedown notices were filed in Japanese, and YouTube claimed they’d come from a seemingly real email address: <a href="mailto:anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp">anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp</a>. Whoever submitted those notices claimed to be a “Group Sub-Manager” in Nintendo’s “Intellectual Property Department.”&nbsp;</p><p>Could Tatsumi be legit? Was Domtendo staring down a real threat?&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Verge</em> could find no public record of a Tatsumi Masaaki working for Nintendo of America or Nintendo’s legal team, period. Nintendo did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s repeated requests to fact-check whether such a lawyer even exists.&nbsp;</p><p>But there <em>was </em>a person by a similar name <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Masaaki+Tatsumi);&amp;assignee=Nintendo&amp;oq=inventor:(Masaaki+Tatsumi);+assignee:(Nintendo)">working on Nintendo technology patents</a> in its home country of Japan, public records show, and Domtendo was dismayed to find a Nintendo email address for that person on the public web.&nbsp;</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="This is the name of a real person (真章 辰己) who worked for Nintendo out of Kyoto, Japan, but the company wouldn’t tell The Verge one word about it." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/376x186/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/384x190/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/415x205/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/480x237/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/540x267/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/640x316/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/750x371/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/828x409/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/1080x534/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/1200x593/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/1440x712/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/1920x949/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/2048x1013/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/2400x1187/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2605x1288/2400x1187/filters:focal(1303x644:1304x645):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25800013/tatsumi_patent.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>This is the name of a real person (</em>真章 辰己) <em>who worked for Nintendo out of Kyoto, Japan</em>, <em>but the company wouldn’t tell The Verge one word about it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: USPTO</cite></p></div></div><p>To a trained eye, there were signs that Domtendo’s “Tatsumi” was probably a fake. What business would a Japanese game technology inventor have individually chasing down a German YouTuber and threatening them with the laws of the United States? If they were a real lawyer, wouldn’t they know that threatening Domtendo with DMCA 512 is laughable, because that’s the portion of the law that protects platforms like YouTube rather than individual creators?&nbsp;</p><p>But Domtendo didn’t want to take the risk, not without proof.

Two more emails arrived the same day, explaining that while Nintendo had “suspended” him from filing copyright infringement claims, his Nintendo colleagues would now file them on his behalf. Hours later, Domtendo received what was in some ways the most legit-looking email yet, seemingly sent from anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp rather than a personal email address.&nbsp;</p><p>But that email turned out to be Tatsumi’s undoing, when Domtendo checked the headers and discovered they’d spoofed Nintendo’s email address using a publicly available tool on the web. I took the tool for a spin, and sure enough — <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436?hl=en">unless you check</a>, anyone can make an email look like it was sent from Nintendo that way.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo still doesn’t understand how “Tatsumi” knew he’d emailed the real Tatsumi at Nintendo. He changed his passwords and reformatted his computer, just to be safe. Today, his best guess is that the troll was lurking in his personal Discord channel.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s angry at YouTube for letting this happen. “It’s their fault,” he tells me. “Every idiot can strike every YouTuber and there is nearly no problem to do so. It’s insane,” he writes. “It has to change NOW.”</p><div><p>“Every idiot can strike every YouTuber”</p></div><p>It’s true there isn’t a terribly high bar to submit a YouTube copyright claim, something that YouTube itself admits. Currently, bad actors just need to fill in a form on a website, a place where YouTube sees a “10 times higher attempted abuse rate” than tools with more limited access. Or they can just email YouTube’s copyright department directly. And while <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512#:~:text=Elements%20of%20notification">the law</a> technically requires a copyright holder to provide their name and address and state “under penalty of perjury” that they’re authorized to complain on Nintendo’s behalf, there’s nothing compelling YouTube to check they aren’t lying before slapping creators with penalties.&nbsp;</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Photo collage of Blue shells from Mario Kart launching at an anonymous figure." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25703633/247348_Nintendo_targeting_Youtuber_CVirginia_A.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Why is Nintendo targeting this YouTuber?</a></h2></p><p>Russ Crandall, aka Retro Game Corps, was actually targeted by Nintendo. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Here’s the story</a> of  how the Japanese game company (and YouTube) are threatening his livelihood.</p><p>If you have first-hand information about Nintendo, you can reach me securely on Signal at <strong>seanhollister.01</strong>. </p></div><p>The thing to remember is the DMCA’s “Safe Harbor” isn’t here to protect creators, EFF legal director Corynne McSherry explained to me in 2022.

Neither know for sure whether trolls were responsible for all the takedown notices they’re received, and that’s part of the problem. “The idea that months of worries were caused by a single troll as opposed to a big untouchable company is a hard pill to swallow either way,” says Rimea.&nbsp;</p><p>But they also claim YouTube doesn’t allow smaller channels to challenge copyright strikes in the first place, arguing that it automatically and arbitrarily rejects the legal notices that would let them reinstate their videos. “YouTube decides whether someone loses his channel based on channel size,” says Waikuteru.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube isn’t particularly interested in talking about any of this, though.&nbsp;</p><p>While YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon did confirm that “Tatsumi” made false claims, the company wouldn’t explain why the company even briefly accepted false claims from a protonmail.com email address as legitimate, and repeatedly dodged questions about whether Tatsumi made false claims on other creators’ videos, too. </p><p>YouTube wouldn’t even tell me whether Domtendo was still in danger of false copyright claims from this specific individual, or offer assurances that it would take any new action to prevent this sort of behavior in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Malon does claim that YouTube has “dedicated teams working to detect and prevent abuse,” however, and “work to ensure that any associated strikes are reversed” when bad actors make false claims.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the troll, Tatsumi declined <em>The Verge</em>’s interview request. “Dear Sean, I am an authorized agent for Nintendo of America Inc,” they replied, staying in character to the very end.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                <p>Eerke Boiten, Professor of Cyber Security at De Montfort University Leicester, explains his belief that current AI should not be used for serious applications.</p>
                            </div>


            <section>


<div>
                    <p>From the perspective of <a href="https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/how-to-become-a-software-engineer/">software engineering</a>, current AI systems are unmanageable, and as a consequence their use in serious contexts is irresponsible. For foundational reasons (rather than any temporary technology deficit), the tools we have to manage complexity and scale are just not applicable.</p>
<p>By ‘software engineering’, I mean developing software to align with the principle that impactful software systems need to be trustworthy, which implies their development needs to be managed, transparent and accountable. I don’t suggest any particular methodologies or tools (before you know it, I’d have someone explaining why ‘waterfall’ is wrong!) — but there are some principles which I believe to be both universal and unsatisfiable with current AI systems.</p>
<p>When I last gave talks about AI ethics, around 2018, my sense was that AI development was taking place alongside the abandonment of responsibility in two dimensions. Firstly, and following on from what was already happening in ‘big data’, the world stopped caring about where AI got its data — fitting in nicely with ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1781256845">surveillance capitalism</a>. And secondly, contrary to what professional organisations like BCS and ACM had been preaching for years, the outcomes of AI algorithms were no longer viewed as the responsibility of their designers — or anybody, really.</p>
<p>‘Explainable AI’ and some ideas about mitigating bias in AI were developed in response to this, and for a while this looked promising — but unfortunately, the data responsibility issue has not gone away, and the major developments in AI since then have made responsible engineering only more difficult.</p>
<h2>How neural networks work</h2>
<p>When I say ‘current AI systems’, I mean systems based on large neural networks, including most generative AI, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, most of what DeepMind and OpenAI are producing and developing, and so on. An extremely optimistic view of these is what I would call ‘LLM-functionalism’: the idea that a natural language description of the required functionality fed to an LLM, possibly with some prompt engineering, establishes a meaningful implementation of the functionality.</p>
<p>The neural networks underlying these systems have millions of ‘nodes’ or ‘neurons’. Each has one output and multiple inputs, which either originate externally to the entire network or are taken from other nodes’ outputs. A node’s output is determined by the inputs, the weights put on each input, and an ‘activation function’ that decides how the weighted inputs translate into an output. The connection structure is fixed, using connected ‘layers’ or other structures such as recurrent networks or transformers, as is the activation function. The fixed structure is relevant to what type of problems the network can deal with, but the network’s functionality is almost entirely introduced by ‘training’, which means setting and modifying the weights of each input until the outputs achieve an objective satisfactorily on a set of training data.</p>
<p>The training of the huge networks that make up current AI systems has typically taken an astronomical amount of compute, measurable in the millions of dollars or kWh, and will necessarily have been mostly unsupervised or self-supervised. Put bluntly, it will have required no human input – though there may have been some human tuning afterwards (such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or ‘guard rails’), or when the system runs (such as context and prompt engineering).</p>
<h2>Emergence and compositionality</h2>
<p>Many of these neural network systems are stochastic, meaning that providing the same input will not always lead to the same output. The behaviour of such AI systems is ‘emergent’ — which means despite the fact that the behaviour of each neuron is given by a precise mathematical formula, neither this behaviour nor the way the nodes are connected are of much help in explaining the network’s overall behaviour.</p>
<p>My first 20 years of research were in formal methods, where <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-92711-4">mathematics and logic are used to ensure systems operate according to precise formal specifications</a>, or at least to support verification of implemented systems. Software engineering, and particularly formal methods, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066105050966">has not been as successful in managing emergent behaviour</a> or even the aspects of ‘traditional’ systems that have emergent tendencies such as resource usage or security. This is for foundational reasons rather than for a lack of scientific effort.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/3-540-49213-5">A central property in formal software engineering is compositionality</a>: the idea that composite systems can be understood in terms of the meanings of their parts and the nature of the composition, rather than by having to look at the parts themselves.</p>
<p>This idea lies at the heart of piecewise development: parts can be engineered (and verified) separately and hence in parallel, and reused in the form of modules, libraries and the like in a ‘black box’ way, with re-users being able to rely on any verification outcomes of the component and only needing to know their interfaces and their behaviour at an abstract level. Reuse of components not only provides increased confidence through multiple and diverse use, but also saves costs.</p>
<h2>Issues arising from emergent over compositional</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, my informal definitions of ‘emergent’ and ‘compositionality’ are almost exact opposites, and this raises several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current AI systems have no internal structure that relates meaningfully to their functionality. They cannot be developed, or reused, as components. There can be no separation of concerns or piecewise development. A related issue is that most current AI systems do not create explicit models of knowledge — in fact, many of these systems developed from techniques in image analysis, where humans have been notably unable to create knowledge models for computers to use, and all learning is by example (‘<a href="https://www.acluohio.org/en/cases/jacobellis-v-ohio-378-us-184-1964#:~:text=TheU.S.SupremeCourtreversed,tohardcorepornography...">I know it when I see it</a>’). This has multiple consequences for development and verification.</li>
<li>There are no intermediate models at different levels of abstraction to describe the system. There is no possibility for stepwise development — using either informal or formal methods.</li>
<li>Systems are not explainable, as they have no model of knowledge and no representation of any ‘reasoning’.</li>
<li>Even a ‘human in the loop’ adds little explainability, as they can only explain system outcomes (and learn from them) by doing their own reasoning on the input data from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>Verification comes with a subset of issues following from the above. The only verification that is possible is of the system in its entirety; if there are no handles for generating confidence in the system during its development, we have to put all our eggs in the basket of post-hoc verification. Unfortunately, that is severely hampered, following from the issues listed above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current AI systems have input and state spaces too large for exhaustive testing.</li>
<li>A correct output on a test of a stochastic system only evidences that the system has the capability to respond correctly to this input, but not that it will do this always or frequently enough.</li>
<li>Lacking components, current AI systems do not allow verification by parts (unit testing, integration testing, etc).</li>
<li>As the entire system is involved in every computation, there are no meaningful notions of coverage to gain confidence from non-exhaustive whole system testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, whole system testing is the only verification tool available, but it can never represent more than a drop in the ocean.</p>
<h2>Faults</h2>
<p>There are serious additional issues around faults and fixing. Faults may arise from unreliable input data, which certainly applies to many generative AI systems, but also from training data being sparse in parts of the input domain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current AI systems have faults, but even their error behaviour is likely emergent, and certainly hard to predict or eradicate.</li>
<li>Given the relative efforts of unsupervised training versus human error correction and feedback learning, there can never be confidence in correctness, arguing from scale alone.</li>
<li>Fixes of errors through retraining are not localised and regression testing is not possible, so newly introduced errors are likely, but not easily discoverable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>In my mind, all this puts even state-of-the-art current AI systems in a position where professional responsibility dictates the avoidance of them in any serious application. When all its techniques are based on testing, AI safety is an intellectually dishonest enterprise.</p>
<p>So, is there hope? I believe — though I would be happy to be proved wrong on this — that current generative AI systems represent a dead end, where exponential increases of training data and effort will give us modest increases in impressive plausibility but no foundational increase in reliability. I would love to see compositional approaches to neural networks, hard as it appears.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://aisafety.dance/">hybrids between symbolic and intuition-based AI</a> should be possible — systems that do generate some explicit knowledge models or confidence levels, or that are coupled with more traditional data retrieval or theorem proving. Current AI systems also have a role to play as components of larger systems in limited scopes where their potentially erroneous outputs can be reliably detected and managed, or in contexts such as weather prediction where we had always expected stochastic predictions rather than certainty.</p>                </div>

  <article>
      <p>In 2023, we launched an AI-powered Chief of Staff for engineering leaders—an assistant that unified information across team tools and tracked critical project developments. Within a year, we attracted 10,000 users, <a href="https://outropy.ai/blog/2024-04-19-outropy_vs_slack_ai/">outperforming even deep-pocketed incumbents such as Salesforce and Slack AI</a>. Here is an early demo:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mr5eZNXDlo?si=-IIK5uO5cTN9FFhi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>By May 2024, we realized something interesting: while our AI assistant was gaining traction, there was overwhelming demand for the technology we built to power it. Engineering leaders using the platform were reaching out non-stop to ask not about the tool but how we made our agents work so reliably at scale and be, you know, <em>actually useful</em>. This led us to pivot to <a href="https://outropy.ai/">Outropy</a>, a developer platform that enables software engineers to build AI products.</p>

<p>Building with Generative AI at breakneck pace while the industry was finding its footing taught us invaluable lessons—lessons that now form the core of the Outropy platform. While LinkedIn overflows with thought leaders declaring every new research paper a “game changer,” few explain what the game actually is. This series aims to change that.</p>

<p>This three-part series will cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How we built the AI agents powering the assistant</li>
  <li>How we constructed and operate our inference pipelines</li>
  <li>The AI-specific tools and techniques that made it all work</li>
</ul>

<p>This order is intentional. So much content out there fixates on choosing the best reranker or chasing the latest shiny technology, and few discuss how to build useful AI software. This is a report from the trenches, not the ivory tower.</p>

<h3 id="structuring-an-ai-application">Structuring an AI Application</h3>

<p>Working with AI presents exciting opportunities and unique frustrations for a team like ours, with decades of experience building applications and infrastructure.</p>

<p>AI’s stochastic (probabilistic) nature fundamentally differs from traditional deterministic software development—but that’s only part of the story. With years of experience handling distributed systems and <a href="https://nighthacks.com/jag/res/Fallacies.html">their inherent uncertainties</a>, we’re no strangers to unreliable components.</p>

<p>The biggest open questions lie in structuring GenAI systems for long-term evolution and operation, moving beyond the quick-and-dirty prompt chaining that suffices for flashy demos.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are two major types of components in a GenAI system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inference Pipelines:</strong> A deterministic sequence of operations that transforms inputs through one or more AI models to produce a specific output. Think of RAG pipelines generating answers from documents—each step follows a fixed path despite the AI’s probabilistic nature.</li>
  <li><strong>Agents:</strong> Autonomous software entities that maintain state while orchestrating AI models and tools to accomplish complex tasks. These agents can reason about their progress and adjust their approach across multiple steps, making them suitable for longer-running operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our journey began with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePFEpU5crN0&amp;ab_channel=PhilCal%C3%A7ado">a simple Slack bot</a>. This focused approach let us explore GenAI’s possibilities and iterate quickly without getting bogged down in architectural decisions. During this period, we only used distinct inference pipelines and tied their results together manually.</p>

<p>This approach served us well until we expanded our integrations and features. As the application grew, our inference pipelines became increasingly complex and brittle, struggling to reconcile data from different sources and formats while maintaining coherent semantics.</p>

<p>This complexity drove us to adopt a <em>multi-agentic system</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-agents-really">What are agents, really?</h3>

<p>The industry has poured billions into AI agents, yet most discussions focus narrowly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation">RPA</a>-style, no-code and low-code automation tools. Yes, frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and Salesforce’s Agentforce serve an important purpose—they give business users the same power that shell scripts give Linux admins. But just like you wouldn’t build a production system in Bash, these frameworks are just scratching the surface of what agents can be.</p>

<p>The broader concept of agents has a rich history in academia and AI research, offering much more interesting possibilities for product development. Still, as a tiny startup on a tight deadline, rather than get lost in theoretical debates, we distilled practical traits that guided our implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Semi-autonomous:</strong> Functions independently with minimal supervision, making local decisions within defined boundaries.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialized:</strong> Masters specific tasks or domains rather than attempting general-purpose intelligence.</li>
  <li><strong>Reactive:</strong> Responds intelligently to requests and environmental changes, maintaining situational awareness.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory-driven:</strong> Maintains and leverages both immediate context and historical information to inform decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Analyzes situations, evaluates options, and executes actions aligned with objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Tool-using:</strong> Effectively employs various tools, systems, and APIs to accomplish tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal-oriented:</strong> Adapts behavior and strategies to achieve defined objectives while maintaining focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these intelligent components are powerful, we quickly learned that not everything needs to be an agent. Could we have built our Slackbot and productivity tool connectors using agents? Sure, but the traditional design patterns worked perfectly well, and our limited resources were better spent elsewhere. The same logic applied to standard business operations—user management, billing, permissions, and other commodity functions worked better with conventional architectures.</p>

<p>This meant that we had the following <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html#idm46407728082304">layered architecture</a> inside our application:</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-mono.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="agents-are-not-microservices">Agents are not Microservices</h3>

<p>I’ve spent the last decade deep in microservices—from pioneering work at ThoughtWorks to helping underdogs like SoundCloud, DigitalOcean, SeatGeek, and Meetup punch above their weight. So naturally, that’s where we started with our agent architecture.</p>

<p>Initially, we implemented agents as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">a service layer</a> with traditional request/response cycles:</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-agents-service-layer.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One of the biggest appeals of this architecture was that, even if we expected our application to be a monolith for a long time, it creates an easier path to extracting services as needed and benefit from <em>horizontal scalability</em> when the time comes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the more we went down the path, the more obvious it became that stateless microservices and AI agents just don’t play nice together. Microservices are all about splitting a particular feature into small units of work that need minimal context to perform the task at hand. The same traits that make agents powerful create a significant impedance mismatch with these expectations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stateful Operation</strong>: Agents must maintain rich context across interactions, including conversation history and planning states. This fundamentally conflicts with microservices’ stateless nature and complicates scaling and failover.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-deterministic Behavior</strong>: Unlike traditional services, agents are basically state machines with unbounded states. They behave completely differently depending on context and various probabilistic responses. This breaks core assumptions about caching, testing, and debugging.</li>
  <li><strong>Data-Intensive with Poor Locality</strong>: Agents process massive amounts of data through language models and embeddings, with poor data locality. This contradicts microservices’ efficiency principle.</li>
  <li><strong>Unreliable External Dependencies</strong>: Heavy reliance on external APIs such as LLMs, embedding services, and tool endpoints creates complex dependency chains with unpredictable latency, reliability, and costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation Complexity</strong>: The combination of prompt engineering, planning algorithms, and tool integrations creates debugging challenges that compound with distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only did this impedance mismatch cause a lot of pain while writing and maintaining the code, but agentic systems are so far away from the ubiquitous <a href="https://12factor.net/">12-factor</a> model that attempting to leverage existing microservice tooling became an exercise in fitting square pegs into round holes.</p>

<h3 id="agents-are-more-like-objects">Agents are more like objects</h3>

<p>If microservices weren’t the right fit, another classic software engineering paradigm offered a more natural abstraction for agents: object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>Agents naturally align with OOP principles: they maintain encapsulated state (their memory), expose methods (their tools and decision-making capabilities via inference pipelines), and communicate through message passing. <a href="https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en">This mirrors Alan Kay’s original vision</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/uml.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We’ve been in the industry long enough to remember the nightmares of distributed objects and the fever dreams of CORBA and J2EE. Yet, objects offered us a pragmatic way to quickly iterate on our product and defer the scalability question until we actually need to solve that.</p>

<p>We evolved our agents from <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EvansClassification.html">stateless Services to Entities</a>, giving them distinct identities and lifecycles. This meant each user or organization maintained their own persistent agent instances, managed through <a href="https://philcalcado.com/2010/12/23/how_to_write_a_repository.html">Repositories</a> in our database.</p>

<p>This drastically simplified our function signatures by eliminating the need to pass extensive context as arguments on every agent call. It also lets us leverage battle-tested tools like SQLAlchemy and Pydantic to build our agents, while enabling unit tests with stubs/mocks instead of complicated integration tests.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-agentic-memory">Implementing Agentic Memory</h3>

<p>Agents’ memories can be as simple as a single value to as complicated as keeping track of historical information since the beginning of times. In our assistant, we have both types and more.</p>

<p>For simple, narrow-focused agents such as the “Today’s Priorities” agents had to remember nothing more than a list of high-priority things they were monitoring and eventually taking action, such as sending a notification if they weren’t happy with the progress. Others, like our “Org Chart Keeper” had to keep track of all interactions between everyone in the organizations and use that to infer reporting lines and teams people belonged to.</p>

<p>The agents with simpler persistence needs would usually just store their data on a dedicated table using <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/">SQLAlchemy’s ORM</a>. This obviously wasn’t an option for the more complicated memory needs, so we had to apply a different model</p>

<p>After some experimentation, we adopted <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> with <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a>. In essence, every state change—whether creating a meeting or updating team members—was represented as a <em>Command</em>, a discrete event recorded chronologically—much like a database <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_log">transaction log</a>. The current state of any object could then be reconstructed by replaying all its associated events in sequence.</p>

<p>While this approach has clear benefits, replaying events solely to respond to a query is slow and cumbersome, especially when most queries focus on the current state rather than historical data. To address, CQRS suggests that we maintain a continuously updated, query-optimized representation of the data, similar to materialized views in a relational database. This ensured quick reads without sacrificing the advantages of event sourcing. We started off storing events and query models in Postgres, planning to move them to DynamoDB when we started having issues.</p>

<p>One big challenge in this model is that only an agent knows what matters to them. For example, if a user would change cancel a scheduled meeting, which agents should care about this event? The scheduling agent for sure, but if this meeting was about a specific project you might also want the project management agent to know about it as it might impact the roadmap.</p>

<p>Rather than building an all-knowing router to dispatch events to the right agents—risking the creation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God object</a>—we took inspiration from <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/building-products-at-soundcloud-part-1-dealing-with-the-monolith">my experience at SoundCloud</a>. There, we developed a semantic event bus enabling interested parties to publish and observe events for relevant entities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soon enough, we realized that there was a big problem with this model; as our microservices needed to react to user activity. The push-notifications system, for example, needed to know whenever a track had received a new comment so that it could inform the artist about it.  […] over several iterations we developed a model called Semantic Events, where changes in the domain objects result in a message being dispatched to a broker and consumed by whichever microservice finds the message interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/semantic-events.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Following this model, all state-change events were posted to an event bus that agents could subscribe to. Each agent filtered out irrelevant events independently, removing the need for external systems to know what they cared about. Since we were working within a single monolith at the time, we implemented a straightforward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer pattern</a> using <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/events.html">SQLAlchemy’s native event system</a>, with plans to eventually migrate to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/dynamodb-streams-use-cases-and-design-patterns/">DynamoDB Streams</a>.</p>

<p>Inside our monolith, the architecture looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/memory1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Managing both the ORM approach for simpler objects and CQRS for more complex needs grew increasingly cumbersome. Small refactorings or shared logic across all agents became harder than necessary. Ultimately, we decided the simplicity of ORM wasn’t worth the complexity of handling two separate persistence models. We converted all agents to the CQRS style but retained ORM for non-agentic components.</p>

<h3 id="handling-events-in-natural-language">Handling Events in Natural Language</h3>

<p>CQRS and its supporting tools excel with well-defined data structures. At SoundCloud, events like <em>UploadTrack</em> or <em>CreateTrackComment</em> were straightforward and unambiguous. AI systems, however, present a very different challenge.</p>

<p>Most AI systems deal with the uncertainty of natural language. This makes the process of consolidating the Commands into a “materialized view” hard. For example, what events correspond to someone posting a Slack message like <em>“I am feeling sick and can’t come to the office tomorrow, can we reschedule the project meeting?”</em></p>

<p>We started with the naive approach most agentic systems use: running every message through an inference pipeline to extract context, make decisions, and take actions via tool calling. This approach faced two problems: first, reliably doing all this work in a single pipeline is hard even with frontier models—more on this in part II. Second, we ran into the God object problem discussed earlier—our logic was spread across many agents, and no single pipeline could handle everything.</p>

<p>One option involved sending each piece of content—Slack messages, GitHub reviews, Google Doc comments, emails, calendar event descriptions…—to every agent for processing. While this was straightforward to implement via our event bus, each agent would need to run its inference pipeline for every piece of content. This would offer all sorts of performance and cost issues due to frequent calls to LLMs and other models, especially considering that the vast majority of content wouldn’t be relevant to a particular agent.</p>

<p>We wrestled with this problem for a while, exploring some initially promising but ultimately unsuccessful attempts at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/feature-extraction.html">Feature Extraction</a> using simpler ML models instead of LLMs. That said, I believe this approach can work well in constrained domains—indeed, we use it in Outropy to route requests within the platform.</p>

<p>Our solution built on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06648">Tong Chen’s Proposition-Based Retrieval research</a>. We already <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pcalcado_ai-vs-human-readability-the-unnecessary-activity-7275345861222535168-3fIB?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">used this approach to ingest structured content like CSV file</a>s, where instead of directly embedding it into a vector database, we first use an LLM to generate natural language factoids about the content. While these factoids add no new information, their natural language format makes vector similarity search much more effective than the original spreadsheet-like structure.</p>

<p>Our solution was to use an LLM to generate propositions for every message, structured according to a format inspired by <a href="https://github.com/amrisi/amr-guidelines/blob/master/amr.md">Abstract Meaning Representation</a>, a technique from natural language processing.</p>

<p>This way, if user <em>Bob</em> sends a message like <em>“I am feeling sick and can’t come to the office tomorrow, can we reschedule the project meeting?”</em> on the <code>#project-lavender</code> channel we would get structured propositions such as:</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/amr.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Naturally, we had to carefully batch messages and discussions to minimize costs and latency. This necessity became a major driver behind developing Outropy’s automated pipeline optimization using Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-to-10000-users">Scaling to 10,000 Users</h3>

<p>As mentioned a few times, Throughout this whole process, it was very important to us to minimize the amount of time and energy invested in technical topics unrelated to learning about our users and how to use AI to build products.</p>

<p>We kept our assistant as a single component, with a single code base and a single container image that we deployed using AWS Elastic Container Service. Our agents were simple Python classes using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, and we relied on FastAPI and asyncio’s excellent features to handle the load. Keeping things simple allowed us to make massive progress on the product side, to a point we went from 8 to 2,000 users in about two months.</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-mono.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That’s when things started breaking down. Our personal daily briefings—our flagship feature—went from taking minutes to hours per user. We’d trained our assistant to learn each user’s login time and generate reports an hour before, ensuring fresh updates. But as we scaled, we had to abandon this personalization and batch process everything at midnight, hoping reports would be ready when users logged in.</p>

<p>As an early startup, growth had to continue, so we needed a quick solution. We implemented organization-based sharding with a simple configuration file: smaller organizations shared a container pool, while those with thousands of users got dedicated resources. This isolation allowed us to keep scaling while maintaining performance across our user base.</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-shards.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This simple change gave us breathing room by preventing larger accounts from blocking smaller ones. We also added priority processing, deprioritizing inactive users and those we learned were away from work.</p>

<p>While sharding gave us parallelism, we quickly hit the fundamental scaling challenges of GenAI systems. Traditional microservices can scale horizontally because their external API calls are mostly for data operations. But in AI systems, these slow and unpredictable third-party API calls are your critical path. They make the core decisions, and this means everything is blocked until you get a response.</p>

<p>Python’s async features proved invaluable here. We restructured our agent-model interactions using <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility">Chain of Responsibility</a>, which let us properly separate CPU-bound and IO-bound work. Combined with some classic systems tuning—increasing container memory and <code>ulimit</code> for more open sockets—we saw our request backlog start to plummet.</p>

<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits">OpenAI rate limits</a> became our next bottleneck. We responded with a token budgeting system that <a href="https://dagster.io/glossary/data-backpressure">applied backpressure</a> while hardening our LLM calls with exponential backoffs, caching, and fallbacks. Moving the heaviest processing to off-peak hours gave us extra breathing room.</p>

<p>Our final optimization on the architectural: moving from OpenAI’s APIs to Azure’s GPT deployments. The key advantage was <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits">Azure’s per-deployment quotas</a>, unlike OpenAI’s organization-wide limits. This let us scale by load-balancing across multiple deployments. To manage the shared quota, we extracted our GPT calling code into a dedicated service rather than adding distributed locks</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-gpt-proxy.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="the-zero-one-infinity-rule">The Zero-one-infinity rule</h3>

<p>One of my favorite adages in computer science is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_one_infinity_rule">“There are only three numbers: zero, one, and infinity.”</a> In software engineering, this manifests as having either zero modules, a monolith, or an arbitrary and always-growing number. As such, extracting the <code>GPTProxy</code> as our first remote service paved the way for similar changes.</p>

<p>The most obvious opportunity to simplify our monolith and squeeze more performance from the system was extracting the logic that pulled data from our users’ connected productivity tools. The extraction was straightforward, except for one challenge: our event bus needed to work across services. We kept using SQLAlchemy’s event system, but replaced our simple observer loop with a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">pub/sub</a> implementation using Postgres as a queue.</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-int-worker.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This change dramatically simplified things—we should have done it from the start. It isolated a whole class of errors to a single service, making debugging easier, and let developers run only the components they were working on.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, we took the next logical step: extracting our agents and inference pipelines into their own component.</p>

<p><img src="https://philcalcado.com/img/building-ai-products-i/arch-agents-worker.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is where my familiar service extraction playbook stopped working. I’ll cover the details of our inference pipelines in the next article, but first, let’s talk about how we distributed our agents.</p>

<h3 id="agents-as-distributed-objects">Agents as Distributed Objects</h3>

<p>As successful as we were with modeling agents as objects, we’d always been wary of distributing them. My ex-colleague <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FirstLaw.html">Martin Fowler’s First Law of Distributed Objects</a> puts it best: <strong>don’t</strong>.</p>

<p>Still, I think that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/distributed-objects-microservices.html">Martin’s “exception” for microservices</a> applies just as well for agents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[My objection is that] although you can encapsulate many things behind object boundaries, you can’t encapsulate the remote/in-process distinction. An in-process function call is fast and always succeeds […] Remote calls, however, are orders of magnitude slower, and there’s always a chance that the call will fail due to a failure in the remote process or the connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with the distributed objects craze of the 90s was its promise that fine-grained operations—like iterating through a list of <code>user</code> objects and setting <code>is_enabled</code> to false—could work transparently across processes or servers. Microservices and agents avoid this trap by exposing coarse-grained APIs specifically designed for remote calls and error scenarios.</p>

<p>We kept modeling our agents as objects even as we distributed them, just using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">Data Transfer Objects</a> for their APIs instead of domain model objects. This worked well since not everything needs to be an object. Inference pipelines, for instance, are a poor candidate for object orientation and benefit from different abstractions.</p>

<p>At this stage, our system consisted of multiple instances of a few docker images on ECS. Each container exposed FastAPI HTTP endpoints, with some continuously polling our event bus.</p>

<p>This model broke down when we added backpressure and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/application-resiliency-patterns">resilience patterns</a> to our agents. We faced new challenges: what happens when the third of five LLM calls fails during an agent’s decision process? Should we retry everything? Save partial results and retry just the failed call? When do we give up and error out?”</p>

<p>Rather than build a custom orchestrator from scratch, we started exploring existing solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>We first looked at ETL tools like Apache Airflow. While great for data engineering, Airflow’s focus on stateless, scheduled tasks wasn’t a good fit for our agents’ stateful, event-driven operations.</p>

<p>Being in the AWS ecosystem, we looked at Lambda and other serverless options. But while serverless has evolved significantly, it’s still optimized for stateless, short-lived tasks—the opposite of what our agents need.</p>

<p>I’d heard great things about Temporal from my previous teams at DigitalOcean. It’s built for long-running, stateful workflows, offering the durability and resilience we needed out of the box. The multi-language support was a bonus, as we didn’t want to be locked into Python for every component.</p>

<p>After a quick experiment, we were sold. We migrated our agents to run all their computations through Temporal workflows.</p>

<p>Temporal’s core abstractions mapped perfectly to our object-oriented agents. It splits work between side-effect-free workflows and flexible activities. We implemented our agents’ main logic as Workflows, while tool and API interactions—like AI model calls—became Activities. This structure let Temporal’s runtime handle retries, durability, and scalability automatically.</p>

<p>The framework wasn’t perfect though. Temporal’s Python SDK felt like a second-class citizen—even using standard libraries like Pydantic was a challenge, as the framework favors data classes. We had to build quite a few converters and exception wrappers, but ultimately got everything working smoothly.</p>

<p>Temporal Cloud was so affordable we never considered self-hosting. It just works—no complaints. For local development and builds, we use their Docker image, which is equally reliable. We were so impressed that Temporal became core to both our inference pipelines and Outropy’s evolution into a developer platform!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for a deeper dive into Temporal and inference pipelines in the next installment of this series!</p>

<td>I had lots of fun building homebrew batteries. I wanted to build a <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">radio transmitter</a> powered by natural, homebrew power sources. The first thought, was a lemon battery (or few).<p>  All over the place on the internet, you can read about the classic school science project, sticking two dissimilar metals into a lemon and generating some small amount of power. Sometimes potatoes. You can even buy "kits" to do this in toystores. What seems to be generally lacking is any measurements on such batteries. How much power can they supply? And for how long? And what factors are involved to determine these parameters? Sure, you can power an LCD clock, until the lemon dries out. But they consume a miniscule current anyway. I found some websites which claimed that a single lemon will produce 0.5V and 1mA of current. They didn't say how long for. Several lemons in series are supposedly enough to light an LED.</p></td>

<h2>Simple lemon cell</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/rawlemon.gif" width="400" height="224"></p>
<p>My first attempt at a lemon battery consisted of a standard lemon, fresh from the supermarket, with a copper wire (solid core household cable with the insulation stripped off) poked in one side and a normal steel bolt pushed in the other side. To test this power generation masterpiece, I rigged up a 10k variable resistor in series with a 330-ohm fixed resistor and my two DVM to measure voltages and currents.</p>
<p>Indeed, when unloaded, the lemon produced around 0.5 Volts. But what about under load? The 10K potentiometer allowed me to vary the load between 10.3k and 330 ohms. The graph to the right shows the resulting battery voltage vs load current. As soon as I connected the load, the voltage dropped to 56mV even though the load was more than 10kOhms. The current was only 5.5 microamps! At the other end of the potentiometer, by the time the load was reduced to 330-Ohms, the current increased to 8uA, but the voltage falls to only 2.6mV. This lemon battery produced only 0.3uW of power across a 10k load! To power my <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a> I'd need about 30,000 lemons.</p>
<p>Next, I cut a strip of baked bean can tin, maybe 50 x 5mm. I inserted that into the lemon, in place of the steel bolt. The open-circuit voltage was 498mV, dropping to approx 300mV through my 10.3kOhm load. That's a current was of 29uA, for a power of 8.7uW. That's a 28-fold increase in power production! But still, nowhere near the claimed 1mA on some websites. If they lit an LED with some of these in series, then Ok, but it must have been a low-current LED. To power my <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a>, now I'd only need 1,000 lemons. But that's still a lot of lemons.</p>
<p>In the end, I was so disappointed with the ability of a lemon to produce much current, that I even forgot to take a photograph. So all you get is the graph.</p>
<h2>Lemon juice cell</h2>
<p>Not quite ready to give up on lemons altogether, however. My next battery cell was made from baked bean tin, soldered into a small cup. The dimensions of the cup are 35 x 23 x 4mm. A small 25 x 25mm square soldered on the bottom keeps it upright. The tin cup is the negative terminal of the battery. To construct the other electrode, I used about 25cm of copper wire, wound into a flat spiral. The copper wire is household lighting cable, with the insulation stripped off. To keep the electrodes apart, I wrapped the copper spiral in a piece of kitchen tissue. Then poured in lemon juice squeezed directly from a lemon. The idea here, is to increase the surface area of the electrodes and decrease the distances involved, to reduce the internal resistance of the battery.</p>

</div>
<!-- JW "Simple Image Gallery" Plugin (v1.2.1) ends here -->
<p>The results of this experiment were a little bit more encouraging. The current at 10.3k load was 34uA, which was only a little bit more than the raw lemon alone. But it coped better with lower resistance loads, and at about 500 ohms load could support a current of 150uA and the voltage dropped to 81mV. Peak power production occured at a little lower current than this, and was 17uW. This cell is therefore about twice as good as my raw lemon (with tin strip electrode).</p>
<h2>Improved lemon juice cell</h2>
<p>I was encouraged by this result and decided to build a bigger version of the same cell, incorporating larger electrodes and keeping the electrode separation as small as possible. For this larger cell, I used a whole 400g baked bean can. I cut the wall of the can into two pieces, folded together such that I produced a cell having three compartments. A piece of tin strip from the offcuts completed this small tank. All soldered together (baked bean can tin solderes very nicely). The size of this cell was about 70 x 50 x 20mm. The flat spiral coil is in this case still made from copper wire, but a longer length of it. Three such spirals are used in this battery. Each one was wrapped in a piece of kitchen tissue to stop it touching the tin electrode. Finally, lemon juice was poured into the cell. One lemon produces enough juice to fill the cell. The three compartments weren't sealed from each other; the only reason for the three compartments was to keep as much tin and copper as close together as possible.</p>

<!-- JW "Simple Image Gallery" Plugin (v1.2.1) ends here -->
<div><p>Well, the results from this cell were much better than previous attempts, as might be expected:</p><p>  <img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/lemon1.gif" width="419" height="288"> <img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/lemon2.gif" width="503" height="260"></p><p>  The first graph (above left) shows the voltage vs current of both the small lemon juice cell (see above) and my larger cell (this section). The large cell shows a massive improvement. It can cope with a 1mA current draw, and the voltage drops only to 324mV. This is a power production of 322uW, which is 19 times better than the small lemon juice cell!</p></div>
<p>In my second graph (above right), I discharged the battery through a fixed resistance of 330 ohms, which initially takes more than 1mA of current. Note that the discharge isn't a constant current one. As the voltage declines, so does the current so the power consumption is decreasing as the experiment runs. I repeated the discharge experiment three times. The first, started at 22:38 in the evening and I left it running for 90 minutes. The following morning, I tried again at 10:30am. I found that the voltage decay was faster, and to a lower value, than the first discharge, which is not a surprising result. What WAS more surprising however, was when I tried a third discharge run at 13:30. In this case the battery seemed to substantially recover, such that the decay was less rapid and to a higher voltage. In fact even 18 hours into this 3'rd discharge run, the voltage was practically unchanged at 155mV. At that point, the power production is 73uW.</p>
<p>Whilst certainly a big improvement, the long term power production of 73uW means that if I wanted to produce say 10mW of power in order to produce a few mW of RF from a transmitter, I would require approximately 140 of these cells connected together. That's 140 baked bean cans, 140 lemons, a lot of soldering, and a whole LOT of mess. Somehow, I don't think I'll be giving Duracell much competition any time soon.</p>
<h2>Bleach cell</h2>
<p>A little bit more internet research. I read somewhere of a fellow who put bleach into an ice cube tray, with electrodes separated by kithen tissue and connecting "cells" made from each ice cube's hole, in series. So I decided to have a go with bleach. I cleaned the original "small" lemon juice cell to get rid of all the lemon juice, used a new piece of kitchen tissue to separate the electrodes, and filled it up with undiluted bleach.</p>
<div><p>Now here's a REALLY much more impressive result! Forget about lemons. Keep them for your cooking. Try bleach instead! It's cheaper than lemons, and it works MUCH better. In fact, it even SMELLS better, and less strong! You'd think not, but it's true. Too much lemon juice and the room will really start to smell. Bleach smells strong when it's been spread over a large area, but not so bad when the exposed surface area is small.</p><p>  <img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/bleach2.gif" width="432" height="246"> <img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/bleach3.gif" width="531" height="252"><br> The first graph shows the voltage vs current characteristic. The first thing to notice is that the unloaded voltage of the bleach cell is 0.8V, which is substantially more than the 0.5V produced by a lemon juice electrolyte. Even this small cell can supply 0.25mA of current whilst only dropping the voltage to 606mV. I did two separate runs. In noticed that the bleach cell seems to take a while to "warm up". The performance improves, after a little use. I noticed this several times in subsequent experiments. The power production of this cell was 152uW into 330 ohms load. At smaller loads, it would be even more (but the voltage would suffer). What this means is that roughly speaking, the identical same cell is <strong>TEN TIMES</strong> better when filled with bleach, compared to lemon juice!</p></div>
<p>The second graph shows the discharge characteristic through a fixed 330 ohm resistor. This small bleach cell sustained a current of around 1mA for over 2 hours! You will note the wild fluctuation in voltage during this time, which would make it rather unsuitable for powering many applications. This was I suspect due to bubbles in the bleach, of which there were many. Furthermore, it was noted that the bleach partially disolved the kitchen tissue, leaving a translucent gunge in its place.</p>
<p>Because of the disolved kitchen tissue, I decided NOT to try bleach in my larger improved lemon juice cell (see above). It was very difficult already to get those larger spiral coils of wire neat and flat, wrapped in tissue, and somehow squeezed into the three narrow compartments of the cell. To do that again with bleach rather than lemon juice, and the attendant problems of disolving kitchen tissue, not to mention the damage to clothing... basically it really did not appeal.</p>
<h2>LARGE bleach cell</h2>
<p>Right. Enough of the research, now I want a practical cell that I can use to power my <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a>. The kitchen tissue dissolving problem meant it isn't suitable as a means to keep the two electrodes apart. Bleach is fierce stuff and it is difficult to think of suitable separating materials which would let the bleach through, but not be rapidly degraded. On the other hand, I wanted to get as much copper and tin as close together as possible. I thought long and hard about this and the solution I came up with is effective yet very simple to make.</p>

<p>Above, the construction process. One cell uses one baked bean can. I liked baked beans, and anyway I have a collection of baked bean cans because they are great as shielding material, or as circuit substrate for "ugly" construction. Next comes the "other" electrode, for which I used copper wire again. The copper wire is from a bit of old house lighting cable, left over on a reel. I have grey and white coloured ones (on the bottom and top respectively, in the picture). I used the white wire because the copper was thicker - over 1mm diameter of copper. Stripping off the red and black insulation was a big task and I got blisters on my hands.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/bleach1.gif" width="473" height="251"> Each cell uses two 7-foot lenths of copper wire joined end-to-end. The join is brought OUT of the cell and soldered outside, so as to avoid corrosion breaking the contact if the wires were just twisted together. The wire is wound on a 250ml Johnson's orange juice bottle. I drink one of these at lunchtime so collected them over the course of a week. I filled the orange juice bottle with water, so that 1) it was less compressible than it would have been if it was air-filled and 2) so that it was heavy enough to rest firmly on the bottom of the can when the bleach was poured in, rather than trying to float. The third-from-left photo above shows three cells in various stages of construction. I like the orange juice bottle idea. The separation between the copper wire and tin walls is about 7mm, but no material is required between the two to keep them apart, as long as the cell is placed carefully on a horizontal surface. Furthermore, the orange juice core means that much less bleach is required, limiting it to about 150ml per cell.</p>
<p>The far right photo above, shows the test setup where I am characterising one bleach cell.</p>
<p>The results for this battery cell are at last good enough for it to be seriously considered for powering my <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a>. Across my usual 330 ohm load, it produces 2mA current, dropping the cell voltage to nearly 700mV and producing 1.4mW of power.</p>

<p>I built FOUR of these baked bean can cells, and connected them in series. One 750ml bottle of ASDA thick bleach costs 60 or 70 pence and is more than enough to fill all four cells and clean the toilet too. The voltage of the four cells is more than 3V. I connected the homebrew battery up to my <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a> - it's the circuit in the bottom right corner of the photo, 3'rd from left. That circuit is built on a baked bean can tin substrate too!</p>
<p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong> With this battery powering the TX, it produced an output of about 3mW (into 50 ohm load) on frequency 7,000,850. On the first day of operation, the beacon received reception reports from G3VYZ, ON5SL, and GM0RZY. The report from ON5SL is shown as the rightermost image above. click that photo or <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">Click here to read more about my 40m QRSS transmitter</a>.</p>

<h2>Demise of the bleach battery</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/voltage.gif" width="670" height="214"></p>
<p>The bleach battery powered my <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a> for over a week, at a peak RF power output of over 6mW. The last reception report was received on the 5'th day, after which the RF power output dropped to below a milliwatt so reception would have become increasingly difficult from my poor aerial.</p>
<p>The graph to the right shows the discharge of the bleach battery. The upper (blue) curve is voltage (V) and the lower (red) curve is the current (mA). One could estimate an average current of perhaps 2.2mA over this 5 day period, leading to some kind of rough estimate for the capacity of this battery of approximately 250mAh. The voltage variation during the discharge is quite harsh, and not at all even. Around day 3 the battery peaked in performance. It is interesting that the battery improved during the first few days, rather than simply discharge from its initial value.</p>
<p>The photos below show that some severe corrosion of the baked bean can tin occured during this experiment. After a couple of days, the corrosion started to eat through the tin at the seam between the wall of the tin and its base and I had to stand them on saucers. Two of the tins were much worse affected than the others. When I finally threw away the tins, the base of the tin could easily be broken with gentle pressure. However, the inside of the tin, and the copper wire, were clean and uncorroded. The corrosion all seemed to happen at the interface with the air, or at the join in the tin. (Last three photos are courtesy of Steve G0XAR while visiting).</p>

<h2>Salt cell</h2>
<p>Considering the acceptable state of the copper electrodes following the bleach battery experiment, and also encouraging reports of salt and vinegar experiments from Anders Sandstrom, I decided to try a salt cell. I dissolved a large amount of salt into boiling water, until I could dissolve no more. This ensures a saturated salt solution. I used fresh baked bean cans but the same bottle with copper wire wound around.</p>
<p>My measurements on the salt cell are shown in the graph on the right. The same standard set-up was used as for evaluation of previous cells. It seems capable of supplying a good current but the voltage is rather low, which is consistent with what Anders found.</p>
<h2>Vinegar cell</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.hanssummers.com/images/stories/battery/vinegar.gif" width="404" height="219"></p>
<p>Next comes my vinegar cell. Balsamic vinegar, to be exact, since I had no plain vinegar. I covered the bottom of a new baked bean can with a few mm of balsamic vinegar, put in the orange juice bottle with wire wound around, and filled up with water.</p>
<p>My measurements on this vinegar cell are in the graph on the right. It produces about twice the voltage of the salt solution, but half the voltage of the pure bleach. The toxicity of this weak solution of vinegar is considerably less than the bleach. The current provision ability is good, like the salt. I decided to connect four of these vinegar cells in series and try them on the <a href="https://www.hanssummers.com/qrsslp.html">40m QRSS transmitter</a>.</p>

<h2>Ideas and comments from Anders Sandstrom</h2>
<p>Anders writes: <em>After I read the page about homemade batteries on your website I decided to try to make some batteries myself.</em></p>
<p><em> I had some good results with using a steel can and copper wire, with vineager essence and caustic soda between. I could only get 600 mV and 3 mA of short circut current with only the vineager essence, but after i pored in some caustic soda I got over one volt from a single cell and over 60 milliamperes of short circut current! I tried to make another one, but the second one I only got 700 mV from, but still the same high current. There was also some salt in the first one from another experiment, but I found that poring salt into the soloution actually decreases the voltage, but increses the maxium current. I had also good results with using copper and zink, but my only source of zink were nails with zink on the outside (I don't know what they are called in English). However, I have no idea for how long the battery cells can last.</em></p>

<p><em> I have now made 2 new cells, using copper pipe and sheet metal. I used water and drain opener as electrolyte. First i took a piece of copper tube, about 6-7 cm long and wrapped it in paper as insulation. I cut some sheet metal and wrapped it around it to form another tube. I put it in a small glass jar and poured in water (about 0,75 dl) and a spoon ( 15 ml) of caustic soda. The voltage was almost 1,2 volts for a new cell, but i decreases fast to about 1 volt and then stays there. I measured the current of a cell when it was places in a short circut and it was over 100 mA.</em></p>
<p><em>I tried to recharge the cells when they were almost empty, and it worked. I used a car battery charger set to 6 V and the current was about 300 mA, probably to much because bubbles started to form and after one hour the caustic soda solution was bubbling over the jar. But it worked and cell voltage was increased to 1,1 V and I could power a mp3 player for almost 3 minutes with 2 cells in series.</em></p>
<p><em>I have attached 2 photos of the cells in this email. The cells were about 1 day old when they where taken. </em></p>
<h2>Ideas and comments from John Beech G8SEQ</h2>
<p>John writes: <em> I had a look at your batteries and I'm not sure I agree with your calculations ( though they might be true for your batteries). Way back in the early 1970's ( which was probably before you were born) we had what was called the "Three Day Week" where everyone ( except me!) worked a three day week because the power workers went on strike and we had electricity cuts left, right and centre.</em></p>
<p><em>People were making oil lamps that run on smoky, smelly cooking oil and animal fat, but I thought I could do better and made a battery out of houseold materials ( People had panic-bought all the dry cells and most of them had gone flat by then). I used an aluminium 35 mm film can, some copper wire and household bleach.( I tried cooking salt first) This gave enough energy to light a 1.5 v torch bulb to full brightness for about 2 hrs. I then progressed to aluminium foil and jam jars, but these used up too much bleach, so I filled the jam jars with marbles ( later quarz pebbles) as inert displacers. Later I used aluminium drinks cans. I have made loads since as demos to school kids and at Amateur Radio Rallies. The design was published in RadComm TT many years ago. At one rally I actually used one cell to re-charge some Nicads and then had a QSO on 2m using a 2W handheld. I did a test using a Coca Cola Can and a jumbo LED ( about 40 mA) - it lit it for a fornight continuously. Then the experiment was stopped because it was end of term and the lab techs wanted to clear up!</em></p>
<p><em>These cells work better if you use a carbon rod as the positive electrode. The off load terminal voltage is about 2 v. Salt will produce this sort of voltage, but the cell quickly polarizes, reducing the current. By using chlorate bleach, the hydrogen produced is oxidized to water and current is maintained. Chorate bleaches also contain sodium hydroxide which attacks aluminium whether you are drawing current or not, but this soon gets used up. However, it has the effect of etching the aluminium surface increasing its area and increases the current generating capability. Several of these cells would definitely work a QRP TX directly in an emergency.</em></p>
<p><em>Incidentally, I wrote to Guiness in the 70's to ask them to change the design of their cans. I tried theirs and was dissapointed with the results until I found that their cans were steel with aluminium tops. I explained that this was the worst possible combination of metals from the re-cycling point of view. They did change the design and they are now all aluminium. Whether or not I had any influence on it I don't know, but I would like to think so. Conerting aluminium metal back to electricity is NOT the most efficient way of recycling aluminium, Re-melting and re-processing is the most energy efficient and therefore money efficient way.</em></p>
<div><p><em>I have been toying with the idea of making a cell which uses seawater as the electrolyte. This would be flushed with fresh seawater every time a wave came up the beach. I reckon there might be enough oxygen in the sea water to depolarize the cell. Just the job if you are stuck on a desert island with only a pile of coke cans or bits of aircraft!.</em></p></div>

<p dir="auto">When you export diagrams to LaTeX, <strong>quiver</strong> will embed a link to the diagram, which will allow you
to return to it later if you decide it needs to be modified, or to share it with others.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other features</h3><a id="user-content-other-features" aria-label="Permalink: Other features" href="#other-features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Multiple selection, making mass changes easy and fast.</li>
<li>A history system, allowing you to undo/redo actions.</li>
<li>Support for custom macro definitions: simply paste a URL corresponding to the file containing your <code>\newcommand</code>s.</li>
<li>Export embeddable diagrams to HTML.</li>
<li>Panning and zooming, for large diagrams.</li>
<li>Smart label alignment and edge offset.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Importing macros and colours</h2><a id="user-content-importing-macros-and-colours" aria-label="Permalink: Importing macros and colours" href="#importing-macros-and-colours"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use custom macros and colours in <strong>quiver</strong>, create a file containing the definitions, like the
following.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="\newcommand{\cat}{\mathscr}
\newcommand{\psh}{\widehat}
\newcommand{\smcat}{\mathbb}
\newcommand{\yo}{よ}"><pre><span>\newcommand</span>{<span>\cat</span>}{<span>\mathscr</span>}
<span>\newcommand</span>{<span>\psh</span>}{<span>\widehat</span>}
<span>\newcommand</span>{<span>\smcat</span>}{<span>\mathbb</span>}
<span>\newcommand</span>{<span>\yo</span>}{よ}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Upload the file to a publicly accessible URL (for instance,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist.github.com</a>), and paste the URL for the raw text into the "Macros"
input at the bottom of <strong>quiver</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, macros may be defined using <code>\newcommand</code>, <code>\newcommand*</code>, <code>\renewcommand</code>,
<code>\renewcommand*</code>, <code>\DeclareMathOperator</code>, and <code>\DeclareMathOperator*</code>; and colours may be defined
using <code>\definecolor</code> (using the colour modes: <code>rgb</code>, <code>RGB</code>, <code>HTML</code>, <code>gray</code>).</p>

<p dir="auto">Run <code>make</code> from the command line, and then open <code>src/index.html</code> in your favourite web browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">If this fails, you might be using an incompatible version of Make or Bash. In this case, you can
manually download the <a href="https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases">latest release</a> of KaTeX and place
it under <code>src/</code> as <code>src/KaTeX/</code>. If KaTeX has not been given the correct path, you will get an
error telling you that KaTeX failed to load.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>quiver</strong> must be run through <code>localhost</code>. If you have Python installed, an easy solution is to
run:</p>

<p dir="auto">in the <strong>quiver</strong> <code>src</code> directory and then open <code>localhost:8000</code> in browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have any other problems building <strong>quiver</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/varkor/quiver/issues/new">open an
issue</a> detailing the problem and I'll try to help.</p>
