<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>LaTeX, which is pronounced "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech" (to rhyme with "blech" or "Bertolt Brecht"), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple RPG-oriented LaTeX templates: from old-school<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> to contemporary<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> ones. What are the Pros and Cons of using this academia-oriented tool for writing your tabletop rulebooks, adventures, or zines?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<h4 id="consistent-style">Consistent Style</h4>
<p>Just as I write this blog in Markdown, and the site's engine fashions it with consistent margins, fonts, and colors, LaTeX does the same (and much more) for the PDF it outputs. You specify the visual style once and forget about it (until you decide to shake things up a little), which allows you to concentrate on the writing.</p>
<h4 id="automation">Automation</h4>
<p>LaTeX does all the boring tasks for you. Table of contents? Index? List of tables? All will be accounted for and updated on its own.</p>
<h4 id="macros">Macros</h4>
<p>Not only LaTeX has a vast library of commands, but you could create your own, suited for your specific needs, including math operations and simple programming procedures.</p>
<h4 id="version-control-and-collaboration">Version Control and Collaboration</h4>
<p>Since the LaTeX source files are plain text, they are perfect for version control systems like Git.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> You'll have all the chronology of edits done you your documents, as well as benefits of working on a different branches and along with other people.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<h4 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve</h4>
<p>You <u>need</u> to know the syntax in depth to get the most of the LaTeX experience. You don't need to learn it all at once though — just extend your knowledge base when needed.</p>
<h4 id="installation-size">Installation Size</h4>
<p>TeX Live distribution with additional packages that I use to compile <a href="https://vladar4.github.io/itdr/" target="_blank">ItDR</a> takes almost 2 GB of space. Maybe not that much by modern standards, but you should keep that in mind.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="starting-point">Starting point</h2>
<p>It is not hard to find a LaTeX beginner-level tutorial. Here's <a href="https://physics.nyu.edu/~physlab/Lab_Main/Latexguide.pdf" target="_blank">one from the NYU</a>. Also, some kind of <a href="https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> will be useful.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>
<p>There are multiple editors available. My editor of choice is <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TeXstudio</a>, but you might find than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors">another one</a> will suit you better.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sty-files">STY files</h2>
<p>It is quite useful to keep all of your custom formatting parameters and macros in a separate file. Here is a quick reference on <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Writing_your_own_package" target="_blank">how to write your own packages</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>So, with that information in mind, here's a minimal working example of a LaTeX document.</p>
<p><strong><code>example.tex</code></strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>\documentclass</span><span>[10pt,twoside,twocolumn,openany]</span><span>{</span>book<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>example<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>[utf8]</span><span>{</span>inputenc<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>lipsum<span>}</span>

<span>\title</span><span>{</span><span>\scshape\LaTeX</span>~Example<span>}</span>
<span>\author</span><span>{</span>Vladar<span>}</span>

<span>\begin</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>

<span>\maketitle</span>

<span>\chapter</span><span>{</span>Example<span>}</span>

Here's an example of a custom command defined in <span>\verb</span>|example.sty| that formats a monster stat block:

<span>\statblock</span><span>[d6]</span><span>{</span>Orcs<span>}{</span>MV 40'; AC 6; HD 1; AB +1; <span>\#</span>AT 1 scimitar (1d8); SV F1; AL C; Int 7; ML 8; XP 10.<span>}{}</span>

<span>\vspace</span><span>{</span><span>\baselineskip</span><span>}</span>

What follows is a dummy ``Lorem ipsum'' text.

<span>\lipsum</span><span>[1-4]</span>

<span>\end</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong><code>example.sty</code></strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>\ProvidesPackage</span><span>{</span>example<span>}</span>

<span>\RequirePackage</span><span>{</span>xcolor<span>}</span>

<span>% \statblock[number]{Name}{stats}</span>
<span>% Outputs a monster statblock.</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\statblock</span><span>}</span>[3][1]<span>{</span><span>%</span>
    <span>\noindent</span>
    <span>\colorbox</span><span>{</span>black!20<span>}{</span><span>%</span>
    	<span>\parbox</span><span>{</span>0.98<span>\linewidth</span><span>}{</span><span>%</span>
    		<span>\textbf</span><span>{</span>#2 (#1)<span>}</span> #3
    	<span>}</span><span>% parbox</span>
    <span>}</span><span>% colorbox</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now try to compile it and see what you'll get!</p>
<hr>
<p>With this information, you can start tinkering with LaTeX and adapt it for your specific purposes. In the future I will highlight specific use-cases and some useful packages.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Concepts</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is a programming language adapted for socio-fiscal legislative literate
programming. By annotating each line of the legislative text with its meaning
in terms of code, one can derive an implementation of complex socio-fiscal
mechanisms that enjoys a high level of assurance regarding the code-law
faithfulness.</p>
<p dir="auto">Concretely, you have to first gather all the laws, executive orders, previous
cases, etc. that contain information about the socio-fiscal mechanism that
you want to implement. Then, you can proceed to annotate the text article by
article, in your favorite text editor :</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/ScreenShotVSCode.png"><img src="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/ScreenShotVSCode.png" alt="Screenshot" height="350"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Once your code is complete and tested, you can use the Catala
compiler to produce a lawyer-readable PDF version of your
implementation. The Catala language has been specially designed
in collaboration with law professionals to ensure that the code
can be reviewed and certified correct by the domain experts, which
are in this case lawyers and not programmers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/CatalaScreenShot.png"><img src="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/raw/master/doc/images/CatalaScreenShot.png" alt="Screenshot" height="350"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The Catala language is special because its logical structure mimics
the logical structure of the law. Indeed, the core concept of
"definition-under-conditions" that builds on default logic has been formalized
by Professor Sarah Lawsky in her article
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088206" rel="nofollow">A Logic for Statutes</a>.
The Catala language is the only programming language to our knowledge that
embeds default logic as a first-class feature, which is why it is the only
language perfectly adapted to literate legislative programming.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting started</h2>
<p dir="auto">To get started, the best place is the <a href="https://catala-lang.org/en/examples/tutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>
of the language. A <a href="https://catala-lang.org/fr/examples/tutoriel" rel="nofollow">French version</a>
is also available but might be out of sync with the latest language features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> bleeding-edge version</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are interested in the latest development version, pre-built artifacts
including binaries and API documentation can be found at
<a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala" rel="nofollow">https://catalalang.github.io/catala</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building and installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is available as an <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/catala/" rel="nofollow">opam package</a>!
If opam is installed on your machine, simply execute:</p>

<p dir="auto">To get the cutting-edge, latest version of Catala, you
can also do</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="opam pin add catala --dev-repo"><pre><code>opam pin add catala --dev-repo
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However, if you wish to get the latest developments of the compiler, you probably
want to compile it from the sources of this repository or use nix. For that, see
<a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/INSTALL.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Catala</h3>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>catala --help</code> if you have installed it to get more information about the
command line options available. The man page is also <a href="https://catala-lang.org/en/doc/catala" rel="nofollow">available
online</a>. To get the development version
of the help, run <code>make help_catala</code> after <code>make build</code>. The <code>catala</code> binary
corresponds to the Catala compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">The top-level <code>Makefile</code> contains a lot of useful targets to run. To display
them, use</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugin backends</h3>
<p dir="auto">While the compiler has some builtin backends for Catala (Python, Ocaml, etc.),
it is also possible to add a custom backend to the Catala compiler without
having to modify its source code. This plugin solution relies on dynamic
linking: see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/compiler/plugins/README.md">the dedicated README</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Clerk</h3>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>clerk --help</code> if you have installed it to get more information about the
command line options available. To get the development version of the help, run
<code>make help_clerk</code> after <code>make build</code>. The <code>clerk</code> binary corresponds to the
Catala build system, responsible for testing among other things.</p>
<p dir="auto">To get more information about Clerk, see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/tree/master/build_system/README.md">the dedicated readme</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Catleg</h3>
<p dir="auto">Catleg is a command line utility providing useful integration with
<a href="https://legifrance.gouv.fr/" rel="nofollow">LégiFrance</a>, the official repository of French
legal documentation. See the <a href="https://github.com/catalaLang/catleg">decidated
repository</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Syntax cheat sheet</h3>
<p dir="auto">A complete and handy reference of the Catala syntax can be found in the <a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala/syntax.pdf" rel="nofollow">cheat
sheet</a> (for French and English
versions of the syntax).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Formal semantics</h3>
<p dir="auto">To audit the formal proof of the partial certification of the Catala compiler,
see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/doc/formalization/README.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiler documentation</h3>
<p dir="auto">The documentation is accessible online, both for the <a href="https://catala-lang.org/ocaml_docs/" rel="nofollow">latest release</a> and <a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala/api-doc/" rel="nofollow">bleeding-edge version</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is otherwise generated from the compiler source code using
<code>dune</code> and <code>odoc</code>. Run</p>

<p dir="auto">to generate the documentation, then open the <code>doc/odoc.html</code> file in any browser.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">To explore the different programs written in Catala, see
<a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/examples/README.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API</h2>
<p dir="auto">To know how to use the code generated by the Catala compiler in your favorite
programming language, head to the <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/french_law/README.md">readme of the French law library</a>. The corresponding pre-built examples are also <a href="https://catalalang.github.io/catala/" rel="nofollow">available</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">To know how you can contribute to the project, see
<a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test suite</h2>

see <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/tests/README.md">the dedicated readme</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">License</h2>
<p dir="auto">The compiler and all the code contained in this repository is released under
the <a href="https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">Apache license (version 2)</a> unless another license is explicited
for a sub-directory.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations and disclaimer</h2>
<p dir="auto">Catala is a research project from Inria, the French National
Research Institute for Computer Science. The compiler is yet
unstable and lacks some of its features.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pierre Catala</h2>
<p dir="auto">The language is named after Pierre Catala, a professor of law who
pionneered the French legaltech by creating a computer database of law cases,
Juris-Data. The research group that he led in the late 1960s, the
Centre d’études et de traitement de l’information juridique (CETIJ),
has also influenced the creation by state conselor Lucien Mehl of the
Centre de recherches et développement en informatique juridique (CENIJ),
which eventually transformed into the entity managing the LegiFrance website,
acting as the public service of legislative documentation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Like a lot of troubled young men, I used to pay close attention to Apple’s developer conferences and special announcements, eagerly anticipating each new generation of iPhone and operating system. In the 2000s and 2010s these regular public demonstrations were filled with suspense and anticipation What would the phones look like this year? Which executive would Steve Jobs personally execute in a windowless room immediately following the presentation? Would the new iPhone finally solve my problems and make me happy?</p><p>Here in 2023, that air of mystery and expectation is gone. Every phone looks the same; every announcement has been widely leaked. But there is still a good reason to attend to Apple’s marketing extravaganzas: The fake texts.</p><p>I’m talking about the mocked-up texts and emails Apple puts together to demonstrate new messaging features in its operating-system updates, presumably written by some well-paid professionals in Apple’s marketing department. These eerily cheery, aggressively punctuated messages suggest a alternate dimension in which polite, good-natured, rigorously diverse groups of friends and coworkers use Apple products exactly how they are designed to be used, without complaint or error. Here are some of the more recent examples of what I am talking about, used to tout this year’s updates, iOS 17 and MacOS Sonoma: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png" width="1454" height="1064" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1064,&quot;width&quot;:1454,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:534353,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa522dc0b-be47-4816-b20b-0749a3c49f4d_1454x1064.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Every new update to Apple software brings along with it marketing materials populated by new casts of characters engaged in a new set of projects, but storylines are never elaborated, let alone resolved, and campaigns pass without any questions being answered. This year we have texts between an oddly formal soapbox derby team (???) and what seems to be a kind of stuffed-pasta club that is by all evidence annoyingly dominated by a man named Rich Dinh, taking suspiciously professional photographs of his own food:</p><p>If there is still mystery in Apple events, it is located here, in the uncanny fictional world suggested in these images: Who are these people? And what is wrong with them that they text like this?</p><p>A proper literary study of fake Apple texts has yet to be undertaken, but with the help of the Wayback Machine, we can sift through more than a decade’s work of marketing materials to identify certain trends and themes. For the sake of precision, let’s begin our survey in 2011, with the launch of iMessage in iOS 5.

What other powers does he possess? And why does he hate Andrew so much?</p><p>The denizens of Dimension Apple love the following things: Punctuation, trips, sharing photographs, using emoji, taking photographs, surprise parties. You might be inclined to say that they hate roasts, bits, gossip, cynicism, text abbreviations like “LOL,” and other standard features of texting in our dimension--but it is not at all clear to me that any of these things even exist in Dimension Apple to be hated. Like Android users, irony simply does not occur in Dimension Apple.</p><p>For a long time I have enjoyed the stilted, improbable cheeriness of fake Apple texts for their extreme distance from my own texting habits and experiences. (As my friend Emma put it to our group chat “if any of you texted me like this I would immediately call your significant others to make sure you hadn’t been kidnapped.”) But in the last year or so I have realized that Dimension Apple does exist--or at least overlaps with our own--in one very specific place: The WhatsApp groups that the parents at my son’s daycare/school create to share information or set up play dates. In these groups, and only in these groups, do I encounter the same kind of earnest helpfulness and baffling ebullience that exists in the Dimension Apple. Naturally, I find them totally alienating.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png" width="1456" height="94" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/baaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:94,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17721,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaaf9616-d7fe-48a1-bec6-64c6ac25f61c_1550x100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>To aid future study of the Dimension Apple, I’m publishing all the screenshots and images of fake Apple texts I was able to pull from the Wayback Machine below.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I’ve been getting a little obsessed with chili oil. A little…lost in
the sauce so to speak. Here’s some notes and general thoughts on chili oil.</p>

<p>There are two main ways of extracting flavor from chilies with oil:
hot flash or slow infusion. A hot flash basically means you heat up
the oil until it’s really hot, almost smoking , i.e. 375F. You pour it
over the chilies in one dramatic swoop. A slow infusion is less
dramatic. You heat the oil and infuse the chilies at a lower
temperature, say 200-250F.</p>
<p>In my experiments, the hot flash produces a noticably more intense
flavor with some roasted notes. However, with that flavor, there is
some bitterness. The slow infusion comes out milder, but no
bitterness. That said I’ve only tried at the above
temperatures. Perhaps a slow infusion at 250-300F or a hot flash at
325F could be better?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the hot flash creates an oil with the chili
pieces noticably suspended in the oil, while the slow infusion results
in an oil with the pieces all at the bottom. I suspect this is because
the chili pieces are more intensely fried in the hot flash one, which
either dissolves more soluble materials into the oil, making them
lighter, or causes the pieces to unfurl and be more buoyant.</p>
<p>In some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0aGgCuvH4">Chinese
videos</a> that I’ve
watched, people do a sort of hybrid style where you add hot oil
multiple times, with the idea to almost “temper” the oil, i.e. not put
such a large quantity of hot oil into the chilies all at once. I could
see that working too. They also temper with baijiu, i.e. strong
Chinese liquor. That could also potentially be another avenue for
extraction since alcohol is known to extract more flavor compounds
than water? Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, so maybe this could boost
spiciness?</p>
<p>This does put into question whether the ratio of oil to solid material
matters. I usually make the Serious Eats <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp">chili
crisp</a> recipe
by Sohla El-Waylly. It uses the hot flash method, but it also includes
a lot of other ingredients like ginger, cardamom, cumin, sugar,
mushroom powder, etc. Perhaps the sheer quantity of solids means more
thermal mass and therefore less overcooking?</p>
<p>I’ve also thought about doing a really low and slow extraction, say by
using a sous vide machine. You do run into food safety issues, since
the chilies can contain botulism.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could try doing multiple extractions at different
temperatures or even blending different styles.</p>
<h2 id="oil-type">Oil Type</h2>
<p>The easiest oil to use is a neutral oil of your choosing. It won’t add
any flavor, which will let the chilies shine through. This is fairly
important for experiments since you don’t want the taste of the oil to
obscure results (I learned this the hard way).</p>
<p>But there are some other options. Classic Sichuan oil is caiziyou, or
roasted rapeseed oil. It’s hard to find in the US, but you can get it
at more and more Chinese supermarkets or <a href="https://themalamarket.com/collections/regional-chinese-sauces-pickles/products/caizi-you-sichuan-roasted-rapeseed-oil">online at Mala
Market</a>. At
a Chinese supermarket, you’ll probably have to read some Chinese to
make sure you’re buying the right stuff. Caiziyou is nutty, roasted,
almost like a milder sesame oil. It’s great stuff to cook with and it
does make a nice chili oil. Budget-wise it is more expensive,
especially if you’re buying from Mala Market.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen people use clarified butter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJtOATAZl4">like
here</a>, or beef fat like
in hot pot bases. I imagine an olive oil could be good if you stick to
slow infusion.</p>
<p>Of course there are also combinations that could be made. Maybe a
chili oil with a little spike of beef fat just for flavor.</p>
<h2 id="chili-type">Chili Type</h2>
<p>I usually keep quite a few different kinds of dried chilies
around. Right now I have Thai birds-eyes, er ting jiao, xiao mi la,
kashmiri, Japones. Of course it’s hard to determine what exactly a lot
of chilies are, since there could be multiple names depending on the
country. Perhaps Japones are really Heaven-Facing chilies. Or xiao mi
la is birds-eye.</p>
<p>I used to spike the oil with some extra spicy chilies like ghost
peppers or Carolina reapers. I stopped doing that because they were
way more expensive than other chilies, it was extremely painful to
seed them and grind, and I wasn’t convinced they actually added that
much heat. One or two ghost peppers could easily be matched by a
couple handfuls of birds-eye or xiao mi la. Especially since these
super hot peppers are not always consistent in spice level. I did once
make a chili oil with chocolate bhutlah that was delightfully spicy.</p>
<p>I also used to spike the oil with some chipotle peppers to add some
smokiness. I might do an experiment to see how much of a difference
that actually made.</p>
<h2 id="spices--aromatics">Spices &amp; Aromatics</h2>
<p>Recipes run the gamut of no spices at all to lots and lots of
spices. Generally I’m of the view that more spices are better. But
this might be worth testing. I usually add star anise, black pepper
(often omitted, idk why), cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, black
cardamom. Potentially also cinnamon, and sand ginger.</p>
<p>There’s also aromatics like garlic, ginger, scallions, orange peel,
etc. In Sohla’s crisp recipe, you fry a bunch of crispy shallots and
garlic chips before making the oil. That way the oil gets infused with
lots of shallot and garlic flavor. I do love that, but it is a <em>lot</em>
of work.</p>
<h2 id="seasoning">Seasoning</h2>
<p>Should you season the chili oil? Most recipes do call for some salt,
which interestingly is not soluble in oil. I guess the salt ends up
sticking to the chilies and therefore seasoning that aspect. Some
recipes go as far as adding sugar, MSG, and other
MSG-alternatives. This is where the ontology of the chili oil
matters<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: Are you making a condiment or an ingredient? In my view,
a condiment should be seasoned sufficiently that it has some sort of
inherent tastiness. You’d be willing to eat a spoonful of ketchup or a
spoonful of mayo, even if it’d be a little intense. An ingredient does
not have to fulfill that requirement. Nobody’s just eating a spoonful
of flour. So a chili oil that’s an ingredient will omit sugar and MSG
and taste a little bland. That’s fine if you’re adding it to a dish
like a cold poached chicken, where there will be other seasoning. A
chili oil that’s a condiment will taste balanced on its own.</p>
<p>I do think if you add seasoning, you should go all the way and add
sugar, salt and MSG. They balance each other out really nicely.</p>
<p>If you add seasoning, you could be veering into a chili sauce or a
chili crisp. <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/homemade-chiu-chow-sauce/">Chiu chow chili
sauce</a> is a great
example. For a lot of people, especially in the US, what they consider
chili oil is actually chili crisp, specifically Lao Gan Ma, the most
popular brand by far. Lao Gan Ma actually has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douchi">douchi</a> or
fermented black beans. Note that these are fermented black <strong>soy</strong>
beans, not the black beans that we eat in the West. Personally I find
douchi a little too strong of a flavor. They’re intensely salty and
can overpower the rest of the ingredients.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the oil will stay a little bland
regardless because salt does not dissolve into oil. Interestingly
enough it appears that sugar does dissolve.</p>
<h2 id="chili-grinding">Chili Grinding</h2>
<p>For the longest time I used a spice grinder to blitz up the
chilies. It was fast and simple. I never loved the texture I got
though. You’d end up going too fine too quickly. Plus it tended to
create a lot of inhalable dust which made the process pretty painful.</p>
<p>I’ve recently switched over to toasting the chilies in a tiny bit of
oil, then pounding them in a mortar and pestle. It’s definitely more
manual labor, but you end up with these beautiful large flakes that
have great texture. It’s also releases less dust into the air. You do
have to make sure all of the chilies are properly toasted. They should
be shiny, lightly puffed up, and brittle. Otherwise you end up with
these large chunks that are too flexible to be ground down and end up
mixed into the flakes.</p>
<p>If we’re getting really nerdy here (and hey, this is already pretty
nerdy), I’d wonder about the particle distribution of grinding chilies
and how that affects flavor extraction. As any coffee nerd can tell
you, a spice grinder is pretty awful for grinding coffee because it
produces a very uneven particle distribution. You can end up with what
are called fines and boulders, fines being tiny, dust-like pieces of
coffee that create bitterness in the cup, and boulders being large
chunks that create sourness or emptiness in the cup. A mortar and
pestle isn’t that much better. If anything you end up more
bimodal. The end result is a bunch of large flakes covered with very
fine chili dust. Likely due to the combination of pounding and
grinding motions in the mortar and pestle. The pounding breaks the
chilies into big chunks, and the grinding produces the fine powder.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get better particle distribution? You could in
theory sift the chilies. But often times the powder appears stuck to
the flakes a little bit.</p>
<h2 id="styles">Styles</h2>
<p>So far we’ve mostly been talking about Chinese style chili oil,
specifically Sichuan style. But what about other chili oils? Salsa
macha is a very popular Mexican style. And you could argue that a
<a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-tadka-tarka-chaunk-chhonk-baghaar">tadka</a>
is essentially an ad-hoc chili oil made at the last second. Could you
make a batch of Indian chili oil in advance, say by infusing mustard
seeds, curry leaves, cumin and coriander in some ghee and substitute
it for a tadka? I bet you could.</p>
<p>As for more European flavors, ChefSteps does an interesting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCkeZb6tN-c">Thanksgiving flavored
oil</a>. I bet a Calabrian
chili oil would be incredible.</p>
<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>As you can see, there’s a lot of questions and ideas here. Therefore,
I’m gonna need to do some experiments! But first, we should think
about methodology and potential issues with the experiments. The most
important criterion for an experiment is
reproducibility. Unfortunately, that is rather hard with chili oil,
because the chilies are organic compounds with variable
spiciness. We’re also using manual grinding so grind size is not
easily controllable either. This means that while we can grind up a
batch of chilies, use them in two different oils, and compare, we
can’t necessarily compare these oils to oils from a separate
experiment. Of course we should still try to make the experiments as
reproducible as possible, so we should standardize the chili blend,
ratio, and so on.</p>
<p>It’s also important to make the base oil as neutral as possible. I
tried doing an experiment with caiziyou as the base oil, and its
nuttiness occluded any differences between the two chili oils.</p>
<p>Of course, like coffee, you can never get a fully reproducible
setup. Instead it’s probably best to make a bunch of oils, do some
experiments, then learn about the general variables and how they
affect the flavor. In coffee that’s grind size, temperature, time,
ratio, dose, brew style. Chili oil has likely similar variables.</p>
<p>Anyways, on to the potential experiments. Here are a few that I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infuse chilies at different temperatures</li>
<li>Hot flash chilies at different temperatures</li>
<li>Adjust the ratio of chilies to oil</li>
<li>Add alcohol to extract more flavor</li>
<li>How much do the spices actually affect the flavor?</li>
<li>Sous vide chili oil</li>
<li>Mortar and pestle vs spice grinder</li>
<li>Add oil for a hot flash multiple times.</li>
<li>Does stirring matter?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d love to hear if someone has other experiment ideas or other
thoughts about chili oil. Feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:nick@nicholasyang.com">nick@nicholasyang.com</a>!</p>

<section id="why">
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
Tech independence is <strong>not depending on any particular company or software</strong>.
</p><p>
The only tools you need are the common open source basics built into any Linux or BSD operating system — <strong>free public-domain tools that are not owned by anyone</strong>, and can run on any computer.
</p><p>
<strong>Learn a few of these basic tools</strong>, and you can run your own private server on any computer forever, for the rest of your life.
Host your own website and email.
Keep your own contacts and calendars synced with your phone.
Back up and sync your photos, movies, and music to your own private storage.
No more subscriptions needed.
</p><p>
You can <strong>ignore</strong> all the companies offering “<strong>solutions</strong>”, even if they are free, because they take away <strong>self-reliance</strong>.
The point is to <strong>know how to do it yourself</strong>, not to have somebody do it for you.
It’s worth a little up-front work, like learning how to drive.
</p><p>
Below are <strong>simple step-by-step instructions</strong> that work.
Instead of drowning you in options, it uses an operating system called <a href="https://sive.rs/openbsd">OpenBSD</a> and a hosting company called <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9541378-8H">Vultr</a> because I’ve used them for years and I know they are good and trustworthy.
But you could do this same setup with <strong>any free Linux or BSD operating system</strong>, with <strong>any hosting company</strong> that gives you “root” access to your own private server.
You could even do it on <strong>an old laptop in your closet</strong>.
</p><p>
So if a company turns evil or goes out of business, no problem!
You can set up a new server anywhere else in an hour, point your domain name to the new IP address, and it’s done.
<strong>That’s tech independence</strong> — never dependent on any particular provider or software.
It’s very empowering.
The instructions below will show you how.

<h2>Use your encypted storage</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://sive.rs/ti.sh">ti.sh</a> script will eventually prompt you, “Now upload anything while I wait...”.  Here’s how.</p>
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Type <code><strong>rsync -avz Documents <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span>:/mnt/</strong></code> and you will see it uploading your Documents folder to your private encrypted storage. Use this same format to upload any other folders, replacing “Documents” in the command. If you are happy synchonizing on the command line like this, you can skip over the next FreeFileSync section.</p>
<h3><a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a></h3>
<p>Everyone using <strong>Windows</strong> should <strong>use <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a></strong>. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://freefilesync.org/download.php">Download FreeFileSync</a> and please give an optional donation there if you can afford to. Donating also unlocks more features. Thanks to Jon Lis for the recommendation.</li>
<li>Install and open FreeFileSync.</li>
<li>Top-center: click the grey <strong>[Browse]</strong> button and find the folder with the stuff you want to upload.</li>
<li>Top-far-right: click the white <strong>cloud icon</strong> then <strong>SFTP</strong> at the top.</li>
<li>Server name or IP address: <span>yourdomain.name</span></li>
<li>Left side: click <strong>(*) Key File</strong></li>
<li>Username: <span>yourusername</span></li>
<li>Browse to find your <strong>private</strong> key, called <strong>id_ed25519</strong> from the “<a href="#ssh">Create an SSH key</a>” section. (Not the file that ends in “.pub”, but the one next to it.) NOTE: Because the /Users/<span>yourusername</span>/.ssh directory is “hidden” by Windows and Mac by default, I find it easier to just type the path directly, like this:<ul>
	<li><em>The username, for this next line, should be your username on your home computer, not your remote server.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Windows?</strong> Type <code><strong>C:\Users\<span>yourusername</span>\.ssh\id_ed25519</strong></code></li>
	<li><strong>Mac?</strong> Type <code><strong>/Users/<span>yourusername</span>/.ssh/id_ed25519</strong></code></li>
	</ul></li>
<li><strong>Directory on server</strong>: <strong>/mnt</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to go back to the main screen.</li>
<li>Top-right: click the <strong>green gear wheel</strong>.</li>
<li>Left button: click “<strong>MIRROR →</strong>”</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to go back to the main screen.</li>
<li>Top-center: click “<strong>COMPARE</strong>”, and make sure your files are there.</li>
<li>Top-right: click “<strong>SYNCHRONIZE Mirror →</strong>” then <strong>[Start]</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Verify and unmount</h3>
<ol>
<li>When it’s done uploading, <strong>log in to your server</strong> again, from your terminal.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>find /mnt</strong></code></li>
<li>You should see a long list of the files you uploaded.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>m-x</strong></code> to detach your encrypted storage.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>find /mnt</strong></code> again, and now you should see nothing there! Congratulations! You now see <strong>how this will work in the future</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Log in and type “<code><strong>m</strong></code>” to <strong>attach</strong> your encrypted storage.</li>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> your files with rsync or FreeFileSync.</li>
<li>Log in and type “<code><strong>m-x</strong></code>” to <strong>detach</strong> the storage, for security.</li>

<h2>Contacts and Calendar</h2>
<p>
Your phone currently keeps its contacts and calendars with Google or Apple.
Now you can get them off the cloud and keep them privately on your own server.
</p><p>
My <a href="https://sive.rs/ti.sh">ti.sh</a> setup script installs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> server for contacts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> server for calendars.
</p><p>
Here’s how to connect your phone.
</p>
<h3>Android phone</h3>
<p>You need an app called “<a href="https://www.davx5.com/"><strong>DAVx⁵</strong></a>”, so <a href="https://www.davx5.com/download">install it first</a>. Then…</p>

<h2>Email settings</h2>
<p>To do email from your phone, computer, or anywhere else, you now have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a> server, called <a href="https://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a>.
So on any device, you can <strong>add a new IMAP Mail account</strong>, with these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account type: IMAP</li>
<li>Email address: <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span></li>

<li>Connection security: SSL</li>
<li>Authentication type: Basic authentication</li>
</ul>

<section id="web1">
<h2>Simple website</h2>
<ol>
<li>On your home computer, in your main home directory, <strong>make a directory/folder called “htdocs”</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/file/template.html">Download this file called “template.html”</a> and save it in your “htdocs” directory.</li>
<li><a href="https://sive.rs/file/style.css">Download this file called “style.css”</a> and also save it in your “htdocs” directory.</li>
<li><strong>Make a copy</strong> of the “template.html” file, and <strong>name the copy “index.html”</strong>. This will be your home page.</li>
<li><strong>Edit the index.html file</strong> in a text editor (NotePad or TextEdit) and change my default text to whatever you want.</li>
<li>When you need to add a new page, just <strong>copy the template again</strong>, call it “about.html” or whatever, and make a link to it from the home page.  The header of each page will link back to index.html : your home page.</li>
<li>If you want to <strong>change the look</strong> of your site, just edit the style.css file.  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+tutorial">Search the web for “CSS tutorial”</a> if needed.</li>
<li><strong>To upload it</strong> to your public server, do one of the next two steps:</li>
<li>Apple Mac? <strong>Open a new terminal window</strong> on your computer, type <br><code><strong>rsync -avz htdocs <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span>:/var/www/</strong></code></li>
<li>Windows? <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFileSync</a> again, but now change the “<strong>Directory on server</strong>” to <strong>/var/www/</strong> (you can find it by clicking [browse] or typing it directly) then upload this htdocs directory there.</li>
<li>Go to https://<span>yourdomain.name</span> in your web browser, <strong>refresh the page</strong>, and you should see your updated website.</li>
<li>Any trouble, just know that the goal is to get that index.html file into this location on your server: <code><strong>/var/www/htdocs/index.html</strong></code> because that’s where the web server is expecting it to be. That’s where we put the original test file, so your new <code>index.html</code> file should replace that one.</li>
<li>If you want <strong><a href="https://sive.rs/su">short URLs</a></strong>, without the .html, you can (for everything except index.html) because I set the default type to be HTML. Just remove the “.html” from your HTML filenames, update your links, and voilà!</li>
</ol>
It’s important to know how to make a simple website by hand, and not let people sell you on complex solutions that are the equivalent of saying you need a jumbo jet when you really need a bicycle.
For real tech independence, start by typing your HTML files yourself.
Only later, after you have many <em>many</em> pages, consider a more complicated solution.
</section>


<section id="web2">
<h2>File sharing in /pub/</h2>
<p>
Your website is configured to list all files in the /pub/ directory of your website.
So basically anything in /var/www/htdocs/pub/ is public.
Upload any files you want to share.
</p><p>
It replaces Dropbox and similar services for sending big files.
Just upload the file to /var/www/htdocs/pub/
then find it in your web browser, copy its URL, and send someone the URL.
</p>
<p>
If the files you want to share are already on your computer, then just <strong>make a pub/ directory inside htdocs/</strong> (so, <strong>htdocs/pub/</strong>), put your files in there, then use FreeFileSync or rsync to upload them as you did in the previous section called “<a href="#web1">Simple website</a>”.
Consider them part of your website.
</p><p>
Or if you have a URL from somewhere else online that you want to download to your server, just do it as we did in the numbered steps above.
Then use FreeFileSync or rsync to download from your server to your computer first, before your next upload sync.
</p>

<section id="indie">
<h2>More indie tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> in Firefox and Chrome.</li>
<li>In Firefox settings, under “Privacy and Security”, choose “[X] Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed”, then close Firefox often to erase all your cookies and logins. Browse the web anonymously, not logged-in.</li>
<li>Replace Google Authenticator with <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis on Android</a> or <a href="https://raivo-otp.com/">Raivo on iPhone</a>.</li>
<li>If you use Windows, replace it with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu Linux</a>. (Use both at first, then slowly transition.)</li>
<li>Keep your new email address as a <a href="https://sive.rs/pe">private email account</a> that you only give to those few people who you really want to hear from.  Then your old gmail/yahoo/outlook/etc address can be just low-priority junk, and your new private email account won’t need spam protection.</li>
<li>Or if you don’t want to run your own email server, use <a href="https://mailbox.org/">Mailbox.org</a> or <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> but <strong>only</strong> by using your own domain name. Be <span>yourusername</span>@<span>yourdomain.name</span> from now on. Don’t depend on anyone else’s domain for your email or you’ll be stuck with them.</li>
</ol>

<section id="storage5">
<h2>More storage?</h2>
<p>
If you need hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes of storage, I recommend Hetzner’s “<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Storage Box</a>”.
It’s the best storage value I’ve found.
Also consider <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal">Backblaze Personal Backup</a>.
</p><p>
I personally use Vultr’s storage (as described above) for sensitive information I definitely want completely encrypted.
Then I use Hetzner’s Storage Box for all my photos, videos, music, and other big files that don’t absolutely need to be encrypted.
</p>

<section id="mutt">
<h2>Mutt = email in the terminal</h2>
<p>Unless you want to read email directly on your server, skip this step.</p>
<ol>
<li>ssh in to your server, then <strong>type <code>mutt</code></strong></li>
<li>You should see the subject headers, with the first email highlighted. <strong>Type <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> a few times</strong> to go down and up the list of emails.</li>
<li>To <strong>read an email, hit [enter] or [return]</strong> when it is highlighted.</li>
<li>To go <strong>back to the list, type <code>i</code></strong> (for “index”)</li>
<li><strong>To reply, hit <code>r</code></strong> then:<ul>
	<li>It shows “<code>To:</code>” so you can edit or add recipients. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> to leave it.</li>
	<li>It shows “<code>Subject:</code>” so you can edit the subject. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> to leave it.</li>
	<li>It asks “<code>Include message in reply? ([yes]/no/?):</code>”. <strong>Hit [enter] or [return]</strong> for the usual norm of echoing someone’s email back at them below your reply. Or <code>n</code> for not.</li>
	<li>Now you are inside the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vi+editor"><strong>vi</strong> text editor</a> which is not self-explanatory, so I’ll walk you through a simple reply:</li>
	<li>Hit <code><strong>i</strong></code> (no [return] or [enter]) to go into “insert mode” and <strong>type your message</strong>. You’ll notice it’s on the same line as some other text, so you might want to start by hitting [return] or [enter] a few times, then <strong>up-arrow</strong> to go back to the first line again.</li>
	<li>When done typing your message, <strong>hit your [esc] key</strong> in the very top-left corner of your keyboard. Nothing will change on the screen, yet.</li>
	<li>Type <code><strong>:wq</strong></code> (the “:” at the beginning is important) then [enter] or [return].</li>
	<li>Then you’ll see the “Compose Menu” which I think of as the “last chance before sending” screen. <strong>Hit <code>y</code> to send it</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To <strong>send a new email</strong>, hit <code><strong>m</strong></code> then repeat those steps like you did for a reply, except now the “<code>To:</code>” and “<code>Subject:</code>” are blank and waiting for you to create. (For “<code>To:</code>”, type the email address of the person you’re emailing.)</li>
<li>To <strong>quit</strong>, hit <code><strong>q</strong></code></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt</a> is a great program for reading and sending email on the command line. It’s been my email client for 20 years. <a href="http://mutt.org/doc/manual/">Read its manual here</a> if you want to go deeper. It does everything.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vi+editor">vi text editor</a> is a useful tool to edit text on a server. It takes a few minutes to learn, but it’s worth learning because it’s installed by default on every Linux/BSD server.</p>
</section>


<section id="upkeep">
<h2>Upkeep</h2>
<p>
You honestly don’t have to do anything to maintain your server.
It will just work as-is for decades!
But if you like to keep it up-to-date, it only takes a minute, so run these next steps any time.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to your server</strong>, if you are not already.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>doas su</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>syspatch</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>fw_update</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>pkg_add -u</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>sysupgrade</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>exit; exit</strong></code> to log out.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that last “<code>sysupgrade</code>” step did <strong>not</strong> give an “Error retrieving … 404 Not Found” error, that means your OpenBSD operating system is upgrading itself. They release an upgrade every 6 months. In that case, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/">go to this OpenBSD page</a> and follow the link at the top that says “<strong>Upgrading to</strong> (7.4, etc)” to see if there’s anything else you should know.
</p><p>
If the “<code>sysupgrade</code>” step updated your operating system and your server rebooted, then there is just one more step:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Log in to your server</strong>, if you are not already.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>doas su</strong></code></li>
<li>Type <code><strong>sysmerge</strong></code></li>
<li>Follow any instructions. Don’t worry about messing up because you can always start over, as described below.</li>
<li>Re-do the <code>syspatch ; fw_update ; pkg_add -u</code> steps, above.</li>
<li>Type <code><strong>exit; exit</strong></code> to log out.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="redo">
<h2>Trouble? Start over</h2>
<p>I’ve tested the steps above very carefully and repeatedly. They work. So if you hit a major problem, something not happening like it says it should, please do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type “<code><strong>cd ; m-x ; exit</strong></code>” in any terminals you still have open, until they are all closed.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://my.vultr.com/">your Vultr account</a>.</li>
<li>See your server instance?  See to the far right, a subtle <strong>···</strong>?  Click that.</li>
<li>From its pop-up menu, click the last option: “<strong>Server Destroy</strong>”.</li>
<li><strong>Tick the box</strong> next to “[X] Yes, destroy this server.”</li>
<li>Click the big red <strong>[Destroy Server]</strong> button.</li>
<li>This will not destroy your encrypted storage. That’s another reason we kept it separate from the start. So <strong>if</strong> you already uploaded a bunch of your files and want to save them, they should still be there.</li>
<li>On your own computer, <strong>in the terminal, type: <code>rm .ssh/known_hosts</code></strong></li>
<li>Go back to the section called “<a href="#server1">Create your server</a>” and try again.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="questions">
<h2>Questions? Additions?</h2>
<p>
<strong>To learn more</strong> about your new server, just <strong>log in</strong> and type: <code><strong><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/help">help</a></strong></code><br>
It will teach you the basics.
Then for each command or file you want to know more about, type <code><strong><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.1">man</a></strong></code> followed by the command or filename.
So for example, log in and type…</p><ul>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/adduser.8">adduser</a></strong></code></li>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh</a></strong></code></li>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/doas.1">doas</a></strong></code></li>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rcctl.8">rcctl</a></strong></code></li>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add</a></strong></code></li>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp</a></strong></code></li>
<li><code><strong>man <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf.5">httpd.conf</a></strong></code></li>
</ul>
<p>
Hit your [space] bar to scroll the page, then <code><strong>q</strong></code> to quit.
</p><p>
It’s one of the most wonderful things about OpenBSD: <strong>everything you need to know is in those <code>man</code> pages!</strong>
No need for YouTube, Google, ChatGPT, or any other advertising-driven sources of information.
</p><p>
I will constantly improve this page, so <a href="https://sive.rs/contact">get on my private email list</a> for updates.

		<div data-first_letter="M">
		<p>Macs have brought a great deal to us over the years: desktop publishing, design, image editing and processing, multimedia, and more. One of the few fields where they have failed is programming, despite many attempts. Here I look back at some of those opportunities we missed.</p>
<h4>HyperTalk (1987)</h4>
<p>First released in 1987, Apple’s hypertext authoring environment HyperCard contained its own scripting language, HyperTalk. For many of those who built brilliant HyperCard stacks, this new scripting language was the first programming language they had used. Sadly, although seriously cool in its day, HyperTalk was both limited and limiting, as most came to discover. By 2000, HyperCard and HyperTalk were all but dead.</p>
<h4>AppleScript (1993)</h4>
<p>In some respects a successor to HyperTalk, AppleScript was released in October 1993, with System 7 Pro version 7.1.1, making it almost thirty years old. Despite all the odds, and several determined attempts to strangle it, it’s still supported in macOS Sonoma.</p>
<p>The concept behind AppleScript is simple: scripts that compile to a series of instructions for dispatch by macOS to their destination application, which in turn is controlled by those commands to perform a co-ordinated sequence of functions. At their simplest, these can open a document and print it, for instance. At their most complex, they can automate intricate and repetitive tasks that are messy in a GUI.</p>
<p>As a minimum, every application supports a small core of commands to play clean with the Finder and macOS. Those, and the suites of additional commands that bring joy to the scripter, are documented in standard formats within each application’s <em>dictionary,</em> which can be browsed by Script Editor and other tools. Rather than having to locate additional documentation sets specific to each application, all a scripter should need to do is open the dictionary.</p>
<p>Complexity comes because AppleScript is in fact an object-oriented language as sophisticated as Objective-C, as used by pro Mac developers; don’t be deceived by its apparently relaxed and informal style, with examples such as<br>
<code>tell application "System Events"<br>
set mailIsRunning to application process "Mail" exists<br>
end tell<br>
if mailIsRunning then<br>
-- do one thing<br>
else<br>
-- do another thing<br>
end if</code></p>
<p>You might use that code to set up a script that interacts with the Mail app. It first asks macOS whether it knows that Mail is running, and depending on the answer it executes the code that you insert where the comments (prefaced by <code>‘--‘</code> characters) are placed. Unlike the majority of programming languages, punctuation marks are used sparsely in AppleScript, making it considerably easier to write code that works, rather than tripping over a missing semicolon.</p>
<p>When ready to test your script, it compiles into intermediate code, and the editor automatically checks, formats and colours your source code, reporting any errors that it finds. When run, the intermediate code works through macOS to fire off AppleEvents (AEvents) to trigger the target applications to perform the actions.</p>
<p>Although it was integrated into Apple’s Xcode as AppleScript Studio, in recent years it has been left to languish, with occasional rumours of its demise.</p>
<h4>Prograph (1989)</h4>
<p>Innovative languages for Macs haven’t been Apple’s preserve. In 1989, the visual programming language Prograph was launched on the Mac. Sometimes described as a dataflow language, and thoroughly object-oriented, it won awards, was ported to Windows in the late 1990s, but was last seen running as Marten in Yosemite.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png"><img data-attachment-id="5471" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/2015/11/16/polyglot-programmer-visual-programming-with-marten-prograph/marten1/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png" data-orig-size="606,610" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="marten1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=298" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=606" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=940" alt="marten1" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png 606w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/marten1.png?w=298&amp;h=300 298w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"></a></span></p>
<p>In this example method, data flows from the top to the bottom. Normally terminals on the top ‘shelf’ of the method diagram represent the inputs to that method. Data then flows from the top shelf through the intermediate processes, until it reaches the bottom. If there are outputs from the method, they are gathered by connections made to terminals on the bottom ‘shelf’ in the method. Order of execution is not prescribed, and can take place whenever data is available; this allows for inherent concurrency, and the potential to exploit multiprocessor systems without the need for language primitives.</p>
<h4>Automator (2005)</h4>
<p>Even ‘natural’ programming languages like AppleScript have to be learned, a task that many find too verbal and mechanical. Recognising this, Apple introduced <em>Automator</em> in OS X 10.4 in 2005 to help produce custom workflows and apps using more intuitive visual tools.</p>
<p>Although often assumed to be a development of AppleScript, apart from its ability to run AppleScript objects, Automator is actually very different. Instead of relying on AppleEvents and dictionaries, Automator’s modular actions are separate code objects installed in the Automator folder in a Library folder. macOS comes with a huge free library of actions that can accomplish tasks you might pay good money for, so familiarity can save you cost.</p>

<p>Automator is highly extensible, as its actions can include both AppleScript code and Terminal shell scripts. Thus if you cannot find a standard action to do what you want, if it can be expressed in a suitable script, you can build that into your workflow. Nevertheless, in 2021 Apple announced that Automator was to be succeeded by Shortcuts.</p>
<h4>Swift Playgrounds (2014-16)</h4>
<p>From the early days of the Mac, Apple has invested in programming languages designed to make best use of its APIs. In Classic times, that was Object Pascal, and its open-source class library MacApp. In 2014, Apple released a new language destined to be its preferred choice across all its platforms, Swift. From those early days, Swift has had an interactive mode, based on the ‘read-eval-print loop’ (REPL) popularised by Lisp. This versatility has been developed in Swift Playgrounds, both within Xcode and as a standalone app targeted at children (and adults) learning to code for the first time.</p>

<p>As an introduction to Swift in education, this has been impressive, but it hasn’t proved a gateway for those who didn’t really want to learn how to use Xcode in the first place.</p>
<h4>Shortcuts (2014-21)</h4>
<p>Shortcuts started out in the winter of 2014-15 as Workflow by DeskConnect. Apple bought it in 2017, and it became Shortcuts the following year, when it was integrated into Siri in iOS 12. Its arrival in macOS 12 was announced at WWDC in 2021, as Automator’s ultimate successor.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="61698" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/shortcuts1/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg" data-orig-size="1372,1029" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="shortcuts1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=940" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=940" alt="shortcuts1" srcset="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg 1372w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/shortcuts1.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px"></span></p>
<p>While Shortcuts on macOS can run AppleScript and shell scripts, the mechanisms involved in Shortcuts’ actions are completely different from AppleScript and Automator. For an app to support all three well requires it to present four different interfaces: one for the user in the GUI, AppleEvents, Automator actions, and now Shortcuts actions.</p>

<p>While Shortcuts has attracted quite a following, its impact has so far been limited. Like all its predecessors, it hasn’t yet brought programming to the people.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In Rust, there are certain API decisions about what is and isn’t sound that impact all Rust code.
That is, a decision was made to allow or not allow types which have certain safety requirements, and
now all users are committed to that decision. They can’t just use a different API with different
rules: <em>all</em> APIs must conform to these rules.</p><p>These rules are determined through certain “marker” traits. If a safe API could do something to a
value of a type which some types don’t support, the API must be bound by that marker trait, so that
users can not pass values of those types which don’t support that behavior to that API. In contrast,
if Rust allows APIs to perform that behavior on any type, without any sort of marker trait bound,
then types which don’t support that behavior cannot exist.</p><p>I’m going to give three examples to show what I mean, each of which Rust has considered at different
points, though only the first one actually exists in Rust.</p><h2 id="rules-of-rust">Rules of Rust</h2><h3 id="send"><code>Send</code></h3><p>Let’s say you want Rust to support types which can’t be sent across threads. There are a couple of
examples of <em>why</em> you would want this:</p><ul><li>The type provides shared ownership without synchronizing interior mutable writes to the reference
count (e.g. <code>Rc</code>)</li><li>The type may wrap an OS API that doesn’t guaranteee thread safety (e.g. <code>Args</code>, <code>MutexGuard</code>)</li></ul><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Send</code>, which is the set of types which
<em>can</em> be sent across threads. Any API which might send a value to another thread needs to include a
<code>Send</code> bound, such as:</p><ul><li><code>thread::spawn</code>, which spawns a thread</li><li><code>rayon::join</code>, which runs two tasks on a thread pool</li><li><code>tokio::spawn</code>, which may move this task to another thread of the executor</li></ul><p>Of course, Rust chose to support types which can’t be sent across threads, and so it has a <code>Send</code>
bound. But an alternative Rust could have just as easily chosen that <em>all</em> types in Rust must
support sending across threads, and effectively all interior mutability would need to be
synchronized. Indeed, the <code>Send</code> trait is actually a decision fully enforced by the standard
library: someone could release an “alternative libcore” which imposes this requirement with no
change to rustc, though it wouldn’t be compatible with any of the Rust code that exists in the
world.</p><h3 id="move"><code>Move</code></h3><p>Let’s say you want Rust to support types which can’t be invalidated without running their destructor
once their address has been witnessed. This is a sort of wonky and specific definition of
“immoveable type,” but it happens to fit perfectly for what stackless coroutines and intrusive
data structures require.</p><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Move</code>, which is the set of types that can
be moved freely. Unlike <code>Send</code>, <code>Move</code> requires some language support: I think the simplest way to
implement it would be to say that operations that take the address of something take ownership of
types if they don’t implement <code>Move</code> (so <code>let x = &amp;mut y;</code> takes ownership of <code>y</code>, effectively
preventing you from ever moving it again.) And the magic behavior of <code>Box</code> which lets you move out
of it would need to be bound by <code>Move</code> as well.</p><p>Additionally, certain APIs would need to be bounded by <code>Move</code>, which let you move out of a
reference, such as:</p><ul><li><code>mem::swap</code> lets you swap values behind two mutable references</li><li><code>mem::replace</code> lets you replace the value behind a mutable reference with another</li></ul><p>You’ll notice that Rust doesn’t have a <code>Move</code> trait; instead, it provides the same guarantees using
the <code>Pin</code> wrapper around pointer types. Even though the <code>Move</code> trait would have probably been a
much easier to use API, it proved difficult to add in a backward compatible way (I’ll explain why in
a moment), so instead the <code>Pin</code> API was added and used only in the new interfaces that required
these semantics.</p><h3 id="leak"><code>Leak</code></h3><p>Let’s say you want Rust to support types which can’t go out of scope without running their
destructor. This is one of the two different definitions of “linear types,” it is less expressive
than the other (which would also prevent a destructor from running, requiring the type to be
destructured as its final end), but it is the easier of the two to add to the language (because it
works better with generics), and it supports all of the most compelling use cases for linear types.</p><p>To support this, you would include a marker trait called <code>Leak</code>, which is the set of types that can
go out of scope without running their destructors. Like <code>Send</code> and unlike <code>Move</code>, this would require
no language support at all: its not possible to “leak” a value in the core language of Rust, you
have to use standard library APIs to do it.</p><p>Certain APIs would have to be bound by <code>Leak</code>:</p><ul><li>APIs that always leak a value (<code>mem::forget</code>)</li><li>APIs that make it your responsibility to run the destructor (<code>ManuallyDrop::new</code>)</li><li>APIs that allow cyclic shared ownership and can accidentally leak values (<code>Rc::new</code>, <code>Arc::new</code>)</li></ul><p>Of course, Rust doesn’t have the <code>Leak</code> trait, but it almost did. This discussion came to a head in
early 2015, when the scoped thread API that Rust was using was found to be unsound, because its
safety depended on its guard type never leaking. It was decided (in some haste, because the 1.0
release was scheduled within a few months of the controversy) that Rust would not support types that
can’t be leaked, and so the <code>Leak</code> trait would not be added.</p><h2 id="changing-the-rules">Changing the rules</h2><p>There’s been a renewed interest in supporting linear types in Rust, especially because of what I
called the <a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-scoped-task-trilemma">scoped task trilemma</a>, which is only true because of the fact that destructors
cannot be guaranteed to run. Unlike immoveable types, there is no isolated API addition that could
support guaranteeing that a destructor will run, the way there was with <code>Pin</code>. (You can guarantee a
destructor will run if you never give up ownership of the object and use a kind of closure passing
style, but this isn’t adequate for the “scoped task” use case). So some users would like to see Rust
add a <code>Leak</code> trait.</p><p>There are two possible ways a marker trait like <code>Leak</code> could be added to Rust:</p><ol><li><strong>Auto trait:</strong> you could add a new auto trait, like <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code></li><li><strong>?Trait:</strong> you could add a new “?Trait,” like <code>Sized</code></li></ol><p>Each of these presents certain challenges regarding backward compatibility.</p><h3 id="auto-traits">Auto traits</h3><p>At first glance, adding auto traits might seem like a backward compatible change. You add a new
trait, <code>Leak</code>, which says that a type can be leaked. Types that don’t implement this trait
cannot go out of scope without running their destructor. Because all types in Rust today necessarily
can be leaked (this is a consequence of the decision <em>not</em> to have a <code>Leak</code> trait), its perfectly
fine for all types to implement <code>Leak</code>. This is the semantics of an auto trait, so it sounds like it
should work great.</p><p>The problem comes when you go to add bounds to the APIs that can be used to leak values, like <code>mem::forget</code>. If you want to make it so that types that don’t implement <code>Leak</code>d
cannot be leaked, you need to add a bound to <code>mem::forget</code>. But there are two ways in which this
is not backward compatible.</p><p>First, it does not work with generics. This code is legal today, but would break if you add a
<code>Leak</code> bound to <code>mem::forget</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_generic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is because there is no <code>Leak</code> bound on the type parameter for this function. Adding such a
bound to the API of <code>mem::forget</code> (or any other API that can forget values) would be a breaking
change.</p><p>Another way in which it is not backward compatible is that trait object types will not implement
<code>Leak</code> unless they add <code>+ Leak</code>. Trait object types do not inherit impls by way of auto traits,
because you don’t actually know what type the trait object is. So a trait object like <code>dyn Future</code>
does not implement <code>Leak</code>. For example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_trait_object</span><span>(</span><span>object</span>: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span><span> </span><span>Display</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="traits">?Traits</h3><p>So if adding an auto trait is not backward compatible, we are left turning to the <code>?Trait</code> solution.
But there are problems here as well.</p><p>in the strictest sense, adding a new trait like <code>?Leak</code> is backward compatible. Instead of adding
new bounds to APIs like <code>mem::forget</code>, you would be <em>relaxing</em> the bounds on other APIs. So all of
the code above would be fine, because to make a generic function that takes a linear type, you would
have to write a <code>?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>The first problem with this for something like <code>Leak</code> is that the vast majority of generic APIs in
Rust cannot possibly forget their value; after all, even though memory leaks are not undefined
behavior, they are still undesirable and mostly avoided. This is quite different from <code>Sized</code>:
because passing something by value requires <code>Sized</code>, the large majority of generic APIs in Rust
require <code>Sized</code>, and so <code>?Sized</code> bounds are relatively rare. In contrast, adding <code>?Leak</code> would
create a permanent scar across the ecosystem, as the vast majority of generics would gain a <code>T: ?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>The second problem is bigger, though: the interaction between <code>?Traits</code> and associated types means
that it is a breaking change to add a <code>?Trait</code> bound to an associated type. This means that any
stable associated type in the standard library cannot gain a <code>?Leak</code> bound.</p><p>Consider this example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>forget_iterator</span><span>(</span><span>iter</span>: <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>iter</span><span>.</span><span>for_each</span><span>(</span><span>mem</span>::<span>forget</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will forget every element of the iterator, even though the <code>Iterator::Item</code> associated type is
never mentioned. Therefore, <code>Iterator::Item</code> must implement <code>Leak</code>, always. The compiler is allowed
to assume that the item of every iterator implements <code>Leak</code>, and it would be a breaking change to
invalidate that assumption.</p><p>The implications of this are far reaching. If <code>Leak</code> were added as a <code>?Trait</code>, all of these things
would not be possible with linear types:</p><ul><li><strong>Iterator:</strong> You couldn’t construct an iterator of linear types.</li><li><strong>Future:</strong> You couldn’t construct a future that evaluates to a linear type (and so you couldn’t
return a linear type from an async function).</li><li><strong>Deref:</strong> You couldn’t dereference a Box containing a linear type, or dereference a vector of
linear types to a slice of linear types, or any other smart pointer type.</li><li><strong>Index:</strong> You couldn’t index a collection of a linear type, so you couldn’t index into a slice of
linear types or into a map with linear values.</li><li><strong>Add/Sub/Mul/Div:</strong> You couldn’t have a linear type as the output value of any overloaded
arithmetic operator.</li></ul><p>One special set of associated types is the return value of the <code>Fn</code> traits. The Rust project has
specifically made it difficult to refer to the <code>Output</code> associated type of these traits, so that it
would have flexibility to change this in the future. Still, certain issues were encountered in the
past when experimenting with a <code>Move</code> trait. It’s not clear to me if these issues would have been
encountered with other traits (like <code>Leak</code>) or if they were specific to the built-in semantics of
<code>Move</code>.</p><p>Basically, there is a very steep trade off in choosing to add a new <code>?Trait</code> - especially one that
wouldn’t be relevant to very many bounds, like <code>Leak</code> - because you will add confusing new syntax to
a huge variety of generic interfaces in exchange for getting a very limited new feature. I would
consider adopting something like <code>?Leak</code> a poor cost-benefit analysis, even if we do accept that the
current Rust rules are “wrong” and we wish Rust had linear types.</p><h3 id="editions">Editions</h3><p>The final thing that needs to be considered is the edition mechanism. Is it possible, using the
edition mechanism, to introduce one of these traits? Maybe.</p><p>Each edition in effect forms a “dialect” of Rust, all of which are supported by the same compiler.
So at first glance it sounds plausible that in one dialect of Rust, all types can be forgotten, and
in another dialect, the <code>Leak</code> trait exists. The problem is that a hard requirement on editions is
that crates from one edition can depend on crates from another edition, so that the upgrade from one
edition to the next is seamless and voluntary.</p><p>Consider that the Rust project decided to add the <code>Leak</code> trait in the 2024 edition. All of the
code in the 2021 edition needs to still work - including code like the examples I showed above.
Sure, you can use a tool like cargo fix to add <code>Leak</code> bounds everywhere and expect users to relax
them on their own as they move into the 2024 edition, but the code from the 2021 edition needs to
work without modification.</p><p>A way to possibly do this would be to make trait coherence depend on edition, so that in pre-2024
editions, every type meets the <code>Leak</code> bounds, even types that absolutely shouldn’t, like unbounded
generics, and trait object types that don’t mention <code>Leak</code>. If, in the pre-2024 editions, all
types implement <code>Leak</code>, then the added bounds will never fail.</p><p><em>However</em> - and this is the big, enormous caveat of this section - this would rely on the compiler
effectively implementing some kind of unbreakable firewall, to prevent a type that does not
implement <code>Leak</code> from ever getting used with pre-2024 code. This would mean:</p><ul><li>Any time post-2024 code instantiates a generic from pre-2024 code, it needes to check that the
type it instatiates it with implements <code>Leak</code>, even though the pre-2024 code doesn’t have such a
bound.</li><li>Any time pre-2024 code calls post-2024 code, it needs to check that the types it gets from that
API implement <code>Leak</code> (under the 2024 edition rules). Note that the standard library would be
considered post-2024 code, so every call to a std API would involve checking types for <code>Leak</code> in
the pre-2024 editions.</li></ul><p>I don’t know if this is even possible to implement, probably it would have pretty bad effect on
compile times at least on pre-2024 edition code, and it would likely create a very difficult
transition at first. But in the longer term at least it would leave <code>Leak</code> in the “right” state
(as an auto trait, which can be used with old associated types correctly, and not as a ?Trait).</p><h2 id="what-should-be-done">What should be done</h2><p>If I could go back in time to 2015, I think I would probably add both <code>Move</code> and <code>Leak</code> to Rust.
There are certain downsides, which were highlighted by the team at the time in their decision not to
add <code>Leak</code>: any trait object type which needs to meet these bounds needs to add <code>+ Move</code> or <code>+ Leak</code> to their definition. Having two auto traits of such global significance (<code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>)
was already considered enough of a burden.</p><p>But if I’m honest, I have the impression (I wasn’t there) that the decision to exclude <code>Leak</code> was at
least partly a matter of expediency: my understanding is that the Rust team at Mozilla was under
incredible pressure from their management to ship a 1.0 on the deadline they set, and this probably
influenced their decision not to make any last minute changes to the rules that could impact meeting
that deadline.</p><p>In a language with <code>Leak</code>, the scoped task trilemma wouldn’t exist, the simpler scoped thread API
would be safe, GC-integration would possibly be easier, and I’ve gotten the impression many systems
APIs would be easier to wrap safely (though I don’t know the details of this).</p><p>In a language with <code>Move</code>, the <code>Pin</code> type wouldn’t need to exist, users would therefore not have
such annoyance dealing with it, and so-called “pin projections” wouldn’t be an issue requiring
macros to solve, and making self-referential generators would present no complication for the
<code>Iterator</code> trait.</p><p>However, making these changes now is a much thornier problem. I think the edition-based technique is
the only viable solution for adding a new, globally relevant marker trait (except for certain unique
exceptions, like <code>DynSized</code>, not discussed here). And I think there are all kinds of reasons to
think that wouldn’t work - that it would be too difficult to implement, that the implementation
would have too many soundness holes, that the transition would be too disruptive, that it’s actually
totally impossible because I’ve missed something important.</p><p>This is why I’m very glad we found the <code>Pin</code> solution for immoveable types, and were able to ship
self-referential futures and async/await syntax on top of them, in a reasonable time frame without
major disruption to all existing users. When it comes to <code>Leak</code> and linear types, I just despair.</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>A</span></span>s Vladimir Nabokov revised his autobiography,<em> </em><em>Speak, Memory</em>, he found himself in a strange psychological state. He had first written the book in English, published in 1951. A few years later, a New York publisher asked him to translate it back into Russian for the émigré community. The use of his mother tongue brought back a flood of new details from his childhood, which he converted into his adopted language for a final edition, published in 1966.</p><p>“This re-Englishing of a Russian re-version of what had been an English re-telling of Russian memories in the first place, proved to be a diabolical task,” he wrote. “But some consolation was given me by the thought that such multiple metamorphosis, familiar to butterflies, had not been tried by any human before.”</p><p>Over the past decade, psychologists have become increasingly interested in using such mental metamorphoses. Besides altering the quality of our memories, switching between languages can influence people’s financial decision-making and their appraisal of moral dilemmas. By speaking a second language, we can even become more rational, more open-minded and better equipped to deal with uncertainty. This phenomenon is known as the “foreign language effect” and the benefits may be an inspiration for anyone who would like to enrich their mind with the words of another tongue.</p><p>The foreign language effect should not be confused with the older concept of “linguistic determinism”, which proposes that the specific words and grammar of a language can change the way we perceive the world. In this view, people’s colour perception should change according to the terms that we use to divide the rainbow, while people’s perception of time may be influenced by the grammatical tenses they use.</p><p>You may be familiar with this idea from the film <em><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/does-century-old-linguistic-hypothesis-center-film-arrival-have-any-merit-180961284/" data-link-name="in body link">Arrival</a></em>, in which the aliens’ language mysteriously shapes their experience of the world. Whether this happens in real life, however, is still a matter of considerable scientific debate. The foreign language effect does not depend on the particular features of the language that someone speaks; instead, it is concerned with the general experience of moving from a first to a second language. How will my thinking change, for example, when I move from English, which I absorbed in my cot, to Italian, which I have painstakingly studied as an adult?</p><h2 id="influencing-moral-reasoning-the-trolley-problem">Influencing moral reasoning: the ‘trolley problem’</h2><p>For Prof Boaz Keysar at the University of Chicago, who pioneered this research, the inspiration was personal. He grew up in Israel, and has now lived in the US for more than three decades, but still finds that Hebrew has more emotional resonance than English. Driving home from work one day, he started to wonder whether this might influence our moral reasoning, which is often driven by our gut feelings rather than logical reasoning.</p><p>Imagine, for instance, that you are standing on a footbridge when you see that an oncoming train is about to kill five people walking on the track. The only way to save these five people is to push a heavy man off the bridge in front of the train. He will die but the impact will prevent the train from hitting the other five people. This is considered the “utilitarian” choice in a version of the thought experiment known as the “trolley problem”. Many people feel such strong revulsion at the idea of pushing the man to his death that they would prefer to take no action at all, even though that means that many more lives will be lost.</p><p>In a preliminary experiment, Keysar’s team asked participants who had learned Spanish as a second language to consider this dilemma in either their native or adopted tongue. As he had hypothesised, they were far more likely to make the utilitarian choice when they used Spanish compared with English.

Previous experiments showed that people are unwilling to risk losing a small amount of money for the chance of winning a bigger sum, even if the odds are tipped in their favour. If you give people a 50% chance of winning £2.50, for example, or offer them the opportunity to take £1 for sure, most people go for the guaranteed money. This may pay off in the short term, but when you have made many such decisions, it severely limits your profits.</p><p>Myopic loss aversion is a serious problem for investors, but Keysar found that this tendency was much less pronounced when the bets were presented in a foreign language. “People just hate the prospect of losing,” says Keysar. “But they hate it less in a foreign language.” Further experiments have shown that speaking a foreign language can also reduce the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001002771300228X" data-link-name="in body link">framing effect</a>, which is our tendency to be swayed by the particular phrasing of information, and the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20445911.2023.2216918" data-link-name="in body link">sunk cost effect</a>, which is our reluctance to leave a failing endeavour.</p><p>One of the most intriguing recent studies tested the “bias blind spot” – the expectation that we are less susceptible to error than the average person. “We believe that other people are stupid, and we are not,” explains Michał Białek, an associate professor at the University of Wrocław, Poland. In line with Keysar’s findings, he found that speaking a foreign language <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13670069221110383" data-link-name="in body link">punctures this egotistical way of thinking</a>.</p><p>It is now 11 years since Keysar published his first paper on the foreign language effect. Over the same period, many psychological findings have crumbled under scrutiny – but not the foreign language effect. “It’s consistent and replicable,” says Simone Sulpizio, an associate professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, who conducted a recent <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/decisionmaking-depends-on-language-a-metaanalysis-of-the-foreign-language-effect/357CDDF948DB7FC3C101534F1EA3442A" data-link-name="in body link">meta-analysis</a> examining the evidence to date, though both he and Białek emphasise that we need more research into the mechanisms behind the effect.</p><h2 id="the-memory-game">The memory game</h2><p>Psychologists have also started to explore how the foreign language effect may touch many other areas of our psyche. Consider memory, the topic of Nabokov’s musings. We encode our recollections with verbal narratives, particular words triggering specific associations attached to an event. As a result, a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11006905/" data-link-name="in body link">childhood memory</a> may seem less vivid when someone recalls it using a language that was acquired later in life. That may be a disadvantage for someone writing a memoir in a foreign tongue. On the plus side, it could help people to process painful events. People who recalled a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1133915/full" data-link-name="in body link">childhood trauma in a second language</a> showed less emotional distress than those recounting the event in their native tongue.</p><p>Keysar’s <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001378" data-link-name="in body link">latest study</a>, led by his PhD student Leigh Grant, has shown that the foreign language effect can discourage the creation of false memories. In one experiment, the participants were first given a list of connected words, such as “dream”, “snooze”, “bed” and “rest”. When their recall was tested later, many people mistakenly remembered hearing the word sleep, which was not on the list. This is a standard technique to test people’s tendency to form false memories, and it was considerably less likely to happen if they performed the task in their foreign language.</p><p>In a follow-up experiment, the team showed participants two clips of robberies from the films <em>The Pink Panther</em> and <em>Rififi</em>, before playing them audio narratives of the same events that contained some false details. This can muddy people’s memories so that they begin to incorporate the misinformation into their own recollections. Once again, participants managed to avoid more of those errors when they heard the descriptions in their second language.</p><p>Keysar suggests that people employ more careful and deliberative thinking when using their foreign language: “You need to make sure that what you say, and how you understand things, is correct.” And they apply the same attention to the monitoring of their memories, leading them to question the accuracy of their recollections rather than simply recounting the first thing that comes into their heads.</p><p>The foreign language effect may even stretch to elements of our personality. Silvia Purpuri at the University of Trento, Italy has examined “tolerance of ambiguity”, which concerns people’s appreciation of uncertainty, and their willingness to enter unfamiliar situations. This can influence our behaviour in a changing workplace. “Those with high levels of tolerance of ambiguity display more flexibility and adaptability, leading to a more harmonious working environment and overall successful performance,” explains Purpuri. By allowing people to entertain new ideas, tolerance of ambiguity can improve people’s creative problem-solving. Recruiting Italian-English bilingual speakers, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/foreign-language-effect-on-tolerance-of-ambiguity/54A1ABB8E1A2609F155512821A4CC41E" data-link-name="in body link">Purpuri and her colleagues found</a> that people naturally score more highly on this trait when primed to use their second language.</p><p>In today’s increasingly globalised world, many people regularly use two or more languages in their day-to-day lives, yet they may be completely unaware how that may influence their thinking. “People need to realise that if they choose to use one language over the other, that will have a systematic effect on the process and outcome of what they do,” says Keysar.</p><p>We still need much more research examining the limits of the foreign language effect and the cases where it may backfire. But in certain situations, it could be <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.549083/full" data-link-name="in body link">a useful tool</a> to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/11/6/103" data-link-name="in body link">switch mindsets</a>, allowing us to be a little more detached, objective and flexible in our thinking. You could deliberately swap to your second language when investigating important investments, for instance, so that you can more rationally appraise the risks. Or, when facing a personal upset, you may find that describing the situation in your second language helps to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.22283671v1" data-link-name="in body link">calm some of your fears or anxieties</a>. And if you are considering a controversial new environmental policy, you might try to read about it in a foreign newspaper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-017-0005-9" data-link-name="in body link">the research suggests</a> that this may render you more open-minded to the facts at hand and less easily swayed by your immediate gut reaction.</p><p>For those who already speak another language, this may be an unexpected payoff for all your studies. For those who do not, such benefits may offer an extra incentive to pick up your old French textbooks, sign up for a night class in Spanish, or download Duolingo. Nabokov’s experience may have been exceptional, but we may all undergo a mini-metamorphosis as we immerse our minds in the words and idioms of another culture.</p><ul>

							<!-- Title -->
							

							<!-- Content -->
							<p>Last week, Unity announced that they will soon start charging developers $0.20 each time their games are installed, past certain (high) thresholds. This came as a surprise to me and a few thousand other developers who chose Unity, invested in it, and paid for it in large part because they told us they wouldn’t take any of our revenue.</p>
<p>The reaction has been huge, but it’s not clear yet if Unity will make it right. The hasty, vague, conflicting clarifications they’ve offered all seemed aimed at reassuring people “No no, we’re not gonna steal much of <em>your</em> money, because you won’t be successful. Our plan is to steal <em>that</em> guy’s money.”</p>
<p>That’s not my issue, so I just wanna spell out exactly what my issue is.</p>
<h5>My issue</h5>
<p>We chose Unity for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a> over 5 years ago. The deal was, it costs $125 per month per programmer, but that’s it – they take no share of your income when you release. Unreal, a rival engine, has no monthly fee but takes 5% of your revenue when you release. If Unity wanted any part of our revenue, whether percentage or per-install, we wouldn’t have used it – I had more experience in Game Maker, which takes no rev share and has a lower sub cost.</p>
<p>So now we’ve spent 5+ years investing in Unity on that understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of our coding and implementation work (about 70% of my job, and all of my programmer’s job) is in Unity, and could not be pasted into some other engine – it would need to be redone.</li>
<li>To be able to even do that productive work, I spent a ton of this time learning Unity.</li>
<li>Relatedly, I took around 3,824 points of psychic damage during this time from Unity’s bizarre, maddening quirks.</li>
<li>I’ve also paid Unity over $10,000 in subscription fees so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>And not for a slew of useful new features – we use Unity 2019.3. In the last 4 years, the only additional value Unity have provided us is bug fixes to that version. But that’s OK! I’m happy to pay a large fee up front to avoid having our income skimmed forever.</p>
<p>In case we were worried about how much we were investing, in 2019 Unity went out of their way to say, and cement in their Terms of Service, that <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform">“When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.”</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos.png" alt="When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS. In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project." width="933" height="373" srcset="https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos.png 933w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-500x200.png 500w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-178x71.png 178w, https://www.pentadact.com/wp-content/unity-tos-768x307.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<p>But, well, EULA’s say the darnedest things!</p>
<p>A year ago, they quietly removed that part of the TOS. I probably clicked agree on something since then. It wasn’t on my radar that the most reputable indie engine might be silently laying the groundwork for a moustache-twirling betrayal next year.</p>
<p>The new per-install fee is not in the current terms I’ve agreed to, so you might think I have an out – just don’t agree to the new ones! But Unity is a subscription, not a product I bought one time. I have to accept the new terms to continue paying for it, which we have to do to keep legally using Unity, which we have to do to finish our game – because by this point we’re trapped in their platform to the tune of 5 years’ work.</p>
<h5>The situation</h5>
<p>This is why I am not remotely mollified by reassurances that the&nbsp;<em>current</em> profit-skimming terms won’t sting&nbsp;<em>me in particular</em> too badly. That’s not the fuckin’ headline! The headline is that you (surprisingly) can and (staggeringly) will change how much of our revenue you wish to take at any time after we’ve already committed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not just the size of the monthly fee, but the very conceptual structure of what <em>kind of debt</em> we owe you.</li>
<li>Not just to use future versions of your engine, with whatever features you think justify this sharp hike, but even for past versions you previously promised would be usable under the old terms forever.</li>
<li>And not just for games that are starting development now, or mid development – even for games that are <em>already released</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re cool with punishing our trust and investment in your platform by using it as a trap to pressure us into terms we would never agree to if we had free choice.</p>
<p>So if I don’t seem impressed that the current terms won’t brutalise my expected revenue, it’s cos it doesn’t take a genius to flash forward to your next twist of the knife. Even after Breach Wizards is finished and released, apparently you’re able and willing to change the terms under which we used your engine, placing the fees and thresholds wherever you like to see what you can force out of us.</p>
<p>The only difference with a released game is our recourse: instead of having to abandon development of our game, we’d just have to abandon the game – never patch, never update. Which sucks for players almost as much as it sucks for devs.</p>
<h5>Maybe they won’t force worse terms on us later??</h5>
<p>Well, as far as trusting Unity not to do something scummy if they think they legally can: *waves vaguely at the whole situation*</p>
<p>But more specifically, forcing this new fee structure is a <em>desperate</em> move. They knew it would be roundly despised – their own staff told them so – and they did it anyway. The money was more important than their integrity or reputation. Under those terms, what wouldn’t a corporation do? If taking 100% of our revenue would make them more money than it loses, is anyone confident they wouldn’t do it? For some people, they already have: one dev calculated they’d owe Unity 108% of the year’s revenue under the current terms.</p>
<h5>But I heard it’s not retroactive?</h5>
<p>Unity are saying it’s ‘not retroactive’ in the sense that when they count how many installs you owe them money for, they won’t count installs that happened before Jan 2024.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;<em>is</em> retroactive in the sense that it doesn’t matter how long ago your game released, or what version of Unity it was made in, if you still need to use Unity at all, you agree to pay Unity for each install of any of your Unity games, over the thresholds.</p>
<p>Again, the thresholds are high, and again, the thresholds are not the point. If this change is allowed to be retroactive in that sense, there’s nothing to stop them making a “100% of your revenue” TOS retroactive in that sense.</p>
<h5>But they have to do this, their game engine business isn’t profitable!</h5>
<p>Ah, I didn’t know that, perhaps because I don’t give a fuck? It’s not the customer’s job to make your business plan pay off. I didn’t ask them to offer terms that don’t work for them, I didn’t ask them to hire 7,000 people, I never even made a feature request. They asked me to pay them $10,000 in sub fees on the promise that it meant no fee per-sale, then once I was in too deep to switch, they changed the deal.</p>
<h5>But game engines are hard to make and update, it’s not reasonable to expect them to be cheap</h5>
<p>I have no opinions about how much they should cost. My thing is, if you offer me Unity 2019 at $150 a month, it’s a scumbag move to wait til I’m too far invested to switch, then change it to a per-install deal <em>even if I keep using the old version.</em> You can change the price, and even the nature of the cost, for any and all future versions, no probs! I get to not buy those. I can’t not-buy Unity 2019 cos I already paid you $10k and spent over 5 years work on it, so you shouldn’t be able to layer on a new type of debt I owe you.</p>
<p>Especially, I feel, if you promised not to.</p>

<b> Explanation: </b> 

On September 12, from a location just south of the Arctic Circle,
stones of Iceland's
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230327.html">modern Arctic Henge</a>
point skyward in this startling scene.

Entertaining an intrepid group of aurora hunters during a
<a href="https://spaceweather.com/">geomagnetic storm</a>,
alluring northern lights dance across the darkened sky
when a stunning
<a href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/">fireball meteor</a>
explodes.

Awestruck, the camera-equipped skygazers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHitRCagcE">captured video and still
images</a>
of the boreal bolide, at its peak about as bright as a full moon.

Though quickly fading from view, the fireball left a lingering
<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/_DSC7281-1s_1024.jpg">visible trail</a>
or persistent train.

<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180817.html">The wraith-like trail</a> was seen for
minutes wafting in the upper atmosphere at altitudes
of 60 to 90 kilometers along with the
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aurora">auroral glow</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main"><p>Authors: Andrew Kelley and Loris Cro</p><p>Please don’t use bounties to incentivize Zig development.</p><p>This blog post is inspired by this GitHub issue from three days ago: <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support WASIX</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/wasmerio/status/1701168305103331701?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see also</a>)</p><p>Here are some reasons why we believe bounties are a poor form of sponsorship when it comes to software development:</p><ul><li>Bounties foster competition at the expense of cooperation.</li><li>Bounties are an utterly simplistic way of dealing with the business management side of creating software:<ul><li>Instead of scouting for a suitable candidate, you’re letting battle royale dynamics pick a winner for you, at the expense of everybody who’s going to lose the competition.</li><li>Instead of creating a clear contract where you take on some of the risk, you implicitly put the entirety of the risk on the contestants (eg partial solutions don’t get any payout).</li><li>Instead of allocating time and resources to proper due diligence, you instead penalize any form of thoughtfulness in favor of reckless action (eg a solution just needs to pass a test suite).</li><li>Instead of planning for the full lifecycle of software, which also includes maintenance, you end up with a quickly bitrotting artifact that is of no practical use to anybody.</li><li>Instead of spreading unease to all the people involved, it would be preferable you instead learned how to do business properly.</li></ul></li><li>On projects less radical than Zig, you might also put pressure on the development team to accept the winning submission, which, given the above, will probably not be the most well-thought-out and maintainable solution.</li></ul><p>While we do understand that continued exposure to venture capital might have caused some to build an appreciation for endless rat racing, we <em>kindly</em> request that you keep unwarranted hustling away from the Zig community.</p><p>We’re not only building free and open source software but, most importantly, we’re building <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/the-open-source-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software you can love</a> and this can only be done by employing well-designed business management processes.</p><h2 id="a-word-about-bug-bounties">A Word About Bug Bounties</h2><p>We do believe that bug bounties, like the one
<a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/viewstamped-replication-made-famous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered by TigerBeetle</a>,
can be a virtuous way of sponsoring development since they focus on the
<em>discovery</em> aspect of software defects. Yes, it’s possible for different people
to independently discover the same bug, but that’s an unlucky coincidence, not
a structural aspect of the resulting system.</p><hr><p>If you’re interested in investing in the Zig ecosystem, we’re happy to chat with you and give you all the necessary insight both when it comes to the project’s roadmap, and also in terms of publicizing the opportunity within the community to help you find a suitable candidate, but we do expect that you treat your collaborators with the respect they deserve.</p><p>For more info, contact Loris Cro (VP of Community) at <a href="mailto:loris@ziglang.org">loris@ziglang.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Current policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase adaptation and mitigation funding are insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. It is clear that further action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and achieve a just climate future. Here, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility and climate finance by conducting an environmentally extended input output analysis that links 30 years (1990–2019) of United States (U.S.) household-level income data to the emissions generated in creating that income. To do this we draw on over 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers from the Eora MRIO database to calculate both supplier- and producer-based GHG emissions intensities and connect these with detailed income and demographic data for over 5 million U.S. individuals in the IPUMS Current Population Survey. We find significant and growing emissions inequality that cuts across economic and racial lines. In 2019, fully 40% of total U.S. emissions were associated with income flows to the highest earning 10% of households. Among the highest earning 1% of households (whose income is linked to 15–17% of national emissions) investment holdings account for 38–43% of their emissions. Even when allowing for a considerable range of investment strategies, passive income accruing to this group is a major factor shaping the U.S. emissions distribution. Results suggest an alternative income or shareholder-based carbon tax, focused on investments, may have equity advantages over traditional consumer-facing cap-and-trade or carbon tax options and be a useful policy tool to encourage decarbonization while raising revenue for climate finance.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to all of humanity [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref001">1</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref002">2</a>]. Yet, extreme economic inequality, across and within societies, results in a powerful disconnect between those facing the worst climate impacts and those reaping the economic and consumption benefits that drive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref003">3</a>–<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref008">8</a>]. This disparity in harm and benefits has been a central tension at international climate negotiations, particularly when trying to allocate responsibility and financial compensation between developed and developing countries.</p>
<p>In recognition of such disparities, wealthy nations at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC–COP 15) agreed to mobilize $100 billion a year, by 2020, to fund mitigation and adaptation efforts in poorer developing nations. The creation of a “loss and damage” fund at the recent UNCCC COP 27 marks an additional commitment to address disparities between those disproportionately driving emissions and those disproportionately experiencing the harms they cause. These efforts represent progress, yet there is also some reason for skepticism. Existing climate commitments will not keep global temperature rise within 1.5°C [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref009">9</a>], finance pledges fall about 5-10x short of the need [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref010">10</a>], and nations have consistently failed to meet these insufficient emissions and finance pledges [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref009">9</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref011">11</a>]. This has made the current moment pivotal to address an increasingly urgent climate crisis and suggests addition perspectives may be useful in motivating such efforts.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Emissions responsibility frameworks and prior work</h3>
<p>While existing climate agreements are based on national-level territorial emissions, alternative consumption-based and income-based frameworks have been proposed to account for trade related emissions transfers and to better align responsibility with the flow of benefits. At the national level, consumption-based emissions have been well studied over the last several decades [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref012">12</a>–<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref021">21</a>], while income-based emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref022">22</a>–<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref029">29</a>] have received less attention. Because consumption and income ultimately flow to households, these alternative frameworks also allow emissions responsibility to be quantified sub-nationally at the household-level.</p>
<p>The United States (U.S.) provides an interesting case for consumption- and income-based analysis due to its significant emissions, high levels of consumption, and extreme economic inequality. Since the Industrial Revolution the U.S. has cumulatively emitted more GHGs and captured more wealth (GDP) than any other country. At the same time, the U.S. has significant economic inequality, with the top 10% of income earners capturing 46% of pre-tax national income, in 2021, and the top 1% alone capturing 19% [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref030">30</a>].</p>
<p>From a consumption-based standpoint, prior U.S. analyses have been conducted by Weber and Matthews [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref018">18</a>], Jones and Kammen [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref031">31</a>], Song et al. [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref017">17</a>], Sager [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref032">32</a>], Feng et al. [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref016">16</a>] and others. In a recent paper we fill in a gap in these studies by explicitly addressing the undersampling and underestimation of top 1% and top 0.1% households’ emissions in prior work [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref033">33</a>]. We find extreme and growing emissions disparities between very high-income households and the rest of U.S. society.</p>
<p>While emissions related to household <em>consumption</em> (consumer responsibility) have been well explored for the U.S. and many countries—informing climate equity debates–very little work [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref034">34</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>] has been done linking households to the emissions used in generating their <em>incomes</em> (income responsibility). This misses a critical connection between climate altering GHG emissions and those households reaping a tangible benefit from these emissions—obscuring alternative policy solutions.</p>
<p>To date, the only research we are familiar with on income-based household GHG footprints are an initial U.S.-based analysis we conducted [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref034">34</a>] and recent work by Pottier and Le Truet [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>] that report wage-based footprints for households in France. Here we present results for an analysis that links GHG emissions to the full range of U.S. household incomes (wages, investments, retirement, etc.) over a 30 year period (1990–2019). In doing so, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility, fill in a key knowledge gap for a major GHG emitting nation, and highlight some alternative tax policies that could help close the climate finance gap [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref010">10</a>]–including post-COP 27 loss and damage funds.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Research approach</h3>
<p>To link U.S. households with the GHG emissions that enable their income we calculate global GHG emissions intensities (metric tons (t) CO<sub>2</sub>e per dollar) of income using a multi-region input-output (MRIO) model (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a>) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref036">36</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref037">37</a>]. We calculate emissions intensity using two distinct accounting approaches: direct <em>producer</em> emissions and <em>supplier</em> emissions. In the producer framework, each industry’s direct operational emissions (Scope 1) are allocated to households in proportion to the share of total income they receive from that industry. The supplier framework allocates emissions to households in the same proportional way, but each industry’s emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions occurring in all activities which directly and indirectly provide sales revenue to that industry in its role as a supplier. For example, in the producer framework households receiving wage or investment income from a power plant are responsible for the direct emissions it generates, while in the supplier framework households receiving wage or investment income from selling financial services or fossil fuel to that power plant are responsible for the plant’s emissions, proportional to their importance as a supplier. The producer approach allocates direct emissions from 429 U.S. industries, while the supplier approach includes the full downstream supply chain emissions of 9,812 industries across 190 countries (about 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers or around 96 million per year).</p>
<p>Industry-specific emissions intensities are linked with an individual’s wage income from that industry, using the nationally representative Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) harmonized Current Population Survey (CPS), which includes around 5.4 million individuals (~181,000 individuals annually) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref038">38</a>]. Emissions for unearned income, such as investment and retirement (social security, IRA, 401(k), etc.) income, are also included and based on weighted national average multipliers that model a range of diversified investment portfolios. In total, emissions associated with 12 pre-tax income categories are included and aggregated by household (~65,000 annually). The post-tax analysis includes 35 income categories that capture social and government transfers and reduces the household’s income responsibility by the amount of taxes paid (see Table E in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for a comprehensive list of income variables). To compare emissions responsibility across the income distribution, households are then binned into income groups including deciles 1–9, the <em>next 9%</em> (90–99.0th percentile), <em>top 1%</em> (99.0th - 100th percentile), <em>next 0</em>.<em>9%</em> (99.0th—99.9th percentile), and <em>top 0</em>.<em>1%</em> (99.9th - 100th percentile) (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a> for how we estimate top 1% households, which are under sampled in CPS and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for additional methodological details).</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Results</h2><p>Below we present results for both supplier and producer frameworks. For brevity, Figures use the supplier framework and all Figures except <a href="#pclm-0000190-g001">Fig 1</a> present pre-tax income footprints. Producer-based Figures generally show similar results. They are included as Supporting information files and referenced in the corresponding Figure legends below. We mainly focus on pre-tax footprints since they provide a clear picture of the raw income-based emissions distribution. Post-tax results are mostly presented to show the impact of tax policy and social transfers on this distribution (see <a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a> and <em>Tax effects on emissions footprints</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>).</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Income sources and carbon intensity</h3>
<p>Across the income distribution, household income sources and GHG intensities are heterogeneous. Social transfers make up a significant share of lower income groups’ post-tax footprint, wages dominate middle income groups’ emissions, and wage and investment income are the key drivers of very high-income groups’ emissions (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g001">Fig 1</a>). For average top 0.1% households, we find investment income drives &gt;50% of emissions.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of incomes also varies across the income distribution (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g002">Fig 2</a>). In the supplier framework, the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of wages tends to increase with income, though there is significant dispersion within groups. In the producer-based analysis, middle income households have the most CO<sub>2</sub>e intensive wages while low- and high-income households, employed in various service sectors, have less emission intensive incomes (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s003">S2 Fig</a>). These differences result in some decoupling of national income and national emissions (NE) shares (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a>), for some income groups. For example, top 1% households have NE shares that are higher than their income share in the supplier framework and lower in the producer framework. While underlying income inequality is by far the most important factor shaping extreme inequality in emissions footprints, differences in income sources and GHG intensity (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s004">S3</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s005">S4</a> Figs) cause emissions heterogeneity at a given income level and a divergence between national income shares and emissions shares for some income groups.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>Most recent year (2019)</h3>
<p>In 2019, we estimate U.S. household income-based emissions range from ~0 to over 8,000 t and follow a strong linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.94) with an elasticity of 1.0 (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g003">Fig 3</a>). We find a highly unequal emissions distribution with Gini coefficients of 0.57 (producer) and 0.58 (supplier) (for Lorenz curves, see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s006">S5</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s007">S6</a> Figs). It is worth noting that at a given income level differences in the GHG intensities of income sources result in emissions variability. For example, we estimate a pre-tax income around $1 million has emissions as low as ~200 t or as high as ~1,300 t depending on the type of profession or investments that are generating that income.</p>

Depending on the framework, the highest earning top 10% of households drive 40–43% of NE.

<div id="section3"><h3>Super emitters</h3>
<p>We term households with emissions &gt;3,000 t CO<sub>2</sub>e per year as “super emitters”. For pre-tax income, we estimate about 43,200 U.S. households or 34% of the top 0.1% households are super emitters with the supplier framework (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e005" loading="lazy"></span> = 4,317 t, <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e006" loading="lazy"></span> = 4,053). About 26,500 households, or 21% of top 0.1% households surpass this threshold with the producer framework (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e007" loading="lazy"></span> = 3,906 t, <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e008" loading="lazy"></span> = 3,583). Post-tax, the percent of <em>top 0</em>.<em>1%</em> households classified as super emitters drops to about 9% (supplier) and 3% (producer).</p>
<p>Almost all super emitting households come from the top 0.1% income group. They had average incomes of over $10.6 million (supplier) and $11.5 (producer) (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t002">Table 2</a>). Because GHG intensity varies widely across sectors, a household may surpass the 3,000 t threshold with either much lower or much higher income than the average, depending on the GHG intensity of their income source. While super emitting households can also be employed in any sector of the economy (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t002">Table 2</a>), they are markedly overrepresented in finance, real estate, and insurance; manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and services (other). Meanwhile, households earning income from accommodations and restaurants; education; retail and wholesale trade; and some other fields are underrepresented among super emitting households. Generally, both producer and supplier frameworks show the same directionality in terms of divergence from U.S. average employment by sector, but there is variability in the scale of this divergence.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Relationship to racial inequality</h3>
<p>Black households had mean pre-tax footprints of 19 t CO<sub>2</sub>e (supplier and producer) (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e009" loading="lazy"></span> = 11 t in both), White Hispanic households had 26 t (supplier) and 25 t (producer) (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e010" loading="lazy"></span> = 16 t in both), and White non-Hispanic households had 40 t (supplier) and 36 t (producer) (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e011" loading="lazy"></span> = 22 t in both). The fact that White non-Hispanic household emissions were 1.4x - 2.1x higher than other groups partly reflect differences in the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of employment across groups. For example, in the supplier footprint White non-Hispanic households had emissions intensity of wages 1.12x higher than Black households. More critical, however, is the extreme racial inequity of the underlying income distribution. In 2019, the <em>top 1%</em> of the income distribution was 76% White non-Hispanic, 8% Hispanic, and only 3% Black. Meanwhile, Black households make up a disproportionate share of bottom decile households. Post-tax the racial emissions gap closes somewhat, but White non-Hispanic households still have emissions 1.3–1.7x higher than other groups. An additional observation is that significant emissions inequality exists within each racial group. Comparing the median to the means, shows that the emissions distribution is right skewed, with most of the population having emissions far below the mean and a relatively small percent of the population having emissions much higher than the group mean.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Emissions by age group</h3>
<p>In terms of age, average emissions tend to increase with age until peaking within the 45–54 years old head of household age group (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t003">Table 3</a>). After this point they tend to decline. This mirrors household incomes, which tend to increase as cohorts gain experience and seniority within the labor force, then decline as they enter early retirement and retirement age.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Time series: (1990–2019)</h3>
<p>Looking across 30 years of data a few noteworthy trends emerge. First, <em>emissions intensities</em> consistently differ across income groups and have fallen (45–49%) over time (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g005">Fig 5</a>). Second, these falling emission intensities have resulted in <em>decreasing national average</em> household emissions, despite rising incomes (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g006">Fig 6</a>). Yet, this declining national average belies a divergence that has occurred between the bottom 99% of the income distribution and the top 1%. While the bottom 99% have seen rising incomes, their absolute emissions have fallen (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g007">Fig 7</a>) due to declining emissions intensities. For the top 1% however, income growth has outpaced falling emission intensities and resulted in flat or rising absolute emissions (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g007">Fig 7</a>). Finally, these trends have resulted in a large and increasing <em>share of national emissions</em> generating economic benefits for high income households (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g008">Fig 8</a>).</p>
<p>Put together, these trends reveal an interesting emissions story: despite falling emissions intensities, declining national average emissions and rising incomes for all groups, unequal income growth has created significant and increasing emissions inequality between extremely high-income households and the rest of U.S. society. This has moved the income-based national emissions Gini coefficient from 0.51 (producer and supplier) in 1990 to 0.57 (producer) and 0.58 (supplier) in 2019.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Limitations and sources of uncertainty</h3>
<p>Our study is limited in scope, makes certain assumptions about unearned income that are important for top 1% households, and relies on survey and emissions databases that can introduce errors. First, this study focuses on linking emissions with <em>income</em>. Household <em>wealth</em> is only considered insofar as it generates realized income as capital gains or dividends. Because wealth is even more unequally distributed than income, a wealth-based emissions analysis would very likely show greater emissions inequality than our results.</p>
<p>In estimating the emissions intensity of <em>unearned income</em>, it is not feasible to estimate itemized sources of investment income per household. Instead, we assume that households have a diversified passive investment portfolio generating unearned <em>investment income</em> equal to the weighted mean GHG intensity of the U.S. economy. When creating the synthetic dataset for top 1% households, where investments are a key source of income, we allow the GHG intensity of individual household’s investment income to vary up to ±25% from the mean. This creates a distribution of households whose average equals the mean but whose individual portfolios can be overweighted to either more or less GHG intensive industries than the national average. While some households may be outside these bounds, we assume extremely overweight portfolios in either GHG intensive or non-intensive industries are somewhat rare, tend to balance out and in aggregate do not meaningfully affect the overall group mean. This study assumes that on average, investments are passively managed, though further study of how investors can actively influence the carbon intensity of their investments is an interesting topic for future work.</p>
<p>The emissions per industry for <em>wage income</em> are taken from the Eora MRIO (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a>). In Eora, import and export data reported across countries may not exactly align and balancing used in Eora to resolve these discrepancies may lead to minor estimation error, though the affect is minimal on large economies like the U.S. In all MRIO models emissions data are taken from IPCC-style inventories which itemize emissions by activity rather than by economic sector. Reallocating from activity-based inventories to sector-based inventories introduces error that could affect the accuracy of estimated emissions per wage income sector. Additionally, converting from symmetrical and non-symmetrical Supply-Use (SUT), Industry-Industry (II), and Commodity-Commodity (CC) tables, in the original Eora, to a symmetrical II intermediate transaction matrix involves the Fixed Product Sales Structure Assumption [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref039">39</a>] and again moves away from the original national data reports. While some error is inherent, for a large economy with robust GHG reporting the effect on the final income group GHG estimates is limited.</p>
<p>All surveys, including the IPUMS CPS we use for household income are sensitive to sampling and non-sampling error. Most important to our study, top 1% households are under sampled in CPS (See <em>Undersampling and underestimating top 1% incomes in CPS</em> and Table A in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>). To address this, we use income data from the World Inequality Database (WID) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref030">30</a>] and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates on capital income shares to estimate incomes for these missing households (see <a href="#sec016">Materials and Methods</a>). Linking household incomes with Eora GHG intensities also requires the use of a concordance matrix. This reduces the number of U.S. industries from 429 to 246 and can impact an individual household’s emission estimate if their employer has a much higher or lower emissions intensity than the sector average. Yet, it seems reasonable that over- or under-estimates for individual household emissions intensity tend to balance out at the income group level.</p>
<p>While some degree of measurement error is unavoidably present in any estimate of carbon intensity, ultimately income-based footprints are the direct result of the total income dollars received and the carbon intensity of those dollars. As the U.S. is a large economy with fairly accurate income and emissions data collection, we consider error in overall estimates for these variables is likely small. Considering the limited heterogeneity of emissions intensity across income groups and between capital and wage income, any error in group-level CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity is also fairly limited. Nevertheless, to quantify the impact from a quite high level of error, we ran our model with carbon intensity ±20% from the baseline analysis. We then bootstrapped the results for each income group and extract lower 95% bounds from the -20% analysis and upper 95% bounds from the +20% error estimates (gray error bars in <a href="#pclm-0000190-g004">Fig 4</a>). In practice this yields lower and upper bounds ±21–24% from the baseline group means. While the ±20% choice is arbitrary and we believe far higher than the actual error, given that the underlying error is unknown, it was chosen as a reasonable starting point. Results show that even when a high degree of error is tested, the absolute emissions and NE share from next 0.9% and top 1% households remains quite high and distinct from the lowest earning 99% of households. (See the <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for additional discussion on uncertainty).</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Income and emissions inequality</h3>
<p>Across all accounting methods, those at the very top of the income distribution are responsible for striking absolute t CO<sub>2</sub>e and disproportionate shares of national emissions. Disparities between these top income groups and the rest of society have also been growing over time. Between 1990 and 2019, Deciles 1–9 all saw declining absolute emissions and NE shares. For the bottom 5 deciles absolute emissions fell an average of 51% (producer) and 38% (supplier), while their NE shares showed average declines of 20% (producer) and 17% (supplier). For top 1% households, trends moved in the opposite direction. The next 0.9% and top 0.1% groups saw their NE shares respectively rise 46% and 82% (producer) and 43% and 83% (supplier). By 2019, the top 1% alone (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e012" loading="lazy"></span> = 475 t (producer), <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e013" loading="lazy"></span> = 595 t (supplier)) were responsible for more emissions (15–17% NE) than the poorest 50% of U.S. households put together (14% NE). Average top 0.1% households (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e014" loading="lazy"></span> = 2,110 t (producer), <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e015" loading="lazy"></span> = 2,670 t (supplier)) have emissions 1,650–1,700x higher than an average bottom decile household (<span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e016" loading="lazy"></span> = 1.3 t (producer), <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.e017" loading="lazy"></span> = 1.6 t CO<sub>2</sub>e (supplier)). This divergence between top 1% households and the rest of society has been driven by rising income inequality (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g006">Fig 6</a>) and has occurred despite the falling GHG <em>intensity</em> of incomes (<a href="#pclm-0000190-g005">Fig 5</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s010">S9 Fig</a>).</p>
<p>Income-based emissions responsibility closely correlates with income inequality. We find that in 2019 the poorest 50% of the U.S. population captured just 15% of pre-tax national income and was responsible for 14% of pre-tax NE in both frameworks (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a>). The top 10%, <em>top 1%</em>, and <em>top 0</em>.<em>1%</em> captured about 41%, 16%, and 7% of national income. We find they have fairly comparable NE shares of 43%, 17%, and 8% for pre-tax supplier and 40%, 15%, and 7% for pre-tax producer. While limited, the differences between income shares and emission shares are due to variations in GHG-intensity across income sources, income groups, and accounting methods. An interesting recent study by Pottier and Le Treut analyzing wage-based emissions in French households finds the emissions distribution is more unequal than the wage distribution [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>]. Here they find large variability in the carbon intensity of wages is driving this difference. They also find an interesting gender gap in emissions, with men tending to earn wages from more carbon intensive activities than women.</p>
<p>While income-based emissions accounting is distinct from consumption-based accounting, it is worth noting that an income-based approach estimates greater inequality. For example, in a related consumption-based study that we conducted, we estimate the top 10%, top 1%, and top 0.1% of U.S. households are responsible for a much lower 24%, 6%, and 2.3% of national emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref033">33</a>]. The discrepancy is due to large savings rates among high-income households (which reduces consumption) and significant heterogeneity in GHG intensity across income groups, with low-income households purchasing more GHG intensive goods. In France, Pottier and Le Truet find this same trend of income-based emissions being more unequal than consumption-based emissions [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref040">40</a>].</p>
<p>We find that because income-based emissions are the result of both income and the GHG intensity of that income (which varies across industries and producer and supplier accounting principles (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t002">Table 2</a>)), households at the same income level can have very different emissions levels. For example, in the producer framework a household earning $980,000 from the petroleum refining industry would be a super emitter (&gt;3,000 t), while the same amount of emissions would require $11 million in income from the hospital industry. In the supplier framework, becoming a super emitting household would take at least $18 million in hospital income, but only $2.7 million in income from the coal industry. Households may also have very different GHG intensities from different income sources. This is particularly true for high income households that have a significant share of income flowing from investments. For example, one might earn wages from a low GHG intensive sector like education but have above average GHG intensity of investment income from a portfolio that is overweight on fossil fuel companies.</p>
<p>In terms of how age relates to emissions, prior consumption-based work by Zheng et al. has shown that seniors (age 60+) in the U.S. had the highest per capita footprint (20 t) of any age group [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref041">41</a>]. With our income-based analysis we find the highest household emissions are among the 45–54 years old peak earning group. If our analysis was wealth-based however, rather than income-based, it would likely agree with the findings from Zheng et al. that seniors have the largest emissions footprints. This is because, while incomes tend to decline for cohorts above age 54, household net worth continues rising and peaks within the 65–74 years old cohort [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref042">42</a>]. Even the 75 and above group has a higher net worth than the 45–54 peak income group.</p>
<p>While different in methodology, an interesting study by Lucas Chancel looking at global income groups’ consumption and investment found that for the global top 1%, emissions related to investments account for a much greater share of their emissions responsibly (70%) than their consumption (30%) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref043">43</a>]. Finally, it is worth noting that household income is shaped by a variety of demographic factors. While we report on emissions disparity by race, ethnicity, and age, we are principally focused on quantifying the emissions distribution in relation to the income distribution as it exists and do not investigate in great detail how demographic factors influence the income distribution.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Policy implications</h3>
<p>Carbon pricing, either through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, are seen by economists as an essential and cost-effective way to help decarbonize the US economy [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref044">44</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref045">45</a>]. Prior work has suggested this tax would need to be &gt;$200 per t CO<sub>2</sub>e, to achieve even a 5% reduction in oil consumption, and estimates that 70–80% of this cost would be initially passed onto consumers [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref045">45</a>]. Another paper we have published looking at consumption-based U.S. emissions suggests that a tax this high would present a significant burden to low-income families, even though they have comparatively small GHG footprints [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref033">33</a>]. Meanwhile the tax may not be sufficient to shift behavior of high-income households, who have significant consumption-based emissions, but adequate savings rates to absorb the tax. While a carbon tax-funded dividend has been proposed to reduce financial strain on low income households [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref046">46</a>], consumer-facing carbon taxes have not found sufficient political support, despite two decades of development.</p>
<p>The fact that income-based footprints are more inequitable than consumption-based footprints [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref016">16</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref017">17</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref035">35</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref047">47</a>–<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref049">49</a>] suggests an alternative income-based approach to carbon pricing schemes, applied to wage earners or investors, could have equity and political advantages over consumer-facing carbon taxes. Such a tax could be calculated based on direct emissions (producer), on the supply of fossil fuels into the economy (supplier), or some split between the two. Tax revenue could be used for climate mitigation or adaptation projects either within the U.S. or to meet and increase international climate finance pledges including loss and damage funding agreed to at COP 27.</p>
<p>While either wage or investment income could be the focus of such a tax, a wage-based tax has some drawbacks. Just like low-income consumers, low-income wage earners would have the least ability to absorb a tax. To address this, a carbon income tax could be applied progressively, to shield low-income workers. Yet the effectiveness of such a tax to shift the economy to lower GHG emissions may be insubstantial as workers generally have limited agency in shifting their industry’s emissions behavior. While a tax may generate revenue that could be invested in decarbonization or climate finance, it may be politically unpopular to create a wage-based carbon tax that would impact a wide swath of the public.</p>
<p>Because unearned investment income and asset ownership are heavily concentrated at the top of the income distribution, limiting a carbon tax to either of these items could further focus it on those reaping the most economic benefit from GHG emissions, increase public support, and reduce GHG-intensive economic activity in a more direct way. A consideration here is that while there is some overlap of households in the top 1% or 0.1% of <em>income earners</em> and the top 1% or 0.1% of <em>wealth holders</em> there is far more annual churn among the top income group [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref050">50</a>]. Here, households may see huge profits one year from the sale of a business or stocks, but far less income in subsequent years. In this way, an asset-based shareholder carbon tax may be more desirable than an unearned income tax because it would set a more stable annual tax rate and keep the focus on those with the most economic power. It would also be more equitable in that it accounts for the historical emissions embodied in unrealized capital gains, rather than focusing solely on present day emissions that generate unearned income. Furthermore, it concentrates behavior change incentives on the executives and large shareholders who have the most agency and power to reduce their industries’ emissions activities.</p>
<p>At the extreme end of the income distribution, an interesting 2022 study by Oxfam International on 125 global billionaires with assets in excess of $2 trillion, estimates emissions related to their investments were over 3 million t per person annually [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref051">51</a>]. If these individuals were incentivized to reduce the GHG intensity of their industries or shift their investments to other industries, in response to a tax, it could meaningfully impact emissions. Indeed, they estimate the overall carbon intensity of billionaires’ emissions, in their study, could be reduced fourfold if investments were shifted to funds with stronger environmental and social standards [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref051">51</a>]. Work by Lucas Chancel suggests that a progressive carbon tax tied to the carbon intensity of investments could be helpful to accelerate decarbonization, while having limited impact on most households [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref043">43</a>]. Further work by Chancel, Bothe, and Voituriez [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref052">52</a>] estimate a progressive global wealth tax starting at 1.5% for individuals with net worth’s &gt;$100 million (~65,000 individuals or &lt;0.001% of the global population) and going as high as 3% for individuals with assets above $100 billion could raise $300 billion annually for decarbonization, loss and damage, or other climate funding. Even if just the U.S. and European countries adopted such as tax, Chancel and colleagues estimate $175 billion could be raised annually. As they note, because wealth tends to grow 7–9% annually for extremely wealthy individuals, their overall fortunes would still increase, even in the face of these progressive climate-focused taxes [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref052">52</a>]. Kapeller, Leitch, and Wildauer also find that a progressive European wealth tax has the potential to raise enough revenue to close the European Union’s (E.U.) several hundred billion dollar per year green investment gap [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref053">53</a>]. If revenue from capital taxes is reinvested in public infrastructure, such as decarbonization efforts, it can also benefit wealthy countries by increasing social welfare, while reducing extreme economic inequality [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref054">54</a>].</p>
<p>While it would increase the complexity of tax administration, basing such a tax on Scope 1 (or full supply chain Scope 1–3) emissions, rather than a tax based solely on net worth, would keep the tax close to the source of the emissions and encourage divestment from high emitting (highly-taxed) industries. In the U.S., new climate disclosure rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2022, which require Scope 1 and 2 reporting (and Scope 3 for companies with Scope 3 emissions targets) would provide company-specific emissions data that could be used for calculating an appropriate tax rate for investments in that company. In Europe, similar data will become available as the E.U.’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting directive, that came into effect in 2023, requires Scope 3 emissions reporting for E.U. based companies. At the asset manager level, interesting recent work by Zengkai Zhang and colleagues has highlighted the carbon emissions in firms’ portfolios in China [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref055">55</a>] and emissions associated with investments for multinational enterprises [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref056">56</a>].</p>
<p>Finally, while it is impractical to assume large numbers of high-income households could or would easily switch to lower GHG intensive professions, it seems reasonable that in their role as investors high-income households and their asset managers can nimbly shift to lower GHG intensive investments if the market rewards such moves. Linking the shareholder tax rate to the GHG intensity of the industry would also spur fiduciary fund managers to divest from GHG intensive industries in search of higher returns elsewhere. From an industry perspective, such a tax may also encourage firms to decarbonize their operations in order to attract investors with the promise of higher returns, via relatively lower taxes on ownership of the company’s shares. It could also encourage executives, who have seen ballooning compensation over the last several decades [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref057">57</a>] to decarbonize their operations and supply chains to reduce taxes on the income and shares they receive. If high income households did shift their investments in response to such a tax, we would see further decoupling of the national income shares and national emission shares (<a href="#pclm-0000190-t001">Table 1</a>) among high income households.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To avoid the worst impacts of climate change it is imperative that global temperature rise is limited to 1.5°C [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref007">7</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref058">58</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref059">59</a>]. Yet, the window to achieve this goal is rapidly shrinking. By 2030, even if the existing Paris Agreement National Determined Contributions are achieved, global emissions are still projected to overshoot the 1.5°C pathway by at least 60% [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref009">9</a>]. At the same time, climate finance falls well short of what is needed to mitigate and adapt to a warming world. Recent work by Andrew Fanning and Jason Hickel has shown that if nations were each allocated an equality-based fair share of emissions, by 2050 wealthy countries in the global North would owe $192 trillion (or about $6.2 trillion per year) to poorer countries in the global South to compensate for their atmospheric over-appropriations [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref060">60</a>]. To date, climate finance flows to developing nations have struggled to reach the $100 billion a year goal set over a decade ago. It is clear that the economy needs to decarbonize faster than its current trajectory and that more money is needed to both fund this transition and equitably adapt societies to a warming world.</p>
<p>By linking GHG emissions with the incomes it enables our work has quantified the scale of emissions inequality in U.S. society and the extreme and growing concentration of emissions among very wealthy households. It also offers some suggestions on how accelerated decarbonization and revenue generation might occur, such as an income or shareholder-based carbon tax that reflects the GHG intensity of one’s income sources or financial assets. This is distinct from consumer facing carbon taxes that rely on individuals decarbonizing the economy by shifting their consumption to less GHG intensive goods and services and thereby encouraging companies to respond to their new preferences. A consumer-facing approach assumes individual consumers have the knowledge, financial resources, and agency to shift spending and the power to alter corporate decision making on the GHG intensity of their supply chain and operations. An alternative income or shareholder facing carbon tax puts pressure on executives and large shareholders (i.e. those with the most economic and corporate power) to act in their own self-interest and decarbonize their supply chain and operations in order to reduce taxes on their compensation and investments. Recent work has calculated that a climate inspired wealth tax could indeed be an effective tool to raise revenue for adaptation and mitigation efforts [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref052">52</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref053">53</a>].</p>
<p>By thinking of carbon as an outcome of income generation rather than just an outcome of consumption, such alternative policy solutions become possible. While consumer-facing carbon taxes have struggled to move from proposal to law in the U.S. an investment-based carbon tax may be more equitable, politically palatable, and equally justifiable. Of course, any such proposals would likely face significant pushback from the economically advantaged households who dominate policymaking [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref061">61</a>]. Finally, given the urgent nature of the climate crisis and the shrinking window in which limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible, policymakers may be wise to consider adopting multiple approaches (both consumer and income or investor facing carbon taxes) that can simultaneously put pressure on different actors to equitably decarbonize the economy and fund a just transition to a still warming world. We suggest further work quantifying the potential effects of such proposals is warranted.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Materials and methods</h2><p>For both the producer- and supplier-income approach we link income to GHG emissions using survey data on individual-level income (see Table E in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for income categories) and an Environmentally-Extended Multi-Region Input-Output Model (EE-MRIO). For earned income, the GHG intensity per dollar of wages, for each industry, is calculated and multiplied by an individual’s income from that industry. The GHG intensities of unearned investment income, retirement, and employer contributions to healthcare are also included (12 categories in total) in the pre-tax analysis. In post-tax footprints, emissions responsibilities are increased by 23 categories of social transfers and reduced by the amount of taxes paid. Individuals are aggregated into households and households are ranked into percentiles and deciles, for income group comparisons.</p>
<p>To calculate the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of income, we use the Eora MRIO database [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref036">36</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref037">37</a>] covering 14,839 sectors, 190 countries, and 1,140 final demand and value-added categories. For each of the 30 years, EORA is converted from a 14,839 x 14,839 heterogeneous classification system to a square 9,812 x 9,812 industry by industry input-output table, using the Fixed Product Sales Structure assumption [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref039">39</a>]. Current year dollars are adjusted to constant 2020 US$. GHG emissions data come from the PRIMAPHIST database (Version 2.3—available in Eora) [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref062">62</a>, <a href="#pclm.0000190.ref063">63</a>]. This includes the six Kyoto GHGs and excludes land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF).</p>
<p>In a producer-income approach the CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of each industry’s direct emissions are calculated by proportionally allocating emissions to each value added category and calculating the GHG intensity per dollar of various income types. In the supplier income emissions framework, we calculate the enabled emissions, in t CO<sub>2</sub>e per dollar, using the Ghosh inverse (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>). This captures all <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em> CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions, along the whole downstream global supply chain (~96 million inter-sectoral transfers each year) that were enabled to produce a dollar of value added.</p>
<p>For each year, these supply chain and direct emissions factors are matched with individual-level IPUMS CPS income data. IPUMS CPS is a harmonized dataset drawn from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref038">38</a>]. It includes approximately 65,000 U.S. households and about 181,000 individuals per year. From CPS, we extract 58 variables related to income, healthcare, social benefits, industry from which wages are earned, and individual or household characteristics. Each year yields approximately 10,500,000 data points, totaling about 315,000,000 data points across the 30-year period. Individual-level emissions and income matching is done by applying a concordance matrix to convert emissions factors from the 429 U.S. industries in Eora to the 246 U.S. industries reported by CPS, using International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) system coding (For more details see <em>Converting Eora industries into CPS industries</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> and <a href="#pclm.0000190.s024">S12 Data</a>). Individual-level wage data in CPS includes both the amount (in dollars) and the industry from which income is earned (IND90LY). Individual-level wage data are then multiplied by the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity for that industry. The income value of employer healthcare contributions is added, based on the employing industry’s CO<sub>2</sub>e multiplier. This is included for all years except 1990–1992 and 2019, where data is not reported in CPS.</p>
<p>The GHG responsibility of social security, retirement, capital gains, interest and dividends, and social benefits are also accounted for using weighted average income-based emissions intensities of the U.S. economy. These national average intensities are calculated to reflect each industry’s share of emissions from the relevant value added category/ies (see <em>Converting Eora industries into CPS industries</em> and <em>Calculating CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>e intensities of income sources from value added</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>). For example, because Social Security comes out of employee compensation, an industry specific weight is calculated based on each industry’s share of total employee compensation. Each industry’s weight is then multiplied by its CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity. All the weighted CO<sub>2</sub>e intensities are then summed into the weighted national average CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity per dollar Social Security. Interests and dividends multipliers are calculated the same way but based on each industry’s share of Net Operating Surplus. Social benefits are also calculated in this way but based on each industry’s share out of all value added categories. In practice, the difference between these three different national average CO<sub>2</sub>e intensities is generally quite small (a few percentage points).</p>
<p>For each individual in CPS, income dollars from wages, investments, retirement, and employer healthcare contributions are multiplied by the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity of that income source. Individuals are then merged into their respective households and t CO<sub>2</sub>e are summed. This yields the pre-tax emissions footprint of each household. Households are then binned into income groups.</p>
<p>To calculate the post-tax and transfer footprint, the value of social transfers such as monetary gifts and publicly provided benefits such as veterans benefits, unemployment, home heating, rental, and educational assistance are multiplied by the social benefit CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity. Tons CO<sub>2</sub>e are summed and added to the pre-tax footprint. Finally, post-tax footprints are reduced by subtracting emissions equivalent to the percentage of taxes paid. For example, a household with a 20% tax rate would have its t CO<sub>2</sub>e pre-tax plus benefits footprint reduced by 20%.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Top 1% households</h3>
<p>While CPS is the most authoritative source on U.S. household income, top 1% households are under sampled, average incomes are underestimated (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a>), and top-coding affects some income categories. To address this, we create an over-sampled synthetic dataset for the next 0.9% and top 0.1% households and estimate their income, income sources, and CO<sub>2</sub>e intensity. This is done by creating a distribution of 1,000 households, for each group, whose mean pre-tax income and upper and lower thresholds come from WID and whose distributions is right-skewed to reflect within-group income inequality (see <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for detailed methodology).</p>
<p>We then extract the IPUMS CPS households that meet the WID top 1% threshold and bootstrap these into two 1,000 row datasets that are matched with the next 0.9% and top 0.1% WID synthetic income distributions. In this merged synthetic distribution, total household income from WID is then distributed to wage, investment, retirement, and employer healthcare income categories, based on values from the bootstrapped CPS households. Income related to retirement and employer healthcare, which makes up an exceedingly small share of total income (and emissions) for <em>top 1%</em> households, are directly extracted from the CPS households and subtracted from the household’s total income.</p>
<p>The remaining income is divided among wages and investment income. Due to limited reporting on capital gains and investment income in CPS we do not directly apply the raw income share allocation from the CPS bootstrapped households. Instead, we use CBO estimates on the share of capital income versus wage income for next 0.9% and top 0.1% households [<a href="#pclm.0000190.ref064">64</a>]. To do this we use CBO values for each group’s mean capital income share and create a normal distribution (<em>s</em> = 15%) of capital share values around this mean. In so doing we simulate variations in household income streams for each group. For each household, this wage and capital share (which sum to 100) are multiplied by the remaining household total income dollars. This yields dollars per wage and investment income category (see <em>Investment CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>e intensity</em> and <em>Investments and capital gains</em> in <a href="#pclm.0000190.s001">S1 Text</a> for more details on the investment income approach).</p>
<p>Each income category total dollars are then multiplied by the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>e intensities for that category. These intensities come from the bootstrapped dataset but are allowed to randomly vary up ±25% from the original value. This is done to reflect the natural variation in GHG intensity that exists between top 1% households due to differences in employment and investment choices. Summing all categories yields pre-tax income based GHG footprints for the next 0.9% and top 0.1% groups. Post-tax footprints are calculated by adding the emissions value of social benefits (which are exceeding small as a portion of total income for these groups) and reducing these footprints in proportion to the household’s tax rate.</p>

  <p>
    New York, NY — September 08, 2023
  </p>
  <p>At WWDC earlier this year, Apple announced that upcoming versions of iOS and macOS would ship with a new feature powered by “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/ios-17-makes-iphone-more-personal-and-intuitive/">a Transformer language model</a>” that will give users “predictive text recommendations inline as they type.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this announcement, I was pretty curious about how this feature works.
Apple hasn’t deployed many language models of their own, despite most of their competitors going all-in on large language models over the last couple years.
I see this as a result of Apple generally priding themselves on polish and perfection, while language models are fairly unpolished and imperfect.</p>

<p>As a result, this may be one of the first Transformer-based models that Apple will ship in one of its operating systems, or at least one of the first that they’ve acknowledged publicly.
This left me with some questions about the feature, notably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What underlying model is powering this feature?</li>
  <li>What is its architecture?</li>
  <li>What data was used to train the model?</li>
</ul>

<p>After spending some time with these questions, I was able to find some answers, but many of the details still remain unclear.
If you’re able to get any further than I could, please get in touch!</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-feature-work">How does the feature work?</h2>

<p>After installing the macOS beta, I immediately opened the Notes app and started typing.
Despite trying many different sentence structures, the feature generally appeared less often than I expected it to.
It mostly completes individual words.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/individual-word-2.png">

</figure>

<p>The feature will occasionally suggest more than one word at a time, but this is generally limited to instances where the upcoming words are extremely obvious, similar to the autocomplete in Gmail.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="can-we-dig-deeper">Can we dig deeper?</h2>

<p>Finding the model itself was a little tough, but I eventually found the model being used by <code>AppleSpell</code>, an internal macOS application that checks for spelling and grammar mistakes as you type.
With the help of <a href="https://github.com/hot3eed/xpcspy"><code>xpcspy</code></a>, I wrote a Python script that snoops on <code>AppleSpell</code> activity and streams the most probable suggestions from the predictive text model as you type in any application.</p>

<figure>
<video controls="" src="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/script-demo.mov" type="video/mov"></video>
<figcaption>My “predictive spy” script in action.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, I wrote this script earlier in the summer, on the first macOS Sonoma beta.
In one of the subsequent betas (I’m not sure which), Apple removed the unused completions from the XPC messages sent by AppleSpell.
I wasn’t able to glean too much about the model’s behavior from these completions, but it was still a cool find.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-model">Where is the model?</h2>

<p>After some more digging, I’m pretty sure I found the predictive text model in <code>/System/Library/LinguisticData/RequiredAssets_en.bundle/AssetData/en.lm/unilm.bundle</code>.
The bundle contains multiple Espresso model files that are used while typing (Espresso <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/peek-inside-coreml/">appears to be</a> the internal name for the part of CoreML that runs inference on models).
I wasn’t ultimately able to reverse-engineer the model, but I’m fairly confident this is where the predictive text model is kept.
Here’s why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many of the files in <code>unilm.bundle</code> don’t exist on macOS Ventura (13.5), but they do exist on the macOS Sonoma beta (14.0). And the files that do exist in both versions have all been updated in Sonoma.</li>
  <li><code>sp.dat</code>, one of the files in <code>unilm.bundle</code>, exists on Ventura, but it’s been updated in the Sonoma beta. In the updated version of the file, I found what looks pretty clearly like a set of tokens for a tokenizer.</li>
  <li>The number of tokens in <code>sp.dat</code> matches the shape of the output layer in both <code>unilm_joint_cpu.espresso.shape</code> and <code>unilm_joint_ane.espresso.shape</code> (ANE = Apple Neural Engine), two files in <code>unilm.bundle</code> that describe the shapes of layers in an Espresso/CoreML model. This is what we would expect to see for a model that is trained to predict the next token.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-predictive-text-models-tokenizer">The predictive text model’s tokenizer</h2>

<p>I found a set of 15,000 tokens in <code>unilm.bundle/sp.dat</code> that pretty clearly look like they form the vocabulary set for a large language model.
I wrote a script that you can use to see this vocabulary file for yourself, which you can check out <a href="https://github.com/jackcook/predictive-spy">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The vocabulary starts with <code>&lt;pad&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;/s&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;unk&gt;</code> tokens, which are all fairly common special tokens (<code>roberta-base</code> and <code>t5-base</code> are two popular language models):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoTokenizer</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([0, 1, 2, 3])</code>
<code>['&lt;s&gt;', '&lt;pad&gt;', '&lt;/s&gt;', '&lt;unk&gt;']</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base")</code>
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([0, 1, 2])</code>
<code>['&lt;pad&gt;', '&lt;/s&gt;', '&lt;unk&gt;']</code>
</pre>

<p>Next come the following sequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 special tokens, named <code>UniLMCTRL0</code> through <code>UniLMCTRL19</code></li>
  <li>79 contractions (I’d, couldn’t, you’ve…)</li>
  <li>1 special <code>_U_CAP_</code> token</li>
  <li>20 special tokens, named <code>_U_PRE0_</code> through <code>_U_PRE19_</code></li>
  <li>60 special tokens, named <code>_U_NT00_</code> through <code>_U_NT59_</code></li>
  <li>100 emojis</li>
</ul>

<p>And then comes a more normal-looking list of 14,716 tokens, most of which are followed by the special character ▁ (U+9601), which is commonly used in byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, such as the GPT-2 tokenizer, to denote a space.</p>

<p>I have to say that this vocabulary file strikes me as pretty unique, but it’s definitely not out of the question for a language model deployed in this setting.
I’ve personally never seen emojis featured so prominently in a language model’s tokenizer, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15779">existing</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17564">research</a> has shown that domain-specific models and tokenizers can drastically improve downstream model performance.
So it makes sense that a model trained for use in things like text messages, in which emojis and contractions will be used a lot, would prioritize them.</p>

<h2 id="model-architecture">Model architecture</h2>

<p>Based on the contents of the <code>unilm_joint_cpu</code> model from earlier, we can make some assumptions about the predictive text network.
Despite sharing the name of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/unified-language-model-pre-training-for-natural-language-understanding-and-generation/">UniLM</a> from 2019, it looks more to me like a model based on <a href="https://openai.com/research/better-language-models">GPT-2</a>.</p>

<p>GPT-2 has four main parts: token embeddings, positional encodings, a series of 12-48 decoder blocks, and an output layer.
The network described by <code>unilm_joint_cpu</code> appears to be the same, except with only 6 decoder blocks.
Most of the layers within each decoder block have names like <code>gpt2_transformer_layer_3d</code>, which would also seem to suggest it’s based on a GPT-2 architecture.</p>

<p>From my calculations based on sizes of each layer, Apple’s predictive text model appears to have about 34 million parameters, and it has a hidden size of 512 units.
This makes it much smaller than even the smallest version of GPT-2.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Decoder Blocks</th>
      <th>Parameters</th>
      <th>Hidden Size</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Apple’s predictive text model</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>34M</td>
      <td>512</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>117M</td>
      <td>768</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2-medium</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>345M</td>
      <td>1024</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2-large</td>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>762M</td>
      <td>1280</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gpt2-xl</td>
      <td>48</td>
      <td>1542M</td>
      <td>1600</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For the limited scope of the predictive text feature, this makes sense to me.
Apple wants a model that can run very quickly and very frequently, without draining much of your device’s battery.
When I was testing the predictive text feature, suggestions appeared almost instantly as I typed, making for a great user experience.
While the model’s limited size means it wouldn’t be very good at writing full sentences or paragraphs, when it exhibits very high confidence in the next word or two, they’re likely to be good enough to suggest to the user.</p>

<p>However, with my script that snoops on activity from <code>AppleSpell</code>, we can get the model to write full sentences anyway.
If I type “Today” as the first word of my sentence and take the model’s top suggestion each time, here’s what I get (<a href="https://jackcook.com/img/blog/predictive-text/longer-demo.mov">video</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today is the day of the day and the day of the week is going to be a good thing I have to do is get a new one for the next couple weeks and I think I have a lot of…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not very inspiring.
We can compare this with the output from the smallest GPT-2 model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the White House is continuing its efforts against Iran to help the new President, but it will also try to build new alliances with Iran to make more…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or the largest GPT-2 model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the city of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, and the city’s Independent Police Review Authority, alleging that the police department and the Independent Police Review Authority engaged in a pattern or practice…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty cool seeing the effects of all those extra parameters!
It’ll be interesting to see how this feature grows and evolves in the future, and whether Apple decides to keep its scope fairly narrow or someday expand its abilities.</p>

      <p>To save his own life, Joseph Dombey had an idea. As two pirate ships surrounded the ship he was on in the Caribbean Sea in 1794, Dombey scrambled below deck, disrobing as he went. He appropriated the outfit of one of the ship’s many Spanish sailors and prayed that he had picked up enough of their language during his trips to South America to blend in. Dombey shouldn’t have been in this position. In fact, he shouldn’t have been in the Caribbean at all. None other than Thomas Jefferson himself was expecting to meet with Dombey in Philadelphia at that very moment.</p>

</p>
                </figcaption></figure><p>Dombey’s fate that day arguably delayed the adoption of the metric system in the United States by almost a century and left us as one of the few countries in the world still using non-metric units for our everyday measurements.</p>

<h3><strong>A doomed voyage</strong></h3>

<p>The marauders now swarming Dombey’s ship were a particular breed of pirate: British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer">privateers</a>—the state-sponsored terrorists of the 18th century. These waterborne gangs had the tacit approval of the government in London to harass and plunder other countries’ maritime commerce and keep part of the spoils as their profit.</p>

<p>After seizing control of the ship, the pirates came across a sailor speaking Spanish with a curiously French accent—Joseph Dombey. A French physician and botanist acting under orders from the French government, Dombey had left the port city of Le Havre, France, weeks earlier for Philadelphia and the meeting with Jefferson, the United States’ first secretary of state and future president. But storms had pushed Dombey’s ship off course and deep into pirate territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>France had supported the United States against the British in the War of Independence, and now they intended to build closer economic ties with the new American nation. Dombey was to negotiate with Jefferson for grain exports to France and to deliver two new French measurement standards: a standard of length (the meter) and a standard of mass called, rather ominously, a grave, to be considered by the U.S. for adoption. (The grave would be renamed the kilogram a year later in 1795.)</p>

<p>In many ways, Dombey was an excellent choice for this mission. Having already been on several trips to South America to collect botanical specimens, he was an experienced trans-Atlantic traveler. His knowledge of plants would also be of help in his agricultural trade negotiations with Jefferson. And Dombey’s scientific training as a physician and botanist gave him an understanding of the importance of accurate weights and measures, so it was highly likely that he would be able to convince Congress to adopt the new French standards, which would later come to be known as the metric system.</p>

<p>Despite his qualifications, Dombey lacked one important attribute: luck. His previous trips had all ended in failure. He had spent two years in Peru collecting plants that could be usefully cultivated in France, only to have the shipment captured by the British. A second collecting trip, this&nbsp;time in Chile and in collaboration with Spain, fell apart over a business dispute, with Spain keeping all the valuable specimens. But Dombey’s voyage to Philadelphia would turn out to be his most disastrous.</p>

          </figcaption></figure><p>Upon learning his true identity, the pirates imprisoned Dombey on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. Unfortunately, Dombey died before they were able to ransom him to the French, and the units of measure in his charge never made it into Jefferson’s hands.</p>

<h2><strong>A missed opportunity</strong></h2>

<p>Some historians view this event as a tragic missed opportunity whose consequences we are still living with today. When the U.S. became an independent nation, it inherited an inconsistent collection of traditional British weights and measures. Congress was aware of the flaws with its British measures, and a congressional committee was formed to recommend solutions. Thomas Jefferson, an admirer of French scientific ideas, lobbied for a measurement system similar to that of France. But Congress didn’t adopt it, and the British-influenced system took hold in the U.S. instead. However, If pirates hadn’t intercepted Dombey on his way to Philadelphia, the situation might be very different today. As historian Andro Linklater writes in his book&nbsp;<em>Measuring America</em>,</p>

<p>“The sight [in Congress] of those two copper objects [Dombey’s meter and grave], so easily copied and sent out to every state in the Union, together with the weighty scientific arguments supporting them, might well have clarified the minds of senators and representatives alike. And today the U.S. might not be the last country in the world to resist the metric system.”</p>

<p>It would take almost 100 years after Dombey’s failed mission before the United States, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendenhall_Order">Mendenhall Order of 1893</a>, officially adopted metric standards as our fundamental standards for weights and measures. While many U.S. industries have since converted to metric, the nation's long history with British-influenced standards&nbsp;has slowed the widespread adoption of metric units in common practice.</p>

And only Dombey’s set is known to have traveled to the Americas. The cargo on Dombey’s ship was eventually auctioned off. The meter and grave were purchased, and through a series of French intermediaries, the standards were turned over to the next U.S. secretary of state, Edmund Randolph. Randolph failed to understand the significance of the standards and took no action regarding them.</p>



<p>Somehow a grave ended up in the possession of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ellicott">Andrew Ellicott</a>, a contemporary of Dombey and a well-regarded land surveyor.&nbsp;Ellicott surveyed the boundaries for what became Washington, D.C., and completed the street plan for D.C. that had originally been envisioned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant">Pierre L'Enfant</a>. The grave remained in the Ellicott family until 1952 when his descendant Andrew Ellicott Douglass donated it to the NIST museum.</p>



<p>Is the grave now on display in the museum the same one captured by pirates in 1794? That remains a mystery.</p>
