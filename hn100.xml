<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-layout="tutorial"><a id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a><p>CSS Grid is one of the most amazing parts of the CSS language. It gives us a ton of new tools we can use to create sophisticated and fluid layouts.</p><p>It's also <em>surprisingly complex.</em> It took me quite a while to truly become comfortable with CSS Grid!</p><p>In this tutorial, I'm going to share the biggest 💡 lightbulb moments I've had in my own journey with CSS Grid. You'll learn the fundamentals of this layout mode, and see how to do some pretty cool stuff with it. ✨</p><div id="mental-model"><h2><a name="mental-model-1" id="mental-model-1" href="#mental-model-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Mental model</h2></div><p>CSS is comprised of several different <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/understanding-layout-algorithms/">layout algorithms</a>, each designed for different types of user interfaces. The default layout algorithm, Flow layout, is designed for digital documents. Table layout is designed for tabular data. Flexbox is designed for distributing items along a single axis.</p><p>CSS Grid is the latest and greatest layout algorithm. It's <em>incredibly</em> powerful: we can use it to build complex layouts that fluidly adapt based on a number of constraints.</p><p>The most unusual part of CSS Grid, in my opinion, is that the grid <em>structure</em>, the rows and columns, are defined <strong>purely in CSS:</strong></p><!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template><!--/$--><p>With CSS Grid, a single DOM node is sub-divided into rows and columns. In this tutorial, we're highlighting the rows/columns with dashed lines, but in reality, they're invisible.</p><p><em>This is super weird!</em> In every other layout mode, the only way to create compartments like this is by adding more DOM nodes. In Table layout, for example, each row is created with a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, and each cell within that row using <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>:</p><pre></pre><p>Unlike Table layout, CSS Grid lets us manage the layout entirely from within CSS. We can slice up the container however we wish, creating compartments that our grid children can use as anchors.</p><p>We opt in to the Grid layout mode with the <code>display</code> property:</p><pre></pre><p>By default, CSS Grid uses a single column, and will create rows as needed, based on the number of children. This is known as an <em>implicit grid</em>, since we aren't explicitly defining any structure.</p><p>Here's how this works:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template><!--/$--><p>Implicit grids are dynamic; rows will be added and removed based on the number of children. Each child gets its own row.</p><p>By default, the height of the grid parent is determined by its children. It grows and shrinks dynamically. Interestingly, this isn't even a “CSS Grid” thing; the grid <em>parent</em> is still using Flow layout, and block elements in Flow layout grow vertically to contain their content. Only the <em>children</em> are arranged using Grid layout.</p><p>But what if we give the grid a fixed height? In that case, the total surface area is divided into equally-sized rows:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:2"></template><!--/$--><div id="grid-construction"><h2><a name="grid-construction-3" id="grid-construction-3" href="#grid-construction-3"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Grid Construction</h2></div><p>By default, CSS Grid will create a single-column layout. We can specify columns using the <code>grid-template-columns</code> property:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>By passing two values to <code>grid-template-columns</code> — <code>25%</code> and <code>75%</code> — I'm telling the CSS Grid algorithm to slice the element up into two columns.</p><p>Columns can be defined using any valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length-percentage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSS <!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->length-percentage<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> value</a>, including pixels, rems, viewport units, and so on. Additionally, we also gain access to a new unit, the <code>fr</code> unit:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p><code>fr</code> stands for “fraction”. In this example, we're saying that the first column should consume 1 unit of space, while the second column consumes 3 units of space. That means there are 4 total units of space, and this becomes the denominator. The first column eats up ¼ of the available space, while the second column consumes ¾.</p><p>The <code>fr</code> unit brings Flexbox-style flexibility to CSS Grid. Percentages and <code>&lt;length&gt;</code> values create hard constraints, while <code>fr</code> columns are free to grow and shrink as required, to contain their contents.</p><p><strong>Try shrinking this container to see the difference:</strong></p><!--$?--><template id="B:3"></template><!--/$--><p>In this scenario, our first column has a cuddly ghost that has been given an explicit width of 55px. But what if the column is too small to contain it?</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Percentage-based columns are rigid, and so our ghost image will <em>overflow</em>, spilling out of the column.</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p><code>fr</code>-based columns are flexible, and so the column won't shrink below its minimum content size, even if that means breaking the proportions.</p></li></ul><p>To be more precise: the <code>fr</code> unit distributes <em>extra</em> space. First, column widths will be calculated based on their contents. If there's any leftover space, it'll be distributed based on the <code>fr</code> values. This is very similar to <code>flex-grow</code>, as discussed in my <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/">Interactive Guide to Flexbox</a>.</p><p>In general, this flexibility is a good thing. Percentages are too strict.</p><p>We can see a perfect example of this with <code>gap</code>. <code>gap</code> is a magical CSS property that adds a fixed amount of space between all of the columns and rows within our grid.</p><p>Check out what happens when we toggle between percentages and fractions:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:4"></template><!--/$--><p>Notice how the contents spill outside the grid parent when using percentage-based columns? This happens because percentages are calculated using the <em>total</em> grid area. The two columns consume 100% of the parent's content area, and they aren't allowed to shrink. When we add 16px of <code>gap</code>, the columns have no choice but to spill beyond the container.</p><p>The <code>fr</code> unit, by contrast, is calculated based on the <em>extra</em> space. In this case, the extra space has been reduced by 16px, for the <code>gap</code>. The CSS Grid algorithm distributes the remaining space between the two grid columns.</p><div id="implicit-and-explicit-rows"><h3><a name="implicit-and-explicit-rows-4" id="implicit-and-explicit-rows-4" href="#implicit-and-explicit-rows-4"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Implicit and explicit rows</h3></div><p>What happens if we add more than two children to a two-column grid?</p><p>Well, let's give it a shot:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>Interesting! Our grid gains a second row. The grid algorithm wants to ensure that every child has its own grid cell. It’ll spawn new rows as-needed to fulfill this goal. This is handy in situations where we have a variable number of items (eg. a photo grid), and we want the grid to expand automatically.</p><p>In other situations, though, we want to define the rows explicitly, to create a specific layout. We can do that with the <code>grid-template-rows</code> property:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>By defining both <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code>, we've created an explicit grid. This is perfect for building page layouts, like the <span>“Holy Grail”<span>?</span></span> layout at the top of this tutorial.</p><div id="the-repeat-helper"><h3><a name="the-repeat-helper-5" id="the-repeat-helper-5" href="#the-repeat-helper-5"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>The repeat helper</h3></div><p>Let's suppose we're building a calendar:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:5"></template><!--/$--><p>CSS Grid is a wonderful tool for this sort of thing. We can structure it as a 7-column grid, with each column consuming 1 unit of space:</p><pre></pre><p>This <em>works</em>, but it's a bit annoying to have to count each of those <code>1fr</code>’s. Imagine if we had 50 columns!</p><p>Fortunately, there's a nicer way to solve for this:</p><pre></pre><p>The <code>repeat</code> function will do the copy/pasting for us.

Children can even span across multiple rows/columns.</p><p>Here's an interactive demo that shows how this works. <em>Click/press and drag</em> to place a child in the <span>grid<span></span>:</span></p><!--$?--><template id="B:6"></template><!--/$--><p>The <code>grid-row</code> and <code>grid-column</code> properties allow us to specify which track(s) our grid child should occupy.</p><p>If we want the child to occupy a single row or column, we can specify it by its number. <code>grid-column: 3</code> will set the child to sit in the third column.</p><p>Grid children can also stretch across multiple rows/columns. The syntax for this uses a slash to delineate start and end:</p><pre></pre><p>At first glance, this looks like a fraction, ¼. In CSS, though, the slash character is not used for division, it's used to separate groups of values. In this case, it allows us to set the start and end columns in a single declaration.</p><p>It's essentially a shorthand for this:</p><pre></pre><p><strong>There's a sneaky gotcha here:</strong> The numbers we're providing are based on the column <em>lines</em>, not the column indexes.</p><p>It'll be easiest to understand this gotcha with a diagram:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:7"></template><!--/$--><p>Confusingly, a 4-column grid actually has <em>5</em> column lines. When we assign a child to our grid, we anchor them using these lines. If we want our child to span the first 3 columns, it needs to start on the 1st line and end on the 4th line.</p><div id="grid-areas"><h3><a name="grid-areas-7" id="grid-areas-7" href="#grid-areas-7"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Grid areas</h3></div><p>Alright, time to talk about one of the coolest parts of CSS Grid. 😄</p><p>Let's suppose we're building this layout:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:9"></template><!--/$--><p>Using what we've learned so far, we could structure it like this:</p><pre></pre><p>This works, but there's a more ergonomic way to do this: <em>grid areas.</em></p><p>Here's what it looks like:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:a"></template><!--/$--><p>Like before, we're defining the grid structure with <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code>. But then, we have this curious declaration:</p><pre></pre><p><strong>Here's how this works:</strong> We're drawing out the grid we want to create, almost as if we were making <span>ASCII art<span>?</span></span>. Each line represents a row, and each word is a name we're giving to a particular slice of the grid. See how it sorta looks like the grid, visually?</p><p>Then, instead of assigning a child with <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code>, we assign it with <code>grid-area</code>!</p><p>When we want a particular area to span multiple rows or columns, we can repeat the name of that area in our template. In this example, the “sidebar” area spans both rows, and so we write <code>sidebar</code> for both cells in the first column.</p><p><strong>Should we use areas, or rows/columns?</strong> When building explicit layouts like this, I really like using areas. It allows me to give semantic meaning to my grid assignments, instead of using inscrutable row/column numbers. That said, areas work best when the grid has a fixed number of rows and columns. <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> can be useful for implicit grids.</p><div id="being-mindful-of-keyboard-users"><h3><a name="being-mindful-of-keyboard-users-8" id="being-mindful-of-keyboard-users-8" href="#being-mindful-of-keyboard-users-8"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Being mindful of keyboard users</h3></div><p>There's a big gotcha when it comes to grid assignments: <strong>tab order will still be based on <em>DOM position,</em> not grid position.</strong></p><p>It'll be easier to explain with an example. In this playground, I've set up a group of buttons, and arranged them with CSS Grid:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In the “RESULT” pane, the buttons appear to be in order. By reading from left to right, and from top to bottom, we go from one to six.</p><p><strong>If you're using a device with a keyboard, try to tab through these buttons.</strong> You can do this by clicking the first button in the top left (“One”), and then pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move through the buttons one at a time.</p><p>You should see something like this:</p><p>The focus outline jumps around the page without rhyme or reason, from the user's perspective. This happens because the buttons are being focused based on the order they appear in the DOM.</p><p>To fix this, we should re-order the grid children in the DOM so that they match the visual order, so that I can tab through from left to right, and from top to bottom.<span></span></p><p>In all the examples we've seen so far, our columns and rows stretch to fill the entire grid container. This doesn't need to be the case, however!</p><p>For example, let's suppose we define two columns that are each 90px wide. As long as the grid parent is larger than 180px, there will be some dead space at the end:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:b"></template><!--/$--><p>We can control the distribution of the columns using the <code>justify-content</code> property:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:c"></template><!--/$--><p>If you're familiar with the Flexbox layout algorithm, this probably feels pretty familiar. CSS Grid builds on the alignment properties first introduced with Flexbox, taking them even further.</p><p><strong>The big difference is that we're aligning the <em>columns</em>, not the items themselves.</strong> Essentially, <code>justify-content</code> lets us arrange the compartments of our grid, distributing them across the grid however we wish.</p><p>If we want to align the items themselves <em>within</em> their columns, we can use the <code>justify-items</code> property:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:d"></template><!--/$--><p>When we plop a DOM node into a grid parent, the default behaviour is for it to stretch across that entire column, just like how a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in Flow layout will stretch horizontally to fill its container. With <code>justify-items</code>, however, we can tweak that behaviour.</p><p>This is useful because it allows us to break free from the rigid symmetry of columns. When we set <code>justify-items</code> to something other than <code>stretch</code>, the children will shrink down to their default width, as determined by their contents. As a result, items in the same column can be different widths.</p><p>We can even control the alignment of a <em>specific</em> grid child using the <code>justify-self</code> property:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:e"></template><!--/$--><p>Unlike <code>justify-items</code>, which is set on the grid parent and controls the alignment of <em>all</em> grid children, <code>justify-self</code> is set on the child. We can think of <code>justify-items</code> as a way to set a default value for <code>justify-self</code> on all grid children.</p><div id="aligning-rows"><h3><a name="aligning-rows-10" id="aligning-rows-10" href="#aligning-rows-10"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Aligning rows</h3></div><p>So far, we've been talking about how to align stuff in the <em>horizontal</em> direction.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Did you know that Unix systems have a binary whose name is a single symbol?</p><p>Go and look for it. Run <code>ls /bin/?</code> and behold:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ls /bin/?
/bin/[
</code></pre><p>Uh huh. <code>[</code>? The square bracket? That’s a program?!</p><p>But wait, it gets more interesting:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ls -li /bin/[ /bin/test
834 -rwxr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  35824 Jan 23 08:59 /bin/[
834 -rwxr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  35824 Jan 23 08:59 /bin/test
</code></pre><p>The two names, <code>[</code> and <code>test</code>, point to the same binary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. But why? What are these?</p><p>The <code>test</code> program is what you use in the shell to evaluate an expression. You can use this to compare strings, compare numbers, and to check various conditions on files. If you have written a shell script—any shell script really—you certainly have used either of these variants.</p><p>The way this works is simple: the <code>test</code> program takes a bunch of arguments, evaluates the expression represented by them, and returns 0 if the expression is true or 1 if it is false. This then lets you do things like:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>if test a = b; then
    echo "The two strings were the same! Oops!"
fi
</code></pre><p>So why do we have two names for this helper tool? I haven’t been able to find the definitive answer, but my guess is simply: because the above “looks ugly”, and the “obvious” solution to make it look nicer is to introduce <code>[</code> as a command. With it, you can express the same logic from above as:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>if [ a = b ]; then
    echo "The two strings were the same! Oops!"
fi
</code></pre><p>Yup. Exact same code as above. The only difference here is that the <code>test</code> binary checks its <code>argv[0]</code> to see if it’s invoked as <code>test</code> or as <code>[</code>. If the invocation happens to use the latter, then the program ensures that the last argument is the matching <code>]</code> to keep things balanced.</p><p>With that, you can deduce that you don’t even need the conditional statement to use either of these commands and see what’s going on:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ test a = a; echo $?
0
$ test a = b; echo $?
1
$ [ a = a ]; echo $?
0
$ [ a = b ]; echo $?
1
</code></pre><p>That’s right. The <code>if</code> statement we used in the previous examples just takes <em>a command</em> as its argument and runs it to get its exit code. (And with this, you can “guess” that <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are… yup, yup… also helper binaries.)</p><p>To make things more confusing, though, pay attention to the following:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ /bin/test a b
test: a: unexpected operator
$ test a b
dash: 2: test: a: unexpected operator
</code></pre><p>Why did we get different outputs there? Well… as it so happens, <code>test</code> and <code>[</code> appear <em>a lot</em> in shell scripts. Invoking them as separate binaries would be very inefficient, so the vast majority of the shells implement these commands as built-ins <em>too</em>. You may get different behavior depending on whether you run the external binary or the builtin, which means you easily get different behavior across different shells. (And that’s true for many other things like the innocent-looking <code>echo</code>.)</p><hr><p>So what about <code>[[</code>? This is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Conditional-Constructs.html#index-_005b_005b">a Bash extension</a> and replaces the use of <code>[</code>. The key difference, however, is that <code>[[</code> is <em>guaranteed</em> to be a builtin and therefore it can change, and it does change, the fundamental rules of the language within the expression it evaluates. To illustrate this, let’s look at an example with globs:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ touch long-name
$ [ long* = long-name ] &amp;&amp; echo match
match
$ [[ long* = long-name ]] &amp;&amp; echo match
</code></pre><p>The first command shown here is an invocation of the <code>[</code> tool, which may or may not be a builtin. No matter what, all arguments are subject to the regular shell expansion rules, so <code>long*</code> is matched against the directory contents, is then expanded to <code>long-name</code>, and thus the test succeeds. But, in contrast, <code>[[</code> produces a different result because it treats the <code>long*</code> as a literal string, so all this is doing is comparing <code>long*</code> against <code>long-name</code> verbatim, and therefore failing.</p><p>What should you use, then? If you are writing a portable shell script (please do), then stick to <code>[</code>. You can also use <code>test</code>, but I don’t think that’s too common. But if you know your script is going to be Bash-specific anyway, you are probably better served by using <code>[[</code> unconditionally and consistently, as it provides a lot of nice features (like regular expression matches via <code>=~</code>).</p><hr><p>And now for the final lolz. I’ve said above that these are the commands you use to evaluate expressions… but the shell <em>also</em> has expressions of its own via the <code>!</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, and <code>||</code> operators—all of which work on command exit statuses. That is:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ grep ^hello$ /usr/share/dict/words &amp;&amp; grep ^bye$ /usr/share/dict/words
hello
bye
$ echo $?
0
$ grep ^tyop$ /usr/share/dict/words &amp;&amp; grep ^bye$ /usr/share/dict/words
$ echo $?
1
</code></pre><p>Which means… that you can combine <code>test</code> expressions and shell expressions in one invocation:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>if [ a = b ] || grep -q ^hello$ /usr/share/dict/words; then
  echo "test failed and grep succeeded"
fi
</code></pre><p>You pick whether to be amused or horrified. I don’t know how exactly my coworker reacted when I hinted at this during a recent code review I did for them.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

</figure><p>Researchers have used the technology behind the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT to create a fake clinical-trial data set to support an unverified scientific claim.</p><p>In a paper published in <i>JAMA Ophthalmology</i> on 9 November<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, the authors used GPT-4 — the latest version of the large language model on which ChatGPT runs — paired with Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), a model that incorporates the programming language Python and can perform statistical analysis and create data visualizations. The AI-generated data compared the outcomes of two surgical procedures and indicated — wrongly — that one treatment is better than the other.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>“Our aim was to highlight that, in a few minutes, you can create a data set that is not supported by real original data, and it is also opposite or in the other direction compared to the evidence that are available,” says study co-author Giuseppe Giannaccare, an eye surgeon at the University of Cagliari in Italy.</p><p>The ability of AI to fabricate convincing data adds to concern among researchers and journal editors about research integrity. “It was one thing that generative AI could be used to generate texts that would not be detectable using plagiarism software, but the capacity to create fake but realistic data sets is a next level of worry,” says Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist and independent research-integrity consultant in San Francisco, California. “It will make it very easy for any researcher or group of researchers to create fake measurements on non-existent patients, fake answers to questionnaires or to generate a large data set on animal experiments.”</p><p>The authors describe the results as a “seemingly authentic database”. But when examined by specialists, the data failed authenticity checks, and contained telltale signs of having been fabricated.</p><h2>Surgery comparison</h2><p>The authors asked GPT-4 ADA to create a data set concerning people with an eye condition called keratoconus, which causes thinning of the cornea and can lead to impaired focus and poor vision. For 15–20% of people with the disease, treatment involves a corneal transplant, performed using one of two procedures.</p><p>The first method, penetrating keratoplasty (PK), involves surgically removing all the damaged layers of the cornea and replacing them with healthy tissue from a donor. The second procedure, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), replaces only the front layer of the cornea, leaving the innermost layer intact.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The authors instructed the large language model to fabricate data to support the conclusion that DALK results in better outcomes than PK. To do that, they asked it to show a statistical difference in an imaging test that assesses the cornea’s shape and detects irregularities, as well as a difference in how well the trial participants could see before and after the procedures.</p><p>The AI-generated data included 160 male and 140 female participants and indicated that those who underwent DALK scored better in both vision and the imaging test did than those who had PK, a finding that is at odds with what genuine clinical trials show. In a 2010 report of a trial with 77 participants, the outcomes of DALK were similar to those of PK for up to 2 years after the surgery<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><p>“It seems like it’s quite easy to create data sets that are at least superficially plausible. So, to an untrained eye, this certainly looks like a real data set,” says Jack Wilkinson, a biostatistician at the University of Manchester, UK.</p><p>Wilkinson, who has an interest in methods to detect inauthentic data, has examined several data sets generated by earlier versions of the large language model, which he says lacked convincing elements when scrutinized, because they struggled to capture realistic relationships between variables.</p><h2>Closer scrutiny</h2><p>At the request of <i>Nature</i>’s news team, Wilkinson and his colleague Zewen Lu assessed the fake data set using a screening protocol designed to check for authenticity.</p><p>This revealed a mismatch in many ‘participants’ between designated sex and the sex that would typically be expected from their name. Furthermore, no correlation was found between preoperative and postoperative measures of vision capacity and the eye-imaging test. Wilkinson and Lu also inspected the distribution of numbers in some of the columns in the data set to check for non-random patterns. The eye-imaging values passed this test, but some of the participants’ age values clustered in a way that would be extremely unusual in a genuine data set: there was a disproportionate number of participants whose age values ended with 7 or 8.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The study authors acknowledge that their data set has flaws that could be detected with close scrutiny. But nevertheless, says Giannaccare, “if you look very quickly at the data set, it’s difficult to recognize the non-human origin of the data source”.</p><p>Bernd Pulverer, chief editor of <i>EMBO Reports</i>, agrees that this is a cause for concern. “Peer review in reality often stops short of a full data re-analysis and is unlikely to pick up on well-crafted integrity breaches using AI,” he says, adding that journals will need to update quality checks to identify AI-generated synthetic data.</p><p>Wilkinson is leading a collaborative project to design statistical and non-statistical tools to assess potentially problematic studies. “In the same way that AI might be part of the problem, there might be AI-based solutions to some of this. We might be able to automate some of these checks,” he says. But he warns that advances in generative AI could soon offer ways to circumvent these protocols. Pulverer agrees: “These are things the AI can be easily weaponized against as soon as it is known what the screening looks for.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Tesla prepares to deliver its first Cybertrucks to customers, a new report paints a grisly picture of the Texas factory where the truck is being built, including a casting machine explosion and a robot allegedly goring a worker. </p><p><em>The Information</em> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-teslas-giant-texas-factory-injuries-and-safety-lapses-mount">reported some of the gruesome incidents</a> that have occurred at the Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, where one out of every 21 workers were reportedly hurt in 2022. The data is derived from the required injury reports Tesla submits to OSHA. </p><p>One incident in 2021 involved an engineer who approached a supposed shutdown robot arm but got clawed and pinned to the wall by the machine performing its programmed motions. A witness said the engineer bled from his back and arms, and after someone hit the emergency stop button, the engineer pulled himself out and fell into a chute, leaving a trail of blood.</p><p>An injury report submitted to Travis County, Texas, by Tesla reportedly has a robot-related incident but does not clearly match the one from witness accounts. The reported one does not state the person missed any time from work. In unrelated incidents in August 2022, a worker’s ankle got caught under a cart, which put them out of work for 127 days. Days later, another worker suffered a head injury which put them out for 85 days.</p><p>Other injury reports were more recent. At least one worker was concussed after getting launched back from an explosion in the metal casting area around New Year’s 2023. The blast was allegedly caused by water inadvertently mixing into the molten aluminum press machine. A witness who saw surveillance video said the explosion sent a ball of fire and smoke into the air, damaged the die, and curled up a door that seals the chamber. It’s not clear if Tesla reported this to OSHA, which reportedly didn't have an inspection for this incident.</p><p>Another worker claims the molding machine also didn’t correctly seal and often spat out molten metal. When a worker presented a solution to fix the issue, they were reprimanded that shutting it down would slow production output.</p><p>In June, contractors installing metal grating for elevated walkways in the factory fell to the ground due to a lack of protective equipment. Some of the metal walkway fell on top of them, leaving them with fractures and a punctured lung. OSHA inspected this incident and fined the contractors. </p><p>It’s not the only time things fell from above: <em>The Information </em>reports incidents of air conditioning ducts, steel beams, and other building materials crashing to the ground near autoworkers.</p><p>Tesla’s Fremont factory in California also has a torrid history with worker injuries. Employees there have a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681472/tesla-model-3-electric-car-factory-injury-rate-worker-safety">higher injury rate</a> than the national average. Tesla has been accused of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064326/tesla-factory-worker-injuries-clinic-fremont">underreporting injuries</a> and of failing to address hazards in an outdoor tent that was erected for the assembly line, incurring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197866/tesla-fined-osha-safety-hazards-model-3-tent">fines</a>.</p><p>Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23008731/tesla-texas-gigafactory-open-cybertruck-elon-musk">first opened</a> in April 2022 and was built about two years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y">its announcement in 2020</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="how-do-i-become-a-graphics-programmer-a-small-guide-from-the-amd-game-engineering-team" role="main" data-id="3cfd864" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Every now and then we get asked what a beginner-friendly website is for learning graphics programming. We’d love to recommend GPUOpen of course, but the truth is, the main target audience for GPUOpen is intermediate or advanced graphics programmers. For someone who just started to dive into the world of graphics, there are surely other websites more suitable for them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, there is no one right way to get into graphics. It mostly depends on potential pre-existing knowledge, how you like to learn, personal preference, available hardware, etc. Hence, this guide is more a collection of websites that we think are useful for beginners, and a small discussion weighing the pro and cons of the websites and what they teach.</p>
<section id="which-programming-language">
<h2 id="which-programming-language?">Which programming language?</h2>
<p>When we talk to students about our job, one of the questions we almost always get is: which programming language do you use? The short answer is: C++.</p>
<p>The long answer is … well, if you do graphics, you write code for the host CPU, usually in C++, but you also write code for the GPU in what the industry has come to call shader code, typically in a high-level shading language such as HLSL or GLSL. You also need a way to tie them both together, asking the CPU to ask the GPU to do something useful using shaders and the other data and metadata needed to make that happen. That’s where the graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) come in, which you drive usually as host CPU code written in C++.</p>
<p>So the more controversial question is: which graphics API you should start with. And we don’t have an answer for you, just a bunch of different opinions and considerations. We’ll narrow in on the common graphics APIs used to write most PC games or 3D applications at this point, ignoring things like games consoles with their (mostly) proprietary APIs.</p>
<p>There are different graphics APIs out there, but in 2023 it essentially boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenGL® / Microsoft® DirectX®11 / WebGL™</li>
<li>Vulkan® / Microsoft® DirectX®12 / Metal / WebGPU</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenGL®, DirectX®11 and WebGL™ are legacy APIs. They’re based on a historical approach to programming the GPU. Nonetheless, they are still widely used across academia and industry since they’re simpler from the programmer’s perspective and thus easier to learn. Their simplicity comes at a cost however, since the underlying implementation of those APIs in any driver and runtime code became more complex over time, causing host-side bottlenecks and very complicated drivers for GPU vendors to write.</p>
<p>In 2014-2016 things changed with the introduction of Metal (2014), DirectX®12 and Vulkan® (both 2016), which all took a lower-level and more explicit approach to programming the GPU. They put a higher burden on the programmer being more clear and explicit about what they’d like the GPU to do, giving the programmer more control.</p>
<p>It effectively moves more of the traditional view of what a GPU driver is into the application. The tradeoff is more control for the programmer, and thus the opportunity for more performance and efficiency in what happens on the GPU.</p>
<p>Knowing how the GPU programming paradigm shifted, the decision about what API to pick might seem easy. If you want to learn graphics programming on Windows®, which is the primary target for PC games, then the instinct will be to pick Vulkan® or DirectX®12, as this is the new stuff, right?</p>
<p>However, not only are the legacy APIs still widely used, they are much simpler and easier to learn. So it might make sense to first learn the legacy APIs, and then later on move to the modern graphics APIs. Instead of immediately climbing Mount Everest, you first train at your local hill.</p>
<p>A simple comparison is how many lines of code are needed to draw a triangle on the screen, which is the “Hello, World!” equivalent in graphics programming. While OpenGL® or DirectX®11 need about 10 lines of code to get to the first triangle, Vulkan® and DirectX®12 require at least an order of magnitude more.</p>
<p>So, on the other hand, you can also say that Vulkan® and DirectX®12 require you to do more hand-holding for the GPU. You need 100 lines of code, but each line is clearer about what eventually happens on the GPU. While with OpenGL® and DirectX®11 a lot of the things are hidden and taken care for you, it’s easier for it to appear like a magic box and the few things you need to do might not make much sense in terms of understanding how the GPU works.</p>
<p>Vulkan® and DirectX®12 force you to deal with and gain that lower-level knowledge and understand early on, while OpenGL® and DirectX®11 act on a higher level and let you focus with the more productive aspects of graphics programming.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the AMD Game Engineering team have to say about whether one should start with a legacy API or with a modern API:</p>
<p><em>“Starting by learning graphics programming with DX12® or Vulkan® as a teenager would be rough.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We’re a long way away from the ol’ glVertex hello triangle.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Shame that OpenGL® is no longer super relevant tho.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I think it (OpenGL®) is still good enough to learn the basics imho.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I started out with DX10® which I think is not bad, but a lot of kids struggle with it if they are not proficient in C++.”</em> – DX10® is the predecessor of DX11® and outdated – don’t learn DX10®!</p>
<p><em>“But there are many things in play. Learning the theory of rasterisation and ray tracing. Learning the traditional pipeline. Learning how to feed a GPU work etc… I don’t know in what order they should be learnt but I’m usually all-in C++ (there is no need to start in another language) so I should probably say just start with Vulkan®… but I’m not really sure to be honest.”</em></p>
<p>And of course, there is also the possibility to learn graphics programming without OpenGL® and DirectX®11 or Vulkan® and DirectX®12. We mentioned WebGL™ and WebGPU in the broad classes of graphics APIs that are available, both of which operate in the web browser domain which is a whole software ecosystem (and arguably a full operating system) in its own right.</p>
<p>You can do real-time graphics in the web browser via WebGL™ or WebGPU too! One advantage is that you don’t need C++ for the web (but can technically still use it to drive graphics in the browser with something like WebAssembly). In the browser, the dominant programming language of JavaScript is fine!</p>
<p>Or, if you want to focus on higher-level stuff first and not bother with the lower-level details of a graphics API and hand-authoring shaders, maybe even a game engine is the right choice for you. <a href="https://gpuopen.com/unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine</a> is the biggest for PC games, with <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity®</a> the most common alternative, along with a boatload of smaller, simpler, open-source engines like <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot</a> to play with too.</p>
<p>Here’s some opinions from our AMD Game Engineering team:</p>
<p><em>“IMHO, getting newcomers to start out with DX12® or Vulkan® is rough, but maybe doable. I would say that starting out with WebGL™ just to understand the graphics pipeline is probably the easiest (and you focus on the right stuff).”</em></p>
<p><em>“WebGPU might give you concepts closer to modern graphics APIs without the extra low-level details.”</em></p>
<p><em>“WebGPU will probably get a lot better but right now I think you can expect a lot of kinks once you start writing nontrivial code. Still, it was very cool and it worked surprisingly well. I sincerely hope it gets better, but what exists right now is super promising. For prototyping stuff this is crazy good. And yeah, it would probably make a good API for learning / teaching too.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I know a few schools use Unity® for their first rendering courses which probably isn’t half bad, but there is a risk those students will never understand why they need to learn the lower-level stuff…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Starting with an explicit API is fine if you have a good handle on the modern graphics pipeline and the high-level of how GPU hardware implements it, or you want to pick up that GPU hardware understanding along the way. Otherwise start with something simpler to get going and then look at an explicit API later if you need or want to.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Personally, I feel that maybe acclimating to shaders through a popular game engine before moving to writing custom host code might be a good way of getting into it. It’s very hard to learn if you don’t have a clear view of what you want to achieve in a graphics API, otherwise you might just quit when you get to the triangle.”</em></p>

<h2 id="useful-websites">Useful websites</h2>
<p>So what do we recommend in terms of learning resources? These are some of the websites suggested by members of the AMD Game Engineering team:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learnopengl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learnopengl.com</a> – “LearnOpenGL is the best beginner site I can think of that shows you how to actually do this stuff with a real API in C++.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.scratchapixel.com</a> – “What makes scratch a pixel nice is that you don’t end up with a ton of code. You focus on learning how RT works for example.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.udemy.com/</a> – “Udemy is a good place for courses to get people started.”</li>
<li><a href="https://rastertek.com/tutindex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://rastertek.com/tutindex.html</a> – OpenGL®/DirectX®11 tutorial</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io</a> : Ray Tracing in one weekend – “I like hands on approaches to learning, so Ray Tracing in a weekend is nice if you can code a little.”</li>
<li><a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/a-trip-through-the-graphics-pipeline-2011-index/</a> – “A trip through the graphics pipeline from the GPU’s perspective. It’s from 2011, so it pre-dates the explicit APIs, but lots of the hardware and software concepts still apply.”</li>
<li><a href="https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/</a> – “There is a “learn webgpu” site in the same style as learnopengl, but very wip.”</li>
<li><a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app</a> – “I haven’t fully read it, but this is decent.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.shadertoy.com/</a> – “Shadertoy lets you write shaders without the need to deal with any graphics API. I would never have gotten interested in graphics enough to want to learn OpenGL® if I hadn’t started out in something simpler (for me it was just direct painting on a java canvas).”</li>
<li><a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://vulkan-tutorial.com/</a> – “I also feel it’s important for people not to be afraid of copy-paste especially with Vulkan® and DirectX®.”</li>
</ul>

But it was far from their first protest of the Democrat-led effort to reform drug pricing in the US, which pays <a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/how-do-prescription-drug-costs-in-the-united-states-compare-to-other-countries/#Per%20capita%20prescribed%20medicine%20spending,%20U.S.%20dollars,%202004-2019">far more for prescription drugs than other high-income countries</a>.
</p><p>In 2022, the pharmaceutical industry's top lobbying group, PhRMA, gave a record $7.5 million to the GOP-linked dark money group, American Action Network (AAN), which spent millions on advertising that year opposing drug pricing reforms, some of which made it into the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p><a href="https://issueone.org/press/phrma-contributed-record-sum-to-gop-aligned-dark-money-group-in-2022-new-tax-filing-reviewed-by-issue-one-shows/">The revelation was announced by Issue One</a>, a campaign finance reform advocacy group that reviewed federal tax filings. Issue One also highlighted that the $7.5 million donation was the largest donation to date that PhRMA has given AAN.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>From 2010 to 2022, PhRMA has given the dark money group more than $34.5 million. In 2016, PhRMA gave $6.1 million to AAN as it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/business/the-stealth-campaign-to-kill-off-obamacare.html">stealthily backed an aggressive Republican effort to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act</a>, which was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p>"Public policymaking should be done on behalf of the public’s interest, and the forces involved in policymaking should be operating in daylight, not darkness," Issue One CEO Nick Penniman said in the announcement. "Unfortunately, our findings suggest that neither is true when it comes to the pharmaceutical industry. That’s a shame for public health, for government spending, and for Americans who can’t afford the drugs they need."</p>
<p>Dark money groups like AAN are politically active groups that are not required to reveal their donors publicly. But, certain donors—including PhRMA—are required to report their contributions as expenditures on tax filings. Issue One obtained <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24172399-phrma-2022-irs-form-990">an annual tax filing</a> PhRMA submitted to the IRS last week.</p>
<p>Politico also reported that <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2023/11/21/phrma-gave-big-to-dark-money-groups-boosting-drug-pricing-critics-00128360">PhRMA gave $1.6 million in 2022 to the centrist dark money group Center Forward</a>, which funneled money to Democratic lawmakers who hampered the party's drug pricing reform efforts.</p>

<p>Chrome has been the dominant web browser for PC and mobile for some time now. Chrome is everywhere, to the point a huge selection of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-android-web-browser/">the best mobile browsers</a> are Chromium-based (Google's open-sourced version of Chrome), and just because <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/10402/worldwide-browser-market-share-by-platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chrome has been the leading choice for Android and desktop users</a>, it doesn't mean it's necessarily the best browser out there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/chrome-using-much-ram-fix-right-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chrome is known as a system hog</a> on your CPU and RAM, but unfortunately, Firefox also adds stress to your system resources. But when it comes to the best privacy and security and a cleaner browsing experience, Firefox reigns supreme over the majority of Chromium implementations.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":0,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":0,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":10,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":278} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":1,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":1,"ruleCount":10,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>But the final push to start using Firefox over Chrome might finally be thanks to the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/firefox-mozilla-extensions-android-mobile/">enormous selection of add-ons</a> (Firefox's version of extensions) coming out next month. Chrome doesn't offer native support for extensions in its mobile app. This is where Mozilla can finally regain ground over Google, especially now that Google is so insistent on serving ads everywhere, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-ads-european-union-law-google-meta/">like YouTube and its current security concerns</a>.</p>

<h2 id="firefox-wins-the-battle-for-best-user-privacy-and-security"> Firefox wins the battle for best user privacy and security </h2>
<p>As a non-profit project, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mozilla is committed to transparency and user privacy</a> through an open-source model. The advantage of running an open-source project is that the entire community can contribute to making the web a better place, plus the code is public, which means anyone can audit it.</p>

<p>Firefox also protects your privacy with its <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a>. While Google has been <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-chrome-120/">taking its sweet time phasing out cookies</a>, Mozilla has been making progress with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/mozilla-total-cookie-protection-default-firefox/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Total Cookie Protection (TCP) since 2021</a>, and it's on by default. With extra add-ons coming to Firefox, installing your favorite extensions for privacy and security will only get easier.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/how-to-open-chrome-web-store/">Chrome Web Store</a> has plenty of extensions to improve your Chrome browsing. These extensions can help you block ads, manage passwords, and provide anti-malware tools to make internet browsing safe and more secure. Only trusted Chrome extensions make it to the Chrome Web Store. But sadly, Google doesn't extend these benefits to its mobile browser. And if you can't live without your extensions, you'd have to settle with third-party extensions on Chromium-based web browsers instead, moving you away from Chrome.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":768} -->
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/install-add-on-extension-mozilla-firefox-android/">Mozilla offers only a few select add-ons</a> (Mozilla's version of extensions) that work on Android, one of which is uBlock Origin (proving itself incredibly helpful as YouTube wages war against adblockers). But soon, Mozilla <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/firefox-mozilla-extensions-android-mobile/">will launch 200 new add-ons in Firefox 120</a>. That's a whopping 200 more than Google, bringing Firefox Mobile much closer to its Desktop sibling, something Google appears deadset against with Chrome on mobile.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":1213} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":0} -->

<h2 id="add-ons-ensure-firefox-brings-a-competitive-edge-to-mobile"> Add-ons ensure Firefox brings a competitive edge to mobile </h2>
<p>When using Firefox, once you plug in a few helpful add-ons, you don't have to worry about sifting through tons of ads, auto-playing videos, and pop-ups. The uBlock Origin plugin can take care of these things, and if it doesn't, you can manually tell it to. And that's just one add-on. Imagine what 200 will bring to the table. Browsing the web on mobile can be just as clutter-free as web browsing on a computer. And since we often prefer to jump into a news story as quickly as possible on our mobile devices, thanks to Firefox's use of add-ons, background clutter and every other annoyance filling our tiny screens may soon be a thing of the past.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":4,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":905} -->

<p>It's no secret Google loves ads; <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/" target="_blank">Google generates billions of dollars from ads alone</a>. And so the vast majority of sites you read follow suit, requiring ads to keep their livelihoods in check as the pay rate continues to fall. Unfortunately, based on how important ads have become for generating revenue, there will never be a shortage of ads online.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":4,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":4,"nbrPlacementsScanned":5,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":353} -->
<p>But in a world of ads, ads can still exist without being intrusive. Google doesn't care which ads you see until you use filters. We also know <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google can serve ads that are used for nefarious purposes</a>, which is <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221?=8324278624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">why the FBI recommends using an ad blocker when online</a>. And thanks to how lucrative ads have become for Google, the company will more than likely never budge on its stance to bring extension support to mobile, as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/435252/adblock-users-worldwide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most users will install adblockers</a>. But with Firefox, you can already install uBlock Origin to lockdown those ads, with 200 more add-ons coming soon to bolster the experience.</p>

<h2 id="it-39-s-about-winning-the-war-not-the-battle"> It's about winning the war, not the battle </h2>
<p>Google Chrome may still be everyone's favorite browser on desktop and mobile, especially with its <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/best-google-chrome-extensions/">impressive library of extensions</a> for desktops. Still, with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/firefox-mozilla-extensions-android-mobile/">Mozilla Firefox catching up to the extension and add-on</a> game and bringing its work over to Android, Firefox has more than enough fuel to make a comeback in no time flat, especially as Google wages war <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-ads-european-union-law-google-meta/">against adblockers and its users</a>, privacy be damned. With Mozilla's recent moves ensuring Firefox takes shape as one of the most accessible web browsers around, you'd think Google would eventually pick up the pace and start making some pro-consumer moves.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":5,"startingPoint":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":5,"nbrPlacementsScanned":6,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":2,"actualCount":625} -->
<p>But products can only improve with better competition; having another web browser that turns heads may finally force Google to up its game if Firefox really makes a splash once its new add-on supports drops. So not only is it high time to give Firefox another chance as Chrome grows stale and ad-filled, you can expect hundreds of add-ons to make the Firefox browsing experience even better <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on November 21st</a>.</p>

    Reflecting on 18 years at Google
   </h3>
<p>I joined Google in October 2005, and handed in my resignation 18 years later. Last week was my last week at Google.</p>

<p>I feel very lucky to have experienced the early post-IPO Google; unlike most companies, and contrary to the popular narrative, Googlers, from the junior engineer all the way to the C-suite, were genuinely good people who cared very much about doing the right thing. The oft-mocked "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">don't be evil</a>" truly was the guiding principle of the company at the time (largely a reaction to contemporaries like Microsoft whose operating procedures put profits far above the best interests of customers and humanity as a whole).</p>

<p>Many times I saw Google criticised for actions that were sincerely intended to be good for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.">Google Books</a>, for example. Much of the criticism Google received around Chrome and Search, especially around supposed conflicts of interest with Ads, was way off base (it's surprising how often coincidences and mistakes can appear malicious). I often saw privacy advocates argue against Google proposals in ways that were net harmful to users. Some of these fights have had lasting effects on the world at large; one of the most annoying is the prevalence of pointless cookie warnings we have to wade through today. I found it quite frustrating how teams would be legitimately actively pursuing ideas that would be good for the world, without prioritising short-term Google interests, only to be met with cynicism in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>Early Google was also an excellent place to work. Executives gave frank answers on a weekly basis, or were candid about their inability to do so (e.g. for legal reasons or because some topic was too sensitive to discuss broadly). Eric Schmidt regularly walked the whole company through the discussions of the board. The successes and failures of various products were presented more or less objectively, with successes celebrated and failures examined critically with an eye to learning lessons rather than assigning blame. The company had a vision, and deviations from that vision were explained. Having experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dilbert_characters#Pointy-haired_Boss">Dilbert-level management</a> during my internship at Netscape five years earlier, the uniform competence of people at Google was very refreshing.</p>

<p>For my first nine years at Google I worked on <a href="https://whatwg.org/">HTML and related standards</a>. My mandate was to do the best thing for the web, as whatever was good for the web would be good for Google (I was explicitly told to ignore Google's interests). This was a continuation of the work I started while at Opera Software. Google was an excellent host for this effort. My team was nominally the open source team at Google, but I was entirely autonomous (for which I owe thanks to Chris DiBona). Most of my work was done on a laptop from random buildings on Google's campus; entire years went by where I didn't use my assigned desk.</p>

<p>In time, exceptions to Google's cultural strengths developed. For example, as much as I enjoyed Vic Gundotra's enthusiasm (and his initial vision for Google+, which again was quite well defined and, if not necessarily uniformly appreciated, at least unambiguous), I felt less confident in his ability to give clear answers when things were not going as well as hoped. He also started introducing silos to Google (e.g. locking down certain buildings to just the Google+ team), a distinct departure from the complete internal transparency of early Google. Another example is the Android team (originally an acquisition), who never really fully acclimated to Google's culture. Android's work/life balance was unhealthy, the team was not as transparent as older parts of Google, and the team focused on chasing the competition more than solving real problems for users.</p>

<p>My last nine years were spent on Flutter. Some of my fondest memories of my time at Google are of the early days of this effort. Flutter was one of the last projects to come out of the old Google, part of a stable of ambitious experiments started by Larry Page shortly before the creation of Alphabet. We essentially operated like a startup, <em>discovering</em> what we were building more than designing it. The Flutter team was very much built out of the culture of young Google; for example we prioritised internal transparency, work/life balance, and data-driven decision making (greatly helped by Tao Dong and his UXR team). We were radically open from the beginning, which made it easy for us to build a healthy open source project around the effort as well. Flutter was also very lucky to have excellent leadership throughout the years, such as Adam Barth as founding tech lead, Tim Sneath as PM, and Todd Volkert as engineering manager.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://ln.hixie.ch/media/photos/california/2015/flutter_design_document-2015-05-06-small.jpeg" alt="[Photograph]">
We also didn't follow engineering best practices for the first few years. For example we wrote no tests and had precious little documentation. This whiteboard is what passed for a design doc for the core Widget, RenderObject, and dart:ui layers. This allowed us to move fast at first, but we paid for it later.</p>

<p>Flutter grew in a bubble, largely insulated from the changes Google was experiencing at the same time. Google's culture eroded. Decisions went from being made for the benefit of users, to the benefit of Google, to the benefit of whoever was making the decision. Transparency evaporated. Where previously I would eagerly attend every company-wide meeting to learn what was happening, I found myself now able to predict the answers executives would give word for word. Today, I don't know anyone at Google who could explain what Google's vision is. Morale is at an all-time low. If you talk to therapists in the bay area, they will tell you all their Google clients are unhappy with Google.</p>

<p>Then Google had layoffs. The layoffs were an unforced error driven by a short-sighted drive to ensure the stock price would keep growing quarter-to-quarter, instead of following Google's erstwhile strategy of prioritising long-term success even if that led to short-term losses (the very essence of "don't be evil"). The effects of layoffs are insidious. Whereas before people might focus on the user, or at least their company, trusting that doing the right thing will eventually be rewarded even if it's not strictly part of their assigned duties, after a layoff people can no longer trust that their company has their back, and they dramatically dial back any risk-taking. Responsibilities are guarded jealously. Knowledge is hoarded, because making oneself irreplaceable is the only lever one has to protect oneself from future layoffs. I see all of this at Google now. The lack of trust in management is reflected by management no longer showing trust in the employees either, in the form of inane corporate policies. In 2004, Google's founders <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/">famously told Wall Street</a> "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." but that Google is no more.</p>

<p>Much of these problems with Google today stem from a lack of visionary leadership from Sundar Pichai, and his clear lack of interest in maintaining the cultural norms of early Google. A symptom of this is the spreading contingent of inept middle management. Take Jeanine Banks, for example, who manages the department that somewhat arbitrarily contains (among other things) Flutter, Dart, Go, and Firebase. Her department nominally has a strategy, but I couldn't leak it if I wanted to; I literally could never figure out what any part of it meant, even after years of hearing her describe it. Her understanding of what her teams are doing is minimal at best; she frequently makes requests that are completely incoherent and inapplicable. She treats engineers as commodities in a way that is dehumanising, reassigning people against their will in ways that have no relationship to their skill set. She is completely unable to receive constructive feedback (as in, she literally doesn't even acknowledge it). I hear other teams (who have leaders more politically savvy than I) have learned how to "handle" her to keep her off their backs, feeding her just the right information at the right time. Having seen Google at its best, I find this new reality depressing.</p>

<p>There are still great people at Google. I've had the privilege to work with amazing people on the Flutter team such as JaYoung Lee, Kate Lovett, Kevin Chisholm, Zoey Fan, Dan Field, and dozens more (sorry folks, I know I should just name all of you but there's too many!). In recent years I started offering career advice to anyone at Google and through that met many great folks from around the company. It's definitely not too late to heal Google. It would require some shake-up at the top of the company, moving the centre of power from the CFO's office back to someone with a clear long-term vision for how to use Google's extensive resources to deliver value to users. I still believe there's lots of mileage to be had from Google's mission statement (<q lang="en-US">to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful</q>). Someone who wanted to lead Google into the next twenty years, maximising the good to humanity and disregarding the short-term fluctuations in stock price, could channel the skills and passion of Google into truly great achievements.</p>

<p>I do think the clock is ticking, though. The deterioration of Google's culture will eventually become irreversible, because the kinds of people whom you need to act as moral compass are the same kinds of people who don't join an organisation without a moral compass.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.russbishop.net/contextlocal-t">a new post</a>, I logged in to GitHub recently. I created my account two years ago in anticipation of being able to open-source more code and I wanted to reserve my name; I had a couple of forked repos but that's it. A new baby and a wife with major back surgery will do that to you. </p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I logged in today and found that my account had been renamed. No longer was I known as <code>github.com/rbishop</code>. Instead, I was now relegated to <code>github.com/rbishop-xx</code>. </p>

<p>How <em>curious</em>.</p>

<p>I next noticed a warning about verifying my SSH key. </p>

<p><em>"Why self, I don't remember uploading an SSH key just yet"</em></p>

<p><em>"Well self, that's because you <strong>haven't</strong>"</em></p>

<p>Now I was even more <em>curious</em>. Had my account been hacked? Had I made a mistake somewhere? That's when I checked Account Settings, Security, Security History and behold two months ago:</p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/5e13d149-5362-4336-b603-bdb6887d46f4/githubrename_large.png"></p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/e29665d2-2220-4d46-88c3-3b0cd4be4bcd/rathjenc_key_large.png"></p>

<p>Whoever this <em>rathjenc</em> character was, he had not only renamed my account but <strong>he uploaded an SSH key, thus allowing him to modify my repos at-will.</strong></p>

<p>Just who was this rathjenc fellow?</p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c103f12c-1287-4fe3-ad03-984b35d258e5/rathjenc_large.png"></p>

<p>Now I am merely left with questions. </p>

<p><strong>Why is an official Github representative renaming accounts and modifying people's SSH keys without so much as an email to the account holder?</strong> </p>

<p>There is now a new owner of the <code>rbishop</code> name: Richard B; is he a friend of Chris? Was Chris doing his buddy a favor by kicking me off? </p>

<p>Or perhaps it's because Richard B is a member of their Developer program. Maybe people who pay more or develop Github integrations have priority on names?</p>

<p>Maybe it's just policy that you can take someone else's name if you ask <em>real nice</em> ?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I certainly couldn't find any documentation of this forced-renaming policy on Github's website, and as we all know they're a professional organization. <a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/15/prominent-github-engineer-julie-ann-horvath-quits-claiming-gender-based-harassment/">They certainly don't have founder's non-employee wives running around intimidating employees.</a> </p>

<p>As I said earlier, how <em>curious</em>.</p>

<h2 id="link">1 Clickable link</h2>

<p>These techniques protect a clickable link that will open the user’s mail client (e.g. <a href="mailto:email@example.com">email</a>).
The link text is expected to be generic; if the <i>email address</i> appears in the link text, then the email address is additionally exposed as plain text, and you’ll need to layer on the <a href="#text">plain-text</a> obfuscation techniques.</p>


<h3 id="link-url">1.1 URL encoding</h3>
<p>Blocked 100% of spam</p>

<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"mailto:<wbr><span id="link-url-output">%65<wbr>%6d<wbr>%61<wbr>%69<wbr>%6c<wbr>%40<wbr>%65<wbr>%78<wbr>%61<wbr>%6d<wbr>%70<wbr>%6c<wbr>%65<wbr>%2e<wbr>%63<wbr>%6f<wbr>%6d</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-url-input">email:</label></p>

<p>This is based on a small sample size: just six bots that were observed over a one-year period.
Of those bots, <i>half</i> were able to decode HTML entitites, and URL-decoding is just as easy, so caution is advised.</p>


<h3 id="link-entity">1.2 HTML entities</h3>
<p>Blocked 50% of spam</p>

<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"&amp;#109;<wbr>&amp;#97;<wbr>&amp;#105;<wbr>&amp;#108;<wbr>&amp;#116;<wbr>&amp;#111;<wbr>&amp;#58;<wbr><span id="link-entity-output">&amp;#101;<wbr>&amp;#109;<wbr>&amp;#97;<wbr>&amp;#105;<wbr>&amp;#108;<wbr>&amp;#64;<wbr>&amp;#101;<wbr>&amp;#120;<wbr>&amp;#97;<wbr>&amp;#109;<wbr>&amp;#112;<wbr>&amp;#108;<wbr>&amp;#101;<wbr>&amp;#46;<wbr>&amp;#99;<wbr>&amp;#111;<wbr>&amp;#109;</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-entity-input">email:</label></p>


<h3 id="link-none">1.3 No protection</h3>
<p>Blocked 17% of spam</p>

<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"mailto:<wbr><span id="link-none-output">email<wbr>@example<wbr>.com</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-none-input">email:</label></p>

<p>Surprisingly, the unprotected email address appears to have blocked a spam email.
Either that message wasn’t received, or an extra message was sent to one of the protected email addresses.</p>


<h3 id="link-concatenation">1.4 Concatenation</h3>
<p><i>Still testing</i> <span>JS</span></p>

<code>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;<wbr>document<wbr>.write(<wbr>'&lt;a href="mailto:'<wbr>+<span id="link-concatenation-output">'e'+<wbr>'m'+<wbr>'a'+<wbr>'i'+<wbr>'l'+<wbr>'@'+<wbr>'e'+<wbr>'x'+<wbr>'a'+<wbr>'m'+<wbr>'p'+<wbr>'l'+<wbr>'e'+<wbr>'.'+<wbr>'c'+<wbr>'o'+<wbr>'m'</span>+'"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;'<wbr>);<wbr>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-concatenation-input">email:</label></p>

<p>This is convenient because it has no external dependencies, but it is easily broken, even by bots that don’t interpret JavaScript.</p>


<h3 id="link-rot18">1.5 Rot18</h3>
<p><i>Still testing</i> <span>JS</span></p>

<code>&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span>script</span> <span>src</span>=<wbr><span>"js/<a href="https://spencermortensen.com/articles/email-obfuscation/src/link-rot18.js">email.js</a>"</span> <span>defer</span>&gt;<wbr>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>class</span>=<wbr><span>"email"</span> <span>href</span>=<wbr><span>"znvygb:<wbr><span id="link-rot18-output">rznvy<wbr>@rknzcyr<wbr>.pbz</span>"</span>&gt;<wbr>email<wbr>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</code>
<p><label for="link-rot18-input">email:</label></p>

<p>This has an external dependency and can <i>still</i> be broken by bots that don’t interpret JavaScript.
At the very least, you should change the lengths of the rotation cycles (see the source code).</p>


<h3 id="link-xor">1.6 Xor</h3>
<p><i>Still testing</i> <span>JS</span></p>

<code>&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If you read the initial reviews of Apple’s new M3-based Macs, you’d be forgiven for thinking little had changed in their CPU cores, apart from a rejigging of numbers and an increase in the maximum frequency of their P cores. As my MacBook Pro 16-inch M3 Pro arrived three days early, this article presents a tentative first look at what has changed in their CPU cores, and from that, how you might choose the right chip for your next Apple silicon Mac. Like Apple, I’m going to make comparison between M1 and M3 chips, as in most respects discussed here, M2 CPU cores didn’t change as much from those in the M1, and I’ve had and tested four different M1 models.</p>
<h4>Cluster size</h4>
<p>The most obvious difference between M1/M2 CPU cores and those in M3 chips is in the size of their clusters. In M1 and M2 chips, CPU cores are grouped into clusters of 2 or 4, within which cores share L2 cache and run at the same frequency. In M3 chips (certainly the M3 Pro, and I understand the M3 Max as well) clusters are composed of 4 (M3 basic) or 6 (Pro and Max).</p>
<p>This change has impact on chip selection.</p>
<p>macOS tries to allocate threads running at higher priorities, as set by their Quality of Service (QoS), to P cores whenever possible. This is what we want, as it ensures that the apps we’re running deliver best performance, albeit at higher power consumption. When the P cores are already fairly fully occupied, macOS may instead run high QoS threads on the E cores. While it has compensatory mechanisms for doing this (see below), it may mean that those threads run more slowly than we’d want.</p>
<p>If you already have an Apple silicon Mac and are wondering whether to upgrade to an M3 model, then you can use this as a way of working out which chip you’ll need. Load your current Mac up with the apps you normally use together when working, and watch their use in Activity Monitor’s CPU History window. If its P cores are fully occupied much of the time, and that workload often spills over to the E cores, then you should aim for an M3 with more P cores; if there’s always adequate spare capacity on the Mac’s P cores, then you probably wouldn’t get much added value from an M3 with more P cores.</p>
<p>This changed cluster size in M3 chips is significant, as it could not only have effects on performance, but also on power use. When running at full pelt, all six P cores in an M3 Pro cluster can use as much as 5.5 W, while six in an M1 Pro will use about 5.8 W.</p>
<h4>E cores</h4>
<p>From my preliminary measurements, E cores in an M3 Pro differ little from those in an M1 Pro, except for their frequency management, which is determined by macOS. M1 E cores have a maximum frequency of 2064 MHz, while those in M3 chips reach 2748 MHz. But, when running low QoS threads in the M1 Pro chip, E core frequency is set to 972 MHz, and that in the M3 Pro is 744 MHz, giving a ratio of 1.3 for M1/M3. Integer, floating point, NEON and Accelerate performance at those frequencies matches the difference in frequency, at 1.3-1.4. That means the M3’s E cores run background threads slightly more slowly than the M1 because macOS sets their frequency lower.</p>
<p>That isn’t true, though, when the E cores are being used to run high QoS threads that couldn’t be accommodated on P cores. Those are run at maximum frequency, which favours the M3 Pro by a factor of 1.3.</p>
<p>Replacing an M1 Pro with an M3 Pro thus slows background tasks, but accelerates high QoS tasks that have overflowed onto the E cores.</p>
<h4>P cores</h4>
<p>There are greater differences between the P cores in an M1 Pro and those in an M3 Pro. M1 P cores have a maximum frequency of 3228 MHz, while M3 P cores run up to a maximum of 4056 MHz, a ratio of 1.26 in favour of the M3. A similar ratio is seen for integer and floating point performance, at 1.30 and 1.28 respectively, but vector performance using NEON or Apple’s Accelerate library is faster still on the M3 Pro P core, at ratios of 1.67 and 1.63.</p>
<p>This suggests that improved integer and floating point performance is largely (if not completely) the result of increased core frequency, but that there are likely to be further improvements in vector processing. Perhaps Apple has improved the design of the NEON unit in M3 P cores.</p>
<h4>P v E</h4>
<p>Aside from any improvement in vector processing in M3 P cores, M1 and M3 cores show different patterns of performance under load. These are perhaps clearest in the two charts below. Loads were applied using AsmAttic, which here runs tight loops of floating point arithmetic that remains in-core, accessing only registers and not memory. These charts show the time taken to complete one or more threads, each running 200 million loops of assembly code. Each thread is run as if on a single core at 100% active residency, i.e. it’s one core’s worth of performance, so 6 threads will fully load a 6-core P cluster.</p>

<p>This chart shows the total time to complete running all the threads, by the number of threads (effectively the number of cores), for an M1 Pro in red, and an M3 Pro in black. These threads were all run at maximum QoS (33), so were run preferentially on P cores. Those run on the 8 P cores in an M1 Pro (red) show a near-perfect linear relationship, with each thread fully occupying one core for a period of 1.3 seconds.</p>
<p>The lower black line shows equivalent results for the 6 P and 6 E cores in an M3 Pro. For 1-6 threads, these were all run on its P cores, then on an increasing number of its E cores as well. That is quite linear up to 6 threads, where the time taken is significantly less than that of the M1 Pro. By 6 threads, that difference is over 1 second; in the time the M1 Pro took to run 5 threads, the M3 Pro had almost completed 6.</p>
<p>From 6-8 threads, the two lines run in parallel, indicating that the M3 E cores were delivering similar performance to the P cores in the M1 Pro. You wouldn’t want to run more than 8 threads, though, on the 8P + 2E cores of the M1 Pro, as they would risk displacing background threads on the two E cores. On the M3 Pro, you can go safely up to a total of 10 threads, on 6 P and 4 E cores, without compromising background threads. Indeed, because the E cluster is running at maximum frequency, background tasks might even complete more quickly under that load.</p>

<p>Differences are reversed when running low QoS threads on the E cores, as shown here, again with the 2 E cores of the M1 Pro in red, and the 6 E cores of the M3 Pro in black.</p>
<p>The frequency of the M1 Pro E cores is increased when they’re running a second thread, which accounts for the small change in total time from 1-2 threads. However, with more than 2 threads, further threads are queued, and performance suffers as a result. The 6 E cores of the M3 Pro have three times the capacity for background threads, and although running them more slowly, they cope with up to 6 threads, beyond which those threads are queued, and the time required to complete them rises more rapidly.</p>
<h4>CPU History</h4>
<p>The most accessible window you have on core load and performance is CPU History in Activity Monitor. Although it can cast light on the use of different types of core, and help you decide whether your next Mac needs more cores, it’s also seriously misleading, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>This shows what happened during two tests using my app AsmAttic: in the first, responsible for the large blocks of green in the E cores, I ran a load of 6 threads at low QoS; in the second, reflected in the much narrower blocks for the P cores below, I ran the same load of 6 threads on the P cores. When the E cores were fully loaded, their frequency was 744 MHz, that’s only a little above their idle, but when the P cores were fully loaded, they were running at close to their maximum at just under 4000 MHz. This persistent failure in Activity Monitor to take core frequency into account gives seriously misleading impressions.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>There’s much more to comparing CPU cores than multi-core benchmarks.</li>
<li>If you already have an Apple silicon Mac, observe patterns of use of P and E cores during normal use to determine whether you need a Mac with more cores.</li>
<li>CPU core cluster size has changed in M3 chips, from 2-4 to 4-6, which is likely to have extensive effects on performance and power use.</li>
<li>M3 E cores appear similar to those in the M1, but have a higher maximum frequency, and are run at lower frequency for background tasks.</li>
<li>M3 P cores appear to have improved performance in the vector (NEON) unit, and have a higher maximum frequency.</li>
<li>Increased E core count increases the capacity to accommodate overflow of high QoS threads from P cores.</li>

<li aria-level="1"><span>Fixit is dead! Long live Fixit 2 – the latest version of our open-source auto-fixing linter.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fixit 2 allows developers to efficiently build custom lint rules and perform auto-fixes for their codebases.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fixit 2 is </span><span>available today on </span><a href="https://pypi.org/project/fixit/2.0.0a1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>PyPI</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/07/27/developer-tools/programming-languages-endorsed-for-server-side-use-at-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Python is one of the most popular languages in use at Meta.</span></a><span> Meta’s production engineers (PEs) are specialized software engineers (SWEs) who focus on reliability, efficiency, and scalability. They work on various projects, including debugging production services, rewriting inefficient libraries, orchestrating project deployments at scale, or capacity planning and scheduling. And Python is often one of the first tools that PEs reach for, as it offers rapid development, easy to read syntax, and a massive array of open source libraries.</span></p>
<p><span>Meta’s Python Language Foundation team — a hybrid team of both PEs and traditional SWEs — helps own and maintain the infrastructure and tooling for Python at Meta. The team supports engineers, data scientists, researchers, and anyone else at Meta using Python to get their work done.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the ways we accomplish this is building tools that enable Python developers to write better, and more reliable code more efficiently. This includes tools like</span> <a href="https://ufmt.omnilib.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>automatic formatting</span></a><span> and</span> <a href="https://usort.rtfd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>import sorting</span></a><span> that eliminate tedium, or linters that guide engineers toward maintainable code with fewer bugs.</span></p>
<p><span>This year, we have been building a new linter, </span><a href="https://pypi.org/project/fixit/2.0.0a1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Fixit 2</span></a><span>, designed from the ground up to make developers more efficient and capable, both in open source projects and the diverse landscape of our internal monorepo. At Meta, we are using Fixit 2 with a few early adopters, and plan to roll it out to the rest of our monorepo soon. But any developer can use it to </span><span>perform auto-fixing more efficiently and make faster improvements to their own codebases.</span></p>
<h2><span>Why a new linter? (why not X?)</span></h2>
<p><span>There are a variety of excellent linters in the Python ecosystem, many of which have a large community of third-party plugins providing a diverse array of lint rules. We have used </span><a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Flake8</span></a><span> internally at Meta since 2016, and it has been very successful in helping developers reduce bugs and keep a clean codebase. The popular flake8-bugbear plugin was even created by Łukasz Langa (author of </span><a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Black</span></a><span>, PSF developer-in-residence, and release manager for Python 3.8 and 3.9) while working at Meta (then Facebook), as a home for more opinionated lint rules that we could both use internally and share with the rest of the Python developer community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also have a large number of internal plugins built by various teams, and Flake8 allows them to write and enable custom lint rules directly in the codebase without getting sign-off from a central gatekeeper, and without waiting for a new deployment of Flake8 to roll out.</span></p>
<p><span>But while Flake8 has long been a cornerstone of our linting solution, it also has some rough edges. Writing new lint rules requires building entire plugins (each claiming a portion of the “namespace” for error codes) and encourages developers to build complicated plugins covering multiple classes of errors. When those lint errors are found, Flake8 can only point to a line and column number where it occurred, but has no way of suggesting changes to the developer looking at a list of lint results, leaving them in a state of trial and error to find changes that make the linter happy. Also, Flake8 uses the stdlib </span><span>ast</span><span> module, making it unable to parse future syntax features and forcing developers to wait for tools to upgrade before they can use the shiny new hotness.</span></p>
<p><span>There are alternatives to Flake8 of course, but many of them suffer from one or more drawbacks:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A lack of support for “local” in-repo plugins or custom lint rules.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Limited or no support for hierarchical configuration for different projects within a monorepo.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>No option for auto-fixes when errors are found.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Slow performance on large codebases.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While some of those features aren’t critical, the most important for developer efficiency is offering auto-fixes – automatic suggested changes that would satisfy the lint rule. This takes the guesswork out of using a linter, and allows users to quickly review and accept those changes when possible, eliminating the need to re-run the linter until the code is finally clean. Combining these auto-fixes with in-repo, custom lint rules provides a level of tailored code quality improvements that is hard to beat.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, even Fixit, the auto-fixing linter that we built for Instagram and open sourced, did not support local lint rules or hierarchical configuration – core requirements for our monorepo that is home to thousands of projects, many of which are themselves open source projects with their own distinct needs for linting and CI. We received many requests from developers to support Fixit in our monorepo, but there were enough hurdles that we were only able to support a small set of security lint rules, reducing the direct benefits to our Python codebase.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Meet Fixit 2</span></h2>
<p><span>After discussions with other teams, especially in the rapidly growing AI/ML space, we considered our options and decided upon a partial rewrite of Fixit. We intentionally designed the new version with an open source-first mindset, while incorporating the needs and requirements of our own monorepos and open source projects from day one.</span></p>
<p><span>The framework and linting engine would be rebuilt from the ground up while leaving the core design of lint rules largely untouched. The new system provides a hierarchical configuration based on the TOML format; support for local, in-repo lint rules similar to Flake8; and a much improved CLI and API for integration with other tools and automation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fixit itself builds on top of another Instagram open source project, </span><a href="https://libcst.rtfd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>LibCST</span></a><span>, a concrete syntax tree for Python with a tree and node API following the patterns of the <span>ast</span> </span><span>module in the standard library. The “concrete” part of CST means that LibCST includes every part of the source file in the resulting tree after parsing, including whitespace, comments, and formatting elements that are ignored by the <span>ast</span> </span><span>module. This is what allows Fixit (and other tools we built, like </span><a href="https://usort.rtfd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>µsort</span></a><span>) to safely modify source files, without using regular expressions or the risk of producing broken syntax, and provides the foundation for Fixit to offer auto-fixes suggested by the lint rules themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>Writing a new lint rule can be done with less than a dozen lines of code, and test cases are defined inline. You can even place it right next to the code that it will be linting:</span></p>
<pre><code># teambread/rules/hollywood.py
import fixit
import libcst
class HollywoodName(fixit.LintRule):
    VALID = [...] # no lint errors here
    INVALID = [...] # bad code samples here
    def visit_SimpleString(self, node: libcst.SimpleString):
        if node.value in ('"Paul"', "'Paul'"):
            self.report(node, "It's underbaked!")</code></pre>
<p><span>Suggesting auto-fixes for the user is as easy as including a new CST node when reporting an error:</span></p>
<pre><code>def visit_SimpleString(self, node: libcst.SimpleString):
    if node.value in ('"Paul"', "'Paul'"):
        new_node = libcst.SimpleString('"Mary"')
        self.report(node, new_node)</code></pre>
<p><span>Enabling this new rule within the project’s codebase can be done with a simple config change:</span></p>
<pre><code># teambread/sourdough/fixit.toml
[tool.fixit]
enable = [".rules.hollywood"]
</code></pre>
<p><span>Now we can run our linter against our project:</span></p>
<pre><code># teambread/sourdough/baker.py
name = "Paul"
print(f"hello {name}!")</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ fixit lint --diff sourdough/baker.py
sourdough/baker.py@7:11 HollywoodName: It's underbaked! (has autofix)
--- a/baker.py
+++ b/baker.py
@@ -6,3 +6,3 @@
def main():
-    name = "Paul"
+    name = "Mary"
    print(f"hello {name}")
🛠️  1 file checked, 1 file with errors, 1 auto-fix available 🛠️
[1]</code></pre>
<p><span>The `lint` command only shows errors and suggested changes. If we use the `fix` command, we can apply those suggested changes back to the codebase:</span></p>
<pre><code>$ fixit fix --automatic sourdough/baker.py
sourdough/baker.py@7:11 HollywoodName: It's underbaked! (has autofix)
🛠️  1 file checked, 1 file with errors, 1 auto-fix available, 1 fix applied 🛠️
</code></pre>
<p><span>Now that our auto-fixes have been applied, we can confirm that the project is now clean and lint-free:</span></p>
<pre><code>$ fixit lint sourdough/baker.py
🧼 1 file clean 🧼</code></pre>
<p><span>When running Fixit 2 with auto-fixing lint rules, any code that triggers the lint rule is an opportunity to get an automatic replacement, improving the codebase with less effort from the developer. Applied more broadly, Fixit 2 can even be used as a tool to enact sweeping codemods against a large codebase, while leaving a lint rule in place to handle any matching code in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span>Try Fixit 2&nbsp;</span></h2>

Routes are declared using Rocket's <em>route</em> attributes. The attribute describes the requests that match the route. The attribute is placed on top of a function that is the request handler for that route.</p><p>As an example, consider the simple route below:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>#[get(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>index</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>'</span><span>static</span> <span>str</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This <code>index</code> route matches any incoming HTTP <code>GET</code> request to <code>/</code>, the index. The handler returns a <code>String</code>. Rocket automatically converts the string into a well-formed HTTP response that includes the appropriate <code>Content-Type</code> and body encoding metadata.</p></div><div id="dynamic-params-panel"><p>Rocket automatically parses dynamic data in path segments into any desired type. To illustrate, let's use the following route:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>#[get(</span><span>"/hello/&lt;name&gt;/&lt;age&gt;"</span><span>)]</span>

</pre></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This <code>hello</code> route has two dynamic parameters, identified with angle brackets, declared in the route URI: <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;age&gt;</code>. Rocket maps each parameter to an identically named function argument: <code>name: &amp;str</code> and <code>age: u8</code>. The dynamic data in the incoming request is parsed automatically into a value of the argument's type. The route is called only when parsing succeeds.</p><p>Parsing is directed by the <a href="https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/request/trait.FromParam.html"><code>FromParam</code></a> trait. Rocket implements <code>FromParam</code> for many standard types, including both <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>u8</code>.

Here, <code>login</code> maps to <code>login: Form&lt;UserLogin&gt;</code>.

It automatically parses the request body into the internal type, here <code>UserLogin</code>.

Request guards aren't declared in the route attribute, and any number of them can appear in the request handler signature.</p><p>Request guards <em>protect</em> the handler from running unless some set of conditions are met by the incoming request metadata. For instance, if you are writing an API that requires sensitive calls to be accompanied by an API key in the request header, Rocket can protect those calls via a custom <code>ApiKey</code> request guard:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>#[get(</span><span>"/sensitive"</span><span>)]</span>

<div>

<p>With currently reviewing the HP Z6 G5 A workstation powered by the new 96-core <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-linux-threadripper-pro-7995wx">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX</a> Zen 4 processor, one of the areas I was curious about was how well HP's tuned Microsoft Windows 11 compares to that of Linux. In this article is looking at how the Microsoft Windows 11 performance is out-of-the-box with the HP Z6 G5 A workstation as configured by HP versus a clean install of Ubuntu 23.10 with the Linux 6.5 kernel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_1_med" alt="Windows 11 on Threadripper PRO 7995WX"></a></p>
<p>Going back to the original AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors, Linux has long possessed a performance lead over Microsoft Windows. With Linux typically being the dominant OS of HPC systems and other large core count servers, the Linux kernel scheduler has coped better than various flavors of Windows when dealing with high core count processors. Paired with some early Windows issues that Microsoft and AMD has since worked through. Linux has gained a reputation of handling these HEDT systems better than Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_3_med" alt="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX processor"></a></p>
<p>In being curious about the difference for these new Zen 4 Threadrippers and now being able to push things to the extreme with the Threadripper PRO 7995WX 96-core / 192-thread processor, I set out for some fresh benchmarks. The HP Z6 G5 A review unit was preloaded with Microsoft Windows 11 Pro as configured by HP and so it makes for a nice perspective of looking at the Windows performance as validated by the hardware vendor. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=threadripper-7995wx-windows-linux&amp;image=threadripper_windows_2_med" alt="Windows 11 on Threadripper PRO 7995WX"></a></p>
<p>After running through all of the Windows benchmarks of tests relevant to HEDT/workstations and that work similarly on Windows and Linux, I then set out to do the Linux benchmarks. Ubuntu 23.10 was run for providing a clean, out-of-the-box look at this common desktop/workstation Linux distribution. Benchmarks of other Linux distributions will come in time in follow-up Phoronix articles. But for the most part the Ubuntu 23.10 performance should be largely similar to that of other modern Linux distributions with the exception of Intel's Clear Linux that takes things to the extreme or those doing non-default tinkering to their Linux installations.</p>
<p><img type="image/svg+xml" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://phoronix.com/benchmark/result/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-7995wx---windows-11-vs-ubuntu-linux/result.svgz" alt="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX - Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux"></p>
<p>The HP Z6 G5 A for all testing was configured with the Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX at default frequencies, 8 x 16GB DDR5-5200 Hynix RDIMMs, Samsung MZVL21T0HCLR-00BH1 NVMe SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX A4000 16GB graphics. A full review on the HP Z6 G5 A Threadripper workstation will be published in a separate article on Phoronix in early December.</p>
<p>From there the up-to-date Windows 11 Pro Build 22631 (H2'23) was tested against Ubuntu 23.10 with its stable release updates. Let's see how Windows and Ubuntu Linux perform on this 96-core / 192-thread Zen 4 workstation with 128GB of RAM.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models only really need to use an exponential fraction of their neurons for individual inferences. As proof, we present UltraFastBERT, a BERT variant that uses 0.3% of its neurons during inference while performing on par with similar BERT models. UltraFastBERT selectively engages just 12 out of 4095 neurons for each layer inference. This is achieved by replacing feedforward networks with fast feedforward networks (FFFs). While no truly efficient implementation currently exists to unlock the full acceleration potential of conditional neural execution, we provide high-level CPU code achieving 78x speedup over the optimized baseline feedforward implementation, and a PyTorch implementation delivering 40x speedup over the equivalent batched feedforward inference. We publish our training code, benchmarking setup, and model weights.
