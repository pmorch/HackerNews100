<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity was once heralded as the savior of the video game industry. It was relatively easy to use, and provided an engine/framework for multiple games rather than just one. Even as late as the early 2000s, some game companies, especially in Japan, weren't even sharing similar engines within their own teams! Before the popularity of commercial game engines, each game was built bespoke, which had some advantages, but took a lot of time, and made each port a chore. One of the greatest things Unity provided was a relatively easy pipeline to console releases, making ports more about platform quirks than full recoding.</p>
<p>I remember countless interviews I did as a journalist in 2005 where the interviewee said "now that there's engines like Unity, things are getting easier." My game company Necrosoft has used Unity for every commercial project it has ever made.</p>
<p>But now I can say, unequivocally, if you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. If you started a project 4 months ago, it's worth switching to something else. Unity is quite simply not a company to be trusted.</p>
<p>What has happened? Across the last few years, as John Riccitiello has taken over the company, the engine has made a steady decline into bizarre business models surrounding an engine with unmaintained features and erratic stability.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>This did not age well.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll talk about eroding features first. Unity has internal champions for its features. Once those champions leave the company, that feature languishes and falls apart. Unity buys competing products, and then if the owner of that product leaves the company, it is no longer supported. Unity has a "stable" version of its product called the "LTS" version. More experimental features are pushed to a beta which developers can use if they're curious. Currently we are on an LTS version that requires us to open a blank page before doing anything else, otherwise the engine simply crashes. This is because of an error Unity introduced recently which they have not fixed. It adds a couple minutes every time we open the project, and is anything but stable.</p>
<p>The latest and final straw is <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates?ref=insertcredit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this announcement</a>, which you may have seen some developer friends talking about.</p>
<p>I'll break down some of the most important factors in this discussion:</p><ul><li>Unity personal, which is free, now cannot be used offline.</li><li>all tiers of unity now require developers to pay a flat fee of a few cents for every game that's installed</li><li>Unity plus (which is going away), and pro, and enterprise levels all cost a subscription, and most professional developers have to use it.</li><li>different tiers of downloads and income determine how much you pay.</li><li>Unity has never made money off subscriptions, it has always made money off its ads platform (which you see in f2p mobile games, etc)</li><li>There's a discount if you use Unity Services.</li><li>This money is meant to help with runtime issues when they can't even get their base stable version to run without crashing.</li></ul>
<p>So the problem becomes this: they are already charging a subscription, and now a per install cost on top of that. What's the point of the subscription if we're also paying another charge on top of that? Why wouldn't it be free at that point?
</p><div><p>Also, it's on developers to sort through these two types of costs, meaning Unity has added a bunch of admin work for us, while making it extremely costly for games like Vampire Survivor to sell their game at the price they do. Vampire Survivor's edge was their price, now doing something like that is completely unfeasible. Imagine releasing a game for 99 cents under the personal plan, where Steam takes 30% off the top for their platform fee, and then unity takes 20 cents per install, and now you're making a maximum of 46 cents on the dollar. As a developer who starts a game under the personal plan, because you're not sure how well it'll do, you're punished, astoundingly so, for being a breakout success. Not to mention that sales will now be more costly for developers since Unity is not asking for a percentage, but a flat fee. If I reduce the price of my game, the price unity asks for doesn't decrease.</p><p>This all comes out of the developer's pocket, but publishers won't want to be on the hook for it either - expect fewer games to be pitched with Unity going forward.</p></div>
<p>And NOW consider bundles. Each install or activation counts as something that must be paid. We did the itch.io bundle for ukraine. That was approximately a million games given out per developer. If all those were installed, developers would owe $200,000 just for having given their game to charity. It makes charity bundles completely unfeasible.</p>
<p>On top of this there is no minimum cooldown period after they change their fee, so they can raise it as they like, whenever they like. Effectively we're all locked into an upward-only, per-install pricing model that can change whenever Unity decides they need extra revenue to make their stock look healthy. No developer would have decided to use Unity if this was the business model from the start.<br>It proves that they're willing to completely change things up with no notice. January is barely 4 months away, and this decision will affect titles that have been in development for years, and haven't factored this into their budgets. If we had the option, we'd change now, but we're too far into development. Unreal Engine, to their credit, only holds you to the EULA you signed up for, not whatever they've decided most recently.</p>
<p>I want to double down on this point - we did not sign up for this. Frankly the Unity Plus tier, which we currently use, which is going away presently, wasn't even around when we signed up. Oh, and did I mention we're automatically being switched to the more expensive Pro from Plus if we don't cancel our subscription? If the agreement changes underneath you as you're making the game, you can't budget for it, and trust is completely lost. We did not plan for this, and it screws us massively on Demonschool, which is tracking to be our most successful game. You might say poor you, but again, <em>we did not sign up for this</em> and have no option to say no, since we're close to release and this change is 4 months out. You can't simply remake an entire game in another engine when you've been working on it for 4+ years.</p>

        <figcaption>It is clear that Riccitiello never considered that people might make games for reasons other than money. At least the attitude is consistent.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is one other critical element here - developers are being offered a reduced price if they use Unity Services. This is basically monopolistic and anti-competitive, and they will likely get sued over it. At the very least it certainly won't encourage any technology companies to make services for Unity. What's the point when Unity will undercut you and still force devs into licensing their own product? Expect far less offerings from third parties in the future.</p>
<div><p>Ultimately, it screws over indies and smaller devs the most. If you can afford to pay for higher tiers, you don't pay as much of this nickle and dime fee, but indies can't afford to on the front end, or often it doesn't make sense in terms of the volume of games you'll sell, but then you wind up paying more in the long term. It'll squash innovation and art-oriented games that aren't designed around profit, especially. It's a rotten deal that only makes sense if you're looking at numbers, and assume everyone will keep using your product. Well, I don't think people will keep using their product unless they're stuck. I know one such developer who is stuck, who's estimating this new scheme will cost them $100,000/month on a free to play game, where their revenue isn't guaranteed.</p><p>Unity is desperately digging its own grave in a search for gold. This is all incredibly short-sighted and adds onto a string of rash decisions and poorly thought through schemes from Unity across the last few years. It's no wonder Riccitiello sold 2,000 shares last week.</p></div>

Consider the following code:</p><pre></pre><p>We're dropping our first paragraph into a containing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but the margins will still collapse!</p><p>It turns out that many of us have <strong>a misconception about how margins work.</strong></p><p>Margin is meant to increase the distance between siblings.

Giving an element a fixed height can prevent certain margins from collapsing:</p><p>The empty space between the two margins stops them from collapsing, like a moat filled with hungry piranhas.</p><p>Note that this is on a <em>per-side basis</em>. In this example, the child's <em>top</em> margin could still collapse. But because there's some empty space below the child, its bottom margin will never collapse.</p><p>The <code>overflow</code> property creates a <em>scroll container</em>, and margins can't collapse across scroll container boundaries.</p><p>Getting into scroll containers would be too large of a detour to tackle this scenario in this blog post, though it's something we cover in depth in my <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSS course</a>!</p><p>Here's the takeaway from these three scenarios: <strong>Margins must be touching in order for them to collapse.</strong></p><div id="margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction"><h2><a name="margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction-8" id="margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction-8" href="#margins-can-collapse-in-the-same-direction-8"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Margins can collapse in the same direction</h2></div><p>So far, all the examples we've seen involve adjacent opposite margins: the bottom of one element overlaps with the top of the next element.</p><p>Surprisingly, margins can collapse even in the same direction.</p><p>Here's what this looks like in code:</p><pre></pre><p>You can think of this as an extension of the previous rule. The child margin is getting “absorbed” into the parent margin. The two are combining, and are subject to the same rules of margin-collapse we've seen so far (eg. the biggest one wins).</p><p>This can lead to big surprises. For example, check out this common frustration:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In this scenario, you might expect the two sections to be touching, with the margin applied inside each container:</p><div><p>Paragraph One</p><p>Paragraph Two</p></div><p>This seems like a reasonable assumption, since the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s have no margin at all! The intention seems to be to increase the space within the top of each box, to give the paragraphs a bit of breathing room.</p><p>The trouble is that <strong>0px margin is still a collapsible margin.</strong> Each section has 0px top margin, and it gets combined with the 32px top margin on the paragraph.

It lets us pull a child outside its parent's bounding box, or reduce the space between siblings until they overlap.</p><p>How do negative margins collapse? Well, it's actually quite similar to positive ones! The negative margins will share a space, and the size of that space is determined by the most significant negative margin. In this example, the elements overlap by 75px, since the more-negative margin (-75px) was more significant than the other (-25px).</p><p>What about when negative and positive margins are mixed? In this case, the numbers are <spicy>added together</spicy>. In this example, the -25px negative margin and the 25px positive margin cancel each other out and have no effect, since -25px + 25px is 0.</p><p>Why would we want to apply margins that have no effect?! Well, sometimes you don't control one of the two margins. Maybe it comes from a legacy style, or it's tightly ensconced in a component. By applying an inverse negative margin to the parent, you can "cancel out" a margin.</p><p>Of course, this is not ideal. Better to remove unwanted margins than to add even more margins! But this hacky fix can be a lifesaver in certain situations.</p><div id="multiple-positive-and-negative-margins"><h2><a name="multiple-positive-and-negative-margins-11" id="multiple-positive-and-negative-margins-11" href="#multiple-positive-and-negative-margins-11"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Multiple positive and negative margins</h2></div><p>We've gotten pretty deep into the weeds here, and we have one more thing to look at. It's the "final boss" of this topic, the culmination of all the rules we've seen so far.</p><p>What if we have multiple margins competing for the same space, and some are negative?</p><p>If there are more than 2 margins involved, the algorithm looks like this:</p><ul><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Find the largest positive margin</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Find the largest<span></span> negative margin</p></li><li><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line><polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline></svg></span><p>Add those two numbers together</p></li></ul><p>Here's an example in code. Poke around in the devtools to see how it all works out:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In this example, our most significant positive margin is 30px. Our most significant negative margin is -20px. Therefore, we wind up with 10px of realized margin, since we add the positive and negative values together.</p><p>(No 3D illustration for this one — honestly, it was too busy and chaotic-looking to offer much clarity 😅)</p><div id="flow-layout-only"><h2><a name="flow-layout-only-12" id="flow-layout-only-12" href="#flow-layout-only-12"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Flow layout only</h2></div><p>So far, all the examples we've seen have assumed that we're "in-flow"; we're not repositioning things with Grid or Flexbox.</p><p>When items are aligned with either Grid or Flexbox, or taken out-of-flow (eg. floats, absolute positioning), margins will never collapse. This can be surprising when combined with certain techniques, like my <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/">Full Bleed layout</a>. In these cases, you're better off using <code>gap</code> instead of margin.</p><p>In fact, there's a <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growing movement</a> of developers opting for layout components instead of margin. I think layout components are awesome, but I also recognize that margin is <em>universal</em>.

Both models feature the Dynamic Island, and an advanced camera system designed to help users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives. A powerful 48MP Main camera enables super-high-resolution photos and a new 2x Telephoto option to give users a total of three optical zoom levels — like having a third camera. The iPhone 15 lineup also introduces the next generation of portraits, making it easier to capture portraits with great detail and low-light performance. Building on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure, Roadside Assistance via satellite can connect users to AAA if they have car trouble while off the grid. With A16 Bionic for powerful, proven performance; a USB‑C connector; Precision Finding for Find My friends; and industry-leading durability features, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus represent a huge leap forward.

                 <div>The advanced camera system on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus helps users capture everyday moments and cherished memories. A 48MP Main camera shoots sharp photos and videos while capturing fine details, with a quad-pixel sensor and 100 percent Focus Pixels for fast autofocus. Using the power of computational photography, the Main camera gives users a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. By intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option gives users three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system.

        <div>Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Shooting at night gets better with improvements to Night mode, including sharper details and more vivid colors. When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. These improvements benefit the 48MP Main camera, Ultra Wide camera, and TrueDepth front camera.

                 <div>The fast and efficient A16 Bionic chip brings proven performance to iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, powering the Dynamic Island, computational photography capabilities, and more. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and easily handles intensive tasks while delivering extraordinary battery life. The 5-core GPU has 50 percent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games. A new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features like Live Voicemail transcriptions in iOS 17 and third-party app experiences — all while protecting critical privacy and security features using the Secure Enclave.&nbsp;

                 <div>The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection<sup>3</sup> and Emergency SOS via satellite.<sup>4</sup> Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking safety service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.<sup>5</sup> An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.<sup>6</sup>

                 <div>iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus now use even more recycled content, with 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery and 100 percent recycled copper in the main logic board, copper wire in the Taptic Engine, and copper foil in the inductive charger in MagSafe — all firsts for iPhone. Both models also include 75 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The iPhone 15 lineup meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span></strong>&nbsp;Apple today debuted iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, designed with aerospace-grade titanium that’s strong yet lightweight to deliver Apple’s lightest Pro models ever. The new design also features contoured edges and a customizable Action button, allowing users to personalize their iPhone experience. Powerful camera upgrades enable the equivalent of seven pro lenses with incredible image quality, including a more advanced 48MP Main camera system that now supports the new super-high-resolution 24MP default, the next generation of portraits with Focus and Depth Control, improvements to Night mode and Smart HDR, and an all-new 5x Telephoto camera exclusively on iPhone 15 Pro Max. A17 Pro unlocks next-level gaming experiences and pro performance. The new USB‑C connector is supercharged with USB 3 speeds — up to 20x faster than USB 2 — and together with new video formats, enables powerful pro workflows that were not possible before.<sup>1</sup> And with the addition of Roadside Assistance via satellite, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/" target="_blank">iPhone 15 Pro lineup</a>&nbsp;builds on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure to connect users to help if they have car trouble while off the grid.

                 <div>“This is the most pro lineup we have ever created, with a state-of-the-art titanium design, the best iPhone camera system yet that enables game-changing new workflows, and the A17 Pro chip, which ushers in a new chapter of performance and games never before seen on iPhone,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max represent the best of Apple design and industry-first innovations to help enrich the everyday experiences of our users, while enabling them to unleash their creativity.”

                 <div>Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes,<sup>2</sup> iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a strong and lightweight titanium design — a first for iPhone. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.

                 <div>Bringing pro performance and capabilities, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are powered by A17 Pro, the industry’s first 3-nanometer chip. Continuing Apple’s leadership in smartphone silicon, A17 Pro brings improvements to the entire chip, including the biggest GPU redesign in Apple’s history. The new CPU is up to 10 percent faster with microarchitectural and design improvements, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — iPhone 15 Pro offers smoother graphics, as well as more immersive AR applications and gaming experiences. iPhone 15 Pro brings true-to-life gaming to the palm of users’ hands with console titles never before seen on a smartphone, like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassin’s Creed Mirage.<sup>4</sup>

With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the Main camera also supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. Great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple’s most advanced stabilization system yet.

</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>Night mode gets better with sharper details and more vivid colors, now powered by the Photonic Engine, including Night mode portraits, enabled by the LiDAR scanner.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>New Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>The best quality video in a smartphone is upgraded thanks to A17 Pro, with improvements in low-light video and Action mode.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers gets even better with new pro workflows. Users can now get up to 20x faster transfer speeds with an optional USB 3 cable. iPhone and third-party solutions like Capture One also help photographers create a pro studio, allowing them to shoot and instantly transfer 48MP ProRAW images from iPhone to Mac. ProRes video can be recorded directly to external storage, enabling higher recording options up to 4K at 60 fps, and greater flexibility on set when using iPhone as the main camera.&nbsp;iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Color Encoding System, a global standard for color workflows.

                 <div>Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.<sup>9</sup> An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.<sup>10</sup>

                 <div><ul>
<li>The <strong>Phone app</strong> gets major updates, with <strong>Contact Posters</strong> that allow users to customize how they appear to their contacts, and <strong>Live Voicemail</strong>, which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message.</li>
</ul>

                 <div><ul>

                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>StandBy</strong> gives users a customizable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging.

                 <div>iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/">short clip on X</a> shows a single blue flash on the top left corner of the shot, followed by a second burst of light seconds later.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon has been observed before the earthquake in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/">Turkey</a> earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/turkey-earthquake/">claimed the lives of 45,000 people.</a></p>
<p>The first recorded instance of earthquake lights on camera dates back to 1965 during a Japanese earthquake, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-758370">The Jerusalem Post</a> reports.</p>
<p>The mysterious lights have also been observed in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a> in 2008, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy/">Italy </a>in 2009, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/mexico/">Mexico</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>The cause of earthquake lights, or EQLs, remains shrouded in mystery, leaving unanswered questions about whether it serves as some sort of ominous sign of impending disasters.</p>
<p>Scientists suggest that this may be the release of energy as a result of the movement of lithospheric plates, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment/2019/04/earthquake-lights-explained">National Geographic</a> reports.</p>
<p>Analysing 65 earthquake light incidents for patterns in a 2014 study, adjunct physics professor and and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nasa/">NASA</a> researcher Friedemann Freund described the phenomenon "as if you switched on a battery in the Earth's crust".</p>
<p>On Saturday, Morocco woke up to devastating damage following a major 7.2-magnitude earthquake - making it one of the deadliest disasters the country has seen for over 120 years.</p>

<p>More than 2,900 people are dead and 2,059 are injured after the monster tremor struck just after 11pm local time on Friday.</p>
<p>People were sent fleeing in terror from buildings, and those who could not escape were killed as houses collapsed in the quake in Morocco.</p>
<p>The shaking lasted several seconds and a 4.9-magnitude aftershock was recorded 19 minutes later.</p>
<p>The city of Marrakesh was shaken - but the villages in the country's remote High Atlas mountains bore the brute of the devastation.</p>
<p>Morroco is also popular with tourists, with the country welcoming some 700,000 Brits every year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23892372/morocco-earthquake-relief-efforts-brits/">Dozens of Brits broke off from holidays and business trips to queue for hours to give blood</a>, with others planning supply runs into areas worst hit by the shocks.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>There has been a lot of interest on HN in fine-tuning open-source LLMs recently (eg. Anyscale's post at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37090632">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37090632</a>). I've been playing around with fine-tuning models for a couple of years, and wanted to share some insights and practical code. I’ve condensed what I’ve learned into a small set of notebooks at <a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/classify-recipes">https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/clas...</a>, covering labeling data, fine-tuning, running efficient inference, and evaluating costs/performance. The 7B model we train here matches GPT-4’s labels 95% of the time on the test set, and for the 5% of cases where they disagree it’s often because the correct answer is genuinely ambiguous.</p><p>What is fine-tuning? You can think of it as a more-powerful form of prompting, where instead of writing your instructions in text you actually encode them in the weights of the model itself. You do this by training an existing model on example input/output pairs that demonstrate the task you want your fine-tuned model to learn. Fine-tuning can work with as few as 50 examples but I usually try to get 1000+ if possible.</p><p>Prompting still has some big advantages over fine-tuning. It's way easier/faster to iterate on your instructions than label data and re-train a model. And operationally it's easier to deploy one big model and just adjust its behavior as necessary vs deploying many small fine-tuned models that will likely each get lower utilization.</p><p>Fine-tuning has one huge advantage though: it is far more effective at guiding a model's behavior than prompting, so you can often get away with a <i>much</i> smaller model. That gets you faster responses and lower inference costs. A fine-tuned Llama 7B model is 50x cheaper than GPT-3.5 on a per-token basis, and for many use cases can produce results that are as good or better!</p><p>For example, classifying the 2M recipes at <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/corbt/all-recipes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://huggingface.co/datasets/corbt/all-recipes</a> with GPT-4 would cost $23k. Even with GPT-3.5 it would cost over $1k. The model we fine-tuned performs similarly to GPT-4 and costs just $19 to run over the entire dataset.</p><p>Disclaimer: My brother David and I are working on an open-source product called OpenPipe (<a href="https://github.com/openpipe/openpipe">https://github.com/openpipe/openpipe</a>) to help engineers adopt fine-tuning as simply as possible. But none of the information above depends on our startup. The current post is just about sharing information that we’ve learned about fine-tuning. I hope it’s useful!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

            Students from ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts have broken the previous world record for acceleration with their hand-built electric racing car, mythen. The vehicle accelerated from zero to 100 km/h in 0.956 seconds over a distance of 12.3 metres.

            <p>The members of the Academic Motorsports Club Zurich (AMZ) are absolutely thrilled. For the better part of a year, these students from ETH Zurich and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts have spent every spare minute working on their electric vehicle, which they named <i>mythen</i>, overcoming setbacks and going back to the drawing board time and time again for certain components. Now, Guinness World Records has confirmed that <i>mythen</i> broke the previous world acceleration record for electric vehicles. On the <span>Switzerland Innovation Park</span> in Duebendorf, Switzerland, directly opposite the students’ workshop, their racing car accelerated from zero to 100 km/h (zero to 62.15 mph) in just 0.956 seconds, accomplishing this feat over a distance of merely 12.3 metres. At the wheel was Kate Maggetti. This beats the previous world record of 1.461 seconds, set in September 2022 by a team from the University of Stuttgart by more than a third.</p>

                <p>“Working on the project in addition to my studies was very intense. But even so, it was a lot of fun working with other students to continually produce new solutions and put into practice what we learned in class. And, of course, it is an absolutely unique experience to be involved in a world record,” says Yann Bernard, head of motor at AMZ.</p> 
<h2><b>Lighter, stronger, more traction</b></h2> 
<p>All of <i>mythen’s</i> components, from the printed circuit boards (PCBs) to the chassis and the battery, were developed by the students themselves and optimised for their function. Thanks to the use of lightweight carbon and aluminium honeycomb, the race car weighs in at only around 140 kilos (309 pounds). Four-wheel hub motors that the students developed themselves and a special powertrain give the vehicle its impressive power of 240 kilowatts, or around 326 hp. <br> </p>

                <p>“But power isn’t the only thing that matters when it comes to setting an acceleration record – effectively transferring that power to the ground is also key,” says Dario Messerli, head of aerodynamics at AMZ. Conventional Formula One cars solve this through aerodynamics: a rear or front wing pushes the car to the ground. However, this effect only comes into play when the car has reached a certain speed. To ensure strong traction right from the start, the AMZ team has developed a kind of vacuum cleaner that holds the vehicle down to the ground by suction. </p> 
<h2><b>Hotly contested world record</b></h2> 
<p>The AMZ team had set the world acceleration record for electric cars twice before – in 2014 and again in 2016. In the following years, their record was broken by a team from the University of Stuttgart. Now the world record is back in Swiss hands, and the ETH Zurich students are confident they will not relinquish it again any time soon. </p>

                <p><span>AMZ was founded by ETH Zurich students in 2006. Since then, its 30, or so, members have developed a new race car each year, which they have entered into various international design competitions – known as Formula Student in Europe. After initially developing three vehicles powered by an internal-combustion engine, since 2010 AMZ has been building purely electrically powered race cars. The club offers students the opportunity to put their acquired theoretical knowledge into practice in an extraordinarily complex, technical environment.

<p>We launched the <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/" rel="nofollow">Datasette Cloud blog</a> today. The Datasette Cloud site itself is a Django app - it uses Django and PostgreSQL to manage accounts, teams and soon billing and payments, then launches dedicated containers running Datasette for each customer.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've built a new blog implementation in Django! I decided to make notes for the next time.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Here are the features I consider to be essential for a blog in 2023 (though they haven't changed much in over a decade):</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog posts have a title, summary, body and publication date. Optional: author information, tags</li>
<li>Posts can be live or draft</li>
<li>The blog index page shows the most recent entries</li>
<li>Older entries are available via some kind of archive mechanism</li>
<li>The blog has an Atom feed</li>
<li>Entries have social media card metadata, to enhance links to them on Mastodon and Twitter</li>
<li>Markdown is a nice-to-have for editing the posts</li>
</ul>
<h2>The models</h2>
<p>Here's the Django model for the blog (I generated the first version of this with ChatGPT, then iterated on it):</p>
<div><pre><span>from</span> <span>django</span>.<span>db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<p>It's pretty self-explanatory. The most interesting features are the <code>is_draft</code> flag and the way it provides <code>.summary_rendered</code> and <code>.body_rendered</code> properties that return Markdown rendered as HTML.</p>
<p>The URL format for this blog is <code>/blog/2023/welcome/</code> - in my experience name-spacing posts by year makes the most sense, since even the most active blogs usually only have a few posts every month.</p>
<h2>The views</h2>
<p>Here are the view functions defined the <code>views.py</code> module for my <code>blog/</code> application:</p>
<div><pre><span>from</span> <span>django</span>.<span>contrib</span>.<span>syndication</span>.<span>views</span> <span>import</span> <span>Feed</span>

<h2>The Atom feed</h2>
<p>The most interesting part of the <code>views.py</code> file is this bit - defining the Atom feed:</p>
<div><pre><span>class</span> <span>BlogFeed</span>(<span>Feed</span>):
    <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Datasette Cloud"</span>
    <span>link</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/blog/"</span>
    <span>feed_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>Atom1Feed</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>items</span>(<span>self</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>Entry</span>.<span>objects</span>.<span>filter</span>(<span>is_draft</span><span>=</span><span>False</span>).<span>order_by</span>(<span>"-created"</span>)[:<span>5</span>]

    <span>def</span> <span>item_title</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>item</span>.<span>title</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>item_description</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>item</span>.<span>summary_rendered</span> <span>+</span> <span>"<span>\n</span>"</span> <span>+</span> <span>item</span>.<span>body_rendered</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>item_link</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> <span>"/blog/%d/%s/"</span> <span>%</span> (<span>item</span>.<span>created</span>.<span>year</span>, <span>item</span>.<span>slug</span>)

    <span>def</span> <span>item_author_name</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>item</span>):
        <span>return</span> (
            <span>", "</span>.<span>join</span>([<span>a</span>.<span>get_full_name</span>() <span>or</span> <span>str</span>(<span>a</span>) <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>item</span>.<span>authors</span>.<span>all</span>()]) <span>or</span> <span>None</span>
        )

    <span>def</span> <span>get_feed</span>(<span>self</span>, <span>obj</span>, <span>request</span>):
        <span>feedgen</span> <span>=</span> <span>super</span>().<span>get_feed</span>(<span>obj</span>, <span>request</span>)
        <span>feedgen</span>.<span>content_type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"application/xml; charset=utf-8"</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>feedgen</span></pre></div>
<p>This is using the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/syndication/" rel="nofollow">Django syndication feed framework</a>. The resulting Atom feed can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/feed/" rel="nofollow">https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/feed/</a></p>
<p>There's one extra trick here: I'm over-riding the default <code>content-type</code> header and setting it to <code>"application/xml; charset=utf-8</code>.</p>
<p>Django defaults to using <code>application/atom+xml; charset=utf-8</code> which is correct... but causes most browsers to trigger a download rather than rendering the XML in the browser directly.</p>
<p>I like to be able to click on a feed link and see the XML before I paste the URL into my feed reader software, so I prefer to use <code>application/xml</code> instead.</p>
<h2>Social media cards</h2>
<p>It's easy to forget these, but they're really important - with the right markup links to posts shared on Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook will look MUCH better.</p>
<p>Here's a snipet from my <code>entry.html</code> template:</p>
<div><pre><span>{%</span> <span>block</span> <span>extra_head</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>{%</span> <span>if</span> <span>entry</span>.<span>card_image</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:card<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>summary_large_image<span>"</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:image<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>{{ entry.card_image }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>else</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:card<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>summary<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>endif</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>twitter:creator<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>@datasetteproj<span>"</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:url<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>https://www.datasette.cloud{{ request.path }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;

<span>{%</span> <span>if</span> <span>entry</span>.<span>card_image</span> <span>%}</span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:image<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>{{ entry.card_image }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;<span>{%</span> <span>endif</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:type<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>article<span>"</span></span>&gt;
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>property</span>=<span><span>"</span>og:description<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>{{ entry.summary_text }}<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>if</span> <span>entry</span>.<span>is_draft</span> <span>%}</span>
&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span><span>"</span>robots<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span>=<span><span>"</span>noindex<span>"</span></span>&gt;
<span>{%</span> <span>endif</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>{%</span> <span>endblock</span> <span>%}</span></pre></div>
<p>There's one other detail in there: if an entry is a draft entry I serve <code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex"&gt;</code> to prevent it from being accidentally indexed by search engines.</p>
<h2>URL configuration</h2>
<p>Here's the URL configuration from <code>urls.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre>    <span># Blog</span>
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>index</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/&lt;int:year&gt;/&lt;slug:slug&gt;/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>entry</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/archive/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>archive</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/&lt;int:year&gt;/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>year</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/tag/&lt;slug:slug&gt;/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>tag</span>),
    <span>path</span>(<span>"blog/feed/"</span>, <span>blog_views</span>.<span>BlogFeed</span>()),</pre></div>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>I added a quick suite of tests, mainly to check that <code>is_draft</code> was working correctly but also to ensure the Atom feed works.</p>
<p>Testing the feed was particularly important because it's at the highest risk of accidentally breaking without me noticing it - errors that affect the HTML of the blog are much more obvious.</p>

Tracking which sites users click on for those searches, or maybe which sites users with those searches click on last should give a pretty strong signal that python.org should be ranked far above the spam farms no matter what the content percentage difference is. Content percentage is a clearly gameable metric that shouldn't outweigh other factors.<p>I'm honestly surprised Google employees haven't fixed this somehow, surely they have thousands of people running into this problem daily.

You can then get the OSS community involved on GitHub to slam dunk on all the SEO spammers.</p><p>Just look at MDN or Web.dev, both have their content repos up on GitHub and people contribute metric tons of useful info.

Then into the master doc you can start adding hinting and extra material that gets rendered into the sub-pages. So it could be approached gradually.

                  <p><span>Personally, it's because the docs aren't that good unless you're looking for something very specific. People are talking about the fact that there are no ads, but I would think it's because of the bounce rate. I could see there being a lot of people learning Python who go to the docs, see a large chunk of text with OK examples, and then bouncing to go to the other sites that have more examples. This is something that's happened to me a lot when I was doing Python development. Some of the stuff is very helpful on the docs (e.g. asyncio), but for other things the actual stuff that I want to do gets lost in the details of the docs. So while ads probably play a part, I think the bounce rate is a bigger factor, especially for people who aren't necessarily developers.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I think the problem is partly on Python's end: they've got a single page where they've jammed in all of the built in types (str, dict, list, complex, ...). It's a huge list of types and a correspondingly huge page!<p>I suspect if there were separate pages for each type then it would be ranked higher... and it would actually be more useful. I don't get why they've done it like that.</p><p>The higher ranked pages admittedly have a whole page just for a single method, which is too far in the other extreme and is obviously more for SEO than use. But with the Python docs the way they are, we'll never know whether a more sensible official page would beat them or not.</p><p>As some evidence that it's not just Google allowing spammers to shine through - sometimes for a search about a built-in type I actually do get official docs at the top, but it turns out to be the tutorial page about the class (which is not a giant mish-mash).

Maybe I want a tutorial, or short how-to for a specific task. Maybe I'm looking for something deeper, with context and explanation.</p><p>I somewhat agree with another comment here: the library reference docs should be a keystroke or click away in your development environment. Are there plugins for your preferred editor or IDE to make this possible? Use those.  If you're looking for a different kind of documentation and it's not part on the official python site, maybe that's something to be addressed.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/">https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37481872">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>We are excited to introduce a major improvement in funding the development efforts of the Godot Engine – the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund</a>! The goal for the Development Fund is to create a direct way for everyone to help us secure stable funding and ensure the longevity of the project.</p>

<p>The Development Fund was <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/funding-breakdown-and-hiring-process/">soft-launched in July</a> and already welcomed a lot of new and old sponsors, but we need to take it to the next level to sustain the current development pace, and increase it with new hires.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-platform-fees-amplifying-impact">Reducing platform fees, amplifying impact</h2>

<p>The Development Fund will make the Godot Project more sustainable and independent. This new platform lets us significantly reduce platform fees, and as a non-profit we do not charge VAT on donations, unlike a platform like Patreon does. So your contributions go directly towards the development and improvement of the Godot Engine itself.</p>

<p>If you are currently supporting us <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine">through Patreon</a>, we encourage you to switch to the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund</a> to increase the effectiveness of your donations.</p>



<p>The support of the community is what keeps making it possible to reach <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/">new heights</a>. With you, we can achieve even more!</p>

<p>Every donation, no matter the size, helps us immensely! With your help we can hire more developers, create high quality demos, pay for hosting services and infrastructure, and make the best possible Godot Engine. The more funds we have, the more we can give back to you and the entire gamedev community.</p>

<h2 id="future-enhancements">Future enhancements</h2>

<p>While this is a good, fully functioning starting point for the platform, we will keep improving the Developer Fund.</p>

<p>In the future, the platform will give automated rewards, like a special Discord role, and you’ll be able to showcase your contribution level next to your username on our main platforms.</p>

<h2 id="freedom-and-independence">Freedom and independence</h2>

<p>By relying more on recurring user-funded contributions and company sponsorships, we reduce our dependence on large one-time grants from corporations. This financial independence empowers us to prioritize the needs and interests of our community and the open source principles at the core of our projects. Your help ensures that we can create our own journey, uphold our core values, and continue to evolve the engine in ways that truly benefit you, the users.</p>

<h2 id="a-heartfelt-thanks">A heartfelt thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to take a moment to express our deepest gratitude for your ongoing support, dedication, and passion for Godot. It’s thanks to you and our amazing community that the Godot Engine is what it is today. Let’s continue to make it the game engine of choice for developers worldwide!</p>

<p>We absolutely understand that not everyone can donate. In that case, please share the Godot Dev Fund link! Spreading the word is an excellent way to help.</p>

<p>Join us at the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/">Godot Development Fund</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for making it all possible.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthly-ci/">https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthly-ci/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37481513">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine you live in a world where no part of the build has to repeat unless the changes actually impacted it. A world in which all builds happened with automatic parallelism. A world in which you could reproduce very reliably any part of the build on your laptop. Fairy tales, right? Well, that’s what we built, and to everyone’s surprise, nobody wanted it. It’s like flying cars - they sound amazing, but in practice, things are more difficult than they might seem.</p>
<p>Back in April 2020, we at Earthly set out on this quest to improve CI/CD tooling. We dared to ask questions like “What if the CI could run on your laptop?” And “what would the fastest CI system on the planet look like?” With these questions in mind, we came to a pretty strange, but pretty interesting answer… the build system and the CI need to be the same. And it needs to be distributed.</p>
<p>Now we all know dreaming big is easy. Execution is where things get hard.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-success-look-like">What Does Success Look Like?</h2>

<p>In a startup, you don’t have the luxury of building a mature product with all the possible bells and whistles before shipping it to your customers. Mature products take many years and many engineers to build out.</p>
<p>And yet, you are going up against the incumbents - companies that have hundreds of millions in funding, (maybe even IPO’d), they have hundreds of engineers, they have a 10-year head start, and a ton of reputation. How can you even compete?</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say… “Competition is for losers”. The answer is that you don’t. At least not on the same level. You’ll never be more mature, or have more features, or more integrations. Instead, you can be 10x better in one, very specific way. And you’ll appeal to the few teams where the very specific problem you’re solving is so painful that they’re willing to make compromises on everything else.</p>
<p>You’re not going after the whole market in the beginning. You’re just going after just enough enthusiasts, mavens, early adopters - whatever you want to call them - for whom the solution that you built on a shoestring budget is dramatically better in their specific situation than any incumbent. So much better, that they’re willing to pay the cost of adoption, and they’re willing to suffer through the bugs and the missing bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Then, once you have captured that segment, you invest more, extend to a wider audience, get more feedback, then again invest more, extend again, and so on. It’s important to understand this dynamic in order to gauge what success looks like at the earliest stages.</p>
<p>So if your MVP is not getting enough validation, you can’t just slap more features on it, because, again, features are not what will make you successful. Incumbents win feature contests.</p>
<p>Successful products will show validation at a small scale, despite all their limitations, bugs, and general annoyances. If you can’t find a small group of people passionate enough about your product in its experimental stage, you’re going to have a hard time capturing an audience even with a feature-rich product. It’s a recipe for building something nobody wants.</p>
<p>What early-stage validation looks like is a small group of people who have a lot of passion for what you do. Nobody has heard about your stuff, but your users are passionately shouting from the rooftops about it. You walk into their office and everyone has stickers with your company on their laptops, and everyone wants to talk to you.</p>
<h2 id="the-master-plan-for-earthly-ci">The Master Plan for Earthly CI</h2>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1000-28f43921c.webp 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1200-28f43921c.webp 1200w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1000-28f43921c.png 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-1200-28f43921c.png 1200w" type="image/png"><img height="400px" src="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4610-800-28f43921c.png"></picture></p>
<p>To build out the vision of Earthly CI, we devised a master plan. We knew that we didn’t want to go on a crazy complex implementation for 3 years only to emerge from a cave with a product that would not fit the needs of the real world. So we split up the end-vision into several independent products that we would validate along the way.</p>
<p>Thus, instead of building Earthly CI from day 0, we first built the syntax, and the general experience around running builds on-demand. The key value we delivered was build consistency: there is a level of guarantee that the build will execute the same, regardless of the environment it runs in. The syntax of this build tool is the same as the CI down the road, but it only ran locally initially and in other CIs. We called this <strong>first milestone</strong> Earthly.</p>
<p>Then we built remote runners that can be invoked from anywhere - again your laptop or any CI. These remote runners bring you all the key benefits of Earthly CI but without being a CI. The key value is build speed. And I’m talking 2-20X faster CI pipelines, thanks to the caching and parallelism. We called this <strong>second milestone</strong> Earthly Satellites.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>the third milestone</strong>, Earthly CI - the platform that brings everything together, the CI that is ridiculously fast and can run anywhere. This is the full CI that is meant to compete with all the other big CIs like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins and so on.</p>
<p>What was particularly appealing about this plan was that Earthly, the build system, targets one problem: <strong>build consistency</strong>, while the final version, Earthly CI, targets another problem: <strong>build speed</strong>. This meant that Earthly, which is free, would not cannibalize in any way the monetization of Earthly CI. We wouldn’t be giving away too much for free – as Jenkins did – and instead, it would serve as a sustainable and scalable business model. It made sense to use the build system as a way to then create bottom-up adoption for Earthly CI - and the fact that we were building it first allowed us to build traction that one day will magically just convert over to Earthly CI users.</p>
<p>Little did we know that this difference in value proposition – consistency vs.&nbsp;speed – actually became a problem down the road…</p>
<h3 id="milestone-1-earthly">Milestone 1: Earthly</h3>
<p>Earthly was the lowest-stakes validation. I just built the first version on my own, threw it up on GitHub, and then launched it on Reddit and HackerNews. Zero funding (apart from my wife’s patience), so close to zero risk. If it takes off, I go raise money. If it doesn’t I’ll try something else.</p>
<p>We now know that Earthly is used widely across thousands of repositories, by companies big and small, like VMware, Adobe, Namely, Roche, ExpressVPN, Bluecore, and many others. But the early signs were that people were using Earthly even when it was a one-person unfunded project riddled with bugs and limitations. That’s validation.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-2-earthly-satellites">Milestone 2: Earthly Satellites</h3>
<p>After fixing the obvious issues in Earthly, and widened support to appeal to more types of organizations, we were now building momentum. And with enough capital, we were able to now work on the next milestone: Earthly Satellites.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Satellites was that we were getting the validation even before we built them. Earthly being open-source, you could already run your own Earthly remote runner (since we use Buildkit underneath, it was essentially a remote Buildkit), connect Earthly to it, and get similar benefits to Satellites even before this was a commercial offering. And so people did this on their own, hosting it in their own environment, without us managing it for them. Once we had this packaged up in a managed offering, people were flocking to it, mainly because they did not want to manage remote runners on their own. The initial version of Satellites was buggy, inefficient, and unstable. Yet people came to it despite those inefficiencies, because there was nothing else that would give them CI/CD speed at that level. That’s validation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we didn’t really see it for what it was at the time. We were only thinking of the end vision of taking over the CI world completely, and Satellites was just an implementation milestone that we happened to publish as a product along the way. So we just shrugged and figured, “Ok, if this is how people react to this incomplete offering, imagine how they will react to the full vision of Earthly CI!”</p>
<h3 id="milestone-3-earthly-ci">Milestone 3: Earthly CI</h3>
<p>Almost everyone who was using Satellites was using them in a CI/CD use case. Meaning that they executed remote Satellite builds via CI with the main goal of speeding up their pipelines. In this configuration, the CI vendor is merely a pass-through that deals with triggering pipelines. The actual execution happens on the satellites. To us, that was validation that Earthly CI was needed. Why not just simplify the stack? Why pay both the CI vendor and us, when you can just pay us?</p>
<p>Plus, many Earthly community members were asking about the possibility of hooking up Earthly Satellites directly to GitHub. More validation.</p>
<p>Whenever we spoke to VPs of engineering, the promise of 2-20X faster builds was making their eyes light up!</p>
<p>The closer we were getting to the Earthly CI launch, the more of a slam dunk it seemed it was going to be.</p>
<p>But, as you already know what this blog post is about, making Earthly CI successful turned out to be more challenging than we thought.</p>

<p>For Earthly CI, we did a <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/launching-earthly-ci/">solid launch</a>, landed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/23/earthly-wants-to-reinvent-continuous-integration-to-make-it-faster-and-cheaper/">TechCrunch</a>, and lined up <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/remote-code-execution/">a few blog articles for Reddit and HackerNews</a>.</p>
<p>From the launch we got about 50 emails signing up on the waitlist in the first week or two, outpacing the goals we had. We started setting up calls with these people, and, right off the bat, we could sense a big difference between existing Earthly users vs.&nbsp;people who were coming to us for the first time.</p>
<p>These weren’t the raving fans we were used to talking with. New people would look at Earthly CI with a skeptical eye. They were mostly thinking that “all CIs are the same - they just have different syntax,” and then they would not really look any further as to why we might actually be different. As a result, the conversation invariably turned to the <strong>cost of migration</strong>. How difficult would it be for them to rewrite and adapt a bunch of existing scripts to be able to use Earthly effectively?</p>
<p>Existing users, by contrast, were already fans, had already done the work of the migration, and already saw the benefits of Earthly. They were ready to champion us in their organizations, even if not everyone in their organization was on board yet.</p>
<p>We kept talking to as many teams as we could, to understand the apprehension toward Earthly CI, but it always came back to weighing the cost of migration vs.&nbsp;the benefit. And we could never win this up-front, mainly because these prospects had no idea whether we could deliver on the benefits we promised at scale. We don’t have a long-established reputation like our incumbents. Existing users claimed we were 10x easier to use, but how can you prove that to a new client on a quick Zoom call? So it didn’t make sense for them to jump head-first into an expensive and time-consuming migration effort just because some startup they had never heard of promised to deliver the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>We also tried getting existing Earthly Satellite customers to switch to Earthly CI – after all, they were all using Satellites <strong>in their CIs</strong>. The problem with this group was that they were already getting 95% of the value of Earthly CI through Satellites. Their builds were already really fast. Compared to a GitHub Actions + Satellite setup, Earthly CI wasn’t better, or at least, it wasn’t better enough to warrant the switch.</p>
<p>And then, after the launch traffic died down… There was silence.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-ridiculous-negative-lead-qualification-criteria-ever">The Most Ridiculous Negative Lead Qualification Criteria Ever</h2>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1000-c7746413a.webp 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1200-c7746413a.webp 1200w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1000-c7746413a.png 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-1200-c7746413a.png 1200w" type="image/png"><img height="400px" src="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/4880-800-c7746413a.png"></picture></p>
<p>The odd thing about direct calls with prospects was that we could never convince them to try out any of our products when talking to them face to face. Not Earthly CI, not Satellites, not even Earthly. At this point, we probably had over 100 calls with prospects. We were hearing over and over how they spent 2 years migrating to their current setup, how they put so much effort into it, and how throwing all that away would be so wasteful. And how annoying it is to switch CIs.</p>
<p>And yet, when users were coming on their own to our website, through a mix of product-led / word of mouth and content marketing, the adoption of Earthly was happening every single day. At a very significant and increasing rate.</p>
<p>What seemed like absolutely impossible with one approach was being proven as very much possible - perhaps even easy - with a different approach.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it’s of course obvious that there’s no way to sell developer products via traditional means. And we already knew that. We were just shocked at how stark of a difference the approach could create. It became clear that a direct GTM approach would not help us validate a product like Earthly CI.</p>
<p>We ended up with the most ridiculous negative qualification criteria I have ever heard of: if the prospect requires a demo, then they’re not worth going after. The type of prospect that <em>does</em> convert will come to us after they downloaded Earthly, read some docs, and wrote a bunch of Earthfiles. These teams never need a demo. It’s weird, but demoing is one of the strongest negative signals we have.</p>
<p>The moral of the story here is that when you introduce a developer tool that requires integration work (work outside of the development team’s commonly expected flow, work that replicates already existing work, and work that requires learning a new syntax or API), you can never force, or hurry anyone to adopt it. This can only happen on the user’s schedule. <strong>People will buy a developer tool, but you can’t sell it</strong>. We all know that engineers like to get their hands dirty and explore things on their own. This conclusion is the corollary of that well-known fact. That’s why you can’t hard sell to engineers. You can only soft-sell.</p>

<p>Our other big channel was converting existing Earthly users into Earthly CI users. This was a key segment because there is no migration concern - everyone in this segment has already converted to Earthfiles. It should be just a flip of a switch, right?… Right?…</p>
<p>Not so fast. What about the GitHub plugins ecosystem? Do you have a codecov action? Do you have manual triggers? Can I trigger based on a git tag creation? Can I select the machine size? Can I cancel stale builds? Can I trust your platform with our build secrets?</p>
<p>Our Earthly CI MVP, despite being the fastest CI ever, never met some key requirements for people. Sure, there were a few enthusiasts who did play around with Earthly CI and started using it. But there were no sizeable organizations, with budgets, willing to use it more widely than just 2-3 engineers. And even the few Earthly CI users, after a while converted into Satellites users, to get the benefit of the combination of a richer GitHub ecosystem and the speed of the Satellites.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the Earthly community came to our product mainly for the value proposition of <em>consistent builds</em>. Since we were now trying to sell the <em>fast builds</em> value prop instead, well, our audience just wasn’t qualified that way. The match was poor.</p>
<p>And the few organizations that did have both of these needs ended up becoming Satellite customers instead. Not that we minded the Satellite customers, but it wasn’t helping to validate Earthly CI as a product.</p>
<h2 id="validating-the-invalidation">Validating the Invalidation</h2>
<p>At this point, we could see that things weren’t going according to plan. Calls weren’t converting. Existing Satellite customers weren’t converting. And existing Earthly users weren’t converting.</p>
<p>We knew that we needed to change things up, but we weren’t yet thinking that Earthly CI itself was the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, the messaging on our website was saying “Earthly makes CI super simple” and most of the content on the first page was about CI, CI, CI. Gavin Johnson, our PMM, had the interesting idea to A/B-test swapping the word “CI” for the word “build” on our website: “Earthly makes builds super simple”. Inside I kinda thought that it was somewhat of a ridiculous idea… we’re trying to push for our grand vision, and we don’t want to be bucketed into the “builds” space by investors (a space with limited commercial success). CI is where it’s at. But I didn’t have any better ideas either, so we went with it.</p>
<p>And then the results came in.</p>
<p>This one-word change ended up <strong>doubling</strong> conversions to the “Get Earthly” page – the main CTA on our website. 🤯</p>
<p>Now we were starting to get really doubtful about this Earthly CI thing.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-from-another-life">Lessons From Another Life</h2>

<p>In the fall of 2016, long before Earthly, I, along with two co-founders, a really smart code analysis scientist, and an incredibly dedicated team, started ShiftLeft (nowadays called <a href="https://qwiet.ai/">Qwiet.ai</a>). Our vision was to build a security agent that you could install in production and it would protect your cloud app from attacks on vulnerabilities that you have in your source code. This was an incredibly complex system, which required that we build an entire code analyzer that would work with multiple programming languages, runtime agents for individual runtimes, and a distributed backend to integrate everything. The complexity was akin to three companies, all being built by one tiny startup.</p>
<p>And yet, we somehow got one programming language to work end-to-end after over a year of effort, even if it was incredibly buggy initially. We tried to put it on the market - after all “if you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late”. After several attempts, we realized that it wasn’t appealing to the market. ShiftLeft being a security product, our target audience was heavily regulated enterprises. These enterprises, by definition, have a lot of red tape, and it is difficult to put anything in production without extensive bureaucracy. To make matters worse, you had to put this both in CI/CD, for the code analysis, and in production, for the runtime protection, thus creating a virtually impossible insertion motion.</p>
<p>But to overcome the difficulty of insertion, we always thought that it just needed more features. With enough features, surely the customer will accept the difficulty of insertion anyway! I mean… looking at the product it was obvious that it had all these rough edges. Maybe it’s more appealing if we smooth out the rough edges. It just needs to bake in the oven for a bit longer.</p>
<p>And bake it we did. For another year and a half. And still… Nobody. Wanted. It.</p>
<p>Looking back on the experience, we made many mistakes, which, at this point, sound like startup cliche:</p>
<ul>
<li>We did not build the product incrementally, with user feedback informing every step of the execution.</li>
<li>There were some early signals that certain aspects of the product did not align with what the industry needs, but we didn’t listen. We just kept building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, we later realized that this complex product can be split into two other products: a security code introspector for security experts, and a standalone code analyzer that is 40 times faster than any other code analyzer on the market. Yay! But we lost over a year of work and hired too many people to execute in a direction that never materialized into anything successful. It would have been so much more efficient if we started out by building smaller components of the end vision and selling those components as independent products first. The team would have been leaner, we would have had an MVP faster, and we would have had customer feedback much sooner, to help direct the roadmap.</p>
<p>My biggest regret from the experience was that we did not stop earlier when the signs were there.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, learning from mistakes of the past, at Earthly we built everything incrementally. And we even put products on the market that initially seemed like purely engineering intermediate milestones. Each product builds on top of the previous achievements, thus allowing for incremental iteration with the customer in mind. We’re now seeing our latest incremental iteration not working in the marketplace. And, knowing what I know about early products, it’s not the missing features that are the problem.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-for-earthly">What’s Next for Earthly?</h2>
<p><picture><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1000-9985df375.webp 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1200-9985df375.webp 1200w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1000-9985df375.png 1000w, https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-1200-9985df375.png 1200w" type="image/png"><img height="400px" src="https://earthly.dev/blog/generated/assets/images/shutting-down-earthly-ci/5430-800-9985df375.png"></picture></p>
<p>Here’s how I rationalize what’s happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>People want faster builds.</li>
<li>People hate switching CIs.</li>
<li>There is a stigma toward new CIs in general. Specifically that they are undifferentiated. It’s hard to shake that bias, and we scare people off as soon as they see “CI” on our website.</li>
<li>Design-partner type of engagements don’t work when we try to engage with customers directly, due to the perceived high cost of migration.</li>
<li>The Earthly CI MVP isn’t validating, failing to create a significant enough early adopter group.</li>
<li>When we tell people that they can get faster builds without switching their CI (i.e.&nbsp;through Earthly Satellites), their eyes light up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to create enough meaningful initial traction with an MVP, for some the conclusion might be simple: “It just needs more features,” or “just put it back in the oven.” But I know what a promising product’s initial traction looks like, and this is not it. If this were the real deal, there would be a group of people tolerating the absence of features for the benefits. But that’s not happening here, or at least not to a meaningful enough degree.</p>
<p>So, our conclusion is that we need to shut down Earthly CI and refocus our energy on what is working: Earthly and Earthly Satellites.</p>
<p>But Vlad, you’re deprecating the thing you just launched?</p>
<p>Well, yes. We failed fast. And that is a success in my book (or at least that’s what I keep telling myself to feel better about it). Imagine if we had built only Earthly CI from the get-go. Just like with ShiftLeft, the components of the end-vision ended up being more valuable than the original end-vision itself. Only this time, we discovered that much more efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Earthly CI is shutting down on October 1st, 2023. If you are a user, you have my sincere gratitude for experimenting with Earthly CI - it’s because of people like you that there is any innovation in the world. You took a chance on us, and we appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p>Migration off Earthly CI is really easy because Earthly works with any CI. And if you want to keep getting fast builds, you can plug in Earthly Satellites (there’s now a <a href="https://cloud.earthly.dev/">free tier</a> too - yay!). Despite Earthly CI having been marked as beta / experimental, we will fully support your transition off of it. We will be hands-on in the <a href="https://earthly.dev/slack">Earthly Slack community</a> to help you out every step of the way! We remain committed to serving our users with the utmost care.</p>
<p>It seems that Earthly Satellites are taking off, not just because we are delivering fast and consistent builds, but also, crucially, because we are <strong>letting users keep their own CI</strong>. Given this signal, it makes sense for us, as a company, to continue to invest in this direction. In fact, by shutting down Earthly CI, we have more time to execute on a number of things that the Earthly community have been asking us about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Satellite metrics – including CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Build history – for both local and Satellites builds – in the web UI.</p></li>
<li><p>Auto-skip – the ability to skip a build instantly if the changed files don’t impact it.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to execute Dockerfile builds remotely on Satellites, as a fast drop-in replacement for <code>docker build</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-hosted Satellites (a better-supported version of <a href="https://docs.earthly.dev/ci-integration/remote-buildkit">our self-hosted, remote Buildkit</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to spread a single build onto multiple Satellites for added speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute v2 - fully distributed, serverless Satellites (this one will take a while to get right).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not a user and you came to this post just for the story, then boy do I have some goodies for you to check out 🙂.</p>
<p>Earthly Satellites are ridiculously fast remote build runners that work seamlessly with any CI. It is available via Earthly Cloud and free to get started. Satellites are built on top of our open source build framework, Earthly. Earthly gives you write once, run anywhere build consistency, making it super easy to reproduce CI failures on your local computer. Earthly and Satellites together are like peanut butter and jelly – fast, consistent builds that work with any CI and are easy to debug locally.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>
<p>Effective January 1, 2024, we will introduce a new Unity Runtime Fee that’s based on game installs. We will also add cloud-based asset storage, Unity DevOps tools, and AI at runtime at no extra cost to Unity subscription plans this November.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As many of you know, the Unity Engine is in fact two substantial software components – the Unity Editor and the Unity Runtime. The Unity Runtime is code that executes on player devices and makes Made with Unity games work at scale, with billions of monthly downloads.</p>

<p>We are introducing a Unity Runtime Fee that is based upon each time a qualifying game is downloaded by an end user. We chose this because each time a game is downloaded, the Unity Runtime is also installed.&nbsp; Also we believe that an initial install-based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement, unlike a revenue share.</p></div><div><h2><p>Thresholds for revenue and installs</p></h2></div><div><p>Games qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee after two criteria have been met: 1) the game has passed a minimum revenue threshold in the last 12 months, and 2) the game has passed a minimum lifetime install count. We set high revenue and game install thresholds to avoid impacting those who have yet to find scale, meaning they don’t need to pay the fee until they have reached significant success.</p>

<p>Only games that meet the following thresholds qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Unity Personal </strong>and <strong>Unity Plus: </strong>Those<strong> </strong>that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Pro </strong>and <strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
</ul></div><div><h2><p>Flexibility and discounts for Unity Personal, Pro, and Enterprise</p></h2></div><div><p>With this new policy, as of January 1, 2024, we will offer Unity Personal to anyone regardless of how much revenue they make to provide more flexibility in how creators manage their licenses. Once a game passes the revenue and install thresholds, the studio would pay a small flat fee for each install (see the table below).</p>

<p>To adjust for scale, Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers will be eligible for volume discounts that rapidly reduce the per-install cost of the Unity Runtime Fee. This means that in addition to other benefits, the cost of Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise licenses can be offset by the savings as the game grows.</p>

<p>Finally, we structured our fees so that they take into account the variability of game monetization between more established regions like North America and Europe versus emerging gaming regions such as India. A breakdown of the pricing and discount structure is below. See the <a href="http://www.unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for additional details.</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><strong>Unity Personal and Unity Plus</strong></th><th><strong>Unity Pro</strong></th><th><strong>Unity Enterprise</strong></th></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><strong>Unity Runtime Fee thresholds to be met</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Revenue Threshold (USD)</strong></td><td>$200,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td><td>$1,000,000&nbsp;(last 12mo)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Install&nbsp;Threshold</strong></td><td>200,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td><td>1,000,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td><td>1,000,000&nbsp;(life to date)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Installs over the Install Threshold</strong></td><td colspan="3"><strong>Standard monthly rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1–100,000</strong></td><td rowspan="4">$0.20 per install</td><td>$0.15 per install</td><td>$0.125 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>100,001–500,000</strong></td><td>$0.075 per install</td><td>$0.06 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>500,001–1,000,000</strong></td><td>$0.03 per install</td><td>$0.02 per install</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1,000,001+</strong></td><td>$0.02 per install</td><td>$0.01 per install</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Installs over the Install Threshold</strong></td><td colspan="3"><strong>Emerging market monthly rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1+</strong></td><td>$0.02 per install</td><td>$0.01 per install</td><td>$0.005 per install</td></tr></thead></table>
</div><div><h2><p>Fee reduction for use of Unity services</p></h2></div><div><p>Qualifying customers may be eligible for credits toward the Unity Runtime Fee based on the adoption of Unity services beyond the Editor, such as Unity Gaming Services or Unity LevelPlay mediation for mobile ad-supported games. This program enables deeper partnership with Unity to succeed across the entire game lifecycle. Please reach out to your account manager to learn more.</p></div><div><h2><p>New services and tools. No seat price changes.</p></h2></div><div><p>This November, we will update some of the Unity subscription plans to add extra value. New capabilities include better collaboration (Unity DevOps), cloud-based asset management (Unity Asset Manager), role and access controls (Team Administration), and the ability to add AI functionality at runtime (Unity Sentis). These new tools and services will come with no increase in seat prices as we continue to help creators adapt to the growing complexity of game development. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul><li><strong>All Unity plans</strong> will get <a href="https://unity.com/products/sentis" target="_blank">Unity Sentis</a>, which enables you to embed a running AI model in the Unity Runtime, inside your game or application, without needing to pay additional cloud-compute costs or introducing latency.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Personal</strong> will include the Unity Asset Manager free tier (10GB storage total), a maximum of 3 Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes, and Team Administration base roles.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong> will include the Unity Asset Manager (50GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools to manage access will also be included.</li>
	<li><strong>Unity Enterprise </strong>will include the Unity Asset Manager (120GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats with 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools, including custom roles and SSO, provide a higher degree of control.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, Unity Plus is being retired for new subscribers effective today, September 12, 2023, to simplify the number of plans we offer. Existing subscribers do not need to take immediate action and will receive an email mid-October with an offer to upgrade to Unity Pro, for one year, at the current Unity Plus price.</p>

<div>
<p>I received a letter from a reader the other day. It was handwritten in crabbed penmanship so that it was very difficult to read. Nevertheless, I tried to make it out just in case it might prove to be important.</p>

<p>In the first sentence, he told me he was majoring in English Literature, but felt he needed to teach me science. (I sighed a bit, for I knew very few English Lit majors who are equipped to teach me science, but I am very aware of the vast state of my ignorance and I am prepared to learn as much as I can from anyone, however low on the social scale, so I read on.)</p>

<p>It seemed that in one of my innumerable essays, here and elsewhere, I had expressed a certain gladness at living in a century in which we finally got the basis of the Universe straight.</p>

<p>I didn't go into detail in the matter, but what I meant was that we now know the basic rules governing the Universe, together with the gravitational interrelationships of its gross components, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What's more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical Universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930.</p>

<p>These are all twentieth-century discoveries, you see.</p>

<p>The young specialist in English Lit, having quoted me, went on to lecture me severely on the fact that in <em>every</em> century people have thought they understood the Universe at last, and in <em>every</em> century they were proven to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about out modern "knowledge" is that it is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. "If I am the wisest man," said Socrates, "it is because I alone know that I know nothing." The implication was that I was very foolish because I knew a great deal.</p>

<p>Alas, none of this was new to me. (There is very little that is new to me; I wish my corresponders would realize this.) This particular thesis was addressed to me a quarter of a century ago by John Campbell, who specialized in irritating me. He also told me that all theories are proven wrong in time.</p>

<p>My answer to him was, "John, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if <em>you</em> think that thinking the Earth is spherical is <em>just as wrong</em> as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."</p>

<p>The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that "right" and "wrong" are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.</p>

<p>However, I don't think that's so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts, and I will devote this essay to an explanation of why I think so.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>First, let me dispose of Socrates because I am sick and tired of this pretense that knowing you know nothing is a mark of wisdom.</p>

<p>No one knows <em>nothing</em>. In a matter of days, babies learn to recognize their mothers.</p>

<p>Socrates would agree, of course, and explain that knowledge of trivia is not what he means. He means that in the great abstractions over which human beings debate, one should start without preconceived, unexamined notions, and that he alone knew this. (What an enormously arrogant claim!)</p>

<p>In his discussions of such matters as "What is justice?" or "What is virtue?" he took the attitude that he knew nothing and had to be instructed by others. (This is called "Socratic irony," for Socrates knew very well that he knew a great deal more than the poor souls he was picking on.) By pretending ignorance, Socrates lured others into propounding their views on such abstractions. Socrates then, by a series of ignorant-sounding questions, forced the others into such a mélange of self-contradictions that they would finally break down and admit they didn't know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>It is the mark of the marvelous toleration of the Athenians that they let this continue for decades and that it wasn't till Socrates turned seventy that they broke down and forced him to drink poison.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Now where do we get the notion that "right" and "wrong" are absolutes? It seems to me that this arises in the early grades, when children who know very little are taught by teachers who know very little more.</p>

<p>Young children learn spelling and arithmetic, for instance, and here we tumble into apparent absolutes.</p>

<p>How do you spell "sugar?" Answer: s-u-g-a-r. That is <em>right</em>. Anything else is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>How much is 2 + 2? The answer is 4. That is <em>right</em>. Anything else is <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Having exact answers, and having absolute rights and wrongs, minimizes the necessity of thinking, and that pleases both students and teachers. For that reason, students and teachers alike prefer short-answer tests to essay tests; multiple-choice over blank short-answer tests; and true-false tests over multiple-choice.</p>

<p>But short-answer tests are, to my way of thinking, useless as a measure of the student's understanding of a subject. They are merely a test of the efficiency of his ability to memorize.</p>

<p>You can see what I mean as soon as you admit that right and wrong are relative.</p>

<p>How do you spell "sugar?" Suppose Alice spells it p-q-z-z-f and Genevieve spells it s-h-u-g-e-r. Both are wrong, but is there any doubt that Alice is wronger than Genevieve? For that matter, I think it is possible to argue that Genevieve's spelling is superior to the "right" one.</p>

<p>Or suppose you spell "sugar": s-u-c-r-o-s-e, or C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. Strictly speaking, you are wrong each time, but you're displaying a certain knowledge of the subject beyond conventional spelling.</p>

<p>Suppose then the test question was: how many different ways can you spell "sugar?" Justify each.</p>

<p>Naturally, the student would have to do a lot of thinking and, in the end, exhibit how much or how little he knows. The teacher would also have to do a lot of thinking in the attempt to evaluate how much or how little the student knows. Both, I imagine, would be outraged.</p>

<p>Again, how much is 2 + 2? Suppose Joseph says: 2 + 2 = purple, while Maxwell says: 2 + 2 = 17. Both are wrong but isn't it fair to say that Joseph is wronger than Maxwell?</p>

<p>Suppose you said: 2 + 2 = an integer. You'd be right, wouldn't you? Or suppose you said: 2 + 2 = an even integer. You'd be righter. Or suppose you said: 2 + 2 = 3.999. Wouldn't you be <em>nearly</em> right?</p>

<p>If the teacher wants 4 for an answer and won't distinguish between the various wrongs, doesn't that set an unnecessary limit to understanding?</p>

<p>Suppose the question is, how much is 9 + 5?, and you answer 2. Will you not be excoriated and held up to ridicule, and will you not be told that 9 + 5 = 14?</p>

<p>If you were then told that 9 hours had pass since midnight and it was therefore 9 o'clock, and were asked what time it would be in 5 more hours, and you answered 14 o'clock on the grounds that 9 + 5 = 14, would you not be excoriated again, and told that it would be 2 o'clock? Apparently, in that case, 9 + 5 = 2 after all.</p>

<p>Or again suppose, Richard says: 2 + 2 = 11, and before the teacher can send him home with a note to his mother, he adds, "To the base 3, of course." He'd be right.</p>

<p>Here's another example. The teacher asks: "Who is the fortieth President of the United States?" and Barbara says, "There isn't any, teacher."</p>

<p>"Wrong!" says the teacher, "Ronald Reagan is the fortieth President of the United States."</p>

<p>"Not at all," says Barbara, "I have here a list of all the men who have served as President of the United States under the Constitution, from George Washington to Ronald Reagan, and there are only thirty-nine of them, so there is no fortieth President."</p>

<p>"Ah," says the teacher, "but Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms, one from 1885 to 1889, and the second from 1893 to 1897. He counts as both the twenty-second and twenty-fourth President. That is why Ronald Reagan is the thirty-ninth person to serve as President of the United States, and is, at the same time, the fortieth President of the United States."</p>

<p>Isn't that ridiculous? Why should a person be counted twice if his terms are nonconsecutive, and only once if he served two consecutive terms? Pure convention! Yet Barbara is marked wrong—just as wrong as if she had said that the fortieth President of the United States is Fidel Castro.</p>

<p>Therefore, when my friend the English Literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the Universe and are <em>always wrong</em>, what I want to know is <em>how</em> wrong are they? Are they always wrong to the same degree? Let's take an example.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>In the early days of civilization, the general feeling was that the Earth was flat.</p>

<p>This was not because people were stupid, or because they were intent on believing silly things. They felt it was flat on the basis of sound evidence. It was <em>not</em> just a matter of "That's how it looks," because the Earth does <em>not</em> look flat. It looks chaotically bumpy, with hills, valleys, ravines, cliffs, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course, there are plains where, over limited areas, the Earth's surface <em>does</em> look fairly flat. One of those plains is in the Tigris-Euphrates area where the first historical civilization (one with writing) developed, that of the Sumerians.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the appearance of the plain that may have persuaded the clever Sumerians to accept the generalization that the Earth was flat; that if you somehow evened out all the elevations and depressions, you would be left with flatness. Contributing to the notion may have been the fact that stretches of water (ponds and lakes) looked pretty flat on quiet days.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is to ask what is the "curvature" of Earth's surface. Over a considerable length, how much does the surface deviate (on the average) from perfect flatness. The flat-Earth theory would make it seem that the surface doesn't deviate from flatness at all, that its curvature is 0 to the mile.</p>

<p>Nowadays, of course, we are taught that the flat-Earth theory is <em>wrong</em>; that it is all wrong, terribly wrong, absolutely. But it isn't. The curvature of the Earth is <em>nearly</em> 0 per mile, so that although the flat-Earth theory is wrong, it happens to be <em>nearly</em> right. That's why the theory lasted so long.</p>

<p>There were reasons, to be sure, to find the flat-Earth theory unsatisfactory and, about 350 B.C., the Greek philosopher Aristotle summarized them. First, certain stars disappeared beyond the Southern Hemisphere as one traveled north, and beyond the Northern Hemisphere as one traveled south. Second, the Earth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse was always the arc of a circle. Third, here on Earth itself, ships disappeared beyond the horizon hull-first in whatever direction they were traveling.</p>

<p>All three observations could not be reasonably explained if the Earth's surface were flat, but could be explained by assuming the Earth to be a sphere.</p>

<p>What's more, Aristotle believed that all solid matter tended to move toward a common center, and if solid matter did this, it would end up as a sphere. A given volume of matter is, on the average, closer to a common center if it is a sphere than if it is any other shape whatever.</p>

<p>About a century after Aristotle, the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes noted that the Sun cast a shadow of different lengths at different latitudes (all the shadows would be the same length if the Earth's surface were flat). From the difference in shadow length, he calculated the size of the earthly sphere and it turned out to be 25,000 miles in circumference.</p>

<p>The curvature of such a sphere is about 0.000126 per mile, a quantity very close to 0 per mile as you can see, and one not easily measured by the techniques at the disposal of the ancients. The tiny difference between 0 and 0.000126 accounts for the fact that it took so long to pass from the flat Earth to the spherical Earth.</p>

<p>Mind you, even a tiny difference, such at that between 0 and 0.000126, can be extremely important. That difference mounts up. The Earth cannot be mapped over large areas with any accuracy at all if the difference isn't taken into account and if the Earth isn't considered a sphere rather than a flat surface. Long ocean voyages can't be undertaken with any reasonable way of locating one's own position in the ocean unless the Earth is considered spherical rather than flat.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the flat Earth presupposes the possibility of an infinite Earth, or of the existence of an "end" to the surface. The spherical Earth, however, postulates an Earth that is both endless and yet finite, and it is the latter postulate that is consistent with all later findings.</p>

<p>So although the flat-Earth theory is only slightly wrong and is a credit to its inventors, all things considered, it is wrong enough to be discarded in favor of the spherical-Earth theory.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And yet is the Earth a sphere?</p>

<p>No, it is <em>not</em> a sphere; not in the strict mathematical sense. A sphere has certain mathematical properties—for instance, all diameters (that is, all straight lines that pass from one point on its surface, through the center, to another point on its surface) have the same length.</p>

<p>That, however, is not true of the Earth. Various diameters of the Earth differ in length.</p>

<p>What gave people the notion the Earth wasn't a true sphere? To begin with, the Sun and the Moon have outlines that are perfect circles within the limits of measurement in the early days of the telescope. This is consistent with the supposition that the Sun and Moon are perfectly spherical in shape.</p>

<p>However, when Jupiter and Saturn were observed by the first telescopic observers, it became quickly apparent that the outlines of those planets were not circles, but distinct ellipses. That meant that Jupiter and Saturn were not true spheres.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton, toward the end of the seventeenth century, showed that a massive body would form a sphere under the pull of gravitational forces (exactly as Aristotle had argued), but only if it were not rotating. If it were rotating, a centrifugal effect would be set up which would lift the body's substance against gravity, and the effect would be greater the closer to the equator you progressed. The effect would also be greater the more rapidly a spherical object rotated and Jupiter and Saturn rotated very rapidly indeed.</p>

<p>The Earth rotated much more slowly than Jupiter or Saturn so the effect should be smaller, but it should still be there. Actual measurements of the curvature of the Earth were carried out in the eighteenth century and Newton was proved correct.</p>

<p>The Earth has an equatorial bulge, in other words. It is flattened at the poles. It is an "oblate spheroid" rather than a sphere. This means that the various diameters of the earth differ in length. The longest diameters are any of those that stretch from one point on the equator to an opposite point on the equator. The "equatorial diameter" is 12,755 kilometers (7,927 miles). The shortest diameter is from the North Pole to the South Pole and this "polar diameter" is 12,711 kilometers (7,900 miles).</p>

<p>The difference between the longest and shortest diameters is 44 kilometers (27 miles), and that means that the "oblateness" of the Earth (its departure from true sphericity) is 44/12,755, or 0.0034. This amounts to 1/3 of 1 percent.</p>

<p>To put it another way, on a flat surface, curvature is 0 per mile everywhere. On Earth's spherical surface, curvature is 0.000126 per mile everywhere (or 8 inches per mile). On Earth's oblate spheroidical surface, the curvature varies from 7.973 inches to the mile to 8.027 inches to the mile.</p>

<p>The correction in going from spherical to oblate spheroidal is much smaller than going from flat to spherical. Therefore, although the notion of the Earth as sphere is wrong, strictly speaking, it is not <em>as</em> wrong as the notion of the Earth as flat.</p>

<p>Even the oblate-spheroidal notion of the Earth is wrong, strictly speaking. In 1958, when the satellite <em>Vanguard 1</em> was put into orbit about the Earth, it was able to measure the local gravitational pull of the Earth—and therefore its shape—with unprecedented precision. It turned out that the equatorial bulge south of the equator was slightly bulgier than the bulge north of the equator, and that the South Pole sea level was slightly nearer the center of the Earth than the North Pole sea level was.</p>

<p>There seemed no other way of describing this than by saying the Earth was pearshaped and at once many people decided that the Earth was nothing like a sphere but was shaped like a Bartlett pear dangling in space. Actually, the pearlike deviation from oblate-spheroid perfect was a matter of yards rather than miles and the adjustment of curvature was in the millionths of an inch per mile.</p>

<p>In short, my English Lit friend, living in a mental world of absolute rights and wrongs, may be imagining that because all theories are <em>wrong</em>, the Earth may be thought spherical now, but cubical next century, and a hollow icosahedron the next, and a doughnut shape the one after.</p>

<p>What actually happens is that once scientists get hold of a good concept they gradually refine and extend if with a greater and greater subtlety as their instruments of measurement improve. Theories are not so much wrong as incomplete.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This can be pointed out in many other cases than just the shape of the Earth. Even when a new theory seems to represent a revolution, it usually arises out of small refinements. If something more than a small refinement were needed, then the old theory would never have endured.</p>

<p>Copernicus switched from an Earth-centered planetary system to a Sun-centered one. In doing so, he switched from something that was obvious to something that was apparently ridiculous. However, it was a matter of finding better ways of calculating the motion of the planets in the sky and, eventually, the geocentric theory was just left behind. It was precisely because the old theory gave results that were fairly good by the measurement standards of the time that kept it in being so long.</p>

<p>Again, it is because the geological formations of the Earth change <em>so</em> slowly and the living things upon it evolve <em>so</em> slowly that it seemed reasonable at first to suppose that there was <em>no</em> change and that Earth and life always existed as they do today. If that were so, it would make no difference whether Earth and life were billions of years old or thousands. Thousands were easier to grasp.</p>

<p>But when careful observation showed that Earth and life were changing at a rate that was very tiny but <em>not</em> zero, then it became clear that Earth and life had to be very old. Modern geology came into being, and so did the notion of biological evolution.</p>

<p>If the rate of change were more rapid, geology and evolution would have reached their modern state in ancient times. It is only because the difference between the rate of change in a static Universe and the rate of change in an evolutionary one is that between zero and very nearly zero that the creationists can continue propagating their folly.</p>

<p>Again, how about the two great theories of the twentieth century; relativity and quantum mechanics?</p><p>Newton's theories of motion and gravitation were very close to right, and they would have been absolutely right if only the speed of light were infinite. However, the speed of light is finite, and that had to be taken into account in Einstein's relativistic equations, which were an extension and refinement of Newton's equations.</p>

<p>You might say that the difference between infinite and finite is itself infinite, so why didn't Newton's equations fall to the ground at once? Let's put it another way, and ask how long it takes light to travel over a distance of a meter.</p>

<p>If light traveled at infinite speed, it would take light 0 seconds to travel a meter. At the speed at which light actually travels, however, it takes it 0.0000000033 seconds. It is that difference between 0 and 0.0000000033 that Einstein corrected for.</p>

<p>Conceptually, the correction was as important as the correction of Earth's curvature from 0 to 8 inches per mile was. Speeding subatomic particles wouldn't behave the way they do without the correction, nor would particle accelerators work the way they do, nor nuclear bombs explode, nor the stars shine. Nevertheless, it was a tiny correction and it is no wonder that Newton, in his time, could not allow for it, since he was limited in his observations to speeds and distances over which the correction was insignificant.</p>

<p>Again, where the prequantum view of physics fell short was that it didn't allow for the "graininess" of the Universe. All forms of energy had been thought to be continuous and to be capable of division into indefinitely smaller and smaller quantities.</p>

<p>This turned out to be not so. Energy comes in quanta, the size of which is dependent upon something called Planck's constant. If Planck's constant were equal to 0 erg-seconds, then energy would be continuous, and there would be no grain to the Universe. Planck's constant, however, is equal to 0.000000000000000000000000066 erg-seconds. That is indeed a tiny deviation from zero, so tiny that ordinary questions of energy in everyday life need not concern themselves with it. When, however, you deal with subatomic particles, the graininess is sufficiently large, in comparison, to make it impossible to deal with them without taking quantum considerations into account.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Since the refinements in theory grow smaller and smaller, even quite ancient theories must have been sufficiently right to allow advances to be made; advances that were not wiped out by subsequent refinements.</p>

<p>The Greeks introduced the notion of latitude and longitude, for instance, and made reasonable maps of the Mediterranean basin even without taking sphericity into account, and we still use latitude and longitude today.</p>

<p>The Sumerians were probably the first to establish the principle that planetary movements in the sky exhibit regularity and can be predicted, and they proceeded to work out ways of doing so even though they assumed the Earth to be the center of the Universe. Their measurements have been enormously refined but the principle remains.</p>

<p>Newton's theory of gravitation, while incomplete over vast distances and enormous speeds, is perfectly suitable for the Solar System. Halley's Comet appears punctually as Newton's theory of gravitation and laws of motion predict. All of rocketry is based on Newton, and <em>Voyager II</em> reached Uranus within a second of the predicted time. None of these things were outlawed by relativity.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, before quantum theory was dreamed of, the laws of thermodynamics were established, including the conservation of energy as first law, and the inevitable increase of entropy as the second law. Certain other conservation laws such as those of momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge were also established. So were Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism. All remained firmly entrenched even after quantum theory came in.</p>

<p>Naturally, the theories we now have might be considered wrong in the simplistic sense of my English Lit correspondent, but in a much truer and subtler sense, they need only be considered incomplete.</p>

<p>For instance, quantum theory has produced something called "quantum weirdness" which brings into serious question the very nature of reality and which produces philosophical conundrums that physicists simply can't seem to agree upon. It may be that we have reached a point where the human brain can no longer grasp matters, or it may be that quantum theory is incomplete and that once it is properly extended, all the "weirdness" will disappear.</p>

<p>Again, quantum theory and relativity seem to be independent of each other, so that while quantum theory makes it seem possible that three of the four known interactions can be combined into one mathematical system, gravitation—the realm of relativity—as yet seems intransigent.</p>

<p>If quantum theory and relativity can be combined, a true "unified field theory" may become possible.</p>

<p>If all this is done, however, it would be a still finer refinement that would affect the edges of the known—the nature of the big bang and the creation of the Universe, the properties at the center of black holes, some subtle points about the evolution of galaxies and supernovas, and so on.</p>

<p>Virtually all that we know today, however, would remain untouched and when I say I am glad that I live in a century when the Universe is essentially understood, I think I am justified.</p>

The larger the </span><em>n, </em><span>the smaller the variance; the smaller the variance, the more the normal distribution is concentrated around the expected value μ.</span></p><p>This finally answers our question: how large is that ominous number in the law of large numbers? It depends on the variance of our distribution!</p><p><span>We can read from the asymptotic expansion that if the variance is 10x larger, we need roughly 10x the number of samples for the average to be as close as originally.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <article>
                  <p><span><span lang="EN-US">Atsugi, Japan — Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS) today announced that it has developed an energy harvesting<sup>*1</sup> module that uses electromagnetic wave noise energy.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The new module applies technology that SSS has cultivated in the tuner development process to generate power from electromagnetic wave noise with a high level of efficiency. For example, this technology can use the constant electromagnetic wave noise generated by robots inside factories, monitors and lighting in offices, monitors and TVs in stores and homes, and the like to provide the stable power supply needed to run low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">With attention on the challenge of providing power to the increasing number of IoT devices as they grow in popularity and sophistication, this highly efficient energy harvesting technology shows promise for a wide range of applications. SSS aims to employ the new technology as part of its effort to build a power circulation model, thereby contributing to the development of a sustainable IoT society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>*1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology that harvests minute amounts of energy that exist in the environment and living things for conversion into electricity.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Usage scenarios<br></span><span lang="EN-US">Factory (Left), Office (Middle), Retail (Right)</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Energy harvesting is a technology that is expected to contribute to both the development of IoT and the sustainability of the global environment, with research being carried out mainly in fields such as electrical waves, light, heat, and vibration. SSS’s new technology is the energy harvesting technology to generate power utilizing the electromagnetic wave noise that all electrical equipment generates.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Based on antenna technology created during tuner development at SSS, this new module uses the metal parts of electronic devices that serve as the source of electromagnetic wave noise as part of an antenna and employs a rectifier circuit<sup>*2</sup> with enhanced electricity conversion efficiency, for a highly original structure. This allows it to convert electromagnetic wave noise in a range of several Hz to 100 MHz into electrical energy and supply power to low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment, or to charge batteries, despite its compact size. This is the industry’s first<sup>*3</sup> energy harvesting technology based on this method that achieves highly efficient power generation. By efficiently utilizing previously ignored electromagnetic wave noise as a new power source, it enables a stable power supply for equipment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The minimal number of constituent components used in the module yields a compact design that allows for greater freedom of installation. Also, as long as electronic devices are powered, energy can be harvested even while they are not in active use, making this technology promising in a wide variety of usage situations such as factories, offices, stores, and homes, both indoors and outdoors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>*2:&nbsp;&nbsp; An electrical circuit that converts alternating current to direct current. In general, alternating current is used to transmit electrical energy, so a rectifier circuit is used in power sources of equipment that require direct current.</span></p>
<p><span>*3:&nbsp;&nbsp; As an energy harvesting technology. According to SSS research. As of announcement on September 7, 2023.</span></p>

<p>Developed module (size: 7 mm square)</p>
</div>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-US">Main Features</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-US"><span><strong>High level of power generation<br></strong></span></span>Utilizing electronic equipment that generates a significant amount of electromagnetic wave noise such as household appliances, computers, lighting equipment, vending machines, elevators, automobiles, and industrial equipment as an energy source enables this module to harvest from several dozen μW to several dozen mW of power. Doing so makes it possible to supply power to low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment</li>
<li><span lang="EN-US"><strong><span>Applicable to a wide range of use cases<br></span></strong></span><strong>-</strong> As long as electronic devices are powered, power can be harvested even when they are not in active use. This method therefore differs from other energy harvesting methods which use sunlight, electrical waves, and temperature differences, all of which are susceptible to environmental factors such as lighting brightness and indoor environments. Thus, the new module enables continuous harvesting.<br> <strong>-</strong> The minimal number of constituent components used in the module yields a compact design that allows for greater freedom of installation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span>Device status can be identified<br></span></span></strong>Because this technology continuously harvests electromagnetic wave noise from electronic devices, it can also identify the internal status of the electronic device by detecting changes in the harvested voltage. This means, for instance, that it can be used for applications such as detecting whether lighting is functioning normally or predicting device failure, for example in robots with built-in motors.</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-US">SSS looks forward to working with partners from various industries to develop products based on this technology, which shows promise across a wide variety of applications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<div>
		<p>Every release has a killer feature. Qt 6.6 features the opposite - staying alive. This blog post describes work to make Qt clients more robust and seemlessly migrate between compositors, providing resistance against compositor crashes and more.</p>
<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Right now if you restart pulseaudio your sound might cut out, restart NetworkManager and you lose your wifi, restart an X11 window manager and your decorations disappear.</p>
<p>But within a second it's all back to normal exactly where you left off with everything recovering fine.</p>
<p>This isn't true for display servers. If X11 restarts you're back at the login prompt. All drafts lost, games unsaved, work wasted.</p>
<h2>Past</h2>
<p>For X11 this was unfixable; clients relied on memory stored by the Xserver, they made synchronous calls that were expected to return values, and multiple clients talked to multple clients.</p>
<p>This was a real problem in my early days of Linux, X11 would lock up frequently enough that most distributions had a shortcut key to restart the server and send you back to the login prompt.</p>
<p>It's less of an issue now as X11 has been in a lengthy period of feature freeze.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Wayland makes it possible to fix all this. Memory allocations are client side, all operations are async, all protocols are designed that the compositor always has complete control.</p>
<p>Yet the current user-facing state is <strong>considerably worse</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compositors and displays servers are now the same process, doubling the space for errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compositors are typically extensible with 3rd party plugins and scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wayland security model means the compositor absorbs even more functions from global shortcuts to screencasting and input-method handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wayland ecosystem  is not in a period of feature freeze with wayland protocols constantly evolving to cover missing features and new ideas.</p>
<p>Even if there was a perfect compositor:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/report.cgi?bug_severity=crash&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;classification=Plasma&amp;cumulate=0&amp;product=kwin&amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;resolution=UPSTREAM&amp;resolution=DOWNSTREAM&amp;saved_report_id=14&amp;x_axis_field=resolution&amp;width=1024&amp;height=600&amp;action=wrap&amp;format=pie">40% of kwin's crash bug reports are either upstream or downstream causes</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current compositor developer experience is limited with developers having to relogin and restart their apps and development setup just to test their latest changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plan</h2>
<p>The solution for this? Instead of exiting when the compositor closes, simply...don't!</p>
<p>If we could connect to a new compositor we just need to send the right amount of information to bring it in sync and notify the application code of any changes to bring this in sync.</p>
<p>For Qt applications all this information is handled in the backend, in the Wayland Qt Platform Abstraction (QPA).</p>
<p>Qt already has to handle screens and input devices being removed, clipboards being revoked and drag and drops cancelled. Supporting a whole reset isn't introducing any new work, we just have to trigger all of these actions at once, then reconnect to the newly restored compositor and restore our contents.</p>
<p>Applications already have to support all of these events too as well as handle callbacks to redraw buffers. There's no changes needed at an application code level, it's all done as transparently as possible. </p>
<p>Handling OpenGL is a challenge, right now we don't have a way to keep that alive. Fortunately we put in lots of effort previously in supporting GPU resets throughout the Qt stack. The QtWayland backend fakes to the applications that a GPU reset has occured through the Qt abstractions.</p>
<p>For the majority of applications including all QtQuick users this happens automatically and flawlessly, building on the work <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/plasma-rendering-handling-nvidia-context-loss/" title="that we put in previously">that we put in previously</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst the overall concepts might sound invasive, the final merge-request to support all of this for all Qt applications was fewer lines than supporting middle-click paste.</p>
<p>Almost no work needs doing on the compositor side. For a compositor there's no difference between a new client, and a client that was running previously reconnecting. The only big change we made within Kwin is having a helper process so the whole process can be seemless and race-free.</p>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u4HnwqidYFo?si=zmIxcs9555Zv6gsP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Path Forward</h2>
<p>This post is about Qt, but the world is bigger than that. Not only does this technique work here, but we have pending patches for GTK, SDL and even XWayland, with key parts of SDL merged but disabled already.</p>
<p>The challenge for the other toolkits is we can't use the same OpenGL trick as Qt. They either lack GPU reset handling either at a toolkit level or within the applications. </p>
<p>Supporting OpenGL requires new infrastructure. We've tried from the start to get some infrastructure in place to allow this.It was clear that proposing library changes for client reconnection support was an uphill battle whilst being unproven in the wild.</p>
<p>After Qt6 is rolled out to a wider audience and shown to work reliably, we'll refocus efforts on pushing upstream changes to the other platforms. </p>
<h2>Potential Perks</h2>
<p>This isn't just about crashes. If support becomes mainstream there will be additional opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can easily upgrade to new features without having to log out and back. This is one of the reasons why kwin development is happening at such a rapid pace in recent months. We're not having to test in fake nested sessions or waste time logging in and setting up between changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can support multihead, running different compositors per group of outputs and move seemlessly between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's feasible to switch between compositors at runtime. With the application handling the reconnect logic, they can easily handle the case where compositor feature sets vary.</p>

</p></li>
<li>
<p>Checkpoint restore in userspace, being able to suspend your application to disk and then pick up where you left off like nothing happened. It could never work for X applications, but with wayland reconnect support we can make it work. </p>
</li>
</ul>

I’ve been thinking about the implications of AI in teaching since I first began using GPT-2 back in 2019. I have also been following along avidly as my wife </span><a href="https://www.royapakzad.co/" rel="">Roya Pakzad </a><span>works on testing the human rights impacts of AI systems (Roya was a consultant for OpenAI in 2022, where she served on the “red team” for adversarial testing of a pre-release version of GPT-4; you can read her account of that work </span><a href="https://royapakzad.substack.com/p/old-advocacy-new-algorithms" rel="">here</a><span>).</span></p><p>What follows are some thoughts about what I believe to be a novel use of LLMs: using them to simulate interactive historical settings as part of a university assignment. The results of these early trials are why I am personally much more excited about generative AI than many of my colleagues —&nbsp;though I also concede that in the short term, cheating will be a major problem. </p><p>In the second half of this post, I go into detail about what exactly I mean by “simulating history.” I am under no illusions that these simulations are accurate: they are littered with confidently-stated falsehoods and hallucinations. Sometimes, though, hallucinations can be a feature, not a bug. </p><p><span>At the end of this post, I include links to detailed prompts which you can use to simulate different historical settings, or customize to use with </span><a href="https://claude.ai/chats" rel="">Claude</a><span> or </span><a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" rel="">ChatGPT</a><span> (the free versions of both work about equally well, though GPT-4 works best). I invite readers to share their experiences in the comments. </span></p><p>In the long term, I suspect that LLMs will have a significant positive impact on higher education. Specifically, I believe they will elevate the importance of the humanities. </p><p><span>If this happens, it will be a shocking twist. We’ve been hearing for over a decade now that the humanities are in crisis. When faced with raw data about declining enrollments and majors like </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/" rel="">this</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major" rel="">this</a><span>, it is difficult not to agree. From the perspective of a few years ago, then, the advent of a new wave of powerful AI tools would be expected to tip the balance of power, funding, and enrollment in higher education even further toward STEM and away from the humanities. </span></p><p><span>But the thing is: LLMs are deeply, inherently </span><em>textual</em><span>. And they are reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes. </span></p><p>What do I mean by that? One of the hallmarks of training in history is learning how to think about a given text at increasingly higher levels of abstraction. We teach students how to analyze the genre, cultural context,  assumptions, and affordances of a primary source — the unspoken limits that shaped how, why, and for whom it was created, and what content it contains. </p><p><span>For example, imagine a high school student who is asked to analyze the first letter of Hernán Cortés to the Emperor Charles V. The student might dutifully paraphrase the conquistador’s account of the Aztec capital of Tenochititlan —&nbsp;including this </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/fernandocorteshi01cort/page/154/mode/2up" rel="">famously jarring description of Aztec temples as “mosques”</a><span> (</span><em>mezquitas). </em><span>A history major would be able to go further. </span><em>Why </em><span>did Cortés use this confusing term? Cortés was born during the final decade of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista" rel="">Reconquista</a><span>. For this reason, he was intimately acquainted with non-Christian religiosity — but only in the context of </span><em>Muslim </em><span>religiosity. A large religious structure that was not a Christian church was for him, almost by default, a mosque —&nbsp;even when it was actually the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templo_Mayor" rel="">Templo Mayor</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, a history major would be able to recognize that Cortés was writing within a genre —&nbsp;an ambitious subject’s letter to a monarch —&nbsp;which tends toward self-promotion. And they would be able to fact check Cortés’ claims against those of other primary and secondary sources. Perhaps they would conduct some exploratory Google searches along the lines of “primary source conquest of Mexico” or “Aztec account of Cortés.” They might also look around for recent secondary sources by searching library catalogues and the footnotes on Cortés’ Wikipedia page and discover Matthew Restall’s </span><a href="https://notevenpast.org/when-montezuma-met-cortes-the-true-story-of-the-meeting-that-changed-history-by-matthew-restall-2018/" rel="">revisionist take</a><span> on the subject. </span></p><p><span>When history majors encounter LLMs, then, they are already trained to recognize some of the by-now-familiar pitfalls of services like ChatGPT —&nbsp;such as factual inaccuracies —&nbsp;and to address them via skills like fact-checking, analyzing genre and audience, or reading “around” a topic by searching in related sources. Importantly, too, because so many sources are out of copyright and available in multilingual editions on Wikipedia and Wikisource, language models are abundantly trained on historical primary sources in hundreds of different languages.</span></p><p><span>For these reasons, I agree with Tyler Cowen that language models are </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/01/chatgpt-and-the-revenge-of-history.html" rel="">specifically a good thing for historians</a><span> — but I would go further and say that they are also </span><em>specifically a good thing for history majors.</em></p><p><span>On the other hand, I foresee major problems for history teachers and other educators in the short-term. </span><a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2023/07/31/we-can-save-what-matters-about-writing-at-a-price/" rel="">Ted Underwood is right</a><span>: we professors are going to have to fundamentally rethink many of our assignments. I’ve seen many people dismiss ChatGPT as an essay writing tool because simply plugging in a prompt from an assignment results in a weak piece of writing. But LLMs are all about iterative feedback, and experimenting with well-known prompting methods dramatically improves results. </span></p><p><span>Here’s an example from one of my own past classes. When given a question from my “Early Modern Europe” survey about how Benvenuto Cellini’s </span><em>Autobiography </em><span>illustrates new ways of thinking about identity during the early modern period, GPT-4 can produce dramatically different results depending on the prompt. </span></p><p><span>Compare </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/82b429e2-efb1-403c-a4a8-2d8eea1b9c4a" rel="">this short and scattered effort</a><span> (which I’d likely give a D- or F) to this </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/65bf7af7-5672-4ecc-b553-2d3d32573483" rel="">pretty decent attempt</a><span>, which would get around a B+. The difference is the use of roleplaying. In the latter, I tell ChatGPT that it is “an advanced language model that has been trained on prize-winning graduate and undergraduate essays.” I also ask it to start with self-reflection and an outline (which is basically replicating the process a real person would take).</span></p><p>As students get better at finessing prompts in this way, cheating on take-home writing assignments will get far easier. </p><p>But this same power of asking LLMs to role-play as specialized versions of themselves also makes them hugely interesting as educational tools in the classroom — and, specifically, as history simulators. </p><p>What happens if we tell ChatGPT that it is an advanced history simulator specifically trained to reconstruct historical settings in university classrooms? </p><p>This does:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png" width="1200" height="1166.2087912087911" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1415,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:297780,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56c17c01-66d4-4bb8-a9df-3c8f1c392206_1655x1608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This is a trial run for a scenario I’m developing for a world history class I’ll be teaching this fall. I’m envisioning an assignment in which my students will simulate the experience of being sold flawed copper by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir" rel="">Ea-nāṣir</a><span>, a real-life shady copper merchant in Mesopotamia circa 1750 BCE (one who, in recent years, has unexpectedly </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReallyShittyCopper/" rel="">become a meme online</a><span>). </span></p><p><span>Crucially, this is not just about role-playing as an angry customer of Ea-nāṣir — or as the man himself, which is also an option. As illuminating as the simulations can be, the real benefit of the assignment is in what follows. First, students will print out and annotate the transcript of their simulation (which runs for twenty “turns,” or conversational beats) and carefully read through it with red pens to spot potential factual errors. They will then conduct their own research to correct those errors. They’ll then write their findings up as bullet points and feed this </span><em>back</em><span> into ChatGPT in a new, individualized and hopefully improved version of the prompt that they develop themselves. This doesn’t just teach them historical research and fact-checking — it also helps them develop skills for working directly with generative AI that I suspect will be valuable in future job markets.</span></p><p>Finally, the students share their findings with groups of classmates, then write reflection papers that include an account of what they talked about in their groups (which, among other things, makes it difficult to cheat by asking ChatGPT to write the whole thing). </p><p>Back in April of 2023, I tried out a more elaborate assignment in which students in my medieval history class simulated a day in the life as characters during the height of the Bubonic Plague epidemic in 1348, living in one of three places: Damascus, Paris, or Pistoia, an Italian city-state. </p><p>Below are links to the relevant Google Docs. I invite you to try it out yourself. Just click on one of these links, then copy and paste the highlighted prompt into ChatGPT and go from there. (If ChatGPT screws something up, just click “regenerate results” until you get a better response.) Beneath each prompt, I’ve included a transcript of a “trial run” of the simulation so you can see how it works.</p><p><em>You are a traveler passing through Damascus during the height of plague, staying at a crowded caravanserai... and you wake up with a scratchy throat.</em></p><p><em><span>You are a somewhat disreputable apothecary — a seller of cures and possibly counterfeit drugs known as a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan" rel="">quack</a><span>” — trying to survive and profit off the 1348 plague epidemic in Paris.</span></em></p><p><em>You are an upstanding city councilor in the medieval Italian city-state of Pistoia doing your best to navigate between the city's different interest groups, guilds, and wealthy families to negotiate a civic response to the plague.</em></p><p>Students were asked to compare their simulated experience to real historical accounts of the plague in each of those three places. They were then asked to write a paper with the following guidelines:</p><blockquote><p>This 3-4 page paper should focus on analyzing and reflecting on the accuracy of the simulation. In your paper, you should consider what the simulation got right and wrong, what it emphasized and neglected, and what you learned from fact-checking it. To get started, take notes during the simulation itself (what terms or words are used you don't recognize? What strikes you as anachronistic? What questions do you have?). Afterward, consider how the simulation represented the historical time period and how it portrayed different aspects of daily life. Think about the virtual characters and environments generated by the simulation. Then begin researching the actual setting and some of the terms you wrote down in your notes via JSTOR, Google Scholar etc.</p><p><span>When writing your reflection paper, focus on critical thinking and analysis rather than simply summarizing your experience with the simulation. Be sure to cite </span><strong>at least four scholarly secondary sources relating to your chosen scenario </strong><span>as you reflect on the what the simulation got right and wrong. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Earlier in the same class, I had students simulate life as a medieval peasant. This was more of a trial-run, without an accompanying assignment, but you can see that prompt and </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mLIy8LVsfowbtRa5QaWs-PxUQT_E8YSxWp-nl8XoGS8/edit?usp=sharing" rel="">try it out yourself here.</a><span> This was an interesting learning experience for me because it was the first time I experimented with asking ChatGPT to randomize the location (it </span><em>really </em><span>likes dropping you in medieval England or France, surprisingly often as a peasant girl named Isabelle). </span></p><p>In both cases, I was blown away by student engagement and creativity. Here’s a brief list of what some of my students did in their medieval simulations:</p><p>•&nbsp;ran away from home to become an apprentice to a traveling spice merchant</p><p>• developed various treatments for the plague, some historically accurate (like theriac) others much less so (like vaccines)</p><p>• negotiated complex legal settlements between the warring guilds of Pistoia</p><p>•&nbsp;fled to the forest and became an itinerant hermit</p><p><span>• attempt to purchase “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_blood" rel="">dragons blood</a><span>,” a genuine medieval and early modern remedy, to cure their fast-worsening plague</span></p><p>• made heroic efforts as an Italian physician named Guilbert to stop the spread of plague with perfume</p><p>•&nbsp;became leaders of both successful and unsuccessful peasant revolts</p><p>Student engagement in the spring quarter, when I began these trials, was unlike anything I’ve seen. The first time I tested the idea out informally (asking students to simulate their home town via an up-ended general purpose simulation prompt) I realized that we had gone 5 minutes past the end of class without anyone noticing! </p><p>An unexpected positive of this assignment was that it particularly seemed to engage students who had previously been sitting in the back rows looking bored. Engaging students like this is a perennial issue for teachers, and not one I’ve found easy to solve. Randomly calling on people in the back can often make it worse by ramping up anxiety. The medieval manor and plague simulator assignments worked wonders in terms of sparking enthusiasm among previously disengaged students. </p><p>That said, there were some issues with my first iteration of the simulation. You can get a sense of them in my student feedback from that class. There was a lot of praise for the simulation idea, which I called “History Lens” because it provides a distorted perspective on the past:</p><ul><li><p>"The plague simulation History Lens assignment was a great project that allowed us to experience what life was like during the time.”</p></li><li><p>"Big big fan of the plague simulator/history lens game, I think that has a ton of potential and I hope I see it in more classes in the future."</p></li><li><p>“The instructor helped me feel engaged with the course very frequently because he used assignments and activities to allow the class to not just learn about history but to let us see through the eyes of the people during that time. An example of this was the ChatGPT History Lens assignment.”</p></li></ul><p>But also this:</p><ul><li><p>“For the plague assignment it was rather absurd to rate chatgpt on historical accuracy. Someone said their simulation contained a talking rat.”</p></li></ul><p>Not ideal!</p><p><span>Going forward, my plan is to develop my own web app which will allow users to create historical simulations on a dedicated platform using the APIs of both Anthropic’s Claude and GPT-4. Both of these options have or will have larger context windows which will allow the AI to be fed far more detailed primary sources. My hope is that this, plus better directions and rules, will help with what we might call the “talking rat problem”: when the simulation is so </span><em>blatantly </em><span>wrong that an assignment built around fact-checking and contextualizing it just becomes an exercise in absurdity. </span></p><p>I will be writing a writing a sequel to this post in October with the results of my new and improved history simulation assignment and prompts, and some further thoughts on LLMs in education (including the cheating issue). </p><p><span>In the meantime, I would be thrilled if to get a community going of other people interested in this. Please try the prompts I’ve linked above (or the others available below) and let me know in the comments how it went. If you are doing anything similar or are interested in implementing this in your classroom, please </span><a href="https://benjaminpbreen.com/about-2/contact/" rel="">let me know</a><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I believe the following to be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bad managers are the cause of a lot of employee unhappiness.</li>
<li>Bad managers are the cause of a lot of workplace failure, i.e., late projects, subpar products, and unmet goals.</li>
<li>Managers are one of the most under-supported cohorts of employees on the planet.</li>
</ol>
<p>How many managers do you know who studied to be managers of people?</p>
<p>I mean more than a couple of one-day courses; I mean someone who studied to be a manager the way someone studied to be a software engineer or doctor.</p>
<p>I personally don’t know anyone, and while those degrees definitely exist, it’s got me wondering: of the total managers in the world, how many of them have those qualifications? Is it even 1%?</p>
<p>Just imagine if other professions had that split of self-taught vs. formally taught. Plumbers, doctors, lawyers... There would be massive variability in the quality of their work and their overall success, and yet that’s the exact gamble every company around the world is taking.</p>
<p>So how are the 99% becoming managers?</p>
<p>Julie Zhuo, <a href="https://www.juliezhuo.com/" target="_blank">author of The Making of a Manager</a>, writes about the four paths to becoming a manager:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Apprentice</strong>: The team is expanding and is too large for one manager, and so you are tapped to step into a newly needed role.</li>
<li><strong>The Pioneer</strong>: You were the founding member of a new group and, by proxy, its leader.</li>
<li><strong>The New Boss</strong>: You are hired to manage an entirely new team.</li>
<li><strong>The Successor</strong>: The previous manager has left, and you are the obvious choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the ‘New Boss’, most of the ways that people become managers are through time under a pre-existing manager, and this is what drives me to believe 99% of managers aren't trained. It's always a role someone grows into.</p>
<p>We are always taking someone who is highly performant or experienced (not necessarily the same thing) in the 'doing' of a role in the tam, what I call the ‘technical’ stuff, and based off some light leadership examples such as leading projects or being a mentor, are deemed fit enough to now run an entire team.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have as much of an issue with this if it weren’t for the fact that once people become managers, they are almost certainly left to fend for themselves and self-teach themselves the job.</p>
<p>It makes absolutely no sense, and no other profession in the world works like this. We don’t promote someone to doctor after seeing some promising medical abilities and hoping they magically teach themselves how to not kill someone.</p>
<p>What flummoxes me even more is that so much risk to the company hinges on how successful managers are at their jobs, and yet companies turn such a blind eye to this problem.</p>
<p>Companies will invest millions of dollars to reduce the amount of variance in risk in finance, security, intellectual property, and other key areas, but not enough goes towards getting all of their managers up to the same level of competence and onto the same page.</p>
<p>They often leave it to the local level, hoping the manager above the new manager mentors them, which just creates a circular problem if that manager themselves isn’t a good mentor (not everyone who can do can teach) or worse, is a bad manager themselves. Not to mention they themselves have been self-taught; what bad habits have they not corrected?</p>
<p>This then leaves HR (or whatever we are calling this department this month) to try and pick up the slack. While I have found HR to be great in a one-on-one capacity, provided they themselves are good at their job, I’ve been witness to multiple roll-outs of ‘one-size-fits-all’ management training days and intranet portal content, and they never meet the mark.</p>
<p>They are often too generic and impersonal, and they are often starting at ground zero, like how to approve leave and manage expense claims. They never get into the nitty gritty or teach anything that can be truly applied in the 'field'.</p>
<p>It’s not enough, and it’s hurting everyone. I generally believe that most managers are barely managing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I generally believe that most managers are barely managing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both in the sense that I do not believe them to be doing enough as a manager for their team and the company, but also in the sense that I can often see them drowning, personally struggling to do their job. Surviving, not thriving.</p>
<p>This series will provide my personal guidance on both how to be a manager and how to do the job of managing people.</p>
<p>I care for both the people you are responsible for. I want them to not quit because of you.</p>
<p>I also care for you, the manager, who has found themselves in such a position of power and responsibility with minimal support.</p>
<p>You do not need to read this entire thing A-Z like a tome, but instead I encourage you to casually work through the core articles (they will be highlighted) and then jump around to any others that catch your interest.</p>
<p>Bookmark this blog, come back to it when a problem arises at work, and find the piece of advice that is applicable to you and figure out how to implement it. Then don't come back until the next time you need it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/12/phoenix-1-7-for-elixir-edit-a-form-in-a-modal.html">https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/09/12/phoenix-1-7-for-elixir-edit-a-form-in-a-modal.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37479323">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In part one of this series, we introduced the <code>CoreComponents</code> that get generated when bootstrapping a new
Phoenix project. In part two, we implemented a create modal.</p>
<p>Now, we will implement
an edit modal.</p>
<p><em>You can continue following along with our <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular">companion repo</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="editing-a-form-in-a-modal">Editing a Form in a Modal</h2>
<p>You will first notice that each item will need a different changeset. We
want to edit each item, so we need to be able to build a changeset from
a different struct each time.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> do this by iterating over all of the items in <code>mount</code>
and rendering a different modal for every row, but this won't work at all. You would have to have
one changeset per assign, which doesn't work when you have a list to add to. It would
also mean a lot more HTML because you'd render the whole modal once per row. It's an all-round bad idea.</p>
<p>Instead, we need a way to build the correct changeset based on the item we click on.
We can do that by using another <code>JS</code> function — <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.JS.html#push/1"><code>push</code></a>.
This will push an event to the backend, along with any attributes that we want to send. If we add an edit button per row, the click action can push an event to the backend
with the <code>pet_id</code> as a param. Then, we can select the pet from the list of assigns and build
a changeset out of it.</p>
<p>First, add the button to the markup. It might be nice to use an icon for this, so let's take
a quick detour to icons.</p>
<h2 id="icons-in-phoenix">Icons in Phoenix</h2>
<p>Phoenix 1.7 ships with a vendored heroicons library and an <code>&lt;.icon&gt;</code> component in <code>CoreComponents</code>.
It works by supplying the name of an icon as a <code>name</code> attr, like so:</p>

<p>The names for the available icons are the filenames contained in the following
path: <code>assets/vendor/heroicons/optimized/20/solid/</code>.
Looking at the files doesn't tell us much about what they look like because we just see svg
markup.</p>
<p>What would be cool is if we could render a dev-only route that displays all icons on one page.
Then when we consider using an icon, we can go to that page and peruse them all at our leisure.</p>
<p>First, let's add the route:</p>

<p>Then, we can make the necessary <code>PetacularWeb.Pages.StoryBookLive</code> module. We'll now write a function that
generates all the icon names from the files in the assets folder, then iterate over them
and create an icon from each one. This will give us a dynamic list of icons to render.</p>
<p>Here are the <code>icon_names</code> (this assumes you will start your server from the project's route):</p>

<p>Then the markup:</p>

<p>There is one more thing to do, though. Tailwind will purge all classes it doesn't see
being used when the app is built. Usually, this is great because it means the bundle size is
smaller, with more lightweight pages. However, here, it is going to bite us. When you
refer to classes dynamically, Tailwind doesn't see those classes being used, so it purges them. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names">Tailwind's docs warn about this</a>.</p>
<p>We need to tell Tailwind <em>not</em> to purge all the icon modules so we can render them. We do that by adding a line of config into <code>tailwind.config.js</code>, like so:</p>

<p>Now, we can head to <code>http://localhost:4000/dev/storybook</code> and see all the icons. See
<a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/commit/91a0ff0e3af688a47864dc030a83b0f705e8f021">this commit</a>
for all of the changes.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-editing-our-form">Back to Editing Our Form</h3>
<p>Okay, now we can select our edit icon and put it on the page.</p>

<p>We will put this in a button and add a <code>phx-click</code> that opens our edit modal for us. All
this can live in the <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/pages/home_live.ex">homepage</a> we used in parts one and two.</p>

<p>We also need to create our <code>Edit</code> modal. This will be similar to our <code>Create</code> modal, but a bit different, so we'll just create a new modal.</p>
<p>We can put this in our <code>~H</code> component just before the other modal:</p>

<p>Now we need to add a changeset to the assigns. Initially, we can put any changeset in mount because when we open the modal, we are going to seed it:</p>

<h2 id="add-the-open_edit_modal-function">Add the <code>open_edit_modal</code> Function</h2>
<p>Now let's implement the <code>open_edit_modal</code> function. This has to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the modal.</li>
<li>Trigger a message to the backend so we can seed the changeset.</li>
</ol>

<p>The handler for this event needs to select the relevant pet from the list of pets and
put that into the changeset:</p>

<p>When we open the modal, the page will re-render the form because the changeset has changed,
and the form will be seeded with the correct data. We can verify this by using
<code>|&gt; IO.inspect(limit: :infinity, label: "")</code> on the form value:</p>

<h3 id="debugging-an-issue-with-the-open_edit_modal">Debugging an Issue with the <code>open_edit_modal</code></h3>
<p>If you open the modal, you will see the correct value printed. But there is a problem — it's
not showing on the page! What on earth could be the issue? This one is a doozy, so I will
save you some hours of debugging.</p>
<p>The function that we use to <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/components/core_components.ex#L591">open our modal</a> has this line, which focuses the first "focussable"
element in the modal:</p>

<p>This is done for accessibility, and so is generally a good idea.</p>
<p>The input happens to be the first focussable thing in our edit form. Phoenix also ensures
that the client is the source of truth for <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/form-bindings.html#javascript-client-specifics">an input's value</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any given input with focus, LiveView will never overwrite the input's current value, even if it deviates from the server's rendered updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what happens in our case? We push an asynchronous message to the backend, which changes an assign (the edit
form), causing a re-render — <code>|&gt; JS.push("open_edit_modal", value: %{pet_id: pet_id})</code>. Then we
open the modal with JavaScript, but because the message to the server is async, the modal
opens <em>before</em> we get a reply. The first focussable element is the input field, so that gets
focus, then the server responds. This would normally re-render the input field, but now won't, because the input has focus!</p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-issue">Fixing the Issue</h3>
<p>We've done everything right, yet are left adrift. What are our options?</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the auto-focus capabilities of the modal.</li>
<li>Have the edit modal focus on something that is not the input first.</li>
<li>Somehow make the form opening synchronous to the server message.</li>
</ol>
<p>I honestly don't know which is better, but let's reason them out. One is easy to do — just <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/components/core_components.ex#L600">remove this line</a>
from the <code>show_modal</code> function — but may have accessibility implications, which makes it a non-starter.</p>
<p>The second option seems reasonable at first. We could maybe set the <code>tabindex</code> on the heading,
but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Keyboard">mdn</a>
recommends the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an element can be focused using the keyboard, then it should be interactive; that is, the user should be able to do something to it and produce a change of some kind (for example, activating a link or changing an option).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's out.</p>
<p>The third option is possible, but requires some ceremony. Instead of opening the modal with JS, you could have the backend trigger a JS event that opens the modal when it's finished
seeding the changeset. That requires adding a handler in JS to listen for the event
and also means that the modal open is slower, because it requires at least one round trip to
the server. For me, that is out as well.</p>
<p>The solution? A secret fourth option — set the value of the field with JS. This means
the field will open quickly, be set to the correct value, and auto-focus.</p>
<p>To support that, we alter our <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/blob/main/lib/petacular_web/pages/home_live.ex#L74"><code>open_edit_modal</code></a>
function to accept the name, then use <code>JS.set_attribute</code> to set the field value.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-update-in-our-phoenix-application">Implementing the Update in Our Phoenix Application</h2>
<p>Now the only thing left to do is implement the <code>edit_pet</code> handler. This is similar to the
create version, where we flash an error and close the modal on success. We first want to
select the pet we are editing, which means we need the pet's id. How can we get that?</p>
<p>The easiest way is to use a hidden input on the form. That way, when the form is submitted, the pet id will also be sent. To do that, we need to add the hidden input:</p>

<p>And set the value when we open the modal:</p>

<p>We will see the id of the pet appear in the params, allowing us to select
the pet we are editing from the assigns:</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Adzz/petacular/commit/364bec4c35c796bcd19f63ccd42ad230c0ed4afc">this commit</a>
for all the relevant changes.</p>
<p>And with that, we are done!</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>This concludes our three-part series in which we took a fresh Phoenix 1.7 application and built a create and edit modal for
it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this gives you some new ideas you can extend and implement for your own apps.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

Almost nine times the mass of Earth, it is, Nasa, says: “a Hycean exoplanet, one which has the potential to possess a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean-covered surface”.</p><p>The space agency said that its observations of the chemical make-up of the planet’s atmosphere suggested the possibility of an ocean world. “The abundance of methane and carbon dioxide, and shortage of ammonia, support the hypothesis that there may be a water ocean underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere in K2-18 b,” it said.</p><p>But the agency also hinted at even more remarkable possibility in the potential finding of a molecule called dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which on Earth is only produced by life.</p><p>“The bulk of the DMS in Earth’s atmosphere is emitted from phytoplankton in marine environments,” the Nasa press release said.</p><p>The presence of DMS, however, is still to be confirmed, and requires further investigation. “Upcoming Webb observations should be able to confirm if DMS is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18 b at significant levels,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, a University of Cambridge astronomer and lead author of the Nasa research.</p><p>It would not be the first time Nasa has found indications of water on other planets. Water vapor was previously discovered on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/#:~:text=Are%20there%20oceans%20on%20planets,in%20a%20five%2Dday%20orbit." data-link-name="in body link">smaller exoplanet, HAT-P-11b</a>, roughly the size of Neptune in the constellation Cygnus, also 120 light years away.</p><p>But scientists are excited by the revelation, even though they caution it does not necessarily mean the planet could support life.</p><p>“Our findings underscore the importance of considering diverse habitable environments in the search for life elsewhere,” said Madhusudhan.</p><p>“Traditionally, the search for life on exoplanets has focused primarily on smaller rocky planets, but the larger Hycean worlds are significantly more conducive to atmospheric observations.”</p><p>Orbiting the cool dwarf star K2-18, the exoplanet, 2.6 times the radius of Earth, lies in what Nasa calls the <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-8c9217a9-bf37-4563-863a-4b60ff8f5576" data-link-name="in body link">habitable zone</a>, a region around a star where planets with liquid water may be present.</p><p>Its interior likely contains a large mantle of high-pressure ice, similar to Neptune, Nasa says, but likely has a thinner hydrogen-rich atmosphere and an ocean surface. Hycean worlds are predicted to have oceans of water, but on K2-18 b it is also possible the ocean is too hot to be habitable.</p><p>The planet’s existence was first discovered by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasas-k2-mission-the-kepler-space-telescopes-second-chance-to-shine" data-link-name="in body link">Nasa’s K2 mission</a> in 2015, but Webb’s improved technology over the earlier telescopes allowed for a more detailed analysis, and revelation it could be an ocean world. Scientists were able to study a tiny fraction of the star’s light as it passed through the exoplanet’s atmosphere.</p><p>“This result was only possible because of the extended wavelength range and unprecedented sensitivity of Webb, which enabled robust detection of spectral features with just two transits,” Madhusudhan said.</p><p>“For comparison, one transit observation with Webb provided comparable precision to eight observations with Hubble conducted over a few years and in a relatively narrow wavelength range.”</p><p>Nasa celebrated the first anniversary of operation of the Webb space telescope in July by releasing an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/12/nasa-releases-image-of-star-forming-region-rho-ophiuchi-james-webb" data-link-name="in body link">“unprecedented” closeup image</a> of the nearest star-forming region to Earth.</p><p>In little more than a year, it has allowed humans to look closer towards the origins of the universe than ever before, and produced high-resolution pictures of far-distant worlds and the mysterious structures that surround them.</p><p>They include the “rare and fleeting” phase of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/mar/15/james-webb-space-telescope-dying-star-nasa" data-link-name="in body link">star on the cusp of death</a>; early galaxies formed just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/18/james-webb-telescope-finds-two-of-the-oldest-and-most-distant-galaxies-ever-seen" data-link-name="in body link">350m years after the big bang</a>; and evidence of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/22/universe-breakers-james-webb-telescope-detects-six-ancient-galaxies" data-link-name="in body link">universe breaker galaxies</a>” far larger than scientists thought possible, with the potential to upend current theories of cosmology.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been using my own domain for email for over 10 years. I am grandfathered into the free version of Google Workspace and have also used Fastmail and ProtonMail.</p>
<p>One of my concerns is that, if I were unable to renew my domain (e.g., in case of death), someone else could register it and start receiving my emails. This is a serious issue because your email account is as good as a password due to most websites using it as a way to reset your password. Can you imagine if someone in the future got a hold of gmail.com?</p>
<p>Another concern is privacy. Using a unique domain name for email stands out, especially when it has your name. I am starting to use iCloud's Hide My Email to change my email address on accounts I have created over the years because of this. I can also change where the emails are forwarded whenever I want to.</p>
<p>Your domain name can be the weakest link to accessing your online accounts. Make sure to take extra steps to protect your information, such as enabling 2FA.</p>
<p>Domain names registered by the more conventional email hosts are not immune to these problems. We need to start assuming email addresses are only temporarily in use by the current user. Or should we implement regulations? I shudder at the thought.</p>

Quiet is an alternative to team chat apps like Slack, Discord, and Element that does not require trusting a central server or running one's own. In Quiet, all data syncs directly between a team's devices over <a href="https://torproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Tor</a> with no server required.
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: Quiet is not audited and should not be used when privacy and security are critical. It lacks basic features and probably won't replace your Slack or Discord yet. That said, it works surprisingly well and we use it daily as a Slack replacement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Quiet is for fans of software freedom, decentralization and privacy tech, and for anyone craving a future where humanity can collaborate effectively online without trusting our communities, networks, and data to giant corporations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Quiet is written (mostly) in TypeScript, with Electron and React Native frontends, and welcomes outside contributions! See: <a href="#contributing-to-quiet">Contributing to Quiet</a></strong></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto">While apps like Slack, Discord, and Signal use central servers, Quiet syncs messages directly between a team's devices, over Tor, with no server required.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each group of people (Quiet calls them "communities") gets their own insular network, so that data from one community never touches the devices of Quiet users in <em>other</em> communities. Not even in encrypted form!</p>
<p dir="auto">Message syncing is taken care of by a project called <a href="https://orbitdb.org/" rel="nofollow">OrbitDB</a>, which works like a mashup of Git, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol" rel="nofollow">gossip protocol</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" rel="nofollow">BitTorrent</a>; it broadcasts new messages, syncs the latest messages, and fetches files. Syncing means that users typically receive all messages sent while they were offline.</p>
<p dir="auto">Invites, access, and usernames are granted by a community owner, i.e. whoever creates the community. The owner hands out an "invitation code" which invitees use to connect to the owner's device, register a username, and get a standard cryptographic certificate so they can prove to other peers they're part of the community.</p>
<p dir="auto">See our <a href="https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/wiki/Quiet-FAQ">FAQ</a> for answers to common questions and a comparison of Quiet with similar apps.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Technical overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a concise technical summary of the main points.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Granting access:</strong> community owners use standard PKI (<a href="https://pkijs.org/" rel="nofollow">PKI.js</a>) to grant access, with each community owner serving as the community's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority" rel="nofollow">certificate authority</a>; this is handled by Quiet and transparent to users.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> a valid signed certificate from the community owner is required to connect to peers, receive connections from peers, and for messages to be visible to other peers.</li>
<li><strong>Networking:</strong> peers connect via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)#Onion_services" rel="nofollow">Tor onion services</a>, exclusively with their fellow community members.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Tor encrypts all data in transit, and a Quiet user's device connects only to the devices of their fellow community members, so all messages are encrypted to recipients.</li>
<li><strong>Syncing:</strong> IPFS and <a href="https://orbitdb.org/" rel="nofollow">OrbitDB</a>, an <a href="https://ipfs.io/" rel="nofollow">IPFS</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type" rel="nofollow">CRDT</a>, ensure that all data (messages, user data, etc) syncs between peers with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00472" rel="nofollow">eventual consistency</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous messaging:</strong> because messages sync to all members, members can communicate without being contemporaneously online, provided that there is "continuous liveness", a continuous chain of online peers who each sync the latest updates, between the sender and the recipient.</li>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> a valid certificate from the community owner on account creation establishes a username, which the owner attests is unique; in future versions, Quiet will warn all members if community owners are caught issuing non-unique usernames, to protect against impersonation by malicious or compromised owners. (See: <a href="https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/issues/119" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/TryQuiet/quiet/issues/119/hovercard">#119</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Invitation:</strong> to invite new members, community owners provide (via some other secure channel) an onion address that points to a registration API which accepts a certificate signing request, responds with a signed certificate, and provides sufficient peer information to connect to other peers; in future versions this onion address will expire. (See: <a href="https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/issues/536" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/TryQuiet/quiet/issues/536/hovercard">#536</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Account recovery:</strong> owners must back up their data (e.g. by copying a folder, or someday with a wallet-style passphrase) and members request new accounts from owners.</li>
<li><strong>User removal:</strong> TBD, but likely a combination of expiring invitation onion addresses, certificate revocation, and message-layer encryption with updated keys.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple device support:</strong> TBD, but most likely based on <a href="https://github.com/local-first-web/auth">local-first-web/auth</a></li>
<li><strong>Mobile push notifications:</strong> barring a major victory for consumer rights, iOS notifications require using a centralized push notification service that connects to Apple, but message data can still be encrypted; in proof-of-concept, Quiet works well as an always-on background app on Android, so Android versions will likely not require a push notification server.</li>
<li><strong>Stack:</strong> Our backend is in Node.js (on iOS/Android we use <a href="https://github.com/nodejs-mobile">nodejs-mobile</a>); we use Electron on desktop and React Native on mobile.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Our Mission</h2>
<p dir="auto">We are building Quiet to sharpen the tools that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society" rel="nofollow">open societies</a> use to hold power accountable. Each year, movements use the Internet to hold power accountable in breathtaking new ways. But the rise of big tech has made the Internet <em>itself</em> seem like <em>yet another</em> unaccountable power. The medium that brought us <em>Occupy</em> Wall Street now looks like regular old Wall Street. We believe this happened because software became too dependent on company-run infrastructure, which undermined the role <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" rel="nofollow">free software</a> has historically played in holding the software industry accountable. Our goal is to fix that.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the 2000s, when key dominant tech products had viable free software competitors that were radically pro-user (products like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" rel="nofollow">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/" rel="nofollow">VLC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HandBrake" rel="nofollow">Handbrake</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" rel="nofollow">Linux</a>) there was a limit to how much big tech could abuse users before users fled.</p>
<p dir="auto">But software for communication and collaboration seemed to require servers, whose cost grew with the software's popularity, so the question "who runs the server?" became a dilemma for free software projects. Should the project itself run the server? What about when costs grew too high? Should users run the server? But only a small niche of hobbyists have servers! Should an organization run the server? If so, then that organization now controls the data and relationships that make the product useful, limiting the freedom to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)#Forking_of_free_and_open-source_software" rel="nofollow">fork</a> and flee that makes free software so accountable and desirable. Reddit, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6xfyfg/an_update_on_the_state_of_the_redditreddit_and/" rel="nofollow">was once free software</a>, but because forking Reddit's <em>code</em> would never have resulted in anything more than an empty website (since all the conversations and relationships that make Reddit what it is sit on <em>company-run servers</em>) Reddit being free software never gave Reddit's users any real power to hold it accountable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)" rel="nofollow">Federation</a> is a proposed solution to this dilemma, but Gmail shows its limits. After all, email is the most well-known federated product, but Google can still build must-have features like spam filtering on the server side, and Gmail controls a user's email address, so exiting Gmail means updating dozens or hundreds of accounts created with that address. Exiting Gmail might be easier than exiting Facebook or Instagram, but no Gmail competitor can make exiting Gmail as easy and delightful an experience as Firefox made exiting Internet Explorer, because Gmail controls infrastructure, where Internet Explorer never did. So while federation does help, we must do better if we want to hold big tech accountable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Regulation is an even weaker proposed solution. Even when regulation works—and a quick look at the media, telecom, energy, or banking industries will illustrate its limits—regulation tends to create a cozy relationship between industry and regulators that makes industries easy targets for government subversion. For example, the highly-regulated telecom industry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order" rel="nofollow">bends</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8jax/researchers-find-powerful-ss7-cellphone-location-surveillance-in-europe-middle-east-australia" rel="nofollow">over</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A" rel="nofollow">backwards</a> every time governments want help carrying out unpopular mass surveillance. Is this what we want from big tech?</p>
<p dir="auto">We're building Quiet because we believe that, for a broad and growing class of software, the best answer to the "who runs the server?" dilemma is "no one." Eliminate the server; in terms of accountability, it is a burden and a weakness. By eliminating servers from software's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface" rel="nofollow">attack surface</a>, software can be more private and secure. By eliminating exponentially growing server costs and the expertise-intensive work of scaling servers, software can be built by smaller teams under less financial pressure to betray users. Most importantly, by eliminating the server operator's control of relationships and data, users will be free to fork and exit, so they will once again have real power to hold software accountable.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're building Quiet to spark a new phase of the free software movement where it is easy and normal to build apps this way. We want to make a private alternative to Slack &amp; Discord that people love, to figure out the best and easiest technical approach along the way, and—by doing all this—to blaze a trail that other free software teams building other products can follow. Once one team (us, we hope!) can build a good alternative to Slack that doesn't use servers, other teams can build alternatives to Google Docs, Figma, Asana, Trello, 1Password, and so on, until someday—and this is technically much more difficult—humanity can build fully-forkable alternatives to things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even more complex applications. Big tech's users will be free to flee, and the Internet can stop being yet another unaccountable power, and keep being the breathtaking medium for holding power accountable that open societies need.</p>
<p dir="auto">Join us, and let's figure this out.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing to Quiet</h2>

Others have mentioned stuff that may eventually make its way upstream, but from what I've seen there's pretty heavy resistance from maintainers whenever (re)writing something in Rust gets brought up.<p>Before Rust starts getting used "for real" in the kernel there's a lot of barriers to overcome.  Most maintainers aren't hugely proficient in Rust and absolutely do not have the time to learn.  Needing yet another toolchain is annoying (especially when you need bits that aren't in stable yet), anything you write in Rust probably won't get built in distro kernels for a long time, and anything you work on today is hugely uncharted territory since it's all so new.</p><p>I think one thing a lot of people don't understand from "outside" the kernel development sphere is that standards for getting stuff upstream are typically pretty high for most subsystems, a lot higher than most open source projects.  There are a lot of open questions about Rust in Linux that don't have clear answers, and Linux <i>really</i> struggles with consensus.  Yes it has a dictator, but that dictator very rarely dictates anything that hugely moves the needle.</p><p>I do think "real" kernel bits written in Rust will get upstream and will get used, but it will be a very slow burn.

So that's about 6 years of Rust in Firefox.</p><p>From a Firefox user's perspective, I can't say that I'm impressed by it.</p><p>Building Firefox from source is more involved than it was before. As you mentioned, additional tooling for Rust is required in such a situation.</p><p>I haven't really noticed any real Firefox feature, functionality, or performance improvements that I could directly attribute to the use of Rust.</p><p>It also doesn't seem like using Rust has allowed the Firefox developers to be significantly more efficient or productive than they were before.</p><p>Maybe an argument could be made that some security issues, for example, have been avoided thanks to Rust, but that's not really provable in any meaningful way.</p><p>After seeing the Firefox situation, my expectations for the use of Rust in the Linux kernel are pretty low.

And how much code is in the latter. I don't think we know the answer yet but some knowledgable people are willing to run the experiment on the basis that the probability seems quite high that a safe subset can be determined.

                  <p><span>I’m just a layman when it comes to these kind of things. But here’s my take anyway: AFAICT, the issue isn’t so much about rewriting the code. However, if we would use automation for that, we would probably need <i>proofs</i> that the new code is better than the old one. And creating suchs proofs seems incredibly hard as soon as we walk out of “hello world” territory. People has spent years on trying to make suchs systems, but it’s still not widely used. So until then, we need people who read and analyze the code, and also have wast knowledge of the kernel’s inner workings, and today that seems to be the bottleneck. Those people doesn’t really grow on trees.</span></p></div></td></tr>

They should have aimed to add things to the QoS layer, qdisc, classifier, whatever, there's tens of those and you can easily add another. Start small.</p><p>The problem really is that the people who want to see Rust in the linux kernel have next to no linux kernel background and have a poor understanding of how Linux works and how things are generally done.</p><p>Also the people who contribute big things to the linux kernel usually have a clear business case behind them and a big company paying them to work on it full time.</p><p>For example I could imagine Microsoft eventually contributing in this regard, say they want some more Hyper-V virtual hardware drivers in Linux and they decided to do that in Rust. They've been lately using Rust in the Windows kernel so it's not that unrealistic to think it may happen.</p><p>A filesystem written in Rust would be cool... but it's probably going to have to be a new one rather than a rewrite, I can't imagine people going through the trouble of rewriting btrfs in Rust. And big names like Facebook could actually back that effort.</p><p>I really love using Rust for middleware things, however right now I can't convince myself to use it on low level things like OSes or microcontrollers since it seems to be a lot of trouble with getting Rust to play nice with FreeRTOS for example, and there seems to be no production ready rtos written in Rust either.

    <h3 id="the-church-of-complexity">The Church of Complexity</h3>

<p>There is a pretty well-known sketch in which an engineer is explaining to the project manager how an overly complicated maze of 
microservices works in order to get a user’s birthday - and fails to do so anyway. The scene accurately describes the 
absurdity of the state of the current tech culture. We laugh, and yet bringing this up in a 
serious conversation is tantamount to professional heresy, rendering you borderline un-hirable.</p>

</p>

<p>How did we get here? How did our aim become not addressing the task at hand but instead setting a pile of 
cash on fire by <strong>solving problems we don’t have</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="the-perfect-storm">The perfect storm</h3>

<p>There are a few things in recent history that may have contributed to the current state of things. First, a whole army of 
developers 
writing Javascript for the browser started self-identifying as 
“full-stack”, diving into server development and asynchronous code. Javascript is Javascript, right? What difference does it make 
what you create using it - user interfaces, servers, games, or embedded systems. <em>Right</em>? 
Node was still kind of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA" target="_blank">learning project of one person</a>, and 
Javascript back then was a deeply problematic choice for server development.
<a href="https://notes.ericjiang.com/posts/751" target="_blank">Pointing this out</a> to still green server-side developers usually 
resulted in a lot of huffing and puffing. This is all they knew, after all. The world outside of Node 
effectively did not exist, the Node way was the only known way, and so this was the genesis of the 
stubborn, dogmatic thinking 
that we deal with to this day.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/theway.webp" aspect="landscape" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<p><strong>And then</strong>, a steady stream of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech" target="_blank">FAANG</a> veterans started merging into the river of startups, 
mentoring the newly-minted and highly impressionable young Javascript server-side engineers. The apostles of the Church of Complexity would 
assertively claim that “how they did things over at Google” was unquestionable and correct - even if it made no sense under 
current context and size. What 
do you <em>mean</em> you don’t have a separate <em>User Preferences Service</em>? That just <em>will not scale, bro!</em></p>

<p>But, it’s easy to blame the veterans and the newcomers for all of this. What else was happening? Oh yeah - easy money.</p>

<p>What do you do when you are flush with venture capital? You don’t 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzAdXyPYKQo?si=3lOVi1rhtaPC-nv4" target="_blank">go for revenue</a>, surely! On more than one 
occasion I received an email from management, asking everyone to be in the office, tidy up their desks and look busy, as a 
clouder of Patagonia vests was about to be paraded through the office. Investors needed to see explosive growth, but not in 
profitability, 
no. They just needed to see how quickly the company could hire ultra-expensive software engineers to do … <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>And now that you have these developers, what do you do with them? Well, they could build a simpler system that is easier to 
grow and
maintain, or they could conjure up a monstrous constellation of “microservices” that no one really 
understands. Microservices 
- the new way of writing scalable software! Are we just going to pretend that the concept of “distributed systems” never existed?
(Let’s skip the whole parsing of the nuances that microservices are not real distributed systems).</p>

<p>Back in the days when the tech industry was not such a bloated farce, distributed systems were respected, feared, and generally 
avoided - reserved only as the weapon of last resort for particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system 
becomes more challenging and time-consuming - development, debugging, deployment, testing, resilience. But I don’t know - maybe 
it’s all 
super easy now because 
<em>toooollling</em>.</p>

<p>There is no standard tooling for microservices-based development - there is no common 
framework. Working on distributed systems has gotten only marginally easier in 2020s. The Dockers and the 
Kuberneteses of the world did not magically take away the inherent complexity of a distributed setup.</p>

<p>I love referring to this
<a href="https://kenkantzer.com/learnings-from-5-years-of-tech-startup-code-audits/" target="_blank">summary of 5 years of startup audits</a>, 
as it is packed with common-sense conclusions based on hard evidence (and paid insights):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to
engineering. Cleverness for cleverness sake was abhorred. On the flip side, the companies where we were like ”woah,
these folks are smart as hell” for the most part kind of faded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally - “complexity kills”.</p>

<p>The 
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mt/podcast/lessons-from-5-years-of-startup-code-audits/id341623264?i=1000567623452" target="_blank">audit</a>
revealed an interesting pattern, where many startups experienced a sort of collective imposter syndrome while building 
straight-forward, simple,
performant systems. There is a dogma attached to not starting out with microservices on day one - 
no matter the problem. “Everyone is doing microservices, yet we have a single Django monolith maintained by just a few engineers, 
and a MySQL instance - what are we doing wrong?”. The answer is almost always “nothing”.</p>

<p>Likewise, it’s common for seasoned engineers to experience 
hesitation and inadequacy in today’s tech world, and the good news is 
that, 
no - it’s probably not you. It’s common for teams to pretend like they are doing “webs cale”, hiding behind libraries, ORMs, and 
cache - 
confident in their expertise (they crushed that Leetcode!), yet they may not even be
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f46f5a/comment/fhp26k8/?context=3" target="_blank">aware of database indexing basics</a>. 
You are operating in a sea of unjustified overconfidence, waste, and Dunning-Kruger, so who is really the imposter here?</p>

<h3 id="there-is-nothing-wrong-with-a-monolith">There is nothing wrong with a monolith</h3>

<p>The idea that you cannot grow without a system that looks like the infamous diagram of Afghanistan war 
strategy is largely a myth.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/af.png" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Stack Overflow - these companies and others started out as monolithic 
code bases. Many have a monolith at their core to this day. Stack Overflow makes it a 
<a href="https://stackexchange.com/performance" target="_blank">point of pride</a> how little hardware they need to run the massive site. 
Shopify is still a <a href="https://blog.quastor.org/p/shopify-ensures-consistent-reads">Rails monolith</a>, leveraging the tried and true 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/1597983928018948096" target="_blank">Resque</a> to proces billions of tasks.</p>

<p>WhatsApp went supernova with their 
<a href="https://blog.quastor.org/p/whatsapp-scaled-1-billion-users-50-engineers" target="_blank">Erlang monolith and 50 engineers</a>.
How?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WhatsApp consciously keeps the engineering staff small to only about 50 engineers.</p>

  <p>Individual engineering teams are also small, consisting of 1 - 3 engineers and teams are each given a great deal of autonomy.</p>

  <p>In terms of servers, WhatsApp prefers to use a smaller number of servers and vertically scale each server to the highest 
extent possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instagram was acquired for billions - with a crew of 12.</p>

<p>And do you imagine Threads as an effort involving a whole Meta campus? Nope. They followed the
<a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/static-analysis-at-scale-an-instagram-story-8f498ab71a0c" target="_blank">Instagram model</a>, 
and this is the entire Threads team:</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/threads-team.webp" aspect="landscape"></photo-element>

<p>Perhaps claiming that <em>your</em> particular problem domain requires a massively complicated distributed system and an open office 
stuffed 
to the gills with turbo-geniuses is just crossing over into 
arrogance rather than brilliance?</p>

<h3 id="dont-solve-problems-you-dont-have">Don’t solve problems you don’t have</h3>

<p>It’s a simple question - what problem are you solving? Is it scale? How do you know how to break it all up for scale and performance? 
Do you have enough data to show what needs to be a separate service and why? Distributed systems are built for size and 
resilience. Can your system scale and be resilient at the same time? What happens if one of the services goes down or comes to a crawl? 
Just scale it up, yes? What about the <em>other</em> services that will get flooded with load? Did you war-game the endless permutations 
of things that can and will go wrong? Is there back pressure? Circuit breakers? Queues? Jitter? Sensible timeouts on every 
endpoint? Are there fool-proof guards to make sure a simple change does not bring everything down? 
The knobs you need to be aware of and tune are endless, and they are all specific to your system’s particular signature of 
usage and traffic.</p>

<p>The truth is that most companies will never reach the massive size that will actually require building a true distribute 
system. Your cos playing Amazon and Google - without 
their scale, expertise, and endless resources - is very likely just an egregious waste of money and time.</p>

<p><em>The only thing harder than a distributed system is a BAD distributed system</em>.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter3.png" aspect="landscape" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<h3 id="but-each-teambut-separate-but-api">“But each team…but separate… but API”</h3>

<p>Trying to shove a distributed topology into your company’s structure is a noble effort, but it almost always backfires. It’s a 
common approach 
to break up a problem into smaller pieces and then solve those one by one. So, the thinking goes, if you break up one service 
into multiple ones, everything becomes easier, right?</p>

<p>The theory is sweet and elegant - each microservice is being maintained rigorously by a dedicated team, 
walled off behind a beautiful, backward-compatible, versioned API. In fact, this is all so steely that you rarely even have to 
communicate with that team - as if the microservice was maintained by a 3rd party vendor. It’s <em>simple</em>!</p>

<p>If that doesn’t sound familiar, that’s because this rarely happens. In reality, our Slack channels are <em>flooded</em> with 
messages from teams communicating about releases, bugs, configuration updates, breaking changes, and PSAs. Everyone 
needs to be on top of everything, all the time. And if that wasn’t great, it’s normal for one 
already-slammed team to half-ass multiple 
microservices instead of doing a great job on a single one, often changing ownership as people come and go.</p>

<p>In order to win the race, we don’t build <em>one</em> good race car - we build a fleet of shitty golf carts.</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/twitter2.png" aspect="landscape" alt="Performance"></photo-element>

<h3 id="what-you-lose">What you lose</h3>

<p>There are multiple pitfalls to building with microservices, and often that minefield is either not fully appreciated or simply 
ignored. Teams spend months writing highly customized tooling and learning lessons not 
related at all to the core product. Here are just some often overlooked aspects…</p>

<h4 id="say-goodbye-to-dry">Say goodbye to DRY</h4>

<p>After decades of teaching developers to write Don’t Repeat Yourself code, it seems we just stopped talking about it altogether.
Microservices by default are not DRY, with every service stuffed with redundant boilerplate. Very often the overhead of such 
“plumbing” is so heavy, and the size of the microservices is so small, that the average instance of a service has more “service” 
than 
“product”. So what about the common code that <em>can</em> be factored out?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a common library?</li>
  <li>How does the common library get updated? Keep different versions everywhere?</li>
  <li>Force updates regularly, creating dozens of pull requests across all repositories?</li>
  <li>Keep it all in a monorepo? That comes with its <em>own</em> set of problems.</li>
  <li>Allow for some code duplication?</li>
  <li>Forget it, each team gets to reinvent the wheel every time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each company going this route faces these choices, and there are no good “ergonomic” options - you <em>have</em> to 
choose your version of the pain.</p>

<h4 id="developer-ergonomics-will-crater">Developer ergonomics will crater</h4>

<p>“Developer ergonomics” is the friction, the amount of effort a developer
must go through in order to get something done, be it working on a new feature or resolving a bug.</p>

<p>With microservices, an engineer has to have a mental map of the entire system in order to know what services  to bring up for any 
particular task, what teams to talk to, whom to talk to, and what about. The “you have to know everything before 
doing anything” 
principle. How 
do you keep on top of it? Spotify, a 
multi-billion dollar company, spent probably not negligible internal resources to build 
<a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Backstage</a>, software for cataloging its endless systems and services.</p>

<p>This should at least give you a clue that this game is not for everyone, and the price of the ride is <em>high</em>. So what about 
the <em>tooooling</em>? The Not Spotifies of the world are left with McGivering their own solutions, robustness and portability of 
which you can probably guess.</p>

<p>And how many teams actually streamline the process of starting a <em>YASS</em> - “yet another stupid service”? 
This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developer privileges in GitHub/GitLab</li>
  <li>Default environment variables and configuration</li>
  <li>CI/CD</li>
  <li>Code quality checkers</li>
  <li>Code review settings</li>
  <li>Branch rules and protections</li>
  <li>Monitoring and observability</li>
  <li>Test harness</li>
  <li>Infrastructure-as-code</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, multiply this list by the number of programming languages used throughout the company. Maybe you have a 
usable 
template or a runbook? Maybe a frictionless, one-click system to 
launch a new service from scratch? It takes months to iron out all the kinks with this kind of automation. So, you can either 
work on your product, or you can be working on <em>toooooling</em>.</p>

<h4 id="integration-tests---lol">Integration tests - LOL</h4>

<p>As if the everyday microservices grind was not enough, you also forfeit the peace of mind offered by solid integration tests. 
Your single-service and unit tests are passing, but are your critical paths still intact after 
each commit? Who is in charge of the overall integration test suite, in Postman or wherever else? Is there one?</p>

<photo-element source="complexity/unit.gif" aspect="original-size" alt="Service tests"></photo-element>

<p>Integration testing a distributed setup is a nearly-impossible problem, so we pretty much gave up on that and replaced it with 
another one - Observability. Just like “microservices” are the new “distributed systems”, “observability” is the new 
“debugging in production”. Surely, you are not writing real software if you are not doing…. observability!</p>

<p>Observability has become its own sector, and you will pay in both pretty penny and in developer 
time for it. It doesn’t come as plug-and-pay either - you need to understand and implement canary releases, feature flags, etc. 
Who is doing that? One already 
<a href="https://renegadeotter.com/2023/07/26/i-am-not-your-cloud-person.html">overwhelmed</a> engineer?</p>

<p>As you can see, breaking up your problem does not make solving it easier - all you get is another set of <em>even 
harder problems</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-just-services">What about just “services”?</h3>

<p>Why do your services need to be “micro”? What’s wrong with
<a href="https://leeatchison.com/app-architectures/moving-beyond-microservices-hype/" target="_blank">just services</a>? Some
startups have gone as far as create <em>a service for
each function</em>, and yes, “isn’t that just like Lambda” is a valid question. This

<a href="https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first" target="_blank">Starting with a monolith</a>
is one obvious choice. A pattern that could also  work in many instances is “trunk &amp; 
branches”, where the main “meat and potatoes” monolith is helped by “branch” services. A branch service can be a service that 
takes care of a clearly-identifiable and
separately-scalable load. A CPU-hungry <em>Image-Resizing Service</em> makes way more sense than a <em>User Registration Service</em>. Or do you
get so many registrations per second that it requires independent horizontal scaling?</p>

But most notably the famous Kefrens Bars effect does not display - the screen just goes blank.&nbsp; What's going wrong on the Book8088 vs a real IBM PC 5150?</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@davidly_33504/the-book-8088-is-too-fast-c0a2f01a1cc8" target="_blank">As others have noted</a>, even with an 8088 swap, there's something a little fishy going on.</p><h2>DRAM Refresh DMA</h2><p>The original IBM PC used DRAM - 'dynamic' memory that had to be periodically refreshed, or it would lose charge and subsequently its memory contents. IBM was trying to keep the costs of the IBM PC down, so decided to utilize some of the accessory chips that the PC had to perform the task of DRAM refresh rather than add dedicated circuitry to handle it. Therefore one of three channels of the system's timer chip and one of four channels of the system's DMA controller are dedicated solely to the task of refreshing memory.&nbsp;</p><p>By default, every 72 CPU cycles, the timer chip counts down to 0 and sends an output pulse to the DMA controller, triggering a DMA request which eventually pulls the READY line to the CPU low, potentially stalling the CPU if it is in the middle of a bus transaction. During this time certain address lines are strobed, which is all that is needed to refresh the memory cells.</p><p>This has a variable impact on system performance. If the CPU is primarily performing long, arithmetic instructions such as division or multiplication, it won't really slow things down at all. If the CPU is instead copying memory with a string instruction, or executing a sequence of very short instructions&nbsp; requiring rapid fetching, then the impact can be quite substantial.&nbsp; Averaged out, the 8088 CPU in the IBM PC is about 5% slower than it otherwise would be without DRAM refresh.</p><p>If you're curious to know more about how DMA works on the IBM PC, I wrote a <a href="https://martypc.blogspot.com/2023/05/exploring-dma-on-ibm-pc.html" target="_blank">previous article on it</a>.</p><p>The Book8088 and many modern hobby PC clones like it usually forgo DRAM and its complications and instead use SRAM chips. The S stands for Static, and like the name suggests it does not require refreshing. Therefore we don't need to have this process going on at all, so we don't need to have timer channel #1 ticking away and we don't need DMA channel #0 configured for DRAM refresh, and our CPU can run 5% faster. Isn't that just a bonus?</p><p>Well, yes and no. When talking about compatibility with the original IBM PC, there were several software titles that made assumptions about the exact speed of the 8088 CPU, and they made those assumptions with the DRAM refresh performance impact baked-in. If we don't simulate DRAM refresh, we open ourselves up to compatibility issues.</p><p>The Kefrens effect in the 8088MPH demo is a good example. It is a perfectly cycle-counted effect. This effect does not tightly poll the CGA status register to determine when the CGA card is in hblank or vblank, or really where it is on the screen at all. It does not set up a normal screen resolution - instead, it draws a scanline at a time, 'racing the beam'. This is possible due to the fact that the CGA clock is an exact multiple of the CPU clock, so that a single CPU cycle equates to 3 pixels or 'hdots' on screen. Knowing that a single scanline takes 912 hdots to display means if we execute an effect somehow utilizing exactly 304 CPU cycles per scanline, that effect will run in perfect synchronization with the CGA card. And so that's exactly what the Kefrens effect does - it's some impressive coding.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimrhVOWMuCJZzaX5gLtvs-K7mybXE9YXpMZ5_BYG9sNgFeLLjw5pR_Yckxgdy-vfLzbsHLObw2_06bTn50GQri-yJ250FNnBEB3WSiU_2x-1M4xUhxJzTr0KGeSty4udEsyvrPL-0fzdcrV-lPSGCUxuIw8pQhEolIyqa-4WAZjR_94lgqp8-BllKI8zmV/s658/kefrens_02.png"><img data-original-height="547" data-original-width="658" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimrhVOWMuCJZzaX5gLtvs-K7mybXE9YXpMZ5_BYG9sNgFeLLjw5pR_Yckxgdy-vfLzbsHLObw2_06bTn50GQri-yJ250FNnBEB3WSiU_2x-1M4xUhxJzTr0KGeSty4udEsyvrPL-0fzdcrV-lPSGCUxuIw8pQhEolIyqa-4WAZjR_94lgqp8-BllKI8zmV/s16000/kefrens_02.png"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Kefrens Bars in 8088MPH - it looks better in motion!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The reason that this effect does not work on a stock Book8088 is that the painstaking cycle counting done for the effect takes into account the wait state cycles incurred by DRAM refresh DMA on the IBM PC.</p><p>Since the Book8088 isn't doing DRAM refresh, the corresponding wait states don't occur, the effect runs too fast, and quickly is out of sync with the CGA card. Vsync signals happen at the wrong times, and I imagine the LCD controller on the Book8088 gets very upset and refuses to display an image at all.</p><h2>Can we just turn DMA on?</h2><p>It would be nice if we could just program the timer channel #1 to the appropriate value, and set up DMA channel #0 like the BIOS does, and then DRAM refresh would operate as it does on the IBM PC, just harmlessly addressing the system's SRAM but making our 8088 CPU operate at the correct speed.</p><p>We can write a short assembly program that attempts to do just that, and assemble it to 'startdma.com':</p>

Be sure to check there is no connectivity between adjacent pins - the stranded wires can splay out and potentially short.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3yq9pM-fvtCa6mBoJowWsO91kZ-U-J3YT5SQR4PAZkooyfuTGcVM9a3eQJKPlwK-CDq678gtF28o5rjULzEwrAqjHsSMtffG-qZ6QVqbrGTl8IdoQ0oPEyuWMf6CnYYiMS4RL_NjltLhniWUOKo97n5kc3wbljC353GYw4awyto6ZA6EUxEtFlFk1jzlH/s1575/dmac_wires01.JPG"><img data-original-height="1160" data-original-width="1575" height="295" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3yq9pM-fvtCa6mBoJowWsO91kZ-U-J3YT5SQR4PAZkooyfuTGcVM9a3eQJKPlwK-CDq678gtF28o5rjULzEwrAqjHsSMtffG-qZ6QVqbrGTl8IdoQ0oPEyuWMf6CnYYiMS4RL_NjltLhniWUOKo97n5kc3wbljC353GYw4awyto6ZA6EUxEtFlFk1jzlH/w400-h295/dmac_wires01.JPG" width="400"></a></p><p>DREQ0 will go over to the timer chip, but it can't connect to the output of timer channel #1 directly.&nbsp; The timer is driven in Rate Generator mode, which stays high most of the time, dropping low on a 1 count for one tick.&nbsp; DREQ0 is level-triggered; if directly connected, DRAM refresh DMA would run constantly, and our PC would be much slower than intended.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdLHZyNdc308_1Mj5wmXKFtBvTF2Kfls2S2r2OQsgxkRutENe7DCfYeiEto2ciKm59oYIuPyp0aALTK5ywY_capRquzNPgyZjdc7FrEwQZTGzXpmgy2ydNZyJ511XZrb6izyJdtASx7qfiI-uYGhI5PP24dqqie_rZt64K_mxqLnWk5Wq0m5A9WD0EcpPk/s779/dma_circuit02.PNG"><img data-original-height="266" data-original-width="779" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdLHZyNdc308_1Mj5wmXKFtBvTF2Kfls2S2r2OQsgxkRutENe7DCfYeiEto2ciKm59oYIuPyp0aALTK5ywY_capRquzNPgyZjdc7FrEwQZTGzXpmgy2ydNZyJ511XZrb6izyJdtASx7qfiI-uYGhI5PP24dqqie_rZt64K_mxqLnWk5Wq0m5A9WD0EcpPk/s16000/dma_circuit02.PNG"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The IBM 5150 DREQ0 logic circuit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Instead, DREQ0 is driven by the output of a 74LS74 flip-flop, which is clocked by the channel #1 output.

<p><strong>Caddy is the first and only web server to use HTTPS automatically <em>and by default</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Automatic HTTPS provisions TLS certificates for all your sites and keeps them renewed. It also redirects HTTP to HTTPS for you! Caddy uses safe and modern defaults -- no downtime, extra configuration, or separate tooling is required.</p>

<p>Here's a 28-second video showing how it works:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nk4EWHvvZtI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<li><a href="#storage">Storage</a></li>
<li><a href="#wildcard-certificates">Wildcard certificates</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>By default, Caddy serves all sites over HTTPS.</strong></p>

<p>Caddy keeps all managed certificates renewed and redirects HTTP (default port <code>80</code>) to HTTPS (default port <code>443</code>) automatically.</p>
<p><strong>For local HTTPS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Caddy may prompt for a password to install its unique root certificate into your trust store. This happens only once per root; and you can remove it at any time.</li>
<li>Any client accessing the site without trusting Caddy's root CA certificate will show security errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For public domain names:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If your domain's A/AAAA records point to your server,</li>
<li>ports <code>80</code> and <code>443</code> are open externally,</li>
<li>Caddy can bind to those ports (<em>or</em> those ports are forwarded to Caddy),</li>
<li>your <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#data-directory">data directory</a> is writeable and persistent,</li>
<li>and your domain name appears somewhere relevant in the config,</li>
</ul>
<p>then sites will be served over HTTPS automatically. You won't have to do anything else about it. It just works!</p>
<p>Because HTTPS utilizes a shared, public infrastructure, you as the server admin should understand the rest of the information on this page so that you can avoid unnecessary problems, troubleshoot them when they occur, and properly configure advanced deployments.</p>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Caddy implicitly activates automatic HTTPS when it knows a domain name (i.e. hostname) or IP address it is serving. There are various ways to tell Caddy your domain/IP, depending on how you run or configure Caddy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses">site address</a> in the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile">Caddyfile</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/routes/match/host/">host matcher</a> in a <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#servers/routes">JSON route</a></li>
<li>Command line flags like <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-file-server">--domain</a> or <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-reverse-proxy">--from</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/certificates/automate/">automate</a> certificate loader</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the following will prevent automatic HTTPS from being activated, either in whole or in part:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicitly disabling it <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/">via JSON</a> or <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#auto-https">via Caddyfile</a></li>
<li>Not providing any hostnames or IP addresses in the config</li>
<li>Listening exclusively on the HTTP port</li>
<li>Prefixing the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses">site address</a> with <code>http://</code> in the Caddyfile</li>
<li>Manually loading certificates (unless <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/ignore_loaded_certificates/"><code>ignore_loaded_certificates</code></a> is set)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special cases:</strong></p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>When automatic HTTPS is activated, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificates are obtained and renewed for <a href="#hostname-requirements">all domain names</a></li>
<li>The default port (if any) is changed to the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#https_port">HTTPS port</a> <code>443</code></li>
<li>HTTP is redirected to HTTPS (this uses <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#http_port">HTTP port</a> <code>80</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic HTTPS never overrides explicit configuration.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/automatic_https/">customize or disable automatic HTTPS</a> if necessary; for example, you can skip certain domain names or disable redirects (for Caddyfile, do this with <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options">global options</a>).</p>
<h2 id="hostname-requirements">Hostname requirements</h2>
<p>All hostnames (domain names) qualify for fully-managed certificates if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>are non-empty</li>
<li>consist only of alphanumerics, hyphens, dots, and wildcard (<code>*</code>)</li>
<li>do not start or end with a dot (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5">RFC 1034</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, hostnames qualify for publicly-trusted certificates if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>are not localhost (including <code>.localhost</code> and <code>.local</code> TLDs)</li>
<li>are not an IP address</li>
<li>have only a single wildcard <code>*</code> as the left-most label</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="local-https">Local HTTPS</h2>
<p>Caddy uses HTTPS automatically for all sites with a host (domain, IP, or hostname) specified, including internal and local hosts. Some hosts are either not public (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1</code>, <code>localhost</code>) or do not generally qualify for publicly-trusted certificates (e.g. IP addresses -- you can get certificates for them, but only from some CAs). These are still served over HTTPS unless disabled.</p>
<p>To serve non-public sites over HTTPS, Caddy generates its own certificate authority (CA) and uses it to sign certificates. The trust chain consists of a root and intermediate certificate. Leaf certificates are signed by the intermediate. They are stored in <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#data-directory">Caddy's data directory</a> at <code>pki/authorities/local</code>.</p>
<p>Caddy's local CA is powered by <a href="https://smallstep.com/certificates/">Smallstep libraries <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>.</p>
<p>Local HTTPS does not use ACME nor does it perform any DNS validation. It works only on the local machine and is trusted only where the CA's root certificate is installed.</p>
<h3 id="ca-root">CA Root</h3>
<p>The root's private key is uniquely generated using a cryptographically-secure pseudorandom source and persisted to storage with limited permissions. It is loaded into memory only to perform signing tasks, after which it leaves scope to be garbage-collected.</p>
<p>Although Caddy can be configured to sign with the root directly (to support non-compliant clients), this is disabled by default, and the root key is only used to sign intermediates.</p>
<p>The first time a root key is used, Caddy will try to install it into the system's local trust store(s). If it does not have permission to do so, it will prompt for a password. This behavior can be disabled in the configuration if it is not desired. If this fails due to being run as an unprivileged user, you may run <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-trust"><code>caddy trust</code></a> to retry installation as a privileged user.</p>

<p>After Caddy's root CA is installed, you will see it in your local trust store as "Caddy Local Authority" (unless you've configured a different name). You can uninstall it any time if you wish (the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-untrust"><code>caddy untrust</code></a> command makes this easy).</p>
<p>Note that automatically installing the certificate into the local trust stores is for convenience only and isn't guaranteed to work, especially if containers are being used or if Caddy is being run as an unprivileged system service. Ultimately, if you are relying on internal PKI, it is the system administrator's responsibility to ensure Caddy's root CA is properly added to the necessary trust stores (this is outside the scope of the web server).</p>
<h3 id="ca-intermediates">CA Intermediates</h3>
<p>An intermediate certificate and key will also be generated, which will be used for signing leaf (individual site) certificates.</p>
<p>Unlike the root certificate, intermediate certificates have a much shorter lifetime and will automatically be renewed as needed.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>To test or experiment with your Caddy configuration, make sure you <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.issuance.acme#ca">change the ACME endpoint</a> to a staging or development URL, otherwise you are likely to hit rate limits which can block your access to HTTPS for up to a week, depending on which rate limit you hit.</p>
<p>One of Caddy's default CAs is <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>, which has a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/">staging endpoint <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> that is not subject to the same <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/">rate limits <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>:</p>

<h2 id="acme-challenges">ACME challenges</h2>
<p>Obtaining a publicly-trusted TLS certificate requires validation from a publicly-trusted, third-party authority. These days, this validation process is automated with the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME protocol <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>, and can be performed one of three ways ("challenge types"), described below.</p>
<p>The first two challenge types are enabled by default. If multiple challenges are enabled, Caddy chooses one at random to avoid accidental dependence on a particular challenge. Over time, it learns which challenge type is most successful and will begin to prefer it first, but will fall back to other available challenge types if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="http-challenge">HTTP challenge</h3>
<p>The HTTP challenge performs an authoritative DNS lookup for the candidate hostname's A/AAAA record, then requests a temporary cryptographic resource over port <code>80</code> using HTTP. If the CA sees the expected resource, a certificate is issued.</p>
<p>This challenge requires port <code>80</code> to be externally accessible. If Caddy cannot listen on port 80, packets from port <code>80</code> must be forwarded to Caddy's <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/http_port/">HTTP port</a>.</p>
<p>This challenge is enabled by default and does not require explicit configuration.</p>
<h3 id="tls-alpn-challenge">TLS-ALPN challenge</h3>
<p>The TLS-ALPN challenge performs an authoritative DNS lookup for the candidate hostname's A/AAAA record, then requests a temporary cryptographic resource over port <code>443</code> using a TLS handshake containing special ServerName and ALPN values. If the CA sees the expected resource, a certificate is issued.</p>
<p>This challenge requires port <code>443</code> to be externally accessible. If Caddy cannot listen on port 443, packets from port <code>443</code> must be forwarded to Caddy's <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/https_port/">HTTPS port</a>.</p>
<p>This challenge is enabled by default and does not require explicit configuration.</p>
<h3 id="dns-challenge">DNS challenge</h3>
<p>The DNS challenge performs an authoritative DNS lookup for the candidate hostname's <code>TXT</code> records, and looks for a special <code>TXT</code> record with a certain value. If the CA sees the expected value, a certificate is issued.</p>
<p>This challenge does not require any open ports, and the server requesting a certificate does not need to be externally accessible. However, the DNS challenge requires configuration. Caddy needs to know the credentials to access your domain's DNS provider so it can set (and clear) the special <code>TXT</code> records. If the DNS challenge is enabled, other challenges are disabled by default.</p>
<p>Since ACME CAs follow DNS standards when looking up <code>TXT</code> records for challenge verification, you can use CNAME records to delegate answering the challenge to other DNS zones. This can be used to delegate the <code>_acme-challenge</code> subdomain to another zone. This is particularly useful if your DNS provider doesn't provide an API, or isn't supported by one of the DNS plugins for Caddy.</p>
<p>DNS provider support is a community effort. <a href="https://caddy.community/t/how-to-use-dns-provider-modules-in-caddy-2/8148">Learn how to enable the DNS challenge for your provider at our wiki.</a></p>
<h2 id="on-demand-tls">On-Demand TLS</h2>
<p>Caddy pioneered a new technology we call <strong>On-Demand TLS</strong>, which dynamically obtains a new certificate during the first TLS handshake that requires it, rather than at config load. Crucially, this does <strong>not</strong> require hard-coding the domain names in your configuration ahead of time.</p>
<p>Many businesses rely on this unique feature to scale their TLS deployments at lower cost and without operational headaches when serving tens of thousands of sites.</p>
<p>On-demand TLS is useful if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you do not know all the domain names when you start or reload your server,</li>
<li>domain names might not be properly configured right away (DNS records not yet set),</li>
<li>you are not in control of the domain names (e.g. they are customer domains).</li>
</ul>
<p>When on-demand TLS is enabled, you do not need to specify the domain names in your config in order to get certificates for them. Instead, when a TLS handshake is received for a server name (SNI) that Caddy does not yet have a certificate for, the handshake is held while Caddy obtains a certificate to use to complete the handshake. The delay is usually only a few seconds, and only that initial handshake is slow. All future handshakes are fast because certificates are cached and reused, and renewals happen in the background. Future handshakes may trigger maintenance for the certificate to keep it renewed, but this maintenance happens in the background if the certificate hasn't expired yet.</p>
<h3 id="using-on-demand-tls">Using On-Demand TLS</h3>
<p><strong>On-demand TLS must be both enabled and restricted to prevent abuse.</strong></p>
<p>Enabling on-demand TLS happens in <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/policies/">TLS automation policies</a> if using the JSON config, or <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls">in site blocks with the <code>tls</code> directive</a> if using the Caddyfile.</p>
<p>To prevent abuse of this feature, you must configure restrictions. This is done in the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/on_demand/"><code>automation</code> object of the JSON config</a>, or the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#on-demand-tls"><code>on_demand_tls</code> global option</a> of the Caddyfile. Restrictions are "global" and aren't configurable per-site or per-domain. The primary restriction is an "ask" endpoint to which Caddy will send an HTTP request to ask if it has permission to obtain and manage a certificate for the domain in the handshake. This means you will need some internal backend that can, for example, query the accounts table of your database and see if a customer has signed up with that domain name.</p>
<p>Be mindful of how quickly your CA is able to issue certificates. If it takes more than a few seconds, this will negatively impact the user experience (for the first client only).</p>
<p>Due to its deferred nature and the extra configuration required to prevent abuse, we recommend enabling on-demand TLS only when your actual use case is described above.</p>
<p><a href="https://caddy.community/t/serving-tens-of-thousands-of-domains-over-https-with-caddy/11179">See our wiki article for more information about using on-demand TLS effectively.</a></p>
<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>
<p>Caddy does its best to continue if errors occur with certificate management.</p>
<p>By default, certificate management is performed in the background. This means it will not block startup or slow down your sites. However, it also means that the server will be running even before all certificates are available. Running in the background allows Caddy to retry with exponential backoff over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Here's what happens if there's an error obtaining or renewing a certificate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Caddy retries once after a brief pause just in case it was a fluke</li>
<li>Caddy pauses briefly, then switches to the next enabled challenge type</li>
<li>After all enabled challenge types have been tried, <a href="#issuer-fallback">it tries the next configured issuer</a>
<ul>
<li>Let's Encrypt</li>
<li>ZeroSSL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After all issuers have been tried, it backs off exponentially
<ul>
<li>Maximum of 1 day between attempts</li>
<li>For up to 30 days</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>During retries with Let's Encrypt, Caddy switches to their <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/">staging environment <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> to avoid rate limit concerns. This isn't a perfect strategy, but in general it's helpful.</p>
<p>ACME challenges take at least a few seconds, and internal rate limiting helps mitigate accidental abuse. Caddy uses internal rate limiting in addition to what you or the CA configure so that you can hand Caddy a platter with a million domain names and it will gradually -- but as fast as it can -- obtain certificates for all of them. Caddy's internal rate limit is currently 10 attempts per ACME account per 10 seconds.</p>
<p>To avoid leaking resources, Caddy aborts in-flight tasks (including ACME transactions) when config is changed. While Caddy is capable of handling frequent config reloads, be mindful of operational considerations such as this, and consider batching config changes to reduce reloads and give Caddy a chance to actually finish obtaining certificates in the background.</p>
<h3 id="issuer-fallback">Issuer fallback</h3>
<p>Caddy is the first (and so far only) server to support fully-redundant, automatic failover to other CAs in the event it cannot successfully get a certificate.</p>
<p>By default, Caddy enables two ACME-compatible CAs: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a> and <a href="https://zerossl.com/"><strong>ZeroSSL</strong> <img src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/external-link.svg"></a>. If Caddy cannot get a certificate from Let's Encrypt, it will try with ZeroSSL; if both fail, it will backoff and retry again later. In your config, you can customize which issuers Caddy uses to obtain certificates, either universally or for specific names.</p>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>Caddy will store public certificates, private keys, and other assets in its <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/storage/">configured storage facility</a> (or the default one, if not configured -- see link for details).</p>
<p><strong>The main thing you need to know using the default config is that the <code>$HOME</code> folder must be writeable and persistent.</strong> To help you troubleshoot, Caddy prints its environment variables at startup if the <code>--environ</code> flag is specified.</p>
<p>Any Caddy instances that are configured to use the same storage will automatically share those resources and coordinate certificate management as a cluster.</p>
<p>Before attempting any ACME transactions, Caddy will test the configured storage to ensure it is writeable and has sufficient capacity. This helps reduce unnecessary lock contention.</p>
<h2 id="wildcard-certificates">Wildcard certificates</h2>
<p>Caddy can obtain and manage wildcard certificates when it is configured to serve a site with a qualifying wildcard name. A site name qualifies for a wildcard if only its left-most domain label is a wildcard. For example, <code>*.example.com</code> qualifies, but these do not: <code>sub.*.example.com</code>, <code>foo*.example.com</code>, <code>*bar.example.com</code>, and <code>*.*.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>If using the Caddyfile, Caddy takes site names literally with regards to the certificate subject names. In other words, a site defined as <code>sub.example.com</code> will cause Caddy to manage a certificate for <code>sub.example.com</code>, and a site defined as <code>*.example.com</code> will cause Caddy to manage a wildcard certificate for <code>*.example.com</code>. You can see this demonstrated on our <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/patterns#wildcard-certificates">Common Caddyfile Patterns</a> page. If you need different behavior, the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/">JSON config</a> gives you more precise control over certificate subjects and site names ("host matchers").</p>
<p>Wildcard certificates represent a wide degree of authority and should only be used when you have so many subdomains that managing individual certificates for them would strain the PKI or cause you to hit CA-enforced rate limits.</p>
