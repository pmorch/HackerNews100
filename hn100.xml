</p>

<p>Inside the "Remind me again in" label are the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Week</li>
<li>30 days</li>
</ul>

<p>And when I select one option, what does "No thanks" do? Does it dismiss the box entirely and I never have to see it? Or does it validate the reminder schedule? What if I just don't want OneDrive? Microsoft has embedded it so deep into Windows that there are no easy ways of getting rid of it. I would understand if they had asked me when I set up my machine the first time, but why every single time?</p>

<p>This is the illusion of choice. It is "Get it now" or "Get it later". What I'm looking for is the "Get it never option!"</p>

<p>Dark patterns at their finest.</p>

            <p>European nations have generally been more progressive in adopting open source solutions for government operations. Sure, regressive proposals like the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2025-003250_EN.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com">EU Chat Control</a> bill make headlines, but there's genuine progress happening too.</p><p>The German state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Schleswig-Holstein</a> is back in the news for its open source efforts. This time, it's their email system that's undergone a complete transformation.</p><h2 id="microsoft-booted-out-again">Microsoft Booted Out, Again</h2><p>Schleswig-Holstein has <a href="https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/landesregierung/ministerien-behoerden/I/_startseite/Artikel2025/IV/251006_ox-umstellung-abschluss?ref=news.itsfoss.com">successfully migrated</a> (<em>in Deutsch</em>) its entire state administration email system from Microsoft Exchange and Outlook to open source alternatives, <a href="https://www.open-xchange.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Open-Xchange</a> and <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Thunderbird</a>. The German state completed the transition on October 2, 2025, after a six-month process.</p><p>The <strong>migration affected around 30,000 employees</strong> across various government departments. This includes the State Chancellery, ministries, judiciary, state police, and other state authorities. Over <strong>40,000 mailboxes</strong> containing more than <strong>100 million emails and calendar entries</strong> were moved to the new system.</p><p>The state has adopted Open-Xchange as its email server solution and Thunderbird as the email client.</p><p>Of course, the transition wasn't without challenges.

Despite these hurdles, this particular move has now been completed successfully.</p><p>Plus, this switch fits into Schleswig-Holstein's broader open source strategy that has been in development for several years. The state <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/german-state-ditches-microsoft/">began rolling out LibreOffice</a> as its standard office software last year, gradually replacing Microsoft Office across all state computers.</p><p>Dirk also emphasized that:</p><blockquote>We are real pioneers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><p>Long COVID (LC) impacts one in five children after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Typical LC symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, pain, and shortness of breath, which can significantly impact individuals and society. Moreover, LC may impair school performance and have long-term health and development consequences. However, the diagnosis of LC is often imprecise and cumbersome, delaying appropriate care. To address the LC diagnosis challenges, we focused on fibrinaloid clots (microclots), recently proposed as contributing to LC‚Äôs underlying mechanisms. We overcame the limitations of current microclot assessment methods, which are qualitative, by developing a microfluidic device to quantify the number of microclots in patient blood samples.  We found significantly higher microclot levels in samples from pediatric LC patients than from healthy children. We evaluated the diagnostic power of the device in a cohort of 45 LC patients and 14 healthy pediatric donors. We estimated a 94% accuracy for the microclot count using the devices, significantly higher than the traditional counting of microclots on slides (66% accuracy). Intriguingly, we found the highest microclot counts in samples from patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the blood. Further studies will evaluate the utility of the assay as a screening test for Long COVID in larger populations and for assessing treatment responses.</p></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>It is unlikely that you will ever happen upon an editor who will argue that <b>Wikipedia cannot claim that the Earth is not flat</b>. But you may indeed encounter some who will strenuously maintain that a particular "breakthrough", or a "notable" or "controversial" idea, belief, or theory deserves more consideration than it has received in the academic world. Using the <a href="#Historical_note">Flat Earth example (below)</a> as a metaphor, this essay will examine ten types of arguments commonly used by advocates of fringe concepts and advise the neutrally-minded editor or administrator on how to defuse them.
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>It is the stated goal of Wikipedia to mirror the current consensus of mainstream scholarship ‚Äì in the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "accepted knowledge". Self-evidently, the mainstream view of what is <i>accepted</i> knowledge in a discipline has the largest following and as such the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">due weight</a> in the literature. The encyclopedia does not act as an advocate for, or passionately promote, pioneering minority theories that are currently controversial (i.e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOAPBOX" title="Wikipedia:SOAPBOX">soapboxing</a>), even if there is a slim chance beliefs on the margin may eventually gain wide consensus (as happened with the proposals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth" title="Spherical Earth">round Earth</a> in archaic periods and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift" title="Continental drift">continental drift</a> before the mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, two classic examples of cutting edge views once deemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fringe" title="Wikipedia:Fringe">fringe</a> theories that turned out to be justified). Wikipedia acknowledges diverse viewpoints on contemporary controversies, but represents them in proportion to their prevalence (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE" title="Wikipedia:UNDUE">due weight</a>) among serious scholars and reporters with reputations of responsibility and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RELIABLE" title="Wikipedia:RELIABLE">reliability</a>. Wikipedia may in some cases limit its mention of theories understood to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRINGE" title="Wikipedia:FRINGE">fringe</a> to specific articles about those theories, and remove their mention from other articles, per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ONEWAY" title="Wikipedia:ONEWAY">one way</a> principle.
</p><p>In summary, Wikipedia is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Soapbox" title="Wikipedia:Soapbox">soapbox</a> for people to advocate pet points of view, nor is Wikipedia in the business of adjudicating which pet points of view have a potential for subsequent wide acceptance in the future. Some marginal theories are <i>fringe science</i> and some are <i>pseudo-science</i>, but Wikipedia is not in the business of calling the shots as to where these stand except where reliable sources clarify those differences. Thus, Wikipedia is academically conservative, as is fitting for a standard reference work.

<p>The threshold for including material in Wikipedia is that it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, not merely that we think it is true. That is, readers must be able to check that the material has already been published by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable source</a>. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. Verifiability is one of Wikipedia's core content policies.
</p><p>Therefore, Wikipedia is not worried <i>per se</i> about whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth" title="Flat Earth">the theory that the Earth is flat</a> is true. There must be current, reliable and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IS" title="Wikipedia:IS">independent</a> sources substantiating claims that the Earth is flat. But there are no such sources<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> that are current (almost no scientists have thought the Earth was flat since about the fourth century BC), that are reliable (reliable sources are reviewed for accuracy), or independent (a journal published by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Flat_Earth_Research_Society" title="International Flat Earth Research Society">Flat Earth Society</a> would not be independent.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>)
</p><p>If Wikipedia had been available around the sixth century BC, it would have reported the view that the Earth is flat as a fact <i>without qualification</i>. It would have also reported the views of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes" title="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> (who correctly determined the Earth's circumference in 240 BC) either as controversial or a fringe view. Similarly if available in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo" title="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s time, it would have reported the view that the Sun goes round the Earth as a fact, and if Galileo had been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicipaedia" title="Vicipaedia">Vicipaedia</a> editor, his view would have been rejected as "originale investigationis". Of course, if there is a popularly held or notable view that the Earth is flat, Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Flat_Earth_Research_Society" title="International Flat Earth Research Society">reports</a> this view. But it does not report it as true. It reports only on what its adherents believe, the history of the view, and its notable or prominent adherents.

<p>Occasionally, civic-minded Wikipedia editors must act to mitigate, redesign, and sometimes destroy the offerings of users who think that a particular 'breakthrough' or 'notable' or 'controversial' idea or theory deserves more consideration than it has received in the academic world. Since Wikipedia is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="Open source">open project</a> that "anyone can edit", good editors don't take such encounters personally. They do not automatically view supporters of fringe theories as "the enemy". They know that sometimes these fallacies are propagated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" title="Hanlon's razor">not out of malice, but ignorance</a>. Humans are fallible creatures, and there are many more ways to be wrong than right. Science is stodgy, typically not glamorous, and entails hard work. 
</p><p>By contrast, speculation on "amazing new ideas" is stimulating, easy, and fun. It's more exciting to see yourself as a re-discoverer of ancient truths or in the vanguard of a revolutionary scientific breakthrough. Belonging to a small club with a particular belief can be very fulfilling. The world would be a more exciting place if there were malevolent aliens abducting humans, if dead people could send us messages, if exotic plants were able to miraculously cure all disease, if free energy were readily available to anyone, or if our dreams could foretell the future. In addition, popular culture can often confuse the general public with uncritical or credulous presentations of such concepts on the internet, in books, radio talk shows, TV, news, and films. It's little wonder that Wikipedia attracts individuals who feel the encyclopedia should include sympathetic coverage of these types of subjects.

These policies, <i>correctly understood</i> and <i>correctly used</i>, will successfully exclude non-notable or fringe views.  But many dedicated fringe advocates are familiar with these policies, and have become expert at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_the_system" title="Gaming the system">gaming them</a> or even using them against neutrally-minded but inexpert editors.  The latter often find their efforts subverted at every step by advocates who revert war over edits, frivolously request citations for obvious or well known information, argue endlessly about the neutral-point-of-view policy and particularly try to undermine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" title="Wikipedia:DUE">undue weight clause</a>.

Additionally, by continually engaging fringe advocates in endless argument, you run the risk of turning Wikipedia into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND" title="Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND">battleground</a> or a debating society. At the present time, Wikipedia does not have an effective means to address superficially polite but tendentious, long-term, fringe advocacy. Some contend that this is a main flaw of Wikipedia; that unlike conventional encyclopedias, fanatics can always get their way if they stay around long enough and make enough edits and reversions.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In this sense, Wikipedia's '<a rel="nofollow" href="http://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2006/12/22/Citizendium/">commitment to amateurism</a>' does not always work for the best interests of the project.

<p>Arguments commonly used by fringe advocates to support inclusion of marginal viewpoints against official policies fall into a small number of easily recognizable categories. Here are the top ten approaches that might be used by our allegorical Flat Earth advocate to argue that Wikipedia cannot claim "The Earth is not flat":

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Your bias against the Earth being flat is too strong to be objective.</li>
<li>Your arguments against the flat Earth theory so resemble the arguments of editor X that you must be their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry">sockpuppet</a>.</li>
<li>The flat Earth article is being degraded by those who don't like the flat Earth theory.</li>
<li>Ignoring users with differing opinions does nothing to help the further development of this page.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Personalisation is easily the most common form of attack on neutrally-minded editors.  Personalisation is ignoring the basis for inclusion altogether, and making the argument personal.  For example, they argue that an editor is biased towards the mainstream, or that editors are ganging up because their arguments are so similar (even though they would be similar ‚Äì the main argument against the Earth being flat is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography" title="Topography">topographical</a>, and it is hard to argue against it without repeating the argument).  Or they may claim that to disagree with an editor with a fringe agenda is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility" title="Wikipedia:Civility">uncivil</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a>, a violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Do_not_bite_the_newcomers" title="Wikipedia:Do not bite the newcomers">Do not bite the newcomers</a> or a violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>.  It may even be claimed that sources that disagree with the fringe point of view cannot be used if they reflect poorly on any living people who are proponents of the fringe point of view (such as critical book reviews, etc).
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Ignore any personal attack altogether ‚Äì and particularly <i>do not</i> make a personal attack yourself, however tempting it may be.  Also try to ignore the arguments and reasons used by mainstream science itself.  Your opponents will love this and turn the talk page into a battlefield of competing claims and counterclaims.  Simply stick to the principles: if mainstream science holds that the Earth is round, and there are reliable sources establishing this as a fact, that is sufficient.

<li>Since established scientists attended a flat-Earth conference, it follows they take the theory seriously.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>After you have insisted on the use of reliable sources, supporters of the marginal view will then try to exploit the definition of 'reliable source'.  They will argue for the inclusion of material of dubious reliability; for example, using commentary from partisan think-tanks rather than from the scientific literature. Occasionally, they will discover that they can get more attention if they make appeals to authority by presenting supporters who have academic credentials. Typical pseudoscience sources include:
</p>
<ul><li>Dedicated websites (normally registered under a .com or .org ‚Äì rarely under .edu though there are occasions where this may be possible)</li>
<li>Dedicated periodicals</li>
<li>Self-published sources</li>
<li>Publications made outside the typical scientific presses</li>
<li>In-house journals (The <i>Flat Earth Institute's Journal</i> not to be confused with academic journals)</li>
<li>Occasional peer-reviewed articles ‚Äì often in more obscure journals</li></ul>
<p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>The best sources to use when describing fringe theories or determining their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N" title="Wikipedia:N">notability</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WEIGHT" title="Wikipedia:WEIGHT">prominence</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">independent reliable sources</a>. It's impossible to write a balanced article or describe a fringe theory in an objective way if the sources being used have a stake in promoting a specific fringe theory. Independent sources are also necessary to determine the relationship of a fringe theory to mainstream scholarly discourse. And arguments for inclusion of fringe theories based on a proponent's credentials alone are unwarranted. Attempts to insert language that showcases a proponent's academic degrees or honorification should be treated as promotionalism.

<ul><li>You must not say 'the Earth is not flat' but 'according to critics of the flat Earth theory, the Earth is not flat'.</li>
<li>There should be no criticism of the flat Earth theory in the introduction to the article. There is already criticism of the theory in the article, section 94.</li>
<li>So what if the article on flat Earth theory is 250k, and the round Earth article only 8k? The answer is not to fix the balance by writing less about the flat Earth, that only makes Wikipedia worse, but to add more information about the Earth being round.</li>

<li>Criticism of the flat Earth theory should be balanced by criticism of the round Earth theory.</li>
<li>The article lead should begin with a pure definition. Criticism should come second, e.g.:<i>"<b>Flat Earth</b> refers to the Earth's flat shape. Skeptics say the Earth is round."</i></li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Even when supporters of fringe viewpoints recognise the mainstream view as mainstream and established, and agree that Wikipedia may state the mainstream view without qualification, they will still challenge the relative prominence accorded to the mainstream over the fringe viewpoint, and make all sorts of arguments about balance.  It is often seriously claimed that the "N" in NPOV (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>) means that no negative or critical or mainstream material can appear at all in the article, since it is not neutral, or that Wikipedia is not for advocacy, and so advocates of 'scientific points of view' should not overstate their case.
</p><p>It is claimed that the reader will not understand the idea unless it is described without criticism, since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for the general public, not a technical journal.  Reversing this argument, they will state that readers are smart enough to know that fringe ideas are nonsense without including any negative or critical material or sources. They will propose that negative material be forked off into another article, or relegated into a "criticism ghetto" or criticism section or removed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Lead section</a>. They may argue that one must always state the idea first before criticizing it, or that any sources that disagree with the fringe point of view cannot be used since they violate the Neutral point of view.
</p><p>They may insist that a statement by an advocate of a fringe theory saying they "do not agree that it is a fringe theory" must be included in the article text. They may claim that any critical or negative material cannot appear in an article since it is biased. Or that any negative or critical material is unusable since it is just opinion and not fact. Some of them will even claim that there are no facts, arguing that if a fringe minority, not present in any reliable sources, disagrees with a widely accepted fact, it violates Neutral point of view to state it as a fact in the article. They may demand that every statement of fact should be attributed, no matter how universally accepted.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Wikipedia's neutrality is often misunderstood as giving equal validity to mainstream and fringe views. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTNEUTRAL" title="Wikipedia:NOTNEUTRAL">But it actually gives the most weight and validity to the mainstream view, as cited in high quality academic sources</a>. The fact that fringe theory promoters do not think their theory is fringe is a given. Every pseudoscience advocate strenuously objects to their avocation being called pseudoscience, it's an unremarkable detail (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MANDY" title="Wikipedia:MANDY">WP:MANDY</a>), and unless these objections are notable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">WP:FRIND</a> sources, they don't belong in the article. At the root of many of these arguments are intentional (or unintentional) misinterpretations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>, particularly undue weight, although certain kinds of deliberate <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pettifogger" title="wiktionary:pettifogger">pettifogging</a> can also be a sign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Gaming_the_system" title="Wikipedia:Gaming the system">gaming the system</a>.

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The flat Earth theory has been marginalised by the scientific establishment in order to protect its interests.</li>
<li>Any scientist who tried to study flat Earth theory would lose his research funding. Dissent is being suppressed by the scientific establishment.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Rosencrantz was tremendously rude about scientists who claimed the Earth was round. If the scientific establishment has marginalized him this is not really surprising.</li>
<li>As a professional astronomer you have a clear conflict of interest.</li>
<li>X, Y and Z are hard-line skeptics about flat-Earthism. They often publish in skeptics magazines and take a hard line with any approach to any theory which is not empirically verified.</li>
<li>The scientific establishment (peer-reviewed journals, universities) are trying to suppress the Truth about flat Earth theory; they refuse to allow flat Earth papers at conferences and will not publish flat Earth research.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>The next tactic is to appeal to your ideas about free speech and distrust of censorship and the establishment. All theories that are not generally accepted have a part of the theory devoted to explaining why this is.  Fringe theories are no exception.  They will claim that the <i>scientific establishment</i> is afraid of being proved wrong, and hence is trying to suppress the truth. This is a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>. Their theory is not accepted because the black suits in the Scientific Establishment are not concerned about the pursuit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a>, but are much more concerned about not rocking the boat in order to protect their vested interests. The round-earth theorists have the backing of the major media who also have vested interests which they must protect. This explains why the discoveries of 'edges' round the Earth into which planes have gone missing, reports of travelers who have looked into the abyss, are receiving no coverage whatsoever by the major newspapers or the major TV networks.
</p><p>Thus, it is claimed that trying to balance positive content with negative content for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" title="Wikipedia:DUE">due weight</a> is censorship. It is claimed that there is a conspiracy against the fringe position and anyone who opposes an uncritical article about the fringe position is in on the conspiracy, has been bought off, is breaking the rules of Wikipedia, is just plain evil, etc.
</p><p>It is claimed that any source that has not written articles that are supportive and uncritical of fringe positions are not suitable as tertiary sources. For example, recently at a controversial article, it was once argued 'Actually, those really shouldn't be used as sources on this topic because (to my knowledge) they haven't written anything pro-X, and hence really can't be considered third party.'

</p><p>We move to the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon" title="Thermonuclear weapon">powerful weapon</a> in the fringe armoury: the argument from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_onus" title="Reverse onus">reversed burden of proof</a>.  Instead of them having to prove that their view is supported by reliable and independent sources, they will shift the burden of proof over to you, so you have to prove either that their view is <i>not supported</i>, or even that it is <i>refuted</i> by reliable and independent sources.  This is difficult for two reasons.  First, it is always difficult to prove a negative existential statement (which is in effect a claim about everything there is).  Second, because science generally ignores pseudoscience, it is often very difficult to find reliable sources that describe some pseudoscientific view as pseudoscientific.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>This argument is often difficult to address. However, you should always recognise the shifting of the burden for what it is, the second that ball comes thundering down the court at 80 mph.  Slam it back.  <i>Insist that the burden is theirs</i>.
</p>
<dl><dd>"When two or more theories are in competition, it is common for one of them to be treated as the established position ‚Äì the default option, as it were ‚Äì and the others to be treated as challengers. A challenging theory is normally expected to bear the burden or onus of proof. In other words, advocates of the challenging theory are expected to provide highly convincing evidence and arguments before the theory can be taken seriously. To use a different metaphor, it is assumed that the established theory has jumped over a very high hurdle to gain its leading position and that any challenger must jump over an equally high hurdle before being in contention for the remainder of the race."<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Also, in such cases it is legitimate to source from non-promotional descriptions of pseudoscience that can only be obtained from second- and third-party sources. Although most of these sources will not be peer-reviewed simply because science tends to ignore pseudoscience, they are still <i>independent</i>.  Thus, the following are reliable sources for describing pseudoscience:

<p>You have kept the marginal and fringe viewpoint at bay for some months or years.  But now they have got wise, and expert in the ways of Wikipedia.  They have read the policies carefully, and have worked out the various loopholes in it, and the endless games they can play with it.
</p><p>They now claim that only the proponents of the FRINGE position understand NPOV or NOR or RS, not the experienced editors with tens of thousands of edits, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FA" title="Wikipedia:FA">FAs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GA" title="Wikipedia:GA">GAs</a> to their credit.

They will attempt to use mainly primary sources, and to reject secondary and tertiary sources, or to redefine the preferences for secondary and tertiary sources in policy.
</p><p>Worst of all, it is now many months since you tidied up the article.  You have no inherent interest in the Flat Earth theory, and you have moved on to another area of pseudoscience (let's say the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_geocentrism" title="Modern geocentrism">Geocentric theory</a>).  But the Flat Earth supporters are interested in nothing else than their pet theory.  They will come back when you are gone and revert when you do not notice. The arguments that you successfully rebutted and dismissed, sometimes with extensive references, will be repeated over and over and over, sometimes just with a cut and paste approach. Sometimes they will be presented by the same person dozens and dozens of times over days and weeks and months.  They will try to add information that is (at best) peripherally relevant on the grounds that 'it is verifiable, so it should be in'.  They repeatedly use the talk page for soapboxing, or to re-raise the same issues that have already been discussed numerous times.  They hang around forever wearing down more serious editors and become expert in an odd kind of way on their niche POV.

Assorted templates branding the article are thrown on the article repeatedly, such as the claim that an NPOV dispute is going on, when it is more accurate to describe the discussion as revolving around some editor's idiosyncratic interpretation of NPOV to satisfy their own personal agenda. Accusations that a group editing the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" title="Wikipedia:OWN">own</a> the article since they will not change the consensus to satisfy one malcontent are common.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>

However, many fringe advocates thrive on the increased attention and actually welcome these forums as a soapbox from which to further argue their viewpoint. Finding themselves in the spotlight, it is not unusual for dedicated fringe advocates to suddenly disavow any former or present interest/connection with the subject of their advocacy ("Gosh, I don't believe the Earth is flat, I'm just here to uphold NPOV") and profess that they are only fighting "for the good of Wikipedia". The risks of continued involvement with disputes that escalate to this level should be carefully considered, especially if accompanied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder" title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">obsessive/compulsive</a> behavior.
</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The flat Earth theory is not amenable to scientific approaches and methods.</li>
<li>Flat-earth theorists are pragmatic. They are not interested in what is 'true', they are interested in 'what works'.</li>
<li>Rosencrantz never claimed nor explicitly stated that the Flat Earth Theory is a 'science'.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Another way of evading NPOV is to avoid the requirement for reliable sourcing altogether.  They will claim that the view in question is simply not amenable to scientific treatment.  Source X was from a scientific journal, it attempted to address the Flat Earth theory in a way that science could deal with it.  But Flat Earth theory is not amenable to scientific treatment.  Source X misunderstood what the theory was really saying.  The Flat Earth theory is not something that is really a 'fact' in the scientific sense.  (See the archived talk pages of the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">Neuro-linguistic programming</a> for endless repetitions and varieties of this argument).
</p><p>Or they claim that writing material using facts in the same context as in reliable sources violates NPOV since they are following a "narrative", and we must instead choose facts which no source describes as relevant to allow our readers to decide which "narrative" should be chosen.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Stick to your guns. This is merely a philosophically naive means of evading justification and substantiation.  All theories make claims of some sort, otherwise they would not have 'proponents' (a proponent literally 'puts forward' a certain view that is susceptible of truth or falsity).  The Flat Earth theory claims that the Earth is flat, not round.  That is a statement with a binary truth-value.  And it is capable of confirmation or refutation, it is verifiable.  For example, topography (measuring the distances between defined points on the Earth's surface) shows the shape of the Earth. Therefore, the theory is amenable to scientific treatment.

<li>Scientist X was not trained in flat Earth theory, and therefore could not make an expert judgment.</li>

<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Special pleading is when the advocates of a fringe viewpoint argue that you have no expertise in the theory (which may, they argue, take years to fully master).  You do not understand the theory, and therefore you cannot make your claims.  Another version of this argument is to claim there are many different types of the theory, and that while version X and version Y are clearly nonsense, the most recent version Z (which of course you have never heard of) is scientifically impeccable.  They may even claim there is no such 'version' of the theory, and that you are attacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man" title="Straw man">straw man</a>.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>The only people qualified enough to understand flat Earth theory are those who just happen to support flat Earth theory? Ridiculous. Advocates, promoters, and self proclaimed "flat Earth theory experts" are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">independent, objective sources</a> of fact about whether or not the Earth is flat, or whether or not flat Earth theory is valid. Also bear in mind that any "new and improved" versions of flat Earth theory must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTE" title="Wikipedia:NOTE">notable</a> enough to have attracted review and comment by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">independent, objective sources</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The flat Earth theory is clearly controversial. This is proof that scientists take it seriously.</li>
<li>The more controversial or fringe a subject, the less the article should tell the reader what to believe. The reader should be allowed to make up his/her own mind concerning the subject. e.g.: <i>"Flat Earthism is a highly controversial subject, and its scientific validity is often questioned."</i></li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Although supporters of the marginal view cannot overcome Wikipedia policies, they will try to distort and alter an article's language in a way that represents their view as less marginal.  The most well-known and often-used tactic is to claim that their viewpoint is 'controversial', as though there were a minority but substantial view held by serious scientists or academics, actively engaged by the mainstream, and which is reported as controversial by reliable sources.
</p><p>They will try to exploit equivocation in the description of pseudoscience. For example, instead of simply stating: "the Flat Earth theory violates the known laws of geometry", a proponent may argue for the equivocal statement: "<i>some</i> geometers claim that the Flat Earth theory violates the known laws of geometry", perhaps adding "but there is considerable <i>controversy</i> over the matter."

</div>
<p>Pseudoscience should not be described on its own terms. The goal of writing an article on pseudoscience should be to present the ideas that are most commonly seen in relation to that pseudoscientific idea. This means that when writing an article on pseudoscience, popularity of ideas is a major rationale for inclusion or exclusion. Obscure iterations of pseudoscience should be eliminated, even if so-called "experts" in the subject believe such ideas to be of the utmost importance. The best way to write an article on pseudoscience is to approach it from the perspective of what topics are most prevalent in the popular culture about the subject.
</p><p>All claims that are made about observable reality which are directly contradicted by mainstream science must be represented as such. Per the rules of reliable sourcing and not unduly weighting fringe opinions, an article about a mainstream topic should marginalize all related pseudoscience topics relative to the prominence seen in secondary and tertiary sources about the mainstream topic. A pseudoscientific topic should not be mentioned in an article about a mainstream topic unless there are independent mainstream sources that connect the topics. For example, there are plenty of mainstream sources which describe how astronomy is not astrology, and so a decent article on the former may mention the latter. However, there are no mainstream sources about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> which also mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodynamics" title="Autodynamics">autodynamics</a>, and so a decent article on the former should not mention the latter. This approach is outlined in the guideline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ONEWAY" title="Wikipedia:ONEWAY">WP:ONEWAY</a>.
</p><p>If it is deemed necessary to exclude pseudoscience from a certain article, there should not even be a link through a see also section. Often pseudoscience articles must link to science articles. Rarely will science articles link to pseudoscience articles. That is the principle of one-way linking.

<ul><li>Rosencrantz claimed many times that the sky is blue, that grass is green.  These facts are well-established by reliable sources.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>The last weapon in the pseudoscience arsenal is something you cannot deny: parts of the theory may be true.  Proponents will ignore the many bogus and patently untrue claims of the theory, and perhaps not even mention them in the article, but will go on at length about the parts of the theory that are true.  Often these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude" title="Platitude">platitudinous</a>, or are statements that are better and more clearly covered in reliable sources.  Worse, they will cite reliable sources which make these true claims, but which do not mention the fringe theory, <i>as though they supported the theory</i>.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Rosencrantz may have said that the sky is blue and grass is green but he most likely isn't considered an authority or reliable source for such information. Attention to such details is only warranted if there is significant third-party coverage of them.
</p>

<p>By the 1950s historians had established that in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a> the educated classes had recovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks" title="Ancient Greeks">ancient Greeks</a>' discovery that the world is a sphere, even though their world-view was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric" title="Geocentric">geocentric</a>, and that the notion that Columbus's voyage was to prove the world round is a piece of fiction introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving" title="Washington Irving">Washington Irving</a>. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth" title="Myth of the Flat Earth">Myth of the Flat Earth</a>.) Although it was presumed before Copernicus that the Earth was the centre of the Universe, with the Sun revolving around it, we now know that the educated classes still understood the Earth to be a sphere with gravity acting towards its centre, contrary to the widespread 19th-century assumption that most mediaeval people believed it to be flat. (For example, the final two cantos of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>'s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)" title="Inferno (Dante)">Inferno</a></i> assume a spherical Earth.) However, this essay uses the flat Earth as a metaphor for explaining Wikipedia policy, not to describe any authentic historical controversy.

A Gaussian splat is essentially a bunch of blurry ellipsoids. Each one has a view-dependent color, using a process similar to training an AI model, you can optimize until it converges to the photos you feed in. The result is a sort of 3D photograph that can be viewed freely from any angle.
</p><p>
Captivated by this possibility, I wanted to create splats of macro subjects. The hairy, fuzzy textures and complex structures of insects make them a perfect fit for this technique.
</p><p>
In theory, creating a splat is as simple as filming the object from all sides. Unfortunately, the extremely shallow depth of field in macro photography completely throws this process off. If you feed unsharp photos into it, the resulting model will contain unsharp areas as well. </p><p>
Thankfully, there‚Äôs a common technique in macro photography called focus stacking, where multiple images taken from the same angle but with slightly different focal points are combined into one fully sharp photo. A single stack usually contains anywhere from 50 to 500 images. Since I needed to photograph the subject from many angles, I optimized the process to use as few photos per stack as possible and settled on 16. I shot at a small aperture of f/18 to maximize depth of field. The diffraction introduced by this setup can be minimized later in post.
</p><p>
To capture the specimen from all angles, covering a bit more than half a hemisphere, I mounted the insect on a rotary disk and tilted the camera up and down on a boom arm. A script rotated the disk by fixed increments, and each focus stack was captured using a WeMacro automated focus rail. The vertical angle was adjusted manually (only eight times), so it wasn‚Äôt a big issue. In total, I captured 111 perspectives. A full session of 1776 photos took about four hours. The main bottleneck is my Nikon D810, which isn‚Äôt built for such continuous shooting, it slows down to one frame every one or two seconds once the buffer fills up. I used a Tamron 90mm lens with a 20mm extension and shot in DX (cropped sensor) mode. Shorter lenses would change the perspective too much between focus areas, making image alignment impossible.
</p><p>
After batch focus-stacking all the photos, I ended up with 111 fully sharp images. The camera positions could then be reconstructed in <a href="https://colmap.github.io/">COLMAP</a>. I performed some color correction and background masking before feeding the data into training with <a href="https://www.jawset.com/">Postshot</a>. Out comes the splat, requiring only minimal retouching to remove the mounting.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>(This is the blog post version of <a href="https://youtu.be/MMVVboVL5eU?si=_aoKRKmK59HaZTpy">my keynote from EuroPython 2025</a> in Prague, Czechia.)</p><p>We now have a <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pylock-toml/">lock file format specification</a>. That might not sound like a big deal, but for me it took 4 years of active work to get us that specification. Part education, part therapy, this post is meant to help explain what make creating a lock file difficult and why it took so long to reach this point.</p><h2 id="what-goes-into-a-lock-file">What goes into a lock file</h2><p>A lock file is meant to record <strong>all</strong> the dependencies your code needs to work along with how to install those dependencies.</p><p>That involves The "how" is <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/#source-trees">source trees</a>, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/">source distributions</a> (aka sdists), and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/">wheels</a>. With all of these forms, the trick is recording the right details in order to know how to install code in any of those three forms. Luckily we already had the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url/"><code>direct_url.json</code> specification</a> that just needed translation into <a href="https://toml.io/">TOML</a> for source trees. As for sdists and wheels, it's effectively recording what an index server provides you when you look at a project's release.</p><p>The much trickier part is figuring what to install when. For instance, let's consider where your top-level, direct dependencies come from. In <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/"><code>pyproject.toml</code></a> there's <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies"><code>project.dependencies</code></a> for dependencies you always need for your code to run, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies"><code>project.optional-dependencies</code></a> (aka extras), for when you want to offer your users the option to install additional dependencies, and then there's <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-groups/"><code>dependency-groups</code></a> for dependencies that are not meant for end-users (e.g. listing your test dependencies).</p><p>But letting users control what is (not) installed isn't the end of things. There's also the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/"><em>specifiers</em></a> you can add to any of your listed dependencies. They allow you to not only restrict what versions of things you want (i.e. setting a lower-bound and <strong>not</strong> setting an upper-bound if you can help it), but also when the dependency actually applies (e.g. is it specific to Windows?).</p><p>Put that all together and you end up with a graph of dependencies who edges dictate whether a dependency applies on some platform. If you manage to write it all out then you have <em>multi-use</em> lock files which are portable across platforms and whatever options the installing users selects, compared to <em>single-use</em> lock files that have a specific applicability due to only supporting a single platform and set of input dependencies.</p><p>Oh, and even getting the complete list of dependencies in either case is an NP-complete problem.</p><p>And it make makes things "interesting", I also wanted the file format to be written by software but readable by people, secure by default, fast to install, and allow the <em>locker</em> which write the lock file to be different from the <em>installer</em> that performs the install (and either be written in a language other than Python).</p><p>In the end, it all worked out (luckily); you can read the spec for all the nitty-gritty details about <code>pylock.toml</code> or <a href="https://youtu.be/MMVVboVL5eU?si=_aoKRKmK59HaZTpy">watch the keynote</a> where I go through the spec. But it sure did take a while to get to this point.</p><h2 id="why-it-took-over-4-years">Why it took (over) 4 years</h2><p>I'm not sure if this qualifies as the longest single project I have ever taken on for Python (rewriting the import system might still hold that record for me), but it definitely felt the most intense over a prolonged period of time.</p><p>The oldest record I have that I was thinking about this problem is a tweet from Feb 2019:</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/lock-file-format-idea-on-Twitter.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="912" height="771" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/lock-file-format-idea-on-Twitter.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/lock-file-format-idea-on-Twitter.png 912w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="2019">2019</h2><p>That year there were 106 posts on discuss.python.org about a <code>requirements.txt</code> v2 proposal. It didn't come to any specific conclusion that I can recall, but it at least got the conversation started.</p><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><p>The next year, the conversation continued and generated 43 posts. I was personally busy with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a> and the <code>[project]</code> table in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p><h2 id="2021">2021</h2><p>In January of 2021 Tzu-Ping Chung, Pradyun Gedam, and myself began researching how other language ecosystems did lock files. It culminated in us writing <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/">PEP 665</a> and posting it in July. That led to 359 posts that year.</p><p>The goal of PEP 665 was a very secure lock file which partially achieved that goal by only supporting wheels. With no source trees or sdists to contend with, it meant installation didn't involve executing a build back-end which can be slow, be indeterminate, and a security risk simply due to running more code. We wrote the PEP with the idea that any source trees or sdists would be built into wheels out-of-band so you could then lock against those wheels.</p><h2 id="2022">2022</h2><p>In the end, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-665-take-2-a-file-format-to-list-python-dependencies-for-reproducibility-of-an-application/11736/141">PEP 665 was rejected</a> in January of 2022, generating 106 posts on the subject both before and after the rejection. It turns out enough people had workflows dependent on sdists that they balked at having the added step of building wheels out-of-band. There was also some desire to also lock the build back-end dependencies.</p><h2 id="2023">2023</h2><p>After the failure of PEP 665, I decided to try to tackle the problem again entirely on my own. I didn't want to drag other poor souls into this again and I thought that being opinionated might make things a bit easier (compromising to please everyone can lead to bad outcomes when a spec if large and complicated like I knew this would be).</p><p>I also knew I was going to need a proof-of-concept. That meant I needed code that could get metadata from an index server, resolve all the dependencies some set of projects needed (at least from a wheel), and at least know what I would install on any given platform. Unfortunately a lot of that didn't exist as some library on PyPI, so I had to write a bunch of it myself. Luckily I had already started the journey before with my <a href="https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender">mousebender</a> project, but that only covered the metadata from an index server. I still needed to be able to read <code>MEtADATA</code> files from a wheel and do the resolution. The former Donald Stufft had taken a stab at and which I picked up and completed, leading to <a href="https://packaging.pypa.io/en/stable/metadata.html"><code>packaging.metadata</code></a>. I then used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/resolvelib/">resolvelib</a> to create a resolver.</p><p>As such there were only 54 posts about lock files that were general discussion. The key outcome there was trying to lock for build back-ends confused people too much, and so I dropped that feature request from my thinking.</p><h2 id="2024">2024</h2><p>Come 2024, I was getting enough pieces together to actually have a proof-of-concept. And then <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> came out in February. That complicated things a bit as it did/planned to do things I had planned to help entice people to care about lock files. I also knew I couldn't keep up with the folks at <a href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a> as I didn't get to work on this full-time as a job (although I did get a lot more time starting in September of 2024).</p><p>I also became a parent in April which initially gave me a chunk of time (babies for the first couple of months sleep a lot, so if gives you a bit of time). And so in July I posted the first draft of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/">PEP 751</a>. It was based on <code>pdm.lock</code> (which itself is based on <code>poetry.lock</code>). It covered sdists and wheels and was multi-use, all by recording the projects to install as a set which made installation fast.</p><p>But uv's popularity was growing and they had extra needs that <a href="https://pdm-project.org/">PDM</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>‚Äì the other major participants in the PEP discussions --didn't. And do I wrote another draft where I pivoted from a set of projects to a graph of projects. But otherwise the original feature set was all there.</p><p>And then <a href="https://hynek.me/">Hynek</a> came by with what seemed like an innocuous request about making the version of a listed project optional instead of required (which was done because the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#version">version</a> is required in <code>PKG-INFO</code> in sdists and <code>METADATA</code> in wheels).</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/hynek-post.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="763" height="164" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/hynek-post.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/hynek-post.png 763w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately the back-and-forth on that was enough to cause the Astral folks to want to scale the whole project back all the way to the <code>requirements.txt</code> v2 solution.</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/charlie-backtracks.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="709" height="113" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/charlie-backtracks.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/charlie-backtracks.png 709w"></figure><p>While I understood their reasoning and motivation, I would be lying if I said it wasn't disappointing. I felt we were extremely close up to that point in reaching an agreement on the PEP, and then having to walk back so much work and features did not exactly make me happy.</p><p>This was covered by 974 posts on discuss.python.org.</p><h2 id="2025">2025</h2><p>But to get consensus among uv, Poetry, and PDM, I did a third draft of PEP 751. This went back to the set of projects to install, but was single-use only. I also became extremely stringent with timelines on when people could provide feedback as well as what would be required to add/remove anything. At this point I was fighting burn-out on this subject and my own wife had grown tired of the subject and seeing me feel dejected every time there was a setback. And so I set a deadline of the end of March to get things done, even if I had to drop features to make it happen.</p><p>And in February I thought we had reached and agreement on this third draft. But then Frost Ming, the maintainer of PDM, asked why did we drop multi-use lock files when they thought the opposition wasn't that strong?</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/frost-disappointed.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="770" height="161" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/frost-disappointed.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/frost-disappointed.png 770w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And so, with another 150 posts and some very strict deadlines for feedback, we managed to bring back multi-use lock files and get PEP 751 accepted-- with no changes! -- on March 31.</p><h2 id="2-peps-and-6-years-later">2 PEPs and 6 years later ...</h2><p>If you add in some ancillary discussions, the total number of posts on the subject of lock files since 2019 comes to over 1.8K. But as I write this post, less than 7 months since PEP 751 was accepted, PDM has already been updated to allow users to opt into using <code>pylock.toml</code> over <code>pdm.lock</code> (which shows that the lock file format works and meets the needs of at least one of the three key projects I tried to make happy). Uv and pip also have some form of support.</p><p>I will say, though, that I think I'm done with major packaging projects (work has also had me move on from working on packaging since April, so any time at this point would be my free time, which is scant when you have a toddler). Between <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>pylock.toml</code>, I'm ready to move on to the next area of Python where I think I could be the most useful.</p>

That is the philosophy behind <strong>Together Turbo</strong>, our suite of inference innovations that draw from research in algorithms, architectures, and modeling recipes. We‚Äôre excited to introduce the AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System (ATLAS), the first speculator of its kind that gives automatic performance improvements without any manual tuning.</p><p>ATLAS offers a new way of doing speculative decoding ‚Äî one that dynamically improves at runtime ‚Äî and it fits seamlessly alongside our other Turbo techniques like the proprietary <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/fastest-inference-for-deepseek-r1-0528-with-nvidia-hgx-b200" data-wf-native-id-path="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbb" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbb">Together Turbo Speculator</a> or <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/customized-speculative-decoding" data-wf-native-id-path="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbe" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbe">Custom Speculators</a>. But why create an adaptive-learning speculator system?</p><p>Standard speculators are trained for general workloads. Custom speculators are trained on your specific data, but only for a specific snapshot in time. However, as the workload evolves (codebase grows, traffic patterns shift, request distributions change), even highly customized speculators can fall behind. In contrast, ATLAS evolves automatically with usage, learning from both historical patterns and live traffic to continuously align with the target model‚Äôs behaviors in real time. This means the more you use our inference service, the better ATLAS will perform!&nbsp;</p><p>Built on top of Together Turbo Speculator, ATLAS reaches up to 500 TPS on <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/deepseek-v3-1/providers#output-speed" data-wf-native-id-path="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df816" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df816">DeepSeek-V3.1</a> and up to 460 TPS on <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/kimi-k2-0905/providers#output-speed" data-wf-native-id-path="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df819" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df819">Kimi-K2</a> in a fully adapted scenario ‚Äî 2.65x faster than standard decoding, outperforming even specialized hardware like Groq (Figure 1). </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e6f5c39323d811dc587281_Self-Adaptive%20Spec%20-%20DS%20V3.1%20and%20Kimi-k2-v6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 1: We show the decoding speed on NVIDIA HGX B200 with our Turbo speculator and the adaptive-learning speculator system for DeepSeek-V3.1 (top) KIMI-K2-0905 (bottom) with Arena Hard traffic.1</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>1. Speculative Decoding</strong></h2><p>Speculative decoding is one of the most powerful levers for accelerating inference.<sup>2</sup> Instead of having the target model generate every token step by step, a faster <strong>speculator </strong>(also known as the <strong>draft model</strong>)<strong> </strong>proposes multiple tokens ahead, and the target model <em>verifies</em> them in parallel in a single forward pass. The verification process ensures that the quality of the output matches the distribution of non-speculative decoding, while achieving speedups by accepting many tokens at a time.</p><p>The overall speed is influenced by the acceptance rate $Œ±$ (i.e., how often the target model agrees with the drafted tokens from the speculator) and the relative latency $c$ of the draft versus the target. Typically, larger speculators with more parameters yield higher acceptance rates due to their higher capacity but are slower to generate draft tokens. Progress therefore comes from both sides: aligning draft and target models to increase $Œ±$ (training objectives, data, and algorithms) and designing draft models/kernels that keep $c$ low while maintaining $Œ±$ (sparsity, quantization, lightweight &amp; kernel-efficient architectures). The sweet spot is where a high $Œ±$ meets a low $c$, minimizing end-to-end latency. </p><div>

We‚Äôve built a <strong>speculator design and selection framework</strong> that determines the optimal speculator architecture (width/depth, lookahead, sparsity/quantization, KV reuse) and a <strong>scalable training system</strong> that brings up speculators for the largest and most challenging open-source targets quickly and reproducibly (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.1 and Kimi-K2). For instance, while Kimi ships without a ready-to-use speculator, we can train and deploy one rapidly and take Kimi from ~150 TPS out of the box to 270+ TPS on the same hardware and batch settings, while preserving target-model quality (see Figure 1, yellow bars).<strong> </strong>This pipeline powers Turbo Speculators that deliver state-of-the-art decoding latency, and it sets the stage for what comes next: <strong>an Adaptive-Learning Speculator System </strong>that adjusts token drafting to the workload in real time.</p><h2><strong>2. Introducing Turbo‚Äôs Adaptive-Learning Speculator System</strong></h2><p>At Together AI, we power a broad range of inference workloads. But today‚Äôs speculative decoding methods are constrained to using a <strong>static</strong> speculator, trained on a fixed dataset. Once deployed, the speculator cannot adapt, leading to degrading performance if the input distribution evolves. This problem is particularly pronounced in serverless, multi-tenant environments, where input diversity is sky-high. New users continuously arrive, and bring with them unique workloads that the fixed speculator may not have seen during training. Furthermore, these speculators typically use a <em>fixed lookahead</em>, predicting the same number of tokens regardless of the speculator‚Äôs confidence. Put simply, <em>a static speculator cannot keep up</em>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e5f97cde692a7dd4e66daf_Adaptive-Learning%20Speculator%20System%20Design.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 3: Two speculators‚Äîone static, one adaptive‚Äîwork with a confidence-aware controller that selects between them and adjusts lookahead for optimal accuracy and speed.</figcaption></figure><p>To address these limitations, we designed the<strong> Adaptive-Learning Speculative System </strong>with two cooperating speculators, as shown in Figure 3:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>A heavyweight <em>static</em> speculator</strong> trained on a broad corpus that provides strong, general speculation.</li><li><strong>A lightweight <em>adaptive</em> speculator</strong> that allows for rapid, low-overhead updates from real-time traffic, specializing on-the-fly to emerging domains.</li><li>A <strong>confidence-aware controller that</strong> chooses which speculator to trust at each step and what speculation lookahead to use, using longer speculations when the speculator has high confidence.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Efficiency Guardrail via Static Speculator. </strong>The static Turbo Speculator serves as an always-on speed floor: it is trained on a broad corpus and remains stable across workloads, so TPS does not collapse when traffic shifts or the adaptive path is cold. In ATLAS, we use it to jump-start speed and provide a fail-safe fallback‚Äîif confidence drops or drift is detected, the controller shortens lookahead or routes back to the static path to preserve latency while the adaptive speculator relearns.</p><p><strong>Customized Speculator vs. Adaptive-Learning</strong>.<strong> </strong>We know from our previous studies that a <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/customized-speculative-decoding" data-wf-native-id-path="7d9d3fc9-ab60-48db-3a39-d2349c45db72" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="7d9d3fc9-ab60-48db-3a39-d2349c45db72">customized speculator</a> trained on samples from real traffic that mirror expected usage delivers an additional speed boost. The Adaptive-Learning Speculator enables us to be even more customized in real time. For instance, during a vibe-coding session, the adaptive system can specialize a lightweight speculator for the relevant code files being edited and not seen during training, further increasing the acceptance rate and decoding speed. This kind of on-the-fly specialization is hard to achieve with static speculators.</p><p><strong>Accelerating RL Training</strong>. Reinforcement learning (RL) alternates between two phases: (1) a rollout phase, where the current policy generates trajectories and receives rewards, and (2) an update phase, where we use the rewards to update the policy. In practice, rollouts are often the bottleneck, accounting for roughly 70% of total wall-clock time<sup>3</sup>. In general, because the policy distribution shifts throughout training, static speculators quickly fall out of alignment with the target policy, resulting in sub-optimal throughput.<sup>4</sup> ATLAS addresses this by adapting online to the evolving policy and the specific RL domain, maintaining alignment and reducing the overall rollout time. The domain-specific, iterative nature of RL further enables rapid adaptation, yielding sustained and growing speedups. As shown in Figure 4, applying ATLAS to the RL-MATH pipeline produces increasing speedups as training progresses.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e5cccee6c757846d59aed8_acceptance-rate-during-RL-training-3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 4: We train Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M on DeepScaler subsets using ATLAS for RL on NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs. The acceptance rate rises from below 10% to above 80% over 1.4k training steps, resulting in a more than 60% reduction for overall training time without changing RL training algorithm.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Built as part of the Turbo optimization suite. </strong>The Adaptive-Learning Speculator System is a core component of the broader Turbo optimization suite, where each layer of optimization compounds the benefits of the others. As illustrated in Figure 5, performance progressively improves through near-lossless quantization (calibrated to preserve quality), the Turbo Speculator, and finally the Adaptive-Learning Speculator System. Additional optimizations in the suite include TurboBoost-TTFT (not shown) for reducing time-to-first-token latency, further contributing to end-to-end acceleration.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e6f5e6a8a424ecee85949a_Together%20Turbo%20Optimization%20Suite-v5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 5: Performance gains across the Together Turbo Optimization Suite, showing progressive speed improvements from vanilla FP8 DeepSeek baseline (105 TPS) to the Adaptive-Learning Speculator System (501 TPS). The experiment is based on NVIDIA HGX B200 with batch-size 1, as detailed in Figure 1.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Extreme Peak Efficiency</strong>. When the input distribution is narrow and outputs closely echo previously seen tokens, the adaptive system specializes quickly. In this scenario, the controller becomes confident in utilizing more tokens from the lightweight speculator and lengthens lookahead tokens. This yields consistently higher TPS than static or one-off custom speculators can maintain. As shown in Figures 1 and 5, once fully adapted to Arena-Hard traffic, DeepSeek achieves up to 500 tokens per second for batch size 1 on 4 B200 GPUs, delivering a 400% speedup over the FP8 baseline (improvement from 105 TPS to 501 TPS).</p><p>{{custom-cta-1}}</p><h2><strong>Build the Future of Efficient AI</strong></h2><p>In parallel to making models smarter and more capable, advancements in inference efficiency are just as transformative ‚Äì because intelligence only matters when you can deliver it swiftly, cost-effectively, and at scale.

Speculative decoding is typically not beneficial in pure throughput- or compute-bound settings, where GPUs are fully saturated. However, in reinforcement learning (RL) training, the situation can be different. Agent RL training often operates with small batch sizes and CPU-driven environment steps, where each agent waits for model outputs to do the next action. In this regime, endpoint latency (tokens per second per request) becomes the bottleneck. This makes speculative decoding highly applicable for RL training, if there is a suitable and high performant speculator. Faster decoding pipeline can improve CPU utilization and overall sample throughput.&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><p>[1] Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads</p><p>[2] SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding for Interactive LLM Inference on Consumer Devices</p><p>[3] Ladder-Residual: Parallelism-Aware Architecture for Accelerating Large Model Inference with Communication Overlapping&nbsp;</p><p>[4] TEAL: Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Model</p><p>[5] The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models</p><p>[6] SEQUOIA: Scalable and Robust Speculative Decoding</p><p>[7] Mixture-of-Agents Alignment: Harnessing the Collective Intelligence of Open-Source LLMs to Improve Post-Training</p><p>[8] Boosting DeepSeek-R1‚Äôs Speed with Customized Speculative Decoding</p><p>[9] DeepSWE: Training a Fully Open-sourced, State-of-the-Art Coding Agent by Scaling RL </p><p>‚Äç</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/">bent the knee</a> for months, leaving many commentators to ask why. But the reasons are not mysterious: Apple <em>wants</em> things that only the government can provide, things that will defend and extend its power to extract rents, rather than innovate. Namely, selective exemption from tariffs and an end to the spectre of pro-competition regulation that might bring real browser choice in the US, the EU, and around the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/apples-antitrust-playbook/">Over the past few weeks,</a> Tim Apple got a lot what he paid for,<sup><a href="#fn-bonus-treats-1" id="fnref-bonus-treats-1">1</a></sup> with the full weight of the US foreign and industrial policy apparatus <a href="https://on.ft.com/4h8bcXt">threatening the EU over <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> enforcement.</a> This has been part of a full-court press from Cupertino. Apple <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250925-apple-asks-eu-to-scrap-landmark-digital-competition-law">simultaneously threatened the EU</a> while rolling out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damiengeradin_can-small-tech-survive-the-digital-markets-activity-7376973488991137792-M_kG">fresh astroturf for pliant regulators to recline on.</a> This is loud, coordinated, and calculated. But calculated to achieve <em>what</em>? Why is the <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> such a threat to Apple?</p>
<p>Interoperability.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> holds the power to unlock true, safe, interoperability via the web. It's core terms <em>require</em> that Apple facilitate real browser engine choice, and <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-at-the-eu-parliament-dma-working-group/#browser-engines-and-the-dma">Apple is all but refusing,</a> playing games to prevent powerful and safe iOS browsers and the powerful web applications they facilitate. Web applications <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/the-web-is-the-app-store/">that can challenge the App Store.</a></p>
<p>Unlike tariffs, which present a threat to short-term profits through higher costs and suppression of upgrades in the near term, interoperability is a larger and more insidious boogeyman for Apple. It could change <em>everything</em>.</p>
<h2 id="who's-afraid-of-the-big-bad-web%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#who's-afraid-of-the-big-bad-web%3F">Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Web?</a></h2>
<p>Apple's profits are less and less attributable to innovation as <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/14629/apple-services-revenue/?srsltid=AfmBOooHzmlC-KPd9ujiOzEs1lHlaFUDUIsOEC8ODn32ops-5dUK73s_">‚Äúservices‚Äù revenue swells Cupertino's coffers out of all proportion to iPhone sales volume.</a> ‚ÄúServices‚Äù is code for rent extraction from captive users and developers. If they could acquire and make safe apps outside the App Store, Apple wouldn't be able to take 30% from an outlandishly large fraction of the digital ecosystem's wealthiest players.</p>
<p>Apple understands browser choice is a threat to its <em>rentier</em> model. The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> holds the potential for developers to finally access the safe, open, and interoperable web technologies that power most desktop computing today. This is a <em>particular</em> threat to Apple, because its class-leading hardware is perfectly suited to running web applications. This helps to explain why Apple simultaneously demands control over all browser technology on iOS while <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">delaying</a>, <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/history-of-safari-show-stoppers/">constantly breaking</a> foundational <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/web-push-ios-one-year/">web APIs</a>, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/cupertinos-comforting-myths/">gaslighting developers about Apple's unwillingness to solve pressing problems.</a></p>
<p>Keeping capable, stable, high-quality browsers away from iOS is necessary to maintain the App Store's monopoly on the features every app needs. Keeping other software distribution mechanisms from offering those features at a lower price is a hard requirement for Cupertino's extractive business model. The web (in particular, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/"><abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr></a>) present a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Unlike alternative app stores that let developers decouple distributing proprietary apps from Apple's App Store, <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> free developers from building for each OS at all, allowing them to deliver apps though a zero-cost cost platform that builds on standardised APIs. For small developers, this is transformative, and it's why late-stage Apple cannot abide laws that create commercial fairness and enable safe, secure, pro-user alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="dots-unconnected" tabindex="-1"><a href="#dots-unconnected">Dots Unconnected</a></h2>
<p>This is what Apple is mortgaging its brand (or, if you prefer, soul) to prevent: a world where users have a real choice in browsers.</p>
<p>Horrors.</p>
<p>Apple is loaning its monopoly on iOS software to <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">yet another</a> authoritarian regime without a fight, painting a stark contrast: when profits are on the line, Cupertino will gaslight democratic regulators and defy pro-user laws with all the $1600/hr lawyers Harvard can graduate. And when it needs a transactional authoritarian's help to make that happen, temporarily<sup><a href="#fn-it-hopes-2" id="fnref-it-hopes-2">2</a></sup> loaning out Apple's godlike power over iOS devices to censor clearly protected speech isn't too much to ask. Struggle for thee, but not for me.</p>
<p>The kicker is that the only alternative for affected users and developers is Apple's web apps implementation; the same platform Cupertino serially knee-caps to deflect competition with its high-tax offerings.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say the tech press is letting democracy down by failing to connect the dots. Why is Apple capitulating? Because Apple <em>wants things</em> from the government. What are those things? We should be deep into that debate, but our <em>reportage</em> and editorial classes cannot seem to grasp that A precedes B. The obvious answers are also the right ones: selective protection from tariffs, defanged prosecution by the DOJ, and an umbrella from the EU's democratic, pro-competition regulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism">The Verge tiptoed <em>ever so close</em> to getting it,</a> quoting <a href="https://wileyhodges.substack.com/p/my-email-to-tim-cook?r=qlwt">letters that former Apple executives sent the company:</a><sup><a href="#fn-servile-frames-3" id="fnref-servile-frames-3">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to believe that Apple were unequivocally ‚Äòthe good guys,‚Äô‚Äù Hodges writes. ‚ÄúI passionately advocated for people to understand Apple as being on the side of its users above all else. I now feel like I must question that.‚Äù</p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism" taget="_blank">‚Äî Wiley Hodges,<br>"The Verge"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>This is a clue; a lead that a more thoughtful press and tech commentariat could use to evaluate the frames the parties deploy to their own benefit.</p>
<h2 id="%22who-should-rule%3F%22" tabindex="-1"><a href="#%22who-should-rule%3F%22"><em>"Who should rule?"</em></a></h2>
<p>The tech press is failing to grasp the moral stakes of API access. Again and again they flunk at connecting boring questions of who can write and distribute programs that use particular capabilities of phones to urgent issues of power over publication and control of devices. By declining to join these threads, they allow the unearned and increasingly indefensible power of mobile OS vendors to proliferate. The urgent question is how that power can be attenuated, or as Poppper put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must ask whether‚Ä¶we should not prepare for the worst leaders, and hope for the best. But this leads to a new approach to the problem of politics, for it forces us to replace the question: <strong>"Who should rule?"</strong> by the new question: <strong>"How can we so organize political institutions that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage?"</strong></p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.59272/page/n135/mode/1up" taget="_blank">‚Äî Karl Popper,<br>"The Open Society and Its Enemies"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>But the tech press does not ask these questions.</p>
<p>Instead of questioning why Apple's OS is so fundamentally insecure that an App Store is necessary, they accept the ever-false idea that iOS has been relatively secure <em>because</em> of the App Store.</p>
<p>Instead of confronting Apple with the reality that it used the App Store to hand out privacy-invading APIs in undisciplined ways to unscrupulous actors, it congratulates Cupertino on the next episode of our <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/08/apple-vs-fb-kayfabe/">nightly kayfabe.</a> The links between Apple's monopoly on sensitive APIs and the growth of monopolies in adjacent sectors are rarely, if ever, questioned. Far too often, the tech press accepts the narrative structure of Apple's marketing, satisfying pangs of journalistic conscience with largely ineffectual discussions about specific features that will not upset the power balance.</p>
<p>Nowhere, e.g., in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism">The Verge's coverage of these letters</a> is there a discussion about alternatives to the App Store. Only a few outlets ever press Apple on its suppression of web apps, including failure to add <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> install banners and essential capabilities. It's not an <em>Apple vs. Google</em> horse-race story, and so discussion of power distribution doesn't get coverage.</p>
<p>Settling for occasionally embarrassing Apple into partially reversing its most visibly egregious actions is ethically and morally stunted. Accepting the frame of <em>"who should rule?"</em> that Cupertino reflexively deploys is toxic to any hope of worthwhile technology because it creates and celebrates the idea of kings, leaving us supine relative to the mega-corps in our phones.</p>
<p>This is, in a word, childish.</p>
<p>Adults understand that things are complicated, that even the best intentioned folks get things wrong, or can go astray in larger ways. We build institutions and technologies to protect ourselves and those we love from the worst impacts of those events, and those institutions <em>always</em> model struggles over power and authority. And if we are lucky enough to build well, we build balanced systems that attenuate any attempts at over authoritarianism.</p>
<p>In other words, the exact opposite of Apple's infantilising and authoritarian world view.</p>
<p>Instead of debating which wealthy vassals might be more virtuous than the current rulers, we should instead focus on attenuating the power of these monarchical, centralising actors. The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> is doing this, creating the conditions for interoperability, and through interoperability, competition. Apple know it, and <em>that's</em> why they're willing to pawn their own dignity, along with the rights of fellow Americans, to snuff out the threat.</p>
<p>These are not minor points. Apple has <em>power</em>, and that power comes from its effective monopoly on the APIs that make applications possible on the most important computing platform of our adult lives.</p>
<p>Protecting this power has become an end unto itself, curdling the pro-social narratives Apple takes pains to identify itself with. Any reporter that bothers to do <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/balancing-security-and-fair-competition/">what a scrappy band of web developers have done</a> ‚Äî to actually <em>read</em> the self-contradictory tosh Apple flings at regulators and legislators around the world ‚Äî would have been better prepared for this moment. They would be able to pattern match; to see that twisting words to defend the indefensible isn't somehow alien to Apple. It's not even unusual.</p>
<p>But The Verge, 404, and even Wired are declining to connect the dots. If our luminaries can't or won't dig in, what hope do less thoughtful publications with wider audiences have?</p>
<p>Apple's power and profits have made it an enemy of democracy and civic rights at home and abroad. A mealy-mouthed tech press that cannot see or say the obvious is worse than useless; it is an ally in Apple's attempts to obfuscate.</p>
<p>The most important story about smartphones for at least the past decade has been <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">Cupertino's suppression of the web,</a> because that is a true threat to the App Store, and Apple's power flows from <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/apples-crimes-against-the-internet-community/#apple's-unique-monopoly">the monopolies</a> it braids together. As Cory Doctorow observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple's story ‚Äì the story of all centralized, authoritarian technology ‚Äì is that you have to trade freedom for security. If you want technology that Just Works(TM), you need to give up on the idea of being able to override the manufacturer's decisions. It's always prix-fixe, never a la carte.</p>
<p>This is a kind of vulgar Thatcherism, a high-tech version of her maxim that "there is no alternative." Decomposing the iPhone into its constituent parts ‚Äì thoughtful, well-tested technology; total control by a single vendor ‚Äì is posed as a logical impossibility, like a demand for water that's not wet</p>

<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">Doctorow's piece</a> on these outrages is a must-read, as it does what so many in the tech press fail to attempt: connecting patterns of behaviour over time and geography to make sense of Apple's capitulation. It also burrows into the rot at the heart of the App Store: the claim that anybody should have as much power as Apple has arrogated to itself.</p>
<p>We can see clearly now that this micro-authoritarian structure is easily swayed by macro-authoritarians, and bends easily to those demands. As James C. Scott <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/csunstei/moreisless.html">discusses</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that many of the most tragic episodes of state development in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries originate in a particularly pernicious combination of three elements. The first is the aspiration to the administrative ordering of nature and society, an aspiration that we have already seen at work in scientific forestry, but one raised to a far more comprehensive and ambitious level. ‚ÄúHigh modernism‚Äù seems an appropriate term for this aspiration. As a faith, it was shared by many across a wide spectrum of political ideologies. Its main carriers and exponents were the avant-garde among engineers, planners, technocrats, high-level administrators, architects, scientists, and visionaries.</p>
<p>If one were to imagine a pantheon or Hall of Fame of high-modernist figures, it would almost certainly include such names as Henri Comte de Saint-Simon, Le Corbusier, Walther Rathenau, Robert McNamara, Robert Moses, Jean Monnet, the Shah of Iran, David Lilienthal, Vladimir I. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Julius Nyerere. They envisioned a sweeping, rational engineering of all aspects of social life in order to improve the human condition.</p>
<p><span>        ‚Äî James C. Scott,<br>"Seeing Like A State"      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>This is also Apple's vision for the iPhone; an unshakeable belief in its own rightness and transformative power for good. Never mind all the folks that get hurt along the way, it is good <em>because Apple does it</em>. There is no claim more central to the mythos of Apple's marketing wing, and no deception more empowering to abusers of power.<sup><a href="#fn-self-deception-4" id="fnref-self-deception-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Apple claims to stand for open societies, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does"><abbr title="the Purpose Of the System Is What It Does">POSIWID</abbr></a> shows that to be a lie. It is not just corrupted, but itself has become corrupting; a corrosive influence on the day-to-day activities and right necessary to engage in democracy and the rule-of-law.</p>
<p>Apple's Le Corbusierian addiction to control has not pushed it into an alliance with those resisting oppression, but into open revolt against efforts that would make the iPhone an asset for citizens exercising their legitimate rights to aid the powerless. It scuttles and undermines open technologies that would aid dissidents. It bends the knee to tyranny <em>because</em> unchecked power helps Cupertino stave off competition, preserving (it thinks) a space for its own messianic vision of technology to lift others out of perdition.</p>
<p>If the consequences were not so dire, it would be tragically funny.</p>
<p>Let's hope our tech press find their nerve, and a copy of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691210841/the-open-society-and-its-enemies?srsltid=AfmBOopVprr3l-dLq6nmTTkWDK_rxxVEMN3_FgaZa5135_Qjfrp4UpgY"><em>‚ÄúThe Open Society and Its Enemies,"</em></a> before we lose the ability to laugh.</p>
<h2 id="endnote%3A-let's-talk-about-google" tabindex="-1"><a href="#endnote%3A-let's-talk-about-google">Endnote: Let's Talk About Google</a></h2>
<p>I spent a dozen and change years at Google, and my greatest disappointment in leadership over those years was the way the founders coddled the Android team's similarly authoritarian vision.</p>
<p>For the price of a prominent search box on every phone,<sup><a href="#fn-green-thumb-power-5" id="fnref-green-thumb-power-5">5</a></sup> the senior leadership (including Sundar) were willing to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/in-court-filing-google-concedes-the-open-web-is-in-rapid-decline/">sow the seeds of the web's obsolescence,</a> handing untold power to Andy Rubin's team of Java zealots. It was no secret that they sought to displace the web as the primary way for users to experience computing, substituting proprietary APIs for open platforms along the way.</p>
<p>With the growth of Android, Play grew in influence, thanks growing revenue and a need to cover for Android's original sins,<sup><a href="#fn-rotten-to-the-roots-6" id="fnref-rotten-to-the-roots-6">6</a></sup> leading to a series of subtler, but no less effective, tactics that dovetailed with Apple's suppression of the web on iOS. The <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/trusted-web-activities">back doors</a> and <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">exotic hoops</a> developers must jump through to gain distribution for interoperable apps remains a scandal.</p>
<p>But more than talking about Google and what it has done, we should talk about how we <em>talk about</em> Google. In specific, how the lofty goals of its Search origins were undercut by those anti-social, anti-user failures in Android and Play.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that Google is <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/google-must-share-the-ability-to-install-web-apps-in-android/">playing disingenuous games</a> around providing access to competitors regarding web apps on Android, while simultaneously pushing to expand its control over app distribution. The Play team covet what Apple have, and far from exhibiting any self-awareness of their own culpability, are <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal">content to discredit</a> whatever brand reputation Google may have left so long as it can expand its ability to tax software.</p>
<p>And nobody can claim that power is <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/following-apple-google-pulls-ice-spotting-app-red-dot-from-play-store/">being used for good.</a></p>
<p>Google is not creating moral distance between itself and Apple, or seeking to help developers build <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> to steer around the easily-censored channels it markets, and totally coincidentally, taxes.<sup><a href="#fn-knock-off-objectionability-7" id="fnref-knock-off-objectionability-7">7</a></sup> Google is Apple's collaborator in capitulation. A dark moral void, trotting out the same, tired tactic of hiding behind Apple's skirt whenever questions about the centralising and authoritarian tendencies of App Store monopolies crop up. For 15 years, Android has been content to pen 1-pagers for knock-off versions of whatever Apple shipped last year, including authoritarian-friendly acquiescence.</p>
<p>Play is now the primary software acquisition channel for most users around the world, and that should cause our tech press to <em>intensify</em> scrutiny of these actions, but that's not how Silicon Valley's wealth-pilled technorati think, talk, or write. The Bay Area's moral universe extends the wall of the privilege bubble, and we don't talk about the consequences of enshittified, trickle-down tech, or even bother to look hard at it. That would require using Android and‚Ä¶like‚Ä¶ew.</p>
<p>Far from brave truth-telling, the tech press we have today treats the tech the other half (ok, 80%) use as a curio; a destination to gawp at on safari, rather than a geography whose residents are just as worthy of dignity and respect as any other. And that's how Google is getting away with shocking acts of despicable cowardice, but with a fraction of the negative coverage.</p>
<p>And that's a scandal, too.</p>

<p>And can anyone safely claim that, under an administration as nakedly corrupt as Donald Trump's, Apple couldn't buy off the DOJ? And what might the going rate for such policy pliability be?</p>
<p>That we have to ask says everything. <a href="#fnref-bonus-treats-1">‚áê</a></p>

<li id="fn-it-hopes-2"><p>It hopes. <a href="#fnref-it-hopes-2">‚áê</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-servile-frames-3"><p>I don't know Wiley Hodges, but the tone of <a href="https://wileyhodges.substack.com/p/my-email-to-tim-cook?r=qlwt">his letter</a> is everything I expect from Apple employees attempting to convince their (now ex-)bosses of anything: over-the-top praise combined with overt appeals to the brand as the thing of value. At times it verges on hagiography. Again, this is how I understand Apple to discuss Apple to Apple, not just the outside world. I have no doubt that this sort of sickly sweet presentation is absolutely necessary for even moderate criticism to be legible when directed up the chain. Autocracies are not given to debate, and Apple is nothing if not autocratic.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/175654914">follow-up post is more open and honest,</a> and that's commendable. You quickly grasp that he's struggling with some level of deprogramming now that he's on the outside and can only extend the benefit of the doubt towards FruitCo as far as the available evidence allows. Like the rest of us, he's discovering that Apple is demanding far more trust than its actions can justify. He's rightly disappointed that Apple isn't living up to the implications <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">of its stated ideals,</a> and that the stated justifications seem uncomfortably <em>ad hoc</em>, if not self-serving.</p>
<p>This discomfort stems from the difference between principle and PR.</p>
<p>Principles construct tests with which we must wrestle. Marketing creates frames that cast one party as an unambiguous hero. I've often joked that Apple is a marketing firm with an engineering side gig, and this is never more obvious than in the stark differences between <em>communicated</em> choices and <em>revealed</em> outcomes.</p>
<p>No large western company exerts deeper control over its image, prying deep into the personal lives of its employees in domineering ways to protect its own image from (often legitimate) critique that might undermine the message of the day. Every Apple employeed not named "Tim" submits to an authoritarian regime all day, every day. It's no wonder that the demands of power come so easily to the firm. All of this is done to maintain the control that allows Marketing to cast Apple's image in a light that makes it the obvious answer to <em>"who should rule?"</em></p>
<p>But as we know, that question is itself the problem.</p>
<p>Reading these posts, I really feel for the guy, and wish him luck in convincing Apple to change course. If (as seems likely) it does not, I would encourage him to re-read that same <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">Human Rights Policy</a> again and then ask: "<em>is this document a statement of principle or is it marketing?</em>" <a href="#fnref-servile-frames-3">‚áê</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-self-deception-4"><p>The cultish belief that <em>"it is good because we do it"</em> is first and foremost a self-deception. It's so much easier to project confidence in this preposterous proposition when the messenger themselves is a convert.</p>
<p>The belief that <em>"we should rule"</em> is only possible to sustain among thoughtful people once the question <em>"who should rule?"</em> is deeply engrained. No wonder, then, that the firm works so dang hard to market its singular virtue to the internal, captive audience. <a href="#fnref-self-deception-4">‚áê</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-green-thumb-power-5"><p>Control over search entry points is the purest commercial analogue in Android to green/blue messages on iOS. Both work to dig moats around commodity services, erecting barriers to switching away from the OS's provider, and both have been fantastically successful in tamping down competition. <a href="#fnref-green-thumb-power-5">‚áê</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-rotten-to-the-roots-6"><p>It will never cease to be a scandal that Android's singular success metric in the Andy Rubin years was ‚Äúactivations.‚Äù The idea that more handsets running Android was success is a direct parallel to Zuckerberg-brain fantasies about ‚Äúconnection‚Äù is somehow an unalloyed good.</p>
<p>These are facially infantile metrics, but Google management allowed it to continue well past the sell-by date, with predictably horrendous consequences for user privacy and security. Play, and specifically the hot-potato of "GMS Core" (a.k.a., "Play Services") were tasked with covering for the perenially out of date OSes running on client devices. That situation is scarcely better today. At last check, the ecosystem remains desperately fragemented, with huge numbers of users on outdated and fundamentally insecure releases. Google has gone so far as to remove these statistics from it's public documentation site to avoid the press asking uncomfortable qeustions. Insecurity in service of growth is Android's most lasting legacy.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Andy Rubin saw the web as a threat to his growth ambitions, working to undermine it as a competitor at every step. Some day the full story of how <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> came to be will be told, but suffice to say, Android's rabid accolytes within the company did everything they could to prevent them, and when that was no longer possible, to slow their spread. <a href="#fnref-rotten-to-the-roots-6">‚áê</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-knock-off-objectionability-7"><p>Don't worry, though, Play doesn't tax developers <em>as</em> much as Apple. So Google are the good guys. Right?</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli spyware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NSO Group</a> has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz&nbsp;told TechCrunch on Friday that ‚Äúan American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>







<p>Confirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1jgvmitgx#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calcalist reported</a> Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are. &nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,‚Äù said Hershowitz. ‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments ‚Äúoff the record,‚Äù which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is publishing the responses as there was no agreement made.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2023, <a href="http://theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/nso-group-spyware-pegasus-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Guardian reported</a> that Simonds and an associate, through their investment firm, were exploring making a bid to take control of NSO. The deal never materialized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO‚Äôs co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie‚Äôs involvement with the spyware maker will end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-from-a-u-s-ban-to-u-s-ownership-nbsp">From a U.S. ban to U.S. ownership&nbsp;</h2>

<p>NSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Researchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto‚Äôs Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, <a href="https://github.com/GranittHQ/data-pegasus-victims/blob/main/data-pegasus-victims.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have for years documented dozens of cases</a> where NSO‚Äôs government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/27/spyware-diplomats-us-pegasus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was caught in 2021</a> targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the U.S. Commerce Department banned</a> American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/20/nso-group-pegasus-trump-eo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tried to get off the U.S. government‚Äôs blocklist,</a> as recently as May 2025, with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the help of a lobbying firm</a> tied to the Trump administration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO‚Äôs spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúNSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?‚Äù said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúGoing further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities.&nbsp;This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO‚Äôs ownership has exchanged hands before. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally founded by Niv Karmi,&nbsp;Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie,&nbsp;NSO Group was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/12/01/this-spy-tool-can-find-you-with-just-a-telephone-number-and-25-countries-own-it-warn-researchers/?sh=7d4b92b6331e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a> by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="what-is-pipelining-in-postgres">What is pipelining in Postgres?</h2>

<p>Pipelining is a client-side feature supported by the network protocol
that basically consists of
not waiting for the results of previously sent queries before sending the next.
This increases the throughput in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The client, network and server can work in parallel. For instance,
the network may transmit the results of the (N-1)th query while the
server executes the Nth query and the client sends the (N+1)th query,
all this at the same time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The network is better utilized because successive queries can be
grouped in the same network packets, resulting in less packets
overall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pipelining is possible since version 7.4 (released in 2003), which introduced
the extended query protocol. But it‚Äôs only since 2021, with PostgreSQL 14,
that it can be used through libpq, the client-side C library.
Since then, some libpq-based drivers like <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/advanced/pipeline.html">psycopg3</a> have started to support it.</p>

<p>With <strong>PostgreSQL 18</strong>, released last week, <code>psql</code>, the command line client
comes equipped with commands to use pipelining in SQL scripts, making it
even more accessible.
While this addition is not part of the highlighted features of that release,
it can provide huge gains in query throughput, as we‚Äôre going to see in a simple
test.</p>

<h2 id="psql-commands">psql commands</h2>

<p>The pipeline is started with <code>\startpipeline</code>, and in the most simple case, followed
by the SQL queries and ended with <code>\endpipeline</code>.
If intermediate results are needed, we can use <code>\syncpipeline</code> to force a 
synchronisation point and <code>\getresults</code> to fetch all results up to that point.
Also, starting a pipeline creates an implicit transaction. If a query fails,
all the changes since the start (or before the last synchronization point) will
be rolled back.</p>

<p>If you know about the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMAND-SEMICOLON"><code>\;</code> syntax</a> to group several queries in the same request, there are similarities between this technique and pipelining: they‚Äôre both used to reduce server round-trips and have the same semantics with regard to transactions. In a way, pipelining is the evolution in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY">extended query protocol</a> of what multi-statement queries (<code>\;</code> in psql) are in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-SIMPLE-QUERY">simple query protocol</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performance-test">Performance test</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs do a simple test where data from devices are imported
with <code>INSERT ... ON CONFLICT</code> queries. Same-device same-date does update the row,
otherwise it inserts a new row.
Note that if we wanted to unconditionally append all rows,
<code>COPY</code> would be preferable and pipelining not necessary, which is why
the more sophisticated insert-or-update is chosen for that test.</p>

<p>The following bash code imports the (random) data, with or without the pipelining
depending on a parameter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function </span>import_data
<span>{</span>

<p>Let‚Äôs try this with batches of 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000 rows, with and
without pipelining, and compare how fast these batches are processed.</p>

<p>Also, since the network speed matters a lot here, let‚Äôs try with three
typical kinds of network connections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>localhost (ping time ~ 0.04ms): client and server are on the same host.</li>
  <li>LAN (ping time ~ 1ms): client and server are separated only by an Ethernet 1GB/s switch.</li>
  <li>WAN (ping time ~ 4ms): the server is reached through a public Internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, each case is run 5 times and we keep only the median time of the runs.</p>

<p><img src="https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/assets/img/pipeline-psql-localhost-graph.png" alt="graph localhost"></p>

<p>On the same host, the pipeline acceleration ranges from 1.5x for the smallest batch size, up to 5x.</p>

<p><img src="https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/assets/img/pipeline-psql-lan-graph.png" alt="graph LAN"></p>

<p>On a local network connection, the smallest batch size is accelerated by 2.6x, and it goes up to 42x with the bigger sizes.</p>

<p><img src="https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/assets/img/pipeline-psql-wan-graph.png" alt="psql WAN"></p>

<p>On the slowest network, it‚Äôs even more impressive. The acceleration is between 5.4x and 71x !</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These accelerations show how under-utilized the network is when we
send batches of small queries without pipelining: the network packets
are like 50 seater buses that ride with only one passenger.</p>

<p>In our example, all we have to do to optimize on that front
is to add a pair of <code>\startpipeline</code> and <code>\endpipeline</code>.
That‚Äôs because our queries do not depend on the results of previous queries
of the same batch, except in the sense that if one fails, the entire batch fails.</p>

<p>Without pipelining, we could still optimize our test by adding many
rows to the <code>VALUES</code> clauses for each query instead of one row per
query. But it‚Äôs not easy to find the sweet spot for how many data rows
there needs to be per query, and large queries with thousands of parameters
are not the nicest to handle on the server side.
Also, if the client-side logic is more complicated, for instance
conditionally targeting several tables, running simple statements in
a pipeline while using row-by-row logic might be much easier.</p>

<p>The pipelining meta-commands were added in psql version 18, but they do not
require PostgreSQL 18 on the server side. For those interested in this feature
who can‚Äôt upgrade their server soon, you can still upgrade to the latest
version of psql: it‚Äôs backward-compatible as much as possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-plugin-id="text-block">
          <p>In advance of President Donald Trump‚Äôs upcoming visit to South Korea later this month‚Äîwhere he is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time since 2019‚ÄîChina announced that it has expanded its restrictions on rare earth and permanent magnet exports. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce‚Äôs <a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html">Announcement No. 61 of 2025</a> implements the strictest rare earth and permanent magnet export controls to date. The move both strengthens Beijing‚Äôs leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting U.S. efforts to bolster its industrial base.</p><p><strong>Q1: What is new about today‚Äôs rare earth and permanent magnet export restrictions?</strong></p><p><strong>A1:</strong> The new export controls mark the first time China has applied the foreign direct product rule (FDPR)‚Äîa mechanism introduced in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-is-fdpr-why-is-us-using-it-cripple-chinas-tech-sector-2022-10-07/">1959</a> and long used by Washington to restrict <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2334d3d9-d744-4d1f-94cc-e328968b41ce">semiconductor exports</a> to China. The FDPR enables the United States to regulate the sale of foreign-made products if they incorporate U.S. technology, software, or equipment, even when produced by non-U.S. companies abroad. In effect, if U.S. technology appears anywhere in the supply chain, Washington can assert jurisdiction.</p><p>Under the measures announced today, foreign firms will now be required to obtain Chinese government approval to export magnets that contain even trace amounts of Chinese-origin rare earth materials‚Äîor that were produced using Chinese mining, processing, or magnet-making technologies. The new licensing framework will apply to foreign-produced rare earth magnets and select semiconductor materials that contain at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/business/china-rare-earth-exports.html">0.1 percent</a> heavy rare earth elements sourced from China.</p><p>Given China‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c4b2c5d9-c82f-401e-b763-bc9581019cb7">dominance</a> in the sector‚Äîaccounting for roughly 70 percent of rare earth mining, 90 percent of separation and processing, and 93 percent of magnet manufacturing‚Äîthese developments will have major national security implications.</p><p><strong>Q2: What do the new restrictions mean for the defense and semiconductor industries?</strong></p><p><strong>A2</strong>: Rare earths are crucial for various <a href="https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/#:~:text=The%20F%2D35%2C%20for%20instance,class%20submarine%20needs%209%2C200%20pounds.">defense technologies</a>, including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. The United States is already struggling to keep pace in the production of these systems. Meanwhile, China is rapidly scaling up its munitions manufacturing capacity and acquiring advanced weapons platforms and equipment at a rate estimated to be <a href="https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/">five to six times faster</a> than that of the United States.</p><p>The newly announced restrictions represent China‚Äôs most consequential measures to date targeting the defense sector. Under the new rules, starting December 1, 2025, companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries‚Äîincluding those of the United States‚Äîwill be largely denied export licenses. The Ministry of Commerce also made clear that any requests to use rare earths for military purposes will be automatically rejected. In effect, the policy seeks to prevent direct or indirect contributions of Chinese-origin rare earths or related technologies to foreign defense supply chains.</p><p>Even before these latest measures, the U.S. defense industrial base <a href="https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/">faced significant challenges</a> and had limited production capacity and limited ability to rapidly scale to meet rising defense technology needs. The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions">capability gap</a> and allowing China to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the United States at a time when tension is rising in the Indo-Pacific region.</p><p>Additionally, export license applications for rare earth materials used in highly advanced technologies, including sub-14-nanometer semiconductors, next-generation memory chips, semiconductor manufacturing or testing equipment, will now be subject to case-by-case review by Chinese authorities. Companies will likely need to provide detailed documentation on end users, technical specifications, and intended applications before any export is authorized. The individualized review process gives Chinese authorities significant discretion to delay, deny, or condition exports, effectively introducing a new layer of strategic control over the global supply of rare earth inputs critical to advanced computing and defense technologies.</p><p><strong>Q3: How is China tightening control over the outflow of its skills and technologies?</strong></p><p><strong>A3:</strong> Under the new measures, Chinese nationals are barred from engaging in or providing support for overseas projects involving rare earth exploration, extraction, processing, or magnet manufacturing unless they first obtain explicit authorization from Chinese authorities. By tightening control over the movement of expertise, China aims to prevent the outflow of proprietary technologies and know-how that have made it the global leader in rare earth mining and magnet production. These restrictions build on the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means">rare earth processing technology export ban</a> in December 2023.</p><p><strong>Q4: Why are the new export restrictions likely a negotiation tactic?</strong></p><p><strong>A4: </strong>In its <a href="https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_16a0593dcadd4030959c3691cf39bb26.html">announcement</a>, the Ministry of Commerce stated that China remains open to enhancing communication and cooperation with other countries through both multilateral and bilateral export control dialogues. The ministry emphasized that such dialogue seeks to promote compliant trade while protecting the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.</p><p><strong>Q5: How do these restrictions build on China‚Äôs earlier rare earth export controls?</strong></p><p><strong>A5: </strong>The new measures mark a sharp escalation in Beijing‚Äôs long-running strategy to weaponize its dominance in rare earths. China&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means">announced&nbsp;</a>a ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies on&nbsp;December 21, 2023. On April 4, 2025, the Ministry of Commerce <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions">introduced</a> export restrictions on seven rare earth elements in retaliation for President Trump‚Äôs new tariffs on Chinese goods.</p><p>Subsequent diplomacy offered only a temporary reprieve. During the May 11 <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access">talks</a> in Switzerland, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, which included removing U.S. companies from China‚Äôs trade blacklist and restoring their access to rare earth supplies. Yet stability proved short-lived: U.S. manufacturers soon began shutting down production amid ongoing shortages, as China delayed the issuance of export licenses despite not formally abandoning the deal. Tensions flared again when President Trump accused Beijing of backtracking on its commitments. Ultimately, on June 11, 2025, following two days of negotiations in London attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, both sides <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access">reached</a> a new trade framework‚Äîbut the episode underscored how Beijing‚Äôs rare earth policy has evolved into a potent instrument of economic and geopolitical leverage.</p><p><strong>Q6: What is the United States doing to build its rare earth and permanent magnet capabilities to reduce China‚Äôs leverage?</strong></p><p><strong>A6:</strong> Noveon Magnetics&nbsp;is currently the only manufacturer of rare earth magnets in the United States. This week, Noveon Magnetics and Lynas Rare Earths announced a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic partnership focused on building a scalable, domestic supply chain for rare earth permanent magnets in the United States.</p><p>In July 2025, as part of a landmark agreement, the Department of Defense (recently renamed the Department of War) invested $400 million in equity into MP Materials, making the U.S. government the company‚Äôs largest shareholder. The deal also includes a 10-year price floor commitment of $110 per kilogram for MP Materials‚Äô NdPr (neodymium-praseodymium) products, designed to protect the commercial viability of the company amidst low prices stemming from Chinese overproduction. Additionally, the Department of War‚Äôs Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) has extended a $150 million loan to expand MP Materials‚Äô Mountain Pass, California, facility, adding heavy rare earth separation capabilities to strengthen domestic processing capacity. MP Materials has also announced plans to build its second U.S. magnet manufacturing facility, known as the ‚Äú10X Facility.‚Äù The Department of War has entered into a 10-year offtake agreement for 100 percent of the facility‚Äôs magnet output. It will take time to ramp up these capabilities. Until then, China retains a significant amount of leverage over supply chains crucial for national and economic security.</p><p><em>Gracelin Baskaran is director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</em></p>

<h2 id="23---primetime-release">23 - Primetime Release</h2>

<p>Hey there! Welcome back!</p>

<p>This last year has been a whirlwind to say the least, but we have remained dedicated to bringing
an updated LineageOS based on Android 16 to the masses!</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been hard at work rebasing all of our changes and features since Android 16‚Äôs release in June.
Android 16‚Äôs first release mainly contained iterative improvements and some UI/UX refinements, but
due to our previous efforts adapting to Google‚Äôs UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14,
we were able to rebase onto Android 16‚Äôs code-base faster than anticipated. Yes you read that right:
We‚Äôre early this year!</p>

<p>Other components have complicated our release and security patching efforts, but we‚Äôll get to that
shortly.</p>

<h3 id="googles-patch-cadence-and-lineageos-going-forward">Google‚Äôs Patch Cadence, and LineageOS Going Forward</h3>

<h4 id="firstly-what-even-is-an-asb-or-a-qpr">Firstly, what even is an ASB? Or a QPR?</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ASB (Android Security Bulletin)</strong> ‚Äì Google‚Äôs monthly roundup of newly fixed security
vulnerabilities across the Android ecosystem. Distributed as a list of patches and security branch
updates for older but still supported Android versions, with the current version tagged monthly.
These updates let projects like ours and OEMs stay aligned with Google‚Äôs security baseline.</li>
  <li><strong>QPR (Quarterly Platform Release)</strong> ‚Äì Mid-cycle updates to a given Android version, landing every
few months. QPRs bring not just security fixes but also bug fixes, performance improvements, and
feature changes (like Material 3 Expressive in 16 QPR1).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="okay-why-are-you-telling-me-this">Okay, why are you telling me this?</h4>

<p>You‚Äôll notice we are choosing to release LineageOS 23.0, and not 23.1. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs based on
Android 16‚Äôs initial release (what we‚Äôll call QPR0), even though QPR1 has already rolled out to
Pixels. The catch? Google never pushed QPR1‚Äôs source to AOSP. They‚Äôve said it‚Äôll come ‚Äúin the coming
weeks‚Äù (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-source-code-delay-3596650/">source</a>),
but right now only contracted partners have access. And to answer the immediate question, the
likelihood that any custom ROM will ever be a contracted Google partner is near 0.</p>

<p>On top of that, Google‚Äôs handling of ASBs has shifted (<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-risk-based-security-updates-3597466/">source</a>). July was empty for the first time since the
program began, August had a single patch, and September omitted patches for several listed
vulnerabilities, with fixes shared privately to partners under embargo. The result is that AOSP
security updates are no longer released in full on a monthly basis. Instead, only vulnerabilities deemed ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù (i.e. actively exploited in the wild)
will be published by Google in the monthly ASBs, and even then, the underlying patches are often not
made public immediately.</p>

<p>On a quarterly cadence, Google now issues larger security bulletins that include patches for
vulnerabilities originally discovered in prior months. These quarterly bulletins coincide with QPRs
(Quarterly Platform Releases), which bundles those security fixes together with feature updates,
but have so far not been pushed to AOSP at the time of release.</p>

<p>This is why you‚Äôve seen the LineageOS 22.2 security patch level remain reflective of August well into September.</p>

<p>In short: this cadence is now the norm, and we need to adapt.</p>

<h4 id="and-i-heard-that-google-stopped-pushing-pixel-source">And I heard that Google stopped pushing Pixel source?</h4>

<p>Yes, Google has pulled back here too. Pixel kernels are now only offered as history-stripped
tarballs, available privately on request, with no device trees, HALs, or configs. Thanks to
projects like <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a>, Pixels will likely remain well supported, but they‚Äôre
no longer guaranteed ‚Äúday one‚Äù devices for LineageOS. Pixel devices are now effectively no easier to
support than any other OEM‚Äôs devices.</p>

<p>In short, this just makes things harder, not impossible.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-this-affect-lineageos-and-me">How does this affect LineageOS? And me?</h4>

<p>It means we adapt. Instead of waiting indefinitely for QPR1‚Äôs source, we‚Äôre shipping 23.0 now on
‚ÄúQPR0‚Äù, with the publicly available ASB patches applied, and we‚Äôll only attest to a security patch
level once we have access to all of its fixes. When QPR1 (and future QPRs) eventually land in AOSP,
we‚Äôll merge or rebase as appropriate.</p>

<p>This does mean some features (like Material 3 Expressive) aren‚Äôt here yet. But it ensures users
get timely builds, the most complete security fixes we can legally access, and a clear path forward
without being stuck in limbo.</p>

<p>This will likely be the expected norm for Android 17 and beyond, so expect more <code>.0</code> releases in the
future!</p>

<h4 id="tldr"><strong>TL;DR</strong>:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Google no longer pushes monthly tags and patches to AOSP; and most fixes/security patches are now
pushed quarterly, if at all.</li>
  <li>Security patch levels may occasionally lag: we only increment them once all patches are public.</li>
  <li>LineageOS 23.0 is based on Android 16 ‚ÄúQPR0‚Äù because QPR1‚Äôs source isn‚Äôt public yet.
    <ul>
      <li>Because of this some headline features (like Material 3 Expressive) will come later, once
sources drop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pixel support continues, but with reduced source access, they‚Äôre no longer guaranteed, let alone
on day one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="legacy-devices">Legacy Devices</h3>

<p>The bad news extends a bit further here, though it‚Äôs less surprising than the earlier sections.</p>

<p>Google‚Äôs increased reliance on newer
<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf"><strong>eBPF</strong></a> features has made supporting
devices with older Linux kernels increasingly difficult. Android 16 ‚ÄúQPR0‚Äù ‚Äúrequires Linux 5.4 and
above, and at the time of writing, the necessary features have only been properly backported as far
back as <code>4.14</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, LineageOS 22.2 still supports many devices running <code>4.4</code> and <code>4.9</code>. As of
now, no complete backports of the required features exist for these kernels. The silver lining is
that, unlike the massive device loss we saw moving off LineageOS 18.1, these versions <em>could</em> be
salvaged if someone were to take on the work of adapting the backports. If you do succeed, please
reach out to devrel(at)lineageos.org, we‚Äôd be happy to review it!</p>

<p>We‚Äôre currently targeting only shipping kernels that have 1:1 eBPF backports to make them feature
equivalent to Linux 5.4 from here on out to avoid compatibility issues.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-good-stuff">Back to the Good Stuff!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Security patches from September 2024 to August 2025 have been merged to LineageOS 20 through 23.0.</li>
  <li>SeedVault and Etar have both been updated to their newest respective upstream version, with
multiple fixes having been sent back to the relevant upstream repos!</li>
  <li>WebView has been updated to Chromium 140.0.7339.51.</li>
  <li>Contributor demon000 (Cosmin Tanislav) has started work on an awesome set of tools to assist
maintainers in device bringups from scratch! They‚Äôre still in-progress, but are staged to make a
lot of our efforts significantly easier and more streamlined - so stay tuned! Maybe a rare

  <li>Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has extended support for various VirtIO configurations
(QEMU/crosvm/UTM/libvirt, etc.) targets! Though these aren‚Äôt supported officially, there is an
awesome, comprehensive guide for building and utilizing these targets on
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>. There is even a newer one allowing you to run
LineageOS in a UTM virtual machine on an
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/utm-vm-on-apple-silicon-mac">Apple Silicon Mac</a>!</li>
  <li>Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has added support for <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/cuttlefish">Cuttlefish</a> targets!</li>
  <li>Contributor 0xCAFEBABE has extended support for devices booting Android on the mainline Linux
kernel! This will allow us to in theory boot LineageOS on almost all devices supported by the
Linux kernel. It‚Äôs in early phases, but very promising, with several successful device ports
already available on the LineageOS GitHub organization! Check the search term ‚Äúmainline‚Äù on the
organization‚Äôs search bar.</li>
  <li>LineageOS is now nearly <code>Android.mk</code> free! Google
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/build/make-to-soong">announced their move</a> from <code>make</code> to
<code>soong</code> many years ago, pushing developers to migrate from Android.mk to Android.bp, and has
started blocking Android.mk in many locations of the source tree.
    <ul>
      <li>While converting these is a seemingly simple task - in practice it involved countless hours of
converting conditional checks, regression testing, and thousands of individual patches. As of
this writing, LineageOS introduces less than 10 Android.mk files at a platform level,
and many of these are in the process of being converted. In short - we‚Äôre ready for when Google
kills support for Android.mk.</li>
      <li>0xCAFEBABE also created a build target for converting from
<a href="https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_build/+/442552">mk to bp</a>, a WIP feature to
assist developers in migrating to soong!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Both the Charging Control, and Fast Charge Control features have received many updates and
improvements.</li>
  <li>A new set of ringtones and alarms from Plasma Mobile have been included.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="application-updates">Application Updates</h3>

<p>LineageOS isn‚Äôt just about the OS itself: our suite of core apps continues to evolve as well. This
cycle brings some major improvements:</p>

<h4 id="aperture-camera">Aperture (Camera)</h4>

<p>Our camera app, Aperture, has been rewritten from the ground up. The rewrite makes the app much
easier to maintain, while also bringing new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for JPEG Ultra HDR, RAW, and simultaneous RAW+JPEG capture.</li>
  <li>A redesigned notification island with dynamic colors, and new indicators (JPEG Ultra HDR, RAW,
battery, thermal throttling).</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep your system updated (or keep updating the app if you‚Äôre using the app standalone), since we
plan to introduce more features and improvements over time (believe it or not, nowadays the only
obstacle is Google‚Äôs CameraX library, <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/364825889">which has slowed down the development of certain components
which we use in Aperture</a>). We do have some plans
to overcome this though.</p>

<h4 id="twelve-music-player">Twelve (Music Player)</h4>

<p>Our music player, Twelve, didn‚Äôt need a full overhaul this year, but it did get some polish and
some new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added a ‚ÄúPlay random songs‚Äù button for quicker library playback.</li>
  <li>Updated the Now Playing screen with playback statistics (for the nerds and audiophiles out
there).</li>
  <li>Added the ability to rescan the local media store, so newly added music shows up without
needing a reboot.</li>
  <li>Expanded Jellyfin integration, including suggestions, favorites, and better thumbnail
handling.</li>
  <li>Added MIDI playback support.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-app-again">New App, Again?</h3>

<p><img src="https://lineageos.org/images/2025-10-11/catapult.webp" alt="catapult"></p>

<p>We‚Äôre excited to debut Catapult, our brand-new custom launcher for Android TV. Catapult is built
with the same principles we bring to the rest of LineageOS: clean, simple, functional design, with
thoughtful user experience at its core.</p>

<p>Why build a new launcher? For years, Android TV and Google TV users have been stuck with preloaded
launchers that aggressively push advertising and recommendations users can‚Äôt control. Catapult
changes that. It strips away the clutter, gives you back your home screen, and lets you decide what
belongs front and center.</p>

<p>With Catapult, you get a fast, intuitive interface that focuses on <em>your</em> apps and <em>your</em> content:
no forced feeds, no ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù rows, just a launcher that works the way you expect.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre also planning to add more features in the future, you‚Äôll see them appear as you keep your
device up to date, stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="extended-qemu-based-virtual-machine-support">Extended QEMU-Based Virtual Machine Support</h3>

<p>LineageOS has long been a favorite for developers and tinkerers, and with 23.0 we‚Äôve expanded
support for virtualized environments. Thanks to extended QEMU integration spearheaded by developer
0xCAFEBABE, it‚Äôs now easier than ever to run LineageOS in VMs for testing, debugging, or just
exploration. This means developers can spin up consistent environments on their desktops without
needing dedicated hardware, and testers can reproduce tricky issues with greater reliability.
Whether you‚Äôre validating patches or just curious to see how LineageOS runs under the hood, the
tooling is smoother and more accessible.</p>

<p>If interested, take a look on <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>. You can run
LineageOS via libvirt on Linux/Windows, and on an
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/utm-vm-on-apple-silicon-mac">Apple Silicon Mac</a> with UTM.</p>

<p>Additionally, LineageOS now supports <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/cuttlefish">Cuttlefish</a>
build configurations, which are similar to the  <code>emulator</code> family of targets, but has extra
emulated peripherals, so as to act more like a real device! You can view a list of all the differences
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/cuttlefish#cuttlefish_and_android_emulator">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mainline-kernel-support">Mainline Kernel Support</h3>

<p>Another big milestone in 23.0 is our improved support for devices running Linux mainline kernels.</p>

<p>While Android has historically relied on heavily modified vendor kernels, the ecosystem is shifting
toward mainline for long-term stability and maintainability.</p>

<p>With 23.0, developer 0xCAFEBABE has spearheaded an effort to extend compatibility for devices
capable of booting the mainline Linux kernel, and we‚Äôve made it easier for maintainers to bring
their devices closer to upstream with inheritable common trees. The end result? For now, nothing,
but in the future, we will hopefully be able to boot Android on <em>almost any</em> device that is
supported by the mainline Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This effort should help keep devices alive well past the point where their proprietary components
stop working with newer Android releases.</p>

<p>See the following repos if interested! (<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_mainline">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_common">2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_qcom-common">3</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_mainline_configs">4</a>)</p>

<h3 id="careful-commonization">Careful Commonization</h3>

<p>Several of our developers have worked hard on SoC-specific common kernels to base on that can be
merged on a somewhat regular basis to pull in the latest features/security patches to save
maintainers additional effort.</p>

<p>Go check them out and consider basing your device kernels on them!</p>

<p>Supported SoCs right now are:</p>

<p>Moreover, many legacy devices require interpolating libraries that we colloquially refer to as
‚Äúshims‚Äù - these have long been device and maintainer managed, but this cycle we have decided to
commonize them to make the effort easier on everyone and not duplicate effort!</p>

<p>You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_hardware_lineage_compat">here</a> and
contribute shims that you think other devices may need or add additional components to additional
shims and compatibility layers provided via Gerrit!</p>

<h3 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h3>

<p>Overall, we feel that the 23.0 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 22.2 and is
ready for initial release.</p>

<p>We will allow new LineageOS 21 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we will no longer
allow newly submitted LineageOS 21 devices to ship.</p>

<p>LineageOS 23.0 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to
come as they meet the requirements specified by the
<a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/main/device-support-requirements.md">Charter</a> and are
made ready for builds by their maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-to-lineageos-230">Upgrading to LineageOS 23.0</h3>

<p>To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> and then on ‚ÄúUpgrade to a higher version of LineageOS‚Äù.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole‚Äô install guide for your
device, just like anyone else looking to
install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">here</a> by clicking on your device and then on ‚ÄúInstallation‚Äù.</p>

<p>Please note that if you‚Äôre currently on an official build, you <em>DO NOT</em> need to wipe your device,
unless your device‚Äôs wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with
massive changes, such as a repartition.</p>

<h3 id="download-portal">Download portal</h3>

<p>While it has been in the making for quite a while and already released two years ago, it‚Äôs still
relevant to this blog post.
Our <a href="https://download.lineageos.org/">download portal</a> has been redesigned and gained a few
functional improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dark mode</li>
  <li>Downloads of additional images (shown for all devices but not used on all of them, read the
instructions to know which ones you need for your device‚Äôs installation!)</li>
  <li>Verifying downloaded files (see <a href="https://download.lineageos.org/verify">here</a>) - if you go with
any download not obtained from us, you can still verify it was originally signed by us and thus
untampered with</li>
</ul>

<p>A reminder: Follow the <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/">LineageOS Wiki</a> to the letter! If an image is
listed on the download portal that the wiki doesn‚Äôt ask you to use, ignore it! It is likely there
so the maintainer can point power-users at it if needed.</p>

<h3 id="wiki">Wiki</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/">LineageOS Wiki</a> has also been expanded over the years and now
offers, in addition to the known and tested instructions for all supported devices, some
improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The device overview allows filtering for various attributes you might be interested in a device
(please note that choosing a device only based on that list still does not guarantee any device
support beyond the point of when you chose it)</li>
  <li>The device overview now lists variants of a device and other known marketing names in a more
visible way, also allowing for different device information and instructions per variant to be
shown</li>
  <li>The installation instructions have been paginated, giving users less chance to skip a section
involuntarily</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to that we‚Äôd like to take this time to remind users to follow instructions on their
device‚Äôs respective <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">Wiki Page</a>
given the complexity introduced by AOSP changes like System-As-Root, A/B Partition Scheme, Dynamic
Partitions, and most recently <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/virtual_ab">Virtual A/B</a>
found on the Pixel 5 and other devices launching with Android 11, the instructions many of you are
used to following from memory are either no longer valid or are missing very critical steps.
As of 16.0, maintainers have been expected to run through the full instructions and verify they
work on their devices. The LineageOS Wiki was recently further extended, and
maintainers were given significantly more options to customize their device‚Äôs specific
installation, update, and upgrade instructions.</p>

<h3 id="developers-developers-developers">Developers, Developers, Developers</h3>

<p>Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it‚Äôs easier than ever.
Just follow the instructions <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting_device.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but
are no longer supported - seriously - even if it‚Äôs not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe
we can help you complete it.</p>

<p>After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you‚Äôll receive some
feedback on your device submission; and if it‚Äôs up to par, you‚Äôll be invited to our communications
instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS‚Äôs official repositories.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots
of other things you can contribute to.
For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/contributing-apps/">improve them</a>, or you can
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/contributing_wiki">contribute to the wiki</a> by adding
more useful information &amp; documentation.
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/usinggerrit-howto.html">Gerrit</a> is always open for submissions! Once
you‚Äôve contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we‚Äôll
get you in the loop.</p>

<p>Also, if you sent a submission that didn‚Äôt get a response in the last few months, please follow up,
we‚Äôve swapped providers again!</p>

<h3 id="generic-targets">Generic Targets</h3>

<p>We‚Äôve talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.</p>

<p>Although we‚Äôve had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to
developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we‚Äôve documented how to use
them in conjunction with the Android
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/emulator.html">Emulator/Android Studio</a>!</p>

<p>Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations,
and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to
devices using Google‚Äôs
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html">Project Treble</a>.
We won‚Äôt be providing official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies
entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble‚Äôs requirements, but feel
free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!</p>

<p>Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy all later Android versions) diverged GSI and Emulator
targets. Emulator targets reside in <code>lineage_sdk_$arch</code>, while GSI targets reside in
<code>lineage_gsi_$arch</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, experimental targets now exist for QEMU-based virtual machine software (libvirt,
UTM, etc). Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/libvirt-qemu">the Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>

<p>Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?</p>

<p>If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to
<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate">our wiki</a> and have a go!
If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we‚Äôll take
the necessary
steps to include your language.
For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support
for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.</p>

<p>Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language;
poor translations waste both our time and yours.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google‚Äôs October 2025 update has broken the Pixel IMS app, a tool many used to enable VoLTE and VoWiFi on imported Pixel phones in unsupported regions.</li>
<li>The app exploited a loophole that allowed it to override carrier settings, which Google has now patched and designated as a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-48617).</li>
<li>Fortunately, a new workaround has been discovered to enable VoLTE in unsupported regions, but users who want VoWiFi must now either root their devices or wait for Google to officially expand carrier support.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Pixel phones are beloved for their <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-pixel-features-explained-3217987/">many unique software features</a>, but their limited availability prevents many people from buying them. While Google has made strides in expanding access, Pixels still aren‚Äôt sold in nearly as many countries as iPhones or Samsung Galaxy devices. This leads many fans to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/imported-google-pixel-phone-mistake-3562340/">import Pixel phones</a> from other markets, a move that can unfortunately break crucial calling features like VoLTE and VoWiFi.</p><p>VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is the feature that routes voice calls over a 4G LTE connection, a crucial function now that carriers worldwide are phasing out their 2G and 3G networks. Without it, you might not be able to make phone calls at all on many modern networks. Similarly, VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi) handles <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wi-fi-calling-free-travel-3532728/">Wi-Fi calling</a>, routing calls over a Wi-Fi network instead of cellular ‚Äî a handy feature when you‚Äôre in a building with poor signal.</p><p>In theory, any phone with the right hardware for a carrier‚Äôs cellular frequencies should be able to use VoLTE, and any capable phone with a supporting plan should get VoWiFi. The reality, however, is more complex. Many carriers only permit VoLTE and VoWiFi on devices they sell or have officially tested. This means that even if your imported Pixel has the necessary hardware, the carrier can still block these features, potentially preventing you from making voice calls entirely.</p><p>This issue plagued Pixel phone importers until Korean developer <a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho" target="_blank">Kyujin Cho</a> released a workaround in 2023. The developer‚Äôs app, ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch" target="_blank">Pixel IMS,</a>‚Äù enables VoLTE and VoWiFi on unsupported carriers by overriding the carrier check that Android normally performs. Normally, Android uses a signal from the carrier to decide whether to enable VoLTE for the device; the Pixel IMS app overrides this signal and forces it to always be enabled.</p><p>Overriding this check isn‚Äôt something just any app can do, as it‚Äôs part of Android‚Äôs privileged telephony framework. That‚Äôs why Pixel IMS cleverly leverages a loophole intended for testing purposes. Android allows the ‚Äúshell‚Äù user ‚Äî the same user that runs <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-adb-android-3260397/">ADB commands</a> ‚Äî to override carrier configurations. To gain these elevated privileges, Pixel IMS uses Shizuku, an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-open-source-android-apps-3565444/">open source Android app</a> that lets other apps run processes as the shell user.</p><p>But loopholes don‚Äôt last forever, and after more than two and a half years, Google has seemingly closed this one. Following the recent <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/october-2025-pixel-update-3605572/">October 2025 Pixel update</a>, many users <a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch/issues/384" target="_blank">discovered</a> the ‚ÄúPixel IMS‚Äù app was no longer functional, crashing when attempting to toggle VoLTE or VoWiFi. The crash log gives a clear reason: ‚Äú<strong>overrideConfig cannot be invoked by shell</strong>.‚Äù</p><p>While not documented in the official changelog, Google appears to have quietly patched this particular exploit. According to a source, the company has designated this loophole as <strong>CVE-2025-48617</strong>, a high-severity privilege escalation vulnerability. Its absence from the October 2025 Android Security Bulletin is likely because it didn‚Äôt meet the ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù threshold for immediate inclusion under <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-risk-based-security-updates-3597466/">Google‚Äôs new Risk-Based Update System (RBUS)</a>. Google will probably include it in the next quarterly security bulletin, scheduled for December.</p><p>Fortunately for Pixel users, another developer has allegedly <a href="https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch/issues/384#issuecomment-3384423112" target="_blank">found a new workaround</a>. While the new method isn‚Äôt as accessible ‚Äî with the instructions being in Chinese and the APK distributed on the developer‚Äôs Telegram channel ‚Äî it at least seems to work.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new method only enables VoLTE and not VoWiFi, so Pixel users in unsupported regions who need the latter feature will have to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/root-android-277350/">root their phones</a> for now. Rooting requires unlocking the bootloader, which <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-nano-bootloader-3605497/">breaks some Gemini-powered features</a> and complicates using Google Wallet. The only other alternative is to wait for Google to officially enable VoLTE in more markets ‚Äî something the company <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phones-volte-gsma-3571825/">recently signaled it‚Äôs working on</a>.</p><div data-container-type="content"><p>Thank you for being part of our community.

These maybe experiments that push us beyond scaling training datasets and using more compute for reasoning. New architectures. New modalities. But RAG is a very real world, practical topic for something as significant as a new lab‚Äôs first paper.</p><p>Specifically, RAG is ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô because enterprises and consumer apps have operational RAG pipelines with real revenue attached to them. Any improvements to cost/latency in these areas will lead to immediate ROI, also in a way where the benefits are very clear to application layer teams doing things with LLM, and less clear to foundational labs like MSI. </p><p>The ROI comes from a few places. If we zoom in, on the UX level, faster responses increase retention. Cutting time-to-first-token (TTFT) multiplies effective capacity. Software-level efficiency opens new headroom without buying new GPUs or re-architecting models.</p><p>In traditional RAG, you have a knowledge base, say a vector database of unstructured text in ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù, and then you have a LLM that takes a user query, searches the knowledge base for relevant documents/chunks, and generates a response for the user. The main limitation here is the context window: LLMs can take a finite amount of information, up to millions of tokens as of the publishing of this article.</p><p><span>In Meta‚Äôs REFRAG, documents for retrieval are still chunked (~128-token pieces). But, after that, each chunk is encoded into a compact </span><em>chunk embedding</em><span> by a lightweight encoder, then projected into the LLM embedding space. These embeddings are </span><em>precomputable</em><span> and cached.</span></p><p><span>In the product, the user query is embedded and the system retrieves candidate chunks. Instead of sending every chunk‚Äôs full token stream to the LLM, the system feeds the LLM a </span><em>mixture</em><span> of: (a) projected chunk embeddings for most chunks, and (b) full token sequences for a few chunks that the policy picks to expand.</span></p><p>A small policy network, trained to maximize downstream generation quality under an expansion budget, looks at the chunk embeddings and picks which chunks to expand to tokens. This policy can be trained with an RL objective that rewards reduced perplexity on generation.</p><p>The LLM sees a short token sequence (expanded chunks + query) plus a number of single-vector placeholders (unexpanded chunks). LLM proceeds to generate text as normal.</p><p><span>In the paper, the core insight is stated to be using the policy network to compress less-relevant chunks in the RAG process, but to us, </span><strong>the core insight here is actually: if embeddings are generated by layers within the LLM, it makes no sense to convert them back to natural language, just for another LLM to compress those tokens back to embeddings.</strong></p><p>That is why the speedups come without collapsing accuracy.</p><p>Contrast two vectors of innovation in LLM land:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Model-level breakthroughs</strong><span> (new architectures, larger models, novel pretraining): high-risk, high-reward, long timelines, big capital.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Application/system-level efficiency</strong><span> (inference optimizations, retrieval tricks, orchestration): lower-risk, immediate ROI, directly monetizable.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>MSI publishing a RAG efficiency paper, in our opinion, signals a broader direction for them to go after problems with ROI </span><strong>today,</strong><span> where their research and infra expertise can move the needle.</span></p><p>For enterprises and product teams, this is a ripe candidate for production pilots. Evaluate TTFT, throughput, and cost-per-query before and after. The upside is immediate: more queries per GPU, lower infra spend, and better UX.</p><p>You can also mix-and-match stacks. REFRAG is orthogonal to better retrievers or rerankers, you can combine it with stronger rerankers to shrink the candidate set even more.</p><p>In the broader market, it‚Äôs an interesting paper during an even more interesting time in the vector DB space. Leading vector DB Pinecone is rumoured to be exploring a sale and there was a founder-operator CEO transition. </p><p><span>Fresh research from DeepMind, "On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval," highlights how some documents are always out of reach for RAG.

<!--more-->
<h2><strong>TL;DR:</strong></h2>
<p><span>In June 2025, I found a critical vulnerability in GitHub Copilot Chat (CVSS 9.6) that allowed silent exfiltration of secrets and source code from private repos, and gave me full control over Copilot‚Äôs responses, including suggesting malicious code or links.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The attack combined&nbsp;</span><strong><span>a novel CSP bypass using GitHub‚Äôs own infrastructure</span></strong><span>&nbsp;with&nbsp;</span><strong><span>remote prompt injection.&nbsp;</span></strong><span></span><span>I reported it via HackerOne, and GitHub fixed it by disabling image rendering in Copilot Chat completely.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span>Background</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>GitHub Copilot Chat is an AI assistant built into GitHub that helps developers by answering questions, explaining code, and suggesting implementations directly in their workflow. </span></p>
<p><span>Copilot Chat is context-aware: it can use information from the repository (such as code, commits, or pull requests) to provide tailored answers. </span></p>
<p><span>As always,&nbsp;<strong>more context = more attack surface.</strong></span></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, GitHub Copilot is context-aware - so I set out to make it notice me. To do this, I embedded a prompt directed at Copilot inside a pull request description.</p>

<p><em><span>* Notice that the user who asked Copilot Chat to explain the PR is different from the user who posted the invisible prompt, demonstrating that the prompt can affect any user who visits the page.</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Copilot operates with the same permissions as the user making the request</span></strong><span>, but it obviously needs access to the user‚Äôs private repositories to respond accurately. We can exploit this by including instructions in our injected prompt to access a victim user‚Äôs private repository, encode its contents in base16, and append it to a URL. Then, when the user clicks the URL, the data is exfiltrated back to us.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span>Recap: What We Can Do</span></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Influence the responses generated by another user‚Äôs Copilot</li>
<li>Inject custom Markdown, including URLs, code, and images</li>
<li>Exploit the fact that Copilot runs with the same permissions as the victim user</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span>Bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP)</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>This is where things get tricky. If you‚Äôve followed along so far, you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äî just inject an HTML&nbsp;</span><span>&lt;img&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;tag into the victim‚Äôs chat, encode their private data as a parameter, and once the browser tries to render it, the data will be leaked.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Not so fast. GitHub enforces a very restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP), which blocks fetching images and other content types from domains that aren‚Äôt explicitly owned by GitHub. So, our ‚Äúsimple‚Äù&nbsp;</span><span>&lt;img&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;trick won‚Äôt work out of the box.</span></p>
<p><span>You‚Äôre probably asking yourself -&nbsp;<strong>wait, how does my fancy README manage to show images from third-party sites?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When you commit a README or any Markdown file containing external images, GitHub automatically processes the file, during this process:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub parses the Markdown and identifies any image URLs pointing to domains outside of GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>URL rewriting via Camo: Each external URL is rewritten to a Camo proxy URL. This URL includes a HMAC-based cryptographic signature and points to&nbsp;</strong><span><a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/"><strong>https://camo.githubusercontent.com/</strong></a></span><strong>‚Ä¶.</strong></li>
<li>Signed request verification: When a browser requests the image, the Camo proxy verifies the signature to ensure it was generated by GitHub. Only valid, signed URLs are allowed.</li>
<li>Content fetching: If the signature is valid, Camo fetches the external image from its original location and serves it through GitHub‚Äôs servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process ensures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers cannot craft arbitrary URLs to exfiltrate dynamic data.</li>
<li>All external images go through a controlled proxy, maintaining security and integrity.</li>
<li>The end user sees the image seamlessly in the README, but the underlying URL never exposes the original domain directly.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>More information about Camo can be found&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-anonymized-urls"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Alright, so we can‚Äôt generate Camo URLs on the fly ‚Äî without code execution, every&nbsp;</span><span>&lt;img&gt;</span><span> tag we inject into the victim‚Äôs chat must include a valid Camo URL signature that was pre-generated. Otherwise, GitHub‚Äôs reverse proxy won‚Äôt fetch the content.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span>The discovery</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>I spent a long time thinking about this problem before this crazy idea struck me.<br>If I create a dictionary of all letters and symbols in the alphabet, pre-generate their corresponding Camo URLs, embed this dictionary into the injected prompt, and then ask Copilot to play a ‚Äúsmall game‚Äù by rendering the content I want to leak as ‚ÄúASCII art‚Äù composed entirely of images, will Copilot inject valid Camo images that the browser will render by their order?&nbsp;<strong>Yes, it will.</strong></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>I quickly got to work. First, I set up a web server that responds to every request with a 1x1 transparent pixel. This way, when GitHub‚Äôs Camo reverse proxy fetches the images from my server, they remain invisible in the victim‚Äôs chat.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>I recently saw an </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/izaahSqv3oRRDu4mr?commentId=98A9ibWbcKACuhrh3" rel="">online suggestion</a><span> that to treat hard drug addiction, you could provide drugs publicly at government facilities, conditional on (inpatient) treatment afterward. The idea being that (extreme) drug addicts have very high time preference, and so will accept a hit now at any cost, even a cost that would forcibly break their habit soon after.</span></p><p>Instinctively, I doubt this would work for almost any addicts, as even the most far gone addicts are still human beings with human faculties who can behave strategically when they need to. But also, the suggestion is an example of analysis that thinks of the typical drug addict as, like, the sort of obviously crazy, addicted, and presumptively homeless person you sometimes see on the street.</p><p>In my experience, many addicts aren‚Äôt like that.</p><p>In the summer of my youth, I lived with two different opiate addicts. One was (and is) a close friend, and the other I liked but was mostly just a roommate. I won‚Äôt go into lots of detail since it feels icky to mine my friends‚Äô lives for content, but I will say that I had lots and lots of roommates before moving in with my wife, and neither opiate addict was a particularly bad one. They washed their dishes, responded well to requests or criticisms of basic house behaviors, and weren‚Äôt nearly as responsible for the rat infestation as I was.</p><p>(Okay, fine. A pretty girl who had a pet rat heard we had a rat problem and brought some rat food to ostensibly‚Ä¶ lure out the rat? I don‚Äôt even remember the pretext. Anyway we hooked up and the rat food ended up just kind of left out. In the open. For the rats. Ah, to be young.)</p><p>I was pretty tangential to the social scene my addicted friends were part of, but they had friends over sometimes and some of them were closer to the stereotype for people with a drug problem; one guy in particular would occasionally steal things (though never from our house, that I recall), and was generally quite stressful to be around. But I had no idea one of my addicted friends had a drug problem, even though I lived with him during pretty serious crisis in retrospect.</p><p>Nor do I think I‚Äôm especially oblivious! I sometimes perceive things like subtle intra-relationship needling that my wife misses among our friends, and in general I‚Äôm a bit of a people pleaser and try to remain attuned to social cues. If anything kept me from seeing my friends‚Äô addictions, it was that doing heroin seemed so beyond the pale to me that it was hard to imagine anybody going down that road.</p><p>Even in the case of the roommate who did more obviously have a problem, it didn‚Äôt really feel like a crisis from the inside. He‚Äôd just sort of invite shady people over to hang out in his room, then fall asleep with them over. Yes, yes, obviously bad stuff was going on there in retrospect, but it wasn‚Äôt like he looked gaunt, or like there were any obvious physical signs of drug use anywhere. There were bad specific moments, like one time he passed out in front of the house, but that was fairly indistinguishable from stories about alcoholic acquaintances, rather than a sign of something as directly lethal as heroin addiction. I mostly learned how bad it was when that roommate, feeling bad about exposing us to such behavior, spontaneously evicted himself. Alas, his subsequent attempts to get clean failed, and he died a year or so later.</p><p>But even that guy - may he rest in peace, really a sweet person - was way more obvious than my closer friend, who played video games with me almost every day, had a girlfriend and job, and maintained a seemingly normal and functional life while risking his life regularly.</p><p>In fact, having seen opiate addiction really get its claws into a community from a wallflower‚Äôs point of view, the distribution seemed pretty bimodal. The most dysfunctional people tended to get hit, and a smattering of highly functional and friendly people tended to get hit, though you‚Äôd only learn that years later, or when they died. Of course, for all I know people in the middle got hit too, and I just never learned it.</p><p>I‚Äôm not sure I have one.</p><p>I see a lot of discourse about addiction, but, like most discourse, it mostly radiates out from major cities. Major cities are where lots of the wealth is, so they attract a lot of beggars, and therefore a lot of the least functional drug addicts. So successful people living in major cities probably have a mental template of ‚Äúdrug addict‚Äù that looks like a raving guy pushing a stolen shopping cart around, or something. And indeed, when I visit major cities I see many such people, and living in a minor city I see a few.</p><p>But drug addiction, and drug use more broadly, is way more complicated than that. It‚Äôs fine to want to address the ‚Äúroving unstable beggars who do lots of petty crime‚Äù problem, insofar as that problem exists, without also wanting to help address the ‚Äúlots of random 25-year-olds suddenly die out of nowhere‚Äù problem. But in fact both of these problems fall under the ‚Äúdrug addiction‚Äù umbrella, and you can‚Äôt make good policy around drug addiction writ large without keeping both in mind.</p><p>Also I guess I just want people to understand that not every heroin addict is either a death of despair or a person suffering from a cocktail of serious untreated mental disorders. In fact, about half the heroin addicts I knew have fully recovered. Maybe the most surprising thing is how the distribution of recovery overlaps with the entire distribution of mid-addiction stability. My friend is totally fine now, and so is the guy who stole stuff and caused lots of problems. Meanwhile, my other ex-roommate is dead, and so is the second-most-problem-causing addict I knew at the time. This stuff just kind of hits a seemingly-random subsection of entire communities, and of the people hit, about half don‚Äôt make it. I‚Äôm not sure what to do about that. But it‚Äôs probably not simple.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>- Photon, the graphical interface for QNX. Oriented more towards real time (widgets included gauges) but good enough to support two different web browsers. No delays. This was a real time operating system.</p><p>- MacOS 8. Not the Linux thing, but Copeland. This was a modernized version of the original MacOS, continuing the tradition of no command line. Not having a command line forces everyone to get their act together about how to install and configure things. Probably would have eased the tradition to mobile. A version was actually shipped to developers, but it had to be covered up to justify the bailout of Next by Apple to get Steve Jobs.</p><p>- Transaction processing operating systems. The first one was IBM's Customer Information Control System. A transaction processor is a kind of OS where everything is like a CGI program - load program, do something, exit program. Unix and Linux are, underneath, terminal oriented time sharing systems.</p><p>- IBM MicroChannel. Early minicomputer and microcomputer designers thought "bus", where peripherals can talk to memory and peripherals look like memory to the CPU. Mainframes, though, had "channels", simple processors which connected peripherals to the CPU. Channels could run simple channel programs, and managed device access to memory. IBM tried to introduce that with the PS2, but they made it proprietary and that failed in the marketplace. Today, everything has something like channels, but they're not a unified interface concept that simplifies the OS.</p><p>- CPUs that really hypervise properly. That is, virtual execution environments look just like real ones. 
IBM did that in VM, and it worked well because channels are a good abstraction for both a real machine and a VM. Storing into device registers to make things happen is not. x86 has added several layers below the "real machine" layer, and they're all hacks.</p><p>- The Motorola 680x0 series. Should have been the foundation of the microcomputer era, but it took way too long to get the MMU out the door. The original 68000 came out in 1978, but then Motorola fell behind.</p><p>- Modula. Modula 2 and 3 were reasonably good languages. Oberon was a flop. DEC was into Modula, but Modula went down with DEC.</p><p>- XHTML. Have you ever read the parsing rules for HTML 5, where the semantics for bad HTML were formalized? Browsers should just punt at the first error, display an error message, and render the rest of the page in Times Roman.
Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly?</p><p>- Word Lens. Look at the world through your phone, and text is translated, standalone, on the device. No Internet connection required.

<div><p>Nice list. Some thoughts:</p><p>- I think without the move to NeXT, even if Jobs had come back to Apple, they would never have been able to get to the iPhone. iOS was - and still is - a unix-like OS, using unix-like philosophy, and I think that philosophy allowed them to build something game-changing compared to the SOTA in mobile OS technology at the time. So much so, Android follows suit. It doesn't have a command line, and installation is fine, so I'm not sure your line of reasoning holds strongly. One thing I think you might be hinting at though that is a missed trick: macOS today could learn a little from the way iOS and iPadOS is forced to do things and centralise configuration in a single place.</p><p>- I think transaction processing operating systems have been reinvented today as "serverless". The load/execute/quit cycle you describe is how you build in AWS Lambdas, GCP Cloud Run Functions or Azure Functions.</p><p>- Most of your other ideas (with an exception, see below), died either because of people trying to grab money rather than build cool tech, and arguably the free market decided to vote with its feet - I do wonder when we might next get a major change in hardware architectures again though, it does feel like we've now got "x86" and "ARM" and that's that for the next generation.</p><p>- XHTML died because it was too hard for people to get stuff done. The forgiving nature of the HTML specs is a feature, not a bug. We shouldn't expect people to be experts at reading specs to publish on the web, nor should it need special software that gatekeeps the web. It needs to be scrappy, and messy and evolutionary, because it is a technology that serves people - we don't want people to serve the technology.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45556271"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45556271" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45556271&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>&gt; Would it kill people to have to close their tags properly?</p><p>Probably not, but what would be the benefit of having more pages fail to render?

<div><p>&gt; but what would be the benefit of having more pages fail to render?</p><p>I think those benefits are quite similar to having more programs failing to run (due to static and strong typing, other static analysis, and/or elimination of undefined behavior, for instance), or more data failing to be read (due to integrity checks and simply strict parsing): as a user, you get documents closer to valid ones (at least in the rough format), if anything at all, and additionally that discourages developers from shipping a mess. Then parsers (not just those in viewers, but anything that does processing) have a better chance to read and interpret those documents consistently, so even more things work predictably.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45556229"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45556229" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45556229&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

It does not support all Node-RED functionality but gives a good feel for using Node-RED and flow based programming.</p><p>The second project with which I am using Node-RED frontend is Erlang-Red[^3] which is Node-RED with an Erlang backend. Erlang is better suited to flow based programming than NodeJS, hence this attempt to demonstrate that!</p><p>Node-RED makes slightly different assumptions than Yahoo! Pipes - input ports being the biggest: all nodes in Node-RED have either zero or one input wires, nodes in Yahoo!

<div><p>I loved silverlight.

It turns out that getting office workers to install a blessed plugin from Microsoft and navigate to a web page is much easier than distributing binaries that you have to install and keep up to date. And developing for it was pure pleasure; you got to use C# and Visual Studio, and a GUI interface builder, rather than the Byzantine HTML/JS/CSS ecosystem.</p><p>I get why it never took off, but in this niche of small-time custom software it was really way nicer than anything else that existed at the time.

<div><p>Developer Ryan Flaherty's "Via" project, a novel approach to streaming large games in real time.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wAn-4e5hQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wAn-4e5hQ</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWsNFVvblLw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWsNFVvblLw</a></p><p>Summary:</p><p>&gt;This presentation introduces Via, a virtual file system designed to address the challenges of large game downloads and storage. Unlike cloud gaming, which suffers from poor image quality, input latency, and high hosting costs, Via allows games to run locally while only downloading game data on demand. The setup process is demonstrated with Halo Infinite, showing a simple installation that involves signing into Steam and allocating storage space for Via's cache.</p><p>&gt;Via creates a virtual Steam library, presenting all owned games as installed, even though their data is not fully downloaded. When a game is launched, Via's virtual file system intercepts requests and downloads only the necessary game content as it's needed. This on-demand downloading is integrated with the game's existing streaming capabilities, leveraging features like level-of-detail and asset streaming. Performance metrics are displayed, showing download rates, server ping, and disk commit rates, illustrating how Via fetches data in real-time.</p><p>&gt;The system prioritizes caching frequently accessed data. After an initial download, subsequent play sessions benefit from the on-disk cache, significantly reducing or eliminating the need for network downloads. This means the actual size of a game becomes less relevant, as only a portion of it needs to be stored locally. While server locations are currently limited, the goal is to establish a global network to ensure low ping. The presentation concludes by highlighting Via's frictionless user experience, aiming for a setup so seamless that users are unaware of its presence. Via is currently in early access and free to use, with hopes of future distribution partnerships.</p><p>I'm amazed the video still has under 4,000 views.

<div><p>I could think of many examples, but I'll talk about the top four that I have in mind, that I'd like to see re-evaluated for today's times.</p><p>1.  When Windows Vista was being developed, there were plans to replace the file system with a database, allowing users to organize and search for files using database queries.  This was known as WinFS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS</a>).  I was looking forward to this in the mid-2000s.  Unfortunately Vista was famously delayed, and in an attempt to get Vista released, Microsoft pared back features, and one of these features was WinFS.  Instead of WinFS, we ended up getting improved file search capabilities.  It's unfortunate that there's been no proposals for database file systems for desktop operating systems since.</p><p>2.  OpenDoc (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc</a>) was an Apple technology from the mid-1990s that promoted component-based software.  Instead of large, monolithic applications such as Microsoft Excel and Adobe Photoshop, functionality would be offered in the form of components, and users and developers can combine these components to form larger solutions.  For example, as an alternative to Adobe Photoshop, there would be a component for the drawing canvas, and there would be separate components for each editing feature.  Components can be bought and sold on an open marketplace.  It reminds me of Unix pipes, but for GUIs.  There's a nice promotional video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJdjk2rq4E" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJdjk2rq4E</a>.</p><p>OpenDoc was a radically different paradigm for software development and distribution, and I think this was could have been an interesting contender against the dominance that Microsoft and Adobe enjoys in their markets.  OpenDoc actually did ship, and there were some products made using OpenDoc, most notably Apple's Cyberdog browser (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdog" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdog</a>).</p><p>Unfortunately, Apple was in dire straits in the mid-1990s.  Windows 95 was a formidable challenger to Mac OS, and cheaper x86 PCs were viable alternatives to Macintosh hardware.  Apple was an acquisition target; IBM and Apple almost merged, and there was also an attempt to merge Apple with Sun.  Additionally, the Macintosh platform depended on the availability of software products like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop, the very types of products that OpenDoc directly challenged.  When Apple purchased NeXT in December 1996, Steve Jobs returned to Apple, and all work on OpenDoc ended not too long afterward, leading to this now-famous exchange during WWDC 1997 between Steve Jobs and an upset developer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o</a>).</p><p>I don't believe that OpenDoc fits in with Apple's business strategy, even today, and while Microsoft offers component-based technologies that are similar to OpenDoc (OLE, COM, DCOM, ActiveX, .NET), the Windows ecosystem is still dominated by monolithic applications.</p><p>I think it would have been cool had the FOSS community pursued component-based software.  It would have been really cool to apt-get components from remote repositories and link them together, either using GUI tools, command-line tools, or programmatically to build custom solutions.  Instead, we ended up with large, monolithic applications like LibreOffice, Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, etc.</p><p>3.  I am particularly intrigued by Symbolics Genera (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)</a>), an operating system designed for Symbolics Lisp machines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics</a>).  In Genera, everything is a Lisp object.  The interface is an interesting hybrid of early GUIs and the command line.  To me, Genera could have been a very interesting substrate for building component-based software; in fact, it would have been far easier building OpenDoc on top of Common Lisp than on top of C or C++.  Sadly, Symbolics' fortunes soured after the AI winter of the late 1980s/early 1990s, and while Genera was ported to other platforms such as the DEC Alpha and later the x86-64 via the creation of a Lisp machine emulator, it's extremely difficult for people to obtain a legal copy, and it was never made open source.  The closest things to Genera we have are Xerox Interlisp, a competing operating system that was recently made open source, and open-source descendants of Smalltalk-80: Squeak, Pharo, and Cuis-Smalltalk.</p><p>4.  Apple's "interregnum" years between 1985 and 1996 were filled with many intriguing projects that were either never commercialized, were cancelled before release, or did not make a splash in the marketplace.  One of the most interesting projects during the era was Bauhaus, a Lisp operating system developed for the Newton platform.  Mikel Evins, a regular poster here, describes it here (<a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2021-07-12-reimagining-bauhaus/" rel="nofollow">https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2021-07-12-reimagining-ba...</a>).

Well, except for ReactOS' lack of printing support.</p><p>As long as you stay within the ECMA or published Windows APIs, everything runs fine in Wine and ReactOS.  But Microsoft products are full of undocumented functions, as well as checks to see if they're running on real Windows.  That goes back to the Windows 3.1 days, when 3.1 developers regularly used OS/2 instead of DOS, and Microsoft started adding patches to fail under OS/2 and DR-DOS.  So all that has to be accounted for by Wine and ReactOS. A lot of third-party software uses undocumented functions as well, especially stuff written back during the days when computer magazines were a thing, and regularly published that kind of information. A lot of programmers found the lure of undocumented calls to be irresistible, and they wound up in all kinds of commercial applications where they really shouldn't have been.</p><p>In my experience anything that will load under Wine will run with no problems.  ReactOS has some stability problems, but then the developers specifically call it "alpha" software.  Despite that, I've put customers on ReactOS systems after verifying all their software ran on it.  It gets them off the Microsoft upgrade treadmill. Sometimes there are compatibility problems and I fall back to Wine on Linux.  Occasionally nothing will do but real Windows.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45554918"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45554918" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45554918&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45553132"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>TOKYO - Japanese summers have lengthened by about three weeks over the 42 years from 1982 to 2023, a university research group said Saturday.</p>

<p>The Mie University group said that due to climate change, the number of days classified as summer has increased each year, while the length of winter has remained relatively unchanged, and the average durations of spring and fall have shortened.</p>

<p>The group cited "the rise in sea surface temperatures due to global warming" as the main factor, warning that "the trend toward longer summers and winters will intensify if warming continues."</p>

<p>The Japan Meteorological Agency defines summer as lasting from June to August, without specifying a temperature range.</p>

<p>The researchers included second-year master's student Mao Takikawa and Yoshihiro Tachibana, a professor of the university's Department of Environmental Science and Technology.</p>

<p>In their research, the group divided the area from Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido to the southernmost one of Kyushu, including surrounding ocean areas, into about 200 zones and used the agency's observation data to calculate the average annual maximum temperature over 42 years.</p>

<p>They defined a "summer benchmark" for each zone based on its temperature range, using the agency's data on annual highs and lows to determine which days qualified as summer days.</p>

<p>For example, if the highest temperature in an area was 20 C and the lowest was 0 C, the benchmark was 15 C -- one quarter down from the maximum -- with days above that level counted as summer.</p>

<p>They further analyzed 42 years of temperature data on an annual basis.</p>

<p>The group defined the first day of summer in a year as the date when the summer threshold was exceeded, and the ending date on the last day it was exceeded, with the number of days in between constituting the summer period.</p>

<p>Looking at the average across approximately 200 zones over the 42-year period, the start date of summer advanced by about 12.6 days, while the end date was delayed by about 8.8 days.</p>

<p>The summer period extended by approximately 21.4 days, the group said.</p>

<p>In 1982, the summer period lasted 92 days, from June 29 to Sept. 28. However, by 2023, it had lengthened to 121 days, running from June 11 to Oct. 9.</p>

<p>According to Tachibana, warm air flowing in from the Asian continent once cooled over the oceans surrounding the Japanese archipelago, causing temperatures to rise gradually from spring to summer. However, in recent years, rising sea surface temperatures have prevented this cooling, resulting in an earlier onset of summer.</p>

<p>Sea surface temperatures remain persistently high, making it difficult for temperatures to drop and delaying the end of summer, Tachibana said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, little change has been observed for the winter period. This is believed to be due to the continued influence of strong cold waves moving in from the continent.</p>

      <h2>A Guide For Wireguard VPN Setup With Pi-Hole Adblock and Unbound DNS</h2>
      <h3 id="why-setup-wireguard-network-with-pi-hole-adblock-and-unbound-dns">Why Setup Wireguard Network with Pi-Hole Adblock and Unbound DNS</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve used <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a> as my VPN provider for a few years. Their service is good, they provide keys for 5 devices, rely on the Wireguard protocol, and offer alternative configurations as well. Despite that, my needs have changed and I wanted to be able to have granular control over DNS queries and the ability to connect my various devices on my network through simple addresses, such as <a href="http://emby.home.server/">http://emby.home.server</a>. Enter Wireguard, Pi-Hole and Unbound.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many tools that might achieve the same results with a lot less work, such as <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. I would reach devices on the network easily, one of the nodes could be set to act as an exit node and you could also apply network-wide ad-block with Next DNS (I believe that is, at the time of writing, the solution they offer). Outside of Tailscale there are other fully open source alternatives, such as Headscale, Nebula and others.
However, I chose to set up my own Wireguard network, as it gave me the opportunity to learn a lot and helped me better understand everything involved in the process.</p>
<h3 id="network-setup-and-clients">Network Setup and Clients</h3>
<p>For devices, I have the following configuration, and the below IPs will be used throughout the article. They represent a starting point, but should be sufficient for anyone to build their network according to their needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>VPN Server (<code>10.10.10.1</code>) - running on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) from a provider that meets my requirements (close physical proximity, high bandwidth and at least 1 Gbps transfer speeds)</li>
<li>Home Server (<code>10.10.10.10</code>) - running on my home network and providing various service (media server, personal cloud, torrent client, etc.)</li>
<li>Desktop (<code>10.10.10.11</code>) - running on my home network</li>
<li>Laptop (<code>10.10.10.12</code>) - running on my home network, but might connect through outside networks (i.e.: coffee shops, libraries, airports, etc.)</li>
<li>Mobile 1 (<code>10.10.10.100</code>) - running on my home network, mobile data, mobile data roaming or public networks (coffee shops, libraries, airports, etc.)</li>
<li>Mobile 2 (<code>10.10.10.101</code>) - same as above</li>
</ul>
<p>I will use a <a href="https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2020/11/wireguard-hub-and-spoke-config/">hub and spoke network topology</a> where the VPS will act as the in-between for all inter-device communications on the network as well as the exit node for all Internet-facing communications. For example, if my Desktop connects to the Internet it will do so by navigating to the VPS, which will then resolve the query and block any domains that are on the block list. If it wants to connect to the Home Server it will do so without the VPS, since the Home Server and Desktop are on the same local network, connected via a router. If Smartphone 1 wants to connect to the Internet, the query is resolved by the VPS, which will block any domains on the block list. If it wants to connect to the Home Server, the VPS will receive the request and route it to the IP of the Home Server. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the contents of the request become visible as they <em>leave</em> the Wireguard tunnel between Smartphone 1 and the VPS. On the VPS contents will be encrypted again and <em>then</em> forwarded to the Home Server.</p>
<h3 id="vps-selection">VPS Selection</h3>
<p>I chose a VPS provider that is physically near my location, has minimum 1 Gbps speed (up/down), unlimited bandwidth and good performance while gaming (i.e.: specifically no packet loss). There are many options; you can check resources like <a href="https://lowendbox.com/">LowEndBox</a> and <a href="https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/">VPSBenchmarks</a> to get an idea of price ranges, availability and regions. For your own needs, start by defining a set of requirements and see which of these match your needs.</p>
<p>My only recommendation is to initially opt for a cheaper provider, that offers hourly billing and understand the end-to-end-process before committing. Keep in mind that various providers have different configurations and settings, so setups can vary.</p>
<h3 id="initial-server-setup">Initial Server Setup</h3>
<p>If you are completely new to setting up servers using a command line interface (CLI) only, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/cloud-servers-an-introduction">Digital Ocean</a> cloud computing series. Most providers have their own guides, so for specific steps check their respective documentation. Same goes for any chosen OS. For this guide I will be using Ubuntu 24.04. For the remainder of the article I will assume you are running an OS with access to a terminal that can send commands to a CLI that can generate SSH keys, establish SSH connections and can run a text editor that you can use to create, edit, update and delete text files. I will be using BASH/Fish with <code>nano</code> as my text editor.</p>
<h4 id="ssh-key-authentication">SSH Key Authentication</h4>
<p>To start, create an SSH key on your local machine and upload it to your chosen cloud provider. This first step already greatly improves security of the VPS and simplifies connection to it as you don‚Äôt need to remember a password.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Run inside your terminal on your client machine </span>
</span></span><span><span><span># https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Follow the on-screen prompts to provide a name, set a passphrase (recommended) and have the private and public files created at the given path in the prompt.</p>
<p>Next, copy the contents of the <em>.pub</em> file, or the file itself to your chosen VPS provider‚Äôs server setup page. Complete the initial server setup as per your provider‚Äôs steps. Once ready, you will have a public IPv4 address to which you can connect (this is a requirement in this guide, and some providers might only offer IPv6 addresses on their cheapest VPS). A connection can now be established with:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># replace root with the username your provider created by default; could be ubuntu as well</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># replace 123.123.123.123 with the IP address of your VPS</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ ssh -i .ssh/article root@123.123.123.123
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="automatic-updates">Automatic Updates</h4>
<p>You are now connected to the server, as the <code>root</code> user. If you connected via another user that has <code>sudo</code> access, then prepend all commands with <code>sudo</code>. If I write <code>ufw status numbered</code> use <code>sudo ufw status numbered</code>.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades"><code>unattended-upgrades</code></a> installed on your VPS.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ apt install unattended-upgrades
</span></span><span><span>Reading package lists... Done
</span></span><span><span>Building dependency tree... Done
</span></span><span><span>Reading state information... Done
</span></span><span><span>unattended-upgrades is already the newest version <span>(</span>2.9.1+nmu4ubuntu1<span>)</span>.
</span></span><span><span><span>0</span> upgraded, <span>0</span> newly installed, <span>0</span> to remove and <span>29</span> not upgraded.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, prepare the settings you want to apply. Because the application reads through different configuration files in order, I made a copy of <em>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades</em> and called it <em>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades</em>. This means that even after an update, while the original file could be overwritten, my settings will persist. The main settings I changed in my copy are found below. Read through the different options and adjust to your preferences.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Make a copy and give a new name</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ cp /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades
</span></span><span><span><span># Edit the file </span>

<h3 id="ssh-configuration---disable-password-auth-and-change-default-port">SSH Configuration - Disable Password Auth and Change Default Port</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, I connect to the server by using <code>ssh -i .ssh/article root@123.123.123.123</code>. The command passes in the path to the SSH key I use, sets the username I want to connect as, and sets the IP address of the server. By default, the SSH service runs on port 22. This is not explicitly stated in the connection command, it is just assumed as being set as such. One of the first things I like to change on a new VPS is the default port to something else. On Ubuntu 24.04 you will have this option in the <em>sshd_config</em> file, but the actual port used will be picked up from the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/sshd-now-uses-socket-based-activation-ubuntu-22-10-and-later/30189"><code>ssh.socket</code> service</a>. This can be confusing, as the setting is still present in the <em>sshd_config</em> file.</p>
<p>The first step is to make a copy of the configuration file and then edit the following lines in the original file.</p>

<h4 id="ufw-setup">UFW Setup</h4>
<p>Although the server can now do automatic updates, doesn‚Äôt rely on the default port to allow incoming connections and has <code>root</code> login disabled, we still need to configure the firewall. There are various ways to do this, but I like to use <code>ufw</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall">Uncomplicated firewall</a> is a great way to setup some basic rules and security on the server.

Other settings can be changed and if I were to do this often, I would opt for a script file as a minimum, or ideally a <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">cloud-init</a> script. Feel free to explore that once you feel comfortable with this setup.</p>
<p>Next, I‚Äôll setup Wireguard, Pi-Hole and Unbound.</p>
<h3 id="wireguard">Wireguard</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional VPN services, where a central server acts as a point of control and has clients, Wireguard uses the concept of peers. Peers can connect directly to each other, thus allowing for lower latency for connections and removing the single point of failure of a server. However, for my purposes, I configured one of the peers, in Wireguard parlance, to act as a server due to the hub-and-spoke network topology I employ in this setup. As such, the VPS will be referred to as the ‚Äòserver‚Äô and all other devices as ‚Äòclients‚Äô.</p>
<p>I will expand this article once I have a configuration in which clients that need to be able to connect to each other will do so directly, without a VPS in-between.</p>
<p>Next, to setup each client and the server, I need to create keys for all devices and create configuration files using these keys. The below steps will create public, private and pre-shared keys for all devices.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Install or make sure Wireguard is installed</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ apt install wireguard
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Create a folder to keep client keys and one for client configurations</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># This is not strictly needed, as once clients are added, the keys can be removed from the server</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># Except for the preshared keys </span>
</span></span><span><span>$ mkdir /etc/wireguard/clients
</span></span><span><span>$ mkdir /etc/wireguard/clientconfs

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With the keys created, I prepare the VPS configuration file. Each peer that wants to join the VPN needs its own configuration file. In Wireguard, the configuration file is split into two main sections: <code>[Interface]</code> and <code>[Peer]</code>. Each configuration file can contain zero, one or multiple peers that I can connect to. If I have one peer in my config, I‚Äôm connecting to that one device, if I have more, it means I can directly connect to all those peers.</p>
<p>In this case, the server will have multiple peers while the peers will each have a single peer: the server. The term interface is used because Wireguard creates a new network interface which is named according to the name of the configuration file.</p>
<p>Following this, I create a new configuration file named <em>wg0</em>, which means that once I start Wireguard with this configuration, I will have a new network interface called <code>wg0</code>. This can be renamed to anything else.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At this stage I have the base for my Wireguard network on the server. But because I want to hide traffic from peers behind the server‚Äôs IP address I need to apply <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO/ipmasq-background2.1.html">masquerading</a> to the incoming requests from the clients, a function similar to NAT. To achieve this, we need to get the data coming in on the network interface Wireguard creates out to the network interface of the server and allow the server to alter the source IP.</p>
<p>The first step is finding the default network interface on the server, so I run the below command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ ip route list default
</span></span><span><span><span># Output could be something like: </span>
</span></span><span><span><span># default via 123.123.123.123 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 123.123.123.123 metric 100</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The important bit here is to see the device (in my sample above it is <code>dev eth0</code>). This means I want to route requests that I receive out <code>eth0</code> and apply masquerading, which makes it look like a request received from a smartphone originated from the server.</p>
<p>I will go back to the configuration and continue applying a few more settings to enable masquerading out the <code>eth0</code> interface (again, this can be different on your machine) and allow traffic that comes in on the <code>wg0</code> interface (named after the configuration file) to go out on <code>eth0</code>.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This completes this part of the setup. To use the server to resolve DNS queries and block ads, I setup Pi-Hole and Unbound next.</p>
<h3 id="pi-hole-setup">Pi-Hole Setup</h3>
<p>I installed Pi-Hole using the automated script from their <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/">website</a>. I won‚Äôt go into the details of piping a script to bash directly, but for those of you who wish to dissect the script or use alternative methods, you can clone the repo and run the script that way, or you can download the installer file and run it. You can also use Docker to deploy it, but I won‚Äôt cover those in this guide.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You‚Äôll be greeted by a step by step <em>graphical</em> install. Assuming you‚Äôre using a VPS with a dedicated IP, you can confirm that you do have a Static IP and select <strong>Continue</strong>. You‚Äôll next be asked for the interface, at this stage select <code>wg0</code> as we want Pi-Hole to run for those connected on the Wireguard interface.</p>
<p>For upstream DNS provider I selected Quad9 for now. Next you‚Äôll be asked to confirm using the suggested block list, select <strong>Yes</strong> and continue the install. Select <strong>Yes</strong> for the admin interface and select <strong>Yes</strong> to install <code>lighttpd</code> and the required PHP modules (adjust if you don‚Äôt wish to use these). It is up to yourself if you wish to enable query logging or not. You can turn this off later on, if you enable it now. Select the privacy level for the query log.</p>
<p>Once the install finishes you should see the IP on which Pi-Hole is running, the interface on which it is running and the password. Make sure to save the password.</p>
<p>With both the server and the client configured and Pi-Hole installed, we‚Äôre close to turning on the client. Before that, there is one thing to consider. The client configuration sets the server as the DNS resolver. However, the server currently only allows access to port 12345 (SSH) and port 51820 for Wireguard. Ubuntu has <code>systemd-resolved</code> using port 53 for DNS resolution, but access to this port is currently restricted, so I‚Äôll add one more rule to UFW on the server, to allow requests to port 53 coming from the Wireguard IP range I defined earlier.</p>
<p>I also want to be able to configure Pi-Hole once I bring the Wireguard interface up, so for that I need to tell UFW to allow connections to port 80 (HTTP) on the Wireguard IP range.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Allow requests to port 53 from any ip in the 10.10.10.1 - 10.10.10.255 range</span>

</span></span><span><span>$ ufw reload
</span></span><span><span><span># Check rules are showing up</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ ufw status numbered
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>At this point, I can copy the contents of the client config to my desktop, bring up the interface on the desktop (using <code>wg-quick</code>) and navigate to http://10.10.10.1/admin and change any settings on the Pi-Hole instance running on the VPS server. But before doing that, I want to have Unbound setup on the server too, and then bring up the interface on my desktop and change the DNS resolver on Pi-Hole from Quad9 to Unbound.</p>
<h3 id="unbound">Unbound</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> is a recursive, caching DNS resolver. During the Pi-Hole setup, I had picked an upstream DNS resolver, but the issue is, from a privacy standpoint, that the upstream server (in this case Quad9) knows my queries and the queries of everyone using VPS as their DNS, because it‚Äôs not VPS resolving the query, it just forwards it to the upstream provider. More information on this, along with the Unbound configuration and setup can be found on the <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/">Pi-Hole website</a>.</p>
<p>In this guide I‚Äôll just walk you through the setup of Unbound and the configuration I use. To start off, I‚Äôll install unbound and configure it.</p>
<p>Chances are that at this point when you check the status of the Unbound service, it shows as failed. The reason is that you have already a resolver running on port 53. To get around this, I setup a new configuration for Unbound in line with the one provided in the Pi-Hole documentation, with a few tweaks to match my VPS and IP ranges.</p>
<p>I create the new configuration file at <em>/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf</em>, and more details on options and how to change them can be found at the <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/">Unbound configuration</a> documentation.</p>

<p>With this, we‚Äôre almost done. I now turn on the Wireguard interface on the desktop as I have the configuration file prepared previously, and I added the client to the VPS‚Äôs list of peers.</p>
<p>This will disconnect the current SSH connection, but assuming all previous steps went OK, I am able to reconnect to the VPS server and also access http://10.10.10.1/admin to reach the admin interface for the current Pi-Hole installation.</p>

</span></span><span><span>$ sudo systemctl status wg-quick@dwg0.service
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now I can go to the admin interface of the Pi-Hole installation I had setup earlier and change the DNS provider from Quad9 to the instance of Unbound that runs on port 5353 on the VPS.</p>
<p>Once I log into the interface using the password displayed at the end of the Pi-Hole installation, I next go to <strong>Settings</strong>, select the <strong>DNS</strong> tab and here uncheck the Quad9 section in the <strong>Upstream DNS Servers</strong> part of the page. Then, I check the <strong>Custom 1 (IPv4)</strong> checkbox and enter <code>127.0.0.1#5353</code>, make sure that <em>Bind only to interface wg0</em> is selected and then <strong>Save</strong> the settings.</p>
<p>Now I can visit <a href="https://dnsleaktest.com/">DNS Leak Test</a> and run an extended test. If everything runs as expected, the only result here should be the IP address of the VPS. If you are getting different servers showing up it means you are leaking DNS queries. There are a multitude of reasons for this, on Ubuntu derived distributions it might be down to Network Manager changing your DNS settings or you having different DNS servers configured which override the Wireguard DNS server.</p>
<p>This can be difficult to debug and it could take some time for you to chase it down, but some tips to get started would be to run <code>resolvectl dns</code> which will show you the global DNS (if this was configured in <em>/etc/systemd/resolved.conf</em>) or if a global DNS is picked up from somewhere else like <em>/run/systemd/resolve/resolved.conf</em> or Network Manager. For Network Manager, check <em>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections</em> and look for the name of your connection. The file in there will have a setting in the <code>[ipv4]</code> section called <code>dns</code>. This supports multiple DNS settings separated by semicolons.</p>
<p>There are further steps you could take and I recommend the <a href="https://andrea.corbellini.name/2020/04/28/ubuntu-global-dns/">following article by Andrea Corbellini</a>. You can also check to see if it was indeed Pi-Hole that listened and resolved your query by running <code>lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN</code> on the VPS and check to see if pihole is actually listening on port 53 or if there is another resolver that is using the port and responding to your queries.</p>
<h3 id="adding-mobile-clients">Adding Mobile Clients</h3>
<p>While getting a configuration file from the VPS to a device with a keyboard is simple, Android and iOS devices aren‚Äôt that straightforward. To get a configuration over to a mobile device, I use <code>qrencode</code>. The application creates a QR Code from a given configuration file.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Install qrencode</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ apt install qrencode
</span></span><span><span><span># Create a QR Code from the previously created dwg0.conf file  </span>
</span></span><span><span>$ qrencode -t ansiutf8 &lt; dwg0.conf
</span></span><span><span><span># If the file was created by root and you are now signed in with a non-root account then use </span>
</span></span><span><span>$ sudo sh -c <span>'qrencode -t ansiutf8 &lt; dwg0.conf'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above command outputs a QR code to the terminal directly, which you can then scan with the Wireguard application on iOS or Android. Don‚Äôt forget that you need different configuration files for each new device you wish to add, so don‚Äôt try to reuse the same configuration file across multiple devices.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-home-server-resources">Accessing Home Server Resources</h3>
<p>One more goal that I wanted to achieve was that of being able to access my home server resources while I‚Äôm not on my home network. The final setup is a bit clunky, but it works for now. I‚Äôd be curious about any improvements any of you out there can think of. Feel free to e-mail me with any alternatives or ideas on the <em>vpn</em> email address for this domain.</p>
<p>First, go to the Pi-Hole administrator website, select <strong>Local DNS</strong> and then <strong>DNS Records</strong>. Then, add a number of domain/IP addresses to cover your use cases. While the VPN IP address range covers <code>10.10.10.0/24</code> the local home network IP address range covers <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>. Assuming these IP ranges, I ended up with the following list, assuming the home server runs on <code>10.10.10.10</code> within the Wireguard network and <code>192.168.1.10</code> on the local network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Domain Name / IP Address</li>
<li><em>emby.home.server</em> / <code>192.168.1.10</code></li>
<li><em>emby.travel.server</em> / <code>10.10.10.10</code></li>
<li><em>torrent.home.server</em> / <code>192.168.1.10</code></li>
<li><em>torrent.travel.server</em> / <code>10.10.10.10</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The home server is running a reverse proxy in front of these services, so each call gets resolved by the reverse proxy to their respective services. The VPS is already allowing traffic to port <code>80</code>, but if you are using HTTPS on any of these services, you would also need a rule to allow traffic to port <code>443</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly, any request coming in on the VPS <code>wg0</code> interface needs to be forwarded out on the same interface, so a couple more <code>ufw</code> rules need added to allow any device to easily reach these services whether they sit on the same LAN, or connect via Wireguard.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Set the following ufw rules on the VPS - this allows forwarding of requests received on wg0 on wg0</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ ufw route allow in on wg0 out on wg0
</span></span><span><span><span># Set the rule to allow HTTPS traffic if your services are running with HTTPS</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ ufw allow from 10.10.10.0/24 to any port <span>443</span>
</span></span><span><span>$ ufw reload
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>An easier way to persist the rules is to add them to the <code>PostUp</code> and <code>PreDown</code> sections of the Wireguard configuration file. The above settings also mean that if I‚Äôm on my home network, I can use <em>emby.home.server</em> and access my home server with its local IP address and when I‚Äôm outside my home network, then I can access it via <em>emby.travel.server</em>. It‚Äôs not ideal, but this seemed to work most consistently across various OSes, devices and apps.</p>
<p>With this change, the <em>travel</em> or external domain should work, but the local one might not, depending on the device you try to access it from. That is because the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting tells Wireguard to route all traffic through the tunel, but the IP 192.168.1.10 is not reachable through the Wireguard network, as it is an internal network IP address. On most Linux distributions, there are default rules in place to route traffic to these internal or default IP ranges. On Linux you can check the default routes with <code>ip route show table main</code>. On other devices, you need to adjust the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting, so that all traffic, except for that particular IP range, is routed through the Wireguard tunnel.</p>
<p>I used this <a href="https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/03/wireguard-allowedips-calculator/">Wireguard AllowedIPs Calculator</a> to update the IP range for my mobile devices. By setting <em>Allowed IPs</em> on the page to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> and the <em>Disallowed IPs</em> to <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>, I would get a list of <code>AllowedIPs</code> like such:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>AllowedIPs <span>=</span> 0.0.0.0/1, 128.0.0.0/2, 192.0.0.0/9, 192.128.0.0/11, 192.160.0.0/13, 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.2.0/23, 192.168.4.0/22, 192.168.8.0/21, 192.168.16.0/20, 192.168.32.0/19, 192.168.64.0/18, 192.168.128.0/17, 192.169.0.0/16, 192.170.0.0/15, 192.172.0.0/14, 192.176.0.0/12, 192.192.0.0/10, 193.0.0.0/8, 194.0.0.0/7, 196.0.0.0/6, 200.0.0.0/5, 208.0.0.0/4, 224.0.0.0/3
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>On mobile clients you can also go directly into the Wireguard app, click on edit and select the checkbox <em>Exclude private IPs</em> then save the changes to the configuration file. With these changes you should now be able to reach applications on your local network or through the tunnel using the above domain names.</p>
<h3 id="testing-connection-speed-between-vps-and-client-linux">Testing Connection Speed Between VPS and Client (Linux)</h3>
<p>If after the setup, you notice that your connection isn‚Äôt that great or that you see a significant drop in connection performance, you can test the connection speed between the VPS and a client that is running Linux using <code>iperf3</code>. This is a good way to check if your speed is slow because of the VPS or some other factors. I would recommend using the <a href="https://speed.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Speedtest</a> on a client to get an idea of your current speed without the Wireguard tunnel enabled.</p>
<p>You can then use the <code>speedtest-cli</code> application on the VPS to test its upload and download connection and then use <code>iperf3</code> to test the speed of the connection between client and VPS to find any bottlenecks.</p>
<p>On the VPS I install <code>iperf3</code> and allow connections on port <code>5201</code> to run the speed test. I then start <code>iperf3</code> in server mode, which sets it up to listen for incoming requests.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span># Install iperf3 if not already installed</span>

<p>In any case, I hope this article was useful and helped you setup your own Wireguard VPN server, access resources on your home network and provide network-wide ad-block for all your devices. By using a VPS you can generally cover a variety of devices for around $10 a month. This beats a lot of the providers out there and it does so while offering you full control over blocking lists and resources on the network.</p>

      <p>Messaging platform Discord has said the official ID photos of around 70,000 users have been stolen by hackers.</p><p>The app, which is popular with gamers and teenagers, said the hackers targeted a firm responsible for verifying the ages of its users. Discord said its own platform was not breached.</p>
<p>The stolen data could include personal information, partial credit card numbers and messages with Discord's customer service agents, the firm said.</p><p>No full credit card details, passwords or messages and activity beyond conversations with Discord customer support were leaked, it added.</p><p>Discord said it had revoked the third-party service's access and was continuing to investigate. It said all affected users have been contacted.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, we recommend impacted users stay alert when receiving messages or other communication that may seem suspicious," it said.</p><p>Until recently, a hack like this could not have happened, because companies had no need to process and collect proofs of age.</p>    <div data-component-name="sdc-article-related-stories">

<p>Now, so many governments are following the UK and introducing age verification for unsuitable or pornographic content that a company like Discord has to roll out age checks for a decent portion of its 200 million active users.</p><p>It's a bit like the way that shops have to check your age if you're buying alcohol - only because it's online, it comes with a lot of additional complications.</p>

<p>A shop, for instance, won't keep a copy of your passport once they've checked your age.</p><p>And it definitely won't keep it in a massive (yet strangely light) safe along with thousands of other passport photocopies, stored right by its front door, ready to be taken.</p><p>Online, it's surprisingly easy to do just that.</p><p><strong>Read more on Sky News:</strong><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/how-ai-is-driving-a-distortion-of-reality-when-it-comes-to-how-women-are-presented-online-13447270" target="_blank"><strong>AI 'distorting women online'</strong></a><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/do-we-need-digital-ids-in-the-uk-13438109" target="_blank"><strong>Pros and cons of digital IDs</strong></a><br><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tamed-algorithms-and-plummeting-pornography-views-impact-of-new-online-safety-rules-revealed-one-month-on-13416556" target="_blank"><strong>Impact of new online safety rules</strong></a></p>     <a href="https://news.sky.com/download-app" target="blank" data-tracking-label="ui-app-promo-download-link" data-type="" data-component-name="ui-app-promo" data-testid="app-promo">

<p>It's worth noting that the age verification system used by Discord wasn't hacked itself. That system asked people to take a photo of themselves, then used software to estimate their age. Once the check was complete, the image was immediately deleted.</p><p>The problem came with the appeals part of the process, which was supplied to Discord by a third party.</p><p>If someone thought that the age verification system had wrongly barred them from Discord they could send in a picture of their ID to prove their age. This collection of images was hacked. As a result, Discord says, more than 70,000 IDs are now in the possession of hackers.</p><p>(The hackers themselves claim that the number is much bigger - 2,185,151 photos. Discord says this is wrong and the hackers are simply trying to extort money. It's a messy situation.)</p>     
<p>There are ways to make age verification safer.

				I uploaded a photo on my phone to Microsoft's "OneDrive" file-hosting app ‚Äî and there was a surprise waiting under <em>Privacy and Permissions.</em>  "OneDrive uses AI to recognize faces in your photos..."</p><p> 
And... </p><p> 
"You can only turn off this setting 3 times a year."</p><p> 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G6tmCiS.png" alt="*" width="500"></p><p> 

If I moved the slidebar for that setting to the left (for "No"), it moved back to the right, and said "Something went wrong while updating this setting." (Apparently it's not one of those three times of the year.)</p><p> 

The feature is already rolling out to a limited number of users in a preview, a Microsoft publicist confirmed to Slashdot. (For the record, I don't remember signing up for this face-recognizing "preview".) But there's a link at the bottom of the screen for a "Microsoft Privacy Statement" that leads to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/group-photos-by-people-21065f48-c746-48ad-a98a-cbe4631631bc">a Microsoft support page</a>, which says instead that "This feature is coming soon and is yet to be released."  And in the next sentence it's been saying "Stay tuned for more updates"  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231109163626/https://support.microsoft.com/">for almost two years</a>...</p><p> 

A Microsoft publicist <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users#microsoft_spokesperson">agreed to answer Slashdot's questions</a>...</p></div>

		
			<p><span><p>  <a name="microsoft_spokesperson"> </a> <strong>Slashdot:</strong> What's the reason OneDrive tells users this setting can only be turned off 3 times a year?   (And are those any three times ‚Äî or does that mean three specific days, like Christmas, New Year's Day, etc.)</p><p> 

[Microsoft's publicist chose not to answer this question.]</p><p> 

<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  If I move the slidebar to the left (for "No"), it moves back to the right, and says "Something went wrong while updating this setting."   So is it correct to say that there's no way for users to select  "No" now?</p><p> 

<strong>Microsoft:</strong> We haven't heard about the experience you are having with toggling, but our Microsoft contacts would like to investigate why this is happening for you. Can you share what type of device you are using, so we can put you in touch with the right team?</p><p> 
<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  Is this feature really still "coming soon"?   Can you give me more specific details on when "soon" will be?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong>  This feature is currently rolling out to limited users in a preview so we can learn and improve. We have nothing more to share at this time.</p><p> 

<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  I want to confirm something about how this feature is "yet to be released."  Does this mean that currently OneDrive is not (and has never) used AI to "recognize" faces in photos?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong>  Privacy is built into all Microsoft OneDrive experiences. Microsoft OneDrive services adhere to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a> and follow Microsoft's compliance with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy/european-data-boundary-eudb">Microsoft EU Data Boundary</a>.</p><p> 
<strong>Slashdot:</strong>  Some privacy advocates prefer "opt-in" features, but it looks like here OneDrive is planning a (limited) opt-out feature.  What is the reasoning for going with opt-out rather than opt-in?</p><p> 
<strong>Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft OneDrive inherits privacy features and settings from Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, where applicable.</p><p> 

Slashdot also spoke to EFF security/privacy activist Thorin Klosowski, who expressed concerns. "Any feature related to privacy really should be opt-in and companies should provide clear documentation so its users can understand the risks and benefits to make that choice for themselves."</p><p> 

Microsoft's "three times a year" policy also seemed limiting to Klosowski.  "People should also be able to change those settings at-will whenever possible because we all encounter circumstances were we need to re-evaluate and possibly change our privacy settings."</p></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I first started programming Java at IBM back in 1999 as a Pre-University Employee. If I remember correctly, we had Java 1.1.8 installed at that time, but were moving to Java 1.2 (‚ÄúJava 2‚Äù), which was a massive release‚ÄîI remember engineers at the time grumbling that the ever-present ‚Äú<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298118.Java_in_a_Nutshell">Java in a Nutshell</a>‚Äù book had grown to over 600 pages. I thought I‚Äôd take a look back at 26 years of Java releases and rate some of the language and core library changes (Java SE only) that have occurred over this time. It‚Äôs a very different language to what I started out with!</p>



<p>I can‚Äôt possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history">cover every feature of those releases</a>, as there are just way too many. So I‚Äôm just going to cherry-pick some that seemed significant at the time, or have been in retrospect. I‚Äôm not going to cover UI- or graphics-related stuff (Swing, Java2D etc), or VM/GC improvements. Just language changes and core libraries. And obviously this is highly subjective. Feel free to put your own opinions in the comments! The descriptions are brief and not intended as an introduction to the features in question: see the links from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history">Wikipedia page</a> for more background.</p>



<p>NB: later features are listed from when they were first introduced as a preview.</p>



<h2>Java 2 ‚Äì 1998</h2>



<p><strong>The Collections Framework</strong>: before the collections framework, there was just raw arrays, Vector, and Hashtable. It gets the job done, but I don‚Äôt think anyone thinks the Java collections framework is particularly well designed. One of the biggest issues was a failure to distinguish between mutable and immutable collections, strange inconsistencies like why Iterator as a remove() method (but not, say, update or insert), and so on. Various improvements have been made over the years, and I do still use it in preference to pulling in a better alternative library, so it has shown the test of time in that respect. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 1.4 ‚Äì 2002</h2>



<p><strong>The <code>assert</code> keyword: </strong>I remember being somewhat outraged at the time that they could introduce a new keyword! I‚Äôm personally quite fond of asserts as an easy way to check invariants without having to do complex refactoring to make things unit-testable, but that is not a popular approach. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw an assert in any production Java code. <strong>3/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Regular expressions:</strong> Did I really have to wait 3 years to use regex in Java? I don‚Äôt remember ever having any issues with the implementation they finally went for. The Matcher class is perhaps a little clunky, but gets the job done. Good, solid, essential functionality. <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúNew‚Äù I/O</strong> (NIO): Provided non-blocking I/O for the first time, but really just a horrible API (still inexplicably using 32-bit <em>signed</em> integers for file sizes, limiting files to 2GB, confusing interface). I still basically never use these interfaces except when I really need to. I learnt Tcl/Tk at the same time that I learnt Java, and Java‚Äôs I/O always just seemed extraordinarily baroque for no good reason. Has barely improved in 2 and a half decades. <strong>0/10</strong></p>



<p>Also notable in this release was the <strong>new crypto APIs</strong>: the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) added encryption and MAC support to the existing signatures and hashes, and we got JSSE for SSL. Useful functionality, dr<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peumD3MY8So">eadful error-prone APIs</a>. <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 5 ‚Äì 2004</h2>



<p>Absolutely <em>loads</em> of changes in this release. This feels like the start of modern Java to me.</p>



<p><strong>Generics</strong>: as Go discovered on its attempt to speed-run Java‚Äôs mistakes all over again, if you don‚Äôt add generics from the start then you‚Äôll have to retrofit them later, badly. I wouldn‚Äôt want to live without them, and the rapid and universal adoption of them shows what a success they‚Äôve been. They certainly have complicated the language, and there are plenty of rough edges (type erasure, reflection, etc), but God I wouldn‚Äôt want to live without them. <strong>8/10</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Annotations:</strong> sometimes useful, sometimes overused. I know I‚Äôve been guilty of abusing them in the past. At the time it felt like they were ushering a new age of custom static analysis, but that doesn‚Äôt really seem to be used much. Mostly just used to mark things as deprecated or when overriding a method. Meh. <strong>5/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Autoboxing:</strong> there was a time when, if you wanted to store an integer in a collection, you had to manually convert to and from the primitive int type and the Integer ‚Äúboxed‚Äù class. Such conversion code was everywhere. Java 5 got rid of that, by getting the compiler to insert those conversions for you. Brevity, but no less inefficient. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Enums</strong>: I‚Äôd learned Haskell by this point, so I couldn‚Äôt see the point of introducing enums without going the whole hog and doing algebraic datatypes and pattern-matching. (Especially as Scala launched about this time). Decent feature, and a good implementation, but underwhelming. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Vararg methods:</strong> these have done quite a lot to reduce verbosity across the standard library. A nice small improvement that‚Äôs had a good quality of life enhancement. I still never really know when to put @SafeVarargs annotations on things though. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>The for-each loop:</strong> cracking, use it all the time. Still not a patch on Tcl‚Äôs foreach (which can loop over multiple collections at once), but still very good. Could be <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2012/06/03/pimp-my-java/">improved</a> and has been somewhat replaced by Streams. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Static imports:</strong> Again, a good simple change. I probably would have avoided adding * imports for statics, but it‚Äôs quite nice for DSLs. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Doug Lea‚Äôs java.util.concurrent etc</strong>: these felt really well designed. So well designed that everyone started using them in preference to the core collection classes, and they ended up back-porting a lot of the methods. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 7 ‚Äì 2011</h2>



<p>After the big bang of Java 5, Java 6 was mostly performance and VM improvements, I believe, so we had to wait until 2011 for more new language features.</p>



<p><strong>Strings in switch:</strong> seems like a code smell to me. Never use this, and never see it used. <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Try-with-resources</strong>: made a huge difference in exception safety. Combined with the improvements in exception chaining (so root cause exceptions are not lost), this was a massive win. Still use it everywhere. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Diamond operator for type parameter inference:</strong> a good minor syntactic improvement to cut down the visual noise. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Binary literals and underscores in literals:</strong> again, minor syntactic sugar. Nice to have, rarely something I care about much. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Path and Filesystem APIs:</strong> I tend to use these over the older File APIs, but just because it feels like I should. I couldn‚Äôt really tell you if they are better or not. Still overly verbose. Still insanely hard to set file permissions in a cross-platform way. <strong>3/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 8 ‚Äì 2014</h2>



<p><strong>Lambdas: </strong> somewhat controversial at the time. I was very in favour of them, but only use them sparingly these days, due to ugly stack traces and other drawbacks. Named method references provide most of the benefit without being anonymous. Deciding to exclude checked exceptions from the various standard functional interfaces was understandable, but also regularly a royal PITA. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Streams:</strong> Ah, streams. So much potential, but so frustrating in practice. I was hoping that Java would just do the obvious thing and put filter/map/reduce methods onto Collection and Map, but they went with this instead. The benefits of functional programming weren‚Äôt enough to carry the feature, I think, so they had to justify it by promising easy parallel computing. This scope creep enormously over-complicated the feature, makes it hard to debug issues, and yet I almost never see parallel streams being used. What I do still see quite regularly is resource leaks from people not realising that the stream returned from Files.lines() has to be close()d when you‚Äôre done‚Äîbut doing so makes the code a lot uglier. Combine that with ugly hacks around callbacks that throw checked exceptions, the non-discoverable API (where are the static helper functions I need for this method again?), and the large impact on lots of very common code, and I have to say I think this was one of the largest blunders in modern Java. I blogged what I<a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2012/06/03/pimp-my-java/"> thought was a better approach</a> 2 years earlier, and I still think it would have been better. There was plenty of good research that <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/A+generic+collection+traversal+interface">different approaches were better</a>, since at least <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/Iteratee/#enumerator-stream">Oleg Kiselyov‚Äôs work in the early noughties</a>.  <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Java Time:</strong> Much better than what came before, but I have barely had to use much of this API at all, so I‚Äôm not in a position to really judge how good this is. Despite knowing how complex time and dates are, I do have a nagging suspicion that surely it doesn‚Äôt all need to be <em>this</em> complex? <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 9 ‚Äì 2017</h2>



<p><strong>Modules:</strong> I still don‚Äôt really know what the point of all this was. Enormous upheaval for minimal concrete benefit that I can discern. The general advice seems to be that modules are (should be) an internal detail of the JRE and best ignored in application code (apart from when they spuriously break things). Awful. <strong>-10/10</strong> (that‚Äôs minus 10!)</p>



<p><strong>jshell:</strong> cute! A REPL! Use it sometimes. Took them long enough. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 10 ‚Äì&nbsp;2018</h2>



<p>The start of time-based releases, and a distinct ramp-up of features from here on, trying to keep up with the kids.</p>



<p><strong>Local type inference (‚Äúvar‚Äù)</strong>:<strong> </strong>Some love this, some hate it. I‚Äôm definitely in the former camp. <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 11 ‚Äì 2018</h2>



<p><strong>New HTTP Client</strong>: replaced the old URL.openStream() approach by creating something more like Apache HttpClient. It works for most purposes, but I do find the interface overly verbose. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p>This release also added <strong>TLS 1.3</strong> support, along with djb-suite crypto algorithms. Yay. <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 12 ‚Äì 2019</h2>



<p><strong>Switch expressions</strong>: another nice mild quality-of-life improvement. Not world changing, but occasionally nice to have. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 13 ‚Äì 2019</h2>



<p><strong>Text blocks:</strong> on the face of it, what‚Äôs not to like about multi-line strings? Well, apparently there‚Äôs a good reason that injection attacks remain high on the OWASP Top 10, as <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/355">the JEP introducing this feature</a> seemed intent on getting everyone writing SQL, HTML and JavaScript using string concatenation again. Nearly gave me a heart attack at the time, and still seems like a pointless feature. Text templates (later) are trying to fix this, but seem to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1bxck72/there_will_be_no_string_template_in_jdk_23/">currently in limbo</a>. <strong>3/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 14 ‚Äì 2020</h2>



<p><strong>Pattern matching in <code>instanceof</code>:</strong> a little bit of syntactic sugar to avoid an explicit cast. But didn‚Äôt we all agree that using <code>instanceof</code> was a bad idea decades ago? I‚Äôm really not sure who was doing the cost/benefit analysis on these kinds of features. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Records:</strong> about bloody time! Love ‚Äòem. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Better error messages for NullPointerExceptions:</strong> lovely. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 15 ‚Äì 2020</h2>



<p><strong>Sealed classes:</strong> in principal I like these a lot. We‚Äôre slowly getting towards a weird implementation of algebraic datatypes. I haven‚Äôt used them very much yet so far. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>EdDSA signatures:</strong> again, a nice little improvement in the built-in cryptography. Came with a <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/">rather serious bug</a> though‚Ä¶ <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 16 ‚Äì 2021</h2>



<p><strong>Vector (SIMD) API: </strong>this will be great when it is finally done, but still baking several years later. <strong>?/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 17 ‚Äì 2021</h2>



<p><strong>Pattern matching switch:</strong> another piece of the algebraic datatype puzzle. Seems somehow more acceptable than instanceof, despite being largely the same idea in a better form. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 18 ‚Äì 2022</h2>



<p><strong>UTF-8 by default: </strong>Fixed a thousand encoding errors in one fell swoop. <strong>10/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 19 ‚Äì 2022</h2>



<p><strong>Record patterns:</strong> an obvious extension, and I think we‚Äôre now pretty much there with ADTs? <strong>9/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Virtual threads: </strong>being someone who never really got on with async/callback/promise/reactive stream-based programming in Java, I was really happy to see this feature. I haven‚Äôt really had much reason to use them in anger yet, so I don‚Äôt know how well they‚Äôve been done. But I‚Äôm hopeful! <strong>?/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 21 ‚Äì 2023</h2>



<p><strong>String templates: </strong>these are exactly what I asked for in <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2023/01/18/a-few-programming-language-features-id-like-to-see/">A few programming language features I‚Äôd like to&nbsp;see</a>, based on E‚Äôs quasi-literal syntax, and they fix the issues I had with text blocks. Unfortunately, the first design had some issues, and so they‚Äôve gone back to the drawing board. Hopefully not for too long. I really wish they‚Äôd not released text blocks without this feature. <strong>10/10</strong> (if they ever arrive).</p>



<p><strong>Sequenced collections:</strong> a simple addition that adds a common super-type to all collections that have a defined ‚Äúencounter order‚Äù: lists, deques, sorted sets, etc. It defines convenient getFirst() and getLast() methods and a way to iterate items in the defined order or in reverse order. This is a nice unification, and plugs what seems like an obvious gap in the collections types, if perhaps not the most pressing issue? <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Wildcards in patterns:</strong> adds the familiar syntax from Haskell and Prolog etc of using <code>_</code> as a non-capturing wildcard variable in patterns when you don‚Äôt care about the value of that part. <strong>6/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simplified console applications:</strong> Java finally makes simple programs simple for beginners, about a decade after universities stopped teaching Java to beginners‚Ä¶ Snark aside, this is a welcome simplification. <strong>8/10</strong></p>



<p>This release also adds support for <strong><a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2021/01/22/hybrid-encryption-and-the-kem-dem-paradigm/">KEMs</a></strong>, although in the <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2021/02/16/when-a-kem-is-not-enough/">simplest possible form</a> only. Meh. <strong>4/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 22 ‚Äì&nbsp;2024</h2>



<p>The only significant change in this release is the ability to have <strong>statements before a call to super() </strong>in a constructor. Fine. <strong>5/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 23 ‚Äì 2024</h2>



<p><strong>Primitive types in patterns: </strong>plugs a gap in pattern matching. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<p><strong>Markdown javadoc comments:</strong> Does anyone really care about this? <strong>1/10</strong></p>



<h2>Java 24 ‚Äì 2024</h2>



<p>The main feature here from my point of view as a crypto geek is the addition of <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong> in the form of the newly standardised ML-KEM and ML-DSA algorithms, and support in TLS. </p>



<h2>Java 25 ‚Äì 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Stable values:</strong> this is essentially support for lazily-initialised final variables. Lazy initialisation is often trickier than it should be in Java, so this is a welcome addition. Remembering <a href="https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/alice/manual/futures.html#lazy">Alice ML</a>, I wonder if there is some overlap between the proposed StableValue and a Future? <strong>7/10</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>PEM encoding of cryptographic objects</strong> is welcome from my point of view, but someone will need to tell me why this is not just <code>key/cert.getEncoded(‚ÄúPEM‚Äù)</code>? Decoding support is useful though, as that‚Äôs a frequent reason I have to grab Bouncy Castle still. <strong>7/10</strong></p>



<p>Well, that brings us pretty much up to date. What do you think? Agree, disagree? Are you a passionate defender of streams or Java modules? Have at it in the comments.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>After the <a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-assassinated/">murder</a> of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, many on the political right set out to <a href="https://reason.com/2025/09/16/the-perverse-incentives-for-snitch-tagging-teachers-who-criticized-charlie-kirk/?nab=0">punish</a> anyone making light of the tragedy, or even simply being insufficiently upset. In one of the more brazen examples, a Tennessee man was arrested, accused of threatening a school shooting, and held on a $2 million bond, for posting a somewhat uncivil meme on Facebook.</p> <p>Larry Bushart, a 61-year-old former police officer, <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2025/09/22/former-officer-accused-posting-threatening-meme-referencing-school-shooting-tn/">posted</a> the offending meme last month. In <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">response</a> to a Facebook post about an upcoming vigil for Kirk, Bushart shared an <a href="https://x.com/aaronterr1/status/1970272191884468241">image</a> of President Donald Trump with the quote, "We have to get over it," which Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-supporters-get-iowa-school-shooting-move-forward-rcna132610">said</a> in January 2024 after a shooting at Iowa's Perry High School. Text added to the image said, "This seems relevant today."</p> <p>Bushart did not elaborate, but the context seems clear: <em>Why should I care about this shooting, when the sitting president said I should "get over" this other shooting?</em></p> <p>The image was one of <a href="https://wopclive.linkedupradio.com/assets/images/2025/IMG_7383.webp">several</a> Bushart posted, and it was far from the most offensive. Still, it certainly feels crass; as people mourned a brutal public murder, Bushart snidely used the occasion to make a partisan political point. But it's certainly well within the bounds of average social media discourse, and you certainly wouldn't expect it to bring the attention of the local police.</p> <p>"Received a visit from Lexington PD regarding my posted memes," Bushart wrote in a September 21 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BAP29mMvt/">Facebook status</a>. <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">According to</a> Sheriff Nick Weems of nearby Perry County, "numerous‚Ä¶teachers, parents and students"&nbsp;somehow interpreted Bushart's meme‚Äîwith its citation in fine print about a previous school shooting at Perry High School in Perry, Iowa‚Äîas a threat to carry out a similar shooting at nearby Perry County High School.</p> <p>According to the Perry County Sheriff's Office <a href="https://isoms.perrycountysheriff.net/portal/Jail?hours=0&amp;lname=B">website</a>, Bushart was arrested the following morning on a charge of Threats of Mass Violence on School Property and Activities‚Äîa class E <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-39/chapter-16/part-5/section-39-16-517/">felony</a> <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-40-criminal-procedure/tn-code-sect-40-35-111/">punishable</a> by between one and six years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine.

Even just to get out of jail ahead of trial, state law says Bushart would have to pay a bondsman at least $210,000.</p> <p>The Perry County Circuit Court <a href="https://perry.tncrtinfo.com/crCaseForm.aspx?id=ADDFC002-5567-44CA-B209-DA2909E6869F&amp;dsid=fd8e7548">website</a> indicates Bushart had a motion hearing scheduled for October 9, but when reached by phone Friday, a court clerk told <em>Reason</em> the hearing was "reset" for December 4.</p> <p>Bushart posted the Trump meme "to indicate or make the audience think it was referencing our Perry High School," Weems <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">told&nbsp;<em>The Tennesseean</em></a> in a statement. "Investigators believe Bushart was fully aware of the fear his post would cause and intentionally sought to create hysteria within the community." Weems <a href="https://wopclive.com/local-news/808311/sheriff-man-arrested-for-mass-violence-threats-following-facebook-post">also told</a> local radio station WOPC the meme "eluded [<em>sic</em>] to a hypothetical shooting at a place called Perry High School."</p> <p>This justification is downright laughable. In its entirety, the post consists of a direct quote of a statement by the then-former president about a newsworthy event, with text providing context, plus a four-word phrase added. Bushart didn't even create the meme: <em>The Tennesseean</em>'s Angele Latham noted it had been "posted numerous times across multiple social media platforms not connected to Bushart going back to 2024."</p> <p>"Quote the President of the United States, go to jail," Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, <a href="https://x.com/adamsteinbaugh/status/1976087431947649466">posted</a> on X.</p> <p>In context, it's clear Bushart meant to suggest that since Trump previously said people should "get over" a school shooting, then they shouldn't be expected to care about the murder of a conservative public figure. It's quite a stretch to suggest this constituted a threat to shoot up a high school. Yes, a nearby high school happened to have a similar name, but that was clearly a coincidence, and there is nothing to suggest Bushart intended to carry out violence against the local school.</p> <p>On social media, some have <a href="https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1976276224197730800">suggested</a> the meme in question was part of a larger pattern indicating Bushart posed a threat. But in his <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/09/23/tennessee-larry-bushart-arrest-charlie-kirk/86313013007/">statement</a> to <em>The Tennesseean</em>, Weems specifically singled out the Trump meme as the offender, saying while the other posts were "hate memes," they were "not against the law and would be recognized as free speech."</p> <p>Perhaps some teachers, parents, or students really did find Bushart's post threatening‚Äîthough since it was a reply on a Facebook page for local news, it's not clear how many people even saw it. And even if people did see and interpret it as a threat of violence, that doesn't mean it meets the standard for a "true threat," in violation of the First Amendment.</p> <p>"True threats are not protected speech but not everything is a true threat," David Hudson, professor at Belmont University School of Law, tells <em>Reason</em>. "This seems to me to be heated rhetorical hyperbole, which is an incredibly important concept‚Äîor should be‚Äîin true threat-type cases."</p> <p>The U.S. Supreme Court created the true threat exception to the First Amendment in the 1969 decision <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/394/705/"><em>Watts v. United States</em></a>. Even then, Hudson adds, it made the point of distinguishing between true threats and "crude political hyperbole"‚Äîin that case, a protester's remark that if he were drafted into the Army, "the first man I want to get in my sights is" then-President Lyndon Johnson. The court agreed with the plaintiff that it was not a true threat but simply "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President."</p> <p>"Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution," Justice William O. Douglas wrote in a concurring opinion.</p> <p>Bushart's arrest would be humorous if it weren't so serious. He now faces a potential years-long prison sentence for reposting a Facebook meme that doesn't come anywhere close to qualifying as an exception to the First Amendment. Even if the case gets thrown out, he has already spent two weeks in jail and is set to spend two more months until his first hearing.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

          <p>Amazon Echo Show owners are reporting an uptick in advertisements on their smart displays.</p>
<p>The company's Echo Show smart displays have <a href="https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q0000DYDLBvSQP/why-is-my-echo-show-suddenly-showing-ads-and-how-do-i-turn-them-off">previously shown</a> ads through the company's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21213736011">Shopping Lists</a> feature, as well as advertising for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/get-ready-for-alexa-skills-pop-up-ads-on-your-amazon-echo-show/">Alexa skills</a>.&nbsp;Additionally, Echo Shows may play audio ads when users listen to Amazon Music on Alexa.</p>
<p>However, reports on Reddit (examples <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0y0rw/ads_this_will_cause_me_to_unplug_all_show_devices/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nku3j6/ads_after_alarm/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nj0kxc/echo_show_wont_stop_advertising_amazon_plus/">here</a>) and from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/797672/amazon-echo-show-ads-alexa-plus">The Verge‚Äôs</a> Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, who owns more than one Echo Show, suggest that Amazon has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nuucj0/how_are_we_still_getting_ads_on_alexa/">increased the amount of ads</a> it shows on its smart displays' home screens. The Echo Show‚Äôs apparent increase in ads is pushing people to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0y0rw/ads_this_will_cause_me_to_unplug_all_show_devices/">stop</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nlzdbg/comment/nf92nhm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">using</a> or even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1o0o3an/question_im_returning_my_echo_show_because_it_has/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">return</a> their Echo Shows.</p>
<p>The smart displays have also started showing ads for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amazons-subscription-based-alexa-looks-highly-capable-and-questionable/">Alexa+</a>, the new generative AI version of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. Ads for the subscription-based Alexa+ are reportedly taking over Echo Show screens, even though the service is still in Early Access.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is getting ridiculous and I'm about to just toss the whole thing and move back to Google,‚Äù one Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1nj0kxc/echo_show_wont_stop_advertising_amazon_plus/">said</a> of the ‚Äúfull-volume‚Äù ads for Alexa+ on their Echo Show.</p>
<p>The Verge‚Äôs Tuohy reported seeing ads on one (but not all) of her Echo Shows for the first time this week and said ads sometimes show when the display is set to show personal photos. She reported seeing ads for ‚Äúelderberry herbal supplements, Quest sports chips, and tabletop picture frames."</p>
<p>Users are unable to disable the home screen ads. When reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica:</p>
