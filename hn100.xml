<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We’re excited to share a preview of a <a href="https://frame.work/products/deep-computing-risc-v-mainboard">Framework Laptop 13 Mainboard with a new CPU architecture</a> today, and it’s probably not the one you think it is. The team at <a href="https://deepcomputing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepComputing</a> has built the first ever partner-developed Mainboard, and it uses a RISC-V processor! This is a huge milestone both for expanding the breadth of the Framework ecosystem and for making RISC-V more accessible than ever. We designed the Framework Laptop to enable deep flexibility and personalization, and now that extends all the way to processor architecture selection. DeepComputing is demoing an early prototype of this Mainboard in a Framework Laptop 13 at the RISC-V Summit Europe next week, and we’ll be sharing more as this program progresses.</p>
<p>There is excellent philosophical alignment between RISC-V and Framework. Both are built on the idea that an open ecosystem is more powerful than the sum of its parts. To explain why, first we’ll go into what RISC-V even is. <a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RISC-V</a> is a fully open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which is the interface point between software and hardware. It’s a defined set of instructions that software is compiled and assembled into that the processor executes to run the actual program. x86 (or the latest version, x86-64) is the most common ISA for PCs today, and it’s what is used in the processors for each Framework Laptop we’ve shipped to date. The x86 ISA was invented by Intel, extended on by AMD, and is proprietary, with Intel and AMD being effectively the only two companies able to use and create processors around it. ARM is another popular ISA, owned by Arm Holdings. Arm licenses the ARM architecture out, which enables companies to pay a license fee for cores to make their own processors that leverage it. What makes RISC-V unique is that it is an entirely open architecture, which means that anyone can extend on it and create their own processors that use it without paying a fee. RISC-V International is the collaborative organization that exists to help develop the standard and define common versions to ensure cross-compatibility of hardware and software. There are hundreds of companies now developing cores and chips around RISC-V, but most of these have been hidden away in embedded applications. The DeepComputing RISC-V Mainboard is one of the first instances of leveraging this ecosystem for the main processor in a consumer-facing product.</p>
<p>All of this is what makes RISC-V unique from an ecosystem enablement perspective. The actual technology is equally interesting. The base instruction set of RISC-V is simple and streamlined, while there are a number of extensions enabling high performance and specialized compute. This means that RISC-V cores can be developed for anything from tiny control CPUs embedded inside a sensor (the Fingerprint Reader we’ve used in Framework Laptops since 2021 actually has a RISC-V core!) to monstrous multi-hundred-core server processors. The DeepComputing RISC-V Mainboard uses a <a href="https://doc-en.rvspace.org/JH7110/PDF/JH7110_Product_Brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JH7110</a> processor from StarFive which has four <a href="https://starfivetech.com/uploads/u74mc_core_complex_manual_21G1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U74 RISC-V cores</a> from SiFive. SiFive is the company that developed CPU cores using the RISC-V ISA, StarFive is the processor designer that integrated those CPU cores with other peripherals, DeepComputing created a Mainboard leveraging that processor, and Framework makes laptops that can use the Mainboard. The power of an open ecosystem!</p>
<p>This Mainboard is extremely compelling, but we want to be clear that in this generation, it is focused primarily on enabling developers, tinkerers, and hobbyists to start testing and creating on RISC-V. The peripheral set and performance aren’t yet competitive with our Intel and AMD-powered Framework Laptop Mainboards. This board also has soldered memory and uses MicroSD cards and eMMC for storage, both of which are limitations of the processor. It is a great way to start playing with RISC-V though inside of a thin, light, refined laptop. The Mainboard will be able to drop into any Framework Laptop 13 chassis or into the Cooler Master Mainboard Case. DeepComputing is also working closely with the teams at Canonical and Red Hat to ensure Linux support is solid through Ubuntu and Fedora. We’ll continue to keep you up to date as we work with the team at DeepComputing to complete development of this new Mainboard and enable access to it. You can <a href="https://frame.work/products/deep-computing-risc-v-mainboard">sign up in the Framework Marketplace</a> to get notified when we have updates.</p>
<p>We have a couple of other updates around scaling access to Framework Laptop 13. The first is that just like we did for Framework Laptop 16 last week, today we’re sharing <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source CAD for the Framework Laptop 13 shell</a>, enabling development of skins, cases, and accessories. The second is that we now have <a href="https://frame.work/products/factory-seconds-framework-laptop-13-diy-edition-11th-gen-intel-core">Framework Laptop 13 Factory Seconds</a> systems available with British English and German keyboards, making entering the ecosystem more affordable than ever. We’re eager to continue growing a new Consumer Electronics industry that is grounded in open access, repairability, and customization at every level.</p>

      The EU Commission has presented a draft regulation that is to lay down rules for preventing and combating sexual violence against children (Chat Control Regulation). The planned regulation raises such significant fundamental rights concerns that the GFF is joining the debate while the draft is still being deliberated at EU level. The most important points of criticism at a glance.

  </figure>
                      <p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52022PC0209&amp;from=EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>EU Commission's draft regulation on chat control</span></a> is currently being negotiated in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. With the fight against sexual violence against children, the draft pursues an objective that is essential for the protection of children and their rights and can justify restrictions of fundamental rights. However, there are considerable doubts about the effectiveness of the proposed measures. We are convinced that the draft violates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in crucial points. We have summarised the five most important fundamental rights objections to the chat control proposal here. </p>

<h3 id="chat-control-violates-the-right-to-privacy">
  <span>Chat control violates the right to privacy</span></h3>
<p>The EU Commission's proposal provides for a whole range of obligations for certain online services such as internet access providers, app stores, hosting platforms and interpersonal communications services. Interpersonal communications services are, for example, email services such as GMail or instant messaging services such as WhatsApp. The term “chat control" is often used colloquially to refer to the EU Commission’s draft regulation as a whole. Chat control in the narrower sense is the part of the draft according to which authorities can oblige providers of communications services such as WhatsApp to monitor private communications. This is a particularly serious restriction on the right to privacy and the protection of personal data (Art. 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights): The monitoring is not limited to persons specifically suspected of having committed a crime. Additionally, unlike data retention, which is also incompatible with the Charter but is limited to metadata – i.e. information about who communicated with whom at what time – chat control includes the surveillance of the contents of private messages.</p>
<p>Authorities can impose so-called "detection orders" against providers of interpersonal communications services. This means that authorities can, for example, oblige messenger services to monitor the communications of all their users. It is sufficient that the authority has identified a significant risk that the service in question is being used for the dissemination of depictions of sexual violence against children. Detection orders do not have to be limited to monitoring the communications of specific users who are under suspicion. Instead, authorities can order that the content of all communications of all users of the service be monitored preventively. This is therefore a form of <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/my-spy-is-always-with-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>mass surveillance without probable cause</span></a>.</p>
<p>Such a detection order can oblige service providers to filter content for known as well as unknown depictions of sexual violence against children. In addition, they can include an obligation to detect attempts by adults to solicit minors (grooming). Content detected in this way must be forwarded by the service providers to a newly created EU centre, which will pass the information on to the law enforcement authorities of the member states after a plausibility check. Although service providers are free to choose which technologies they use to comply with the detection order, these technologies must in any case be able to analyse the contents of communications. In order to detect known depictions of sexual violence against children, an automated comparison of sent media files with a reference database may be sufficient. To detect unknown depictions of sexual violence and grooming, machine learning must be used to analyse the semantic content of chats. These methods are particularly prone to error: they only make an assumption about the meaning of the content based on patterns in the analysed communication - without actually understanding the content or the context of the conversation. In its case law on data retention, the European Court of Justice has indicated that indiscriminate mass surveillance of the contents of communications would <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/thank-you-very-much-your-mail-is-perfectly-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>violate the essence of the right to privacy</span></a>. </p>
<p>Indiscriminate mass surveillance is incompatible with the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection under the EU Charter, whether it involves encrypted or unencrypted communications. At the centre of public criticism of chat control, however, is the fact that the draft regulation does not exempt end-to-end encrypted communication services from detection orders. These services ensure that only the people involved in a private conversation can read the communication content – neither the service provider nor third parties can decrypt it. More and more people are specifically choosing end-to-end encrypted messengers to protect themselves. If the provider of such a messenger receives a detection order, it cannot reject it on the grounds that the service provider cannot access the contents of its users’ communications. The EU Commission's draft pays lip service to the importance of end-to-end encryption. However, service providers may only choose between technologies that allow them to detect illegal content in private communications, it states. In other words, service providers who offer end-to-end encryption without backdoors will not be able to implement any detection orders they may receive from authorities and thus come into conflict with the law. This attack on end-to-end encryption increases the intensity of the restriction of fundamental rights caused by indiscriminate mass surveillance.</p>
<h3 id="threat-of-chilling-effects-for-communication-freedoms">
  <span>Threat of chilling effects for communication freedoms</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1248552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>The European Court of Justice has already warned</span></a> on several occasions that indiscriminate mass surveillance has an indirect negative impact on freedom of expression (Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights): communication participants are prevented from freely expressing their opinions if they cannot be sure of the confidentiality of their communications. This particularly affects professional secrecy holders, such as journalists communicating with their sources, whistleblowers and opposition activists. This danger will be exacerbated if the Chat Control Regulation, as proposed by the EU Commission, attacks the end-to-end encryption of messenger services. The aforementioned groups of people use such messengers for good reason. If this possibility is taken away from them because service providers have to weaken end-to-end encryption, considerable "chilling effects", i.e. a deterrent effect for the exercise of the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information, can be expected.</p>
<p>This effect occurs regardless of whether service providers monitor the contents of private communications through a backdoor in the encryption technology or by scanning the content on the user's device before it is encrypted (client-side scanning). The communication participants expect their communication to remain confidential from the moment when they enter a message into the chat programme on their mobile phone – not only at the moment when this message is delivered to its addressee. The decisive factor is that the expectation of confidentiality and integrity of the communication process is shaken to such an extent that those affected feel compelled to restrict the exercise of their freedom of communication themselves. </p>
<h3 id="de-facto-filtering-obligations-for-hosting-providers-without-safeguards">
  <span>De facto filtering obligations for hosting providers without safeguards</span></h3>
<p>Public criticism of the proposal has concentrated on the phrase “chat control”, which highlights the planned obligations on messengers to scan private chats. But the planned obligations for hosting services that store third-party content on behalf of their users do not stand up to fundamental rights scrutiny either. Hosting services include those that make third-party content publicly available (platforms such as YouTube, hosting services of public websites) as well as those that offer their customers private cloud storage (Dropbox, iCloud Drive). They also include services where content is only accessible to a certain closed group of people (private accounts on Twitter, closed groups on Facebook, hosting providers of company websites with restricted access). Insofar as the planned obligations for hosting providers relate to non-public content, the threats to privacy and freedom of expression described under 1. and 2. are also relevant for hosting services. In addition, there are specific problems: many of the envisaged procedural fundamental rights safeguards for detection orders may end up being evaded entirely in the case of hosting services. This is due to the different privacy rules for communications on messengers on the one hand and hosting services on the other. </p>
<p>Hosting services (including private cloud storage providers such as Google Drive or Dropbox) can not only be required to scan private content under the Chat Control Regulation, they may also scan content voluntarily. The Chat Control Regulation stipulates that all service providers must first carry out their own risk analysis as to whether their services pose a risk of being abused for sexual violence against children. Only if, in the view of the authorities, a service provider responds to this risk analysis with insufficient voluntary measures will they impose a detection order. In the context of these self-selected measures, hosting service providers may resort to error-prone filters to monitor private user uploads. In this scenario, there is no public scrutiny of the impact of such measures on the fundamental rights of users.</p>
<p>In this respect, hosting services differ from messenger services: Messenger and email programmes such as Whatsapp, Signal or ProtonMail fall under the e-Privacy Directive, which in principle prohibits these service providers from monitoring the private communication content of their users. A temporary derogation from this prohibition, which itself raises <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>serious fundamental rights concerns</span></a>, is to be replaced by the Chat Control Regulation. After the Chat Control Regulation comes into force, messengers and email service providers may only access the contets of private communications on the basis of a detection order. For hosting providers such as private cloud storage, on the other hand, the e-Privacy Directive with its ban on monitoring private communications does not apply. </p>
<p>For hosting providers, it will regularly be attractive to avoid a looming detection order through "voluntary" measures. In this way, the companies retain more control – also over the costs. There is a strong incentive to avoid costly measures to protect users' fundamental rights. A likely scenario, then, is that hosting services will 'voluntarily' deploy error-prone filtering programmes without the procedural safeguards foreseen for authorities’ detection orders.</p>
<p>Before imposing a detection order, an authority must weigh the risk posed by the service against the interference with the users' fundamental rights. In this regard, the European Court of Justice has set narrow limits for the mandatory <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-401/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>use of filtering systems</span></a>. These are only compatible with the prohibition of general monitoring obligations if the filters function so faultlessly that the service providers do not have to perform an "independent assessment of the content" in order to rule out false positives. At least in the case of unknown depictions of sexual violence against children and grooming, the filter systems are incapable of meeting the Court’s standards. If a hosting service "voluntarily" filters content as part of its duty to minimise risk, there is no public assessment of whether the filtering systems are compatible with users’ fundamental rights. As a result, innocent users may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>inadvertently locked out of their accounts or even falsely reported to law enforcement authorities</span></a>.</p>
<h3 id="website-blocking-obligations-require-surveillance-of-internet-users">
  <span>Website blocking obligations require surveillance of Internet users</span></h3>
<p>The draft regulation provides for blocking obligations on internet access providers relating to individual websites (URLs). Before an authority issues a blocking order, it must require internet access providers to provide the authority with information about users' access to the URL in question. To be able to collect the necessary information about the access to individual URLs and pass it on to the authorities, internet access providers would have to monitor the surfing behaviour of all their customers preventively and comprehensively. However, such surveillance would be incompatible with the prohibition on general monitoring obligations and with the fundamental right to privacy. Additionally, this information is technically inaccessible to the internet access providers if the URL is encrypted using the https protocol. Almost all websites now use https to ensure that, for example, address or credit card data that users enter into web forms is transmitted in encrypted form. The widespread use of https is <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Verbraucherinnen-und-Verbraucher/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Cyber-Sicherheitsempfehlungen/cyber-sicherheitsempfehlungen_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>recommended by the Federal Office for Information Security</span></a>.</p>
<p>The targeted blocking of individual URLs is equally impossible for internet access providers <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2022/proposal-combat-child-sexual-abuse-online-presents-serious-risks-fundamental-rights_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>without abandoning https encryption</span></a> and monitoring the contents of their users’ online activities. DNS-based website blocking is not suitable for the planned blocking of individual URLs, because DNS blocking always affects entire domains. A DNS block directed against an individual file on a share hosting platform would also affect all other content hosted by the same share hoster and would thus not meet the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=149924&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=279088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>requirement of the European Court of Justice that website blocking must be strictly targeted</span></a>. In practice, therefore, there is a considerable danger that internet access providers will either over-comply with the blocking orders to the detriment of users’ freedom of expression and information by using DNS blocking to block access to an entire domain. Or they will attempt to implement more targeted blocking and monitor the surfing behaviour of their customers, while sacrificing the security of online communications via https encryption in the process.</p>
<h3 id="age-verification-endangers-freedom-of-communication">
  <span>Age verification endangers freedom of communication</span></h3>
<h3>
  <span> </span></h3>
<p>The draft regulation stipulates that all providers of messenger and email services that are at risk of being used for grooming must verify the age of their users. The risk identified does not have to be significant – the obligation to implement age verification would therefore apply in principle to all email and messaging services that enable communication between minors and adults. In addition, the age verification obligation also applies to all app store providers. They must also prevent underage users from downloading apps that pose a significant risk of being used for grooming.</p>
<p>Service providers may choose between age assessment methods (for example, AI-based facial analysis, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/new-ways-to-verify-age-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" role="presentation" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/assets/icons/icons.ce777a03f1.svg#icon-external-link"></use></svg><span>as already used by Instagram</span></a>) and age verification methods (using an identity document or digital proof of identity). Both procedures are extremely intrusive for users. Age verification via identity documents comes close to banning anonymous internet use. AI-supported facial analysis, on the other hand, is often outsourced by service providers to external companies, leaving users with little control over the handling of this particularly sensitive personal data. If the technology makes a wrong assessment, young-looking adults can also be excluded from using certain apps. Those who do not possess identification documents or do not want to entrust their biometric data to a company are excluded from crucial communication technologies. Using a modern smartphone without an app store is hardly possible. Doing without messenger services is also unreasonable, especially for people who, for good reason, attach particular importance to anonymous internet use (whistleblowers, victims of stalking, politically persecuted people). In contrast to service providers, users cannot always choose between different age verification procedures. </p>
<p>For underage users (especially teenagers), their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and information are severely restricted if app stores categorically refuse to allow them to install certain apps without weighing these rights against the risk the app poses to underage users. Due to the <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/themen/freiheit-im-digitalen/grundrechte-im-digitalen"><span>strong market concentration in this area</span></a>, the possibilities to switch to an alternative app store are limited. </p>

		<p><b>With its legislative proposal known as “Chat Control,” the EU Commission is trying to establish an unprecedented mass-surveillance apparatus of Orwellian proportions in the European Union. If EU citizens don’t stand up for privacy now, it may be too late.</b></p>

<p>This Wednesday, June 19, 2024, the EU Council <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/council-to-greenlight-chat-control-take-action-now/">could be</a> voting on the controversial Chat Control bill. Should it pass, the consequences would be devastating: Under the pretext of child protection, EU citizens would no longer be able to communicate in a safe and private manner on the Internet. The European market’s location advantage would suffer a massive hit due to a substantial decrease in data security. And EU professionals like lawyers, journalists, and physicians could no longer uphold their duty to confidentiality online. All while children wouldn’t be better protected in the least bit. On the contrary, Chat Control could have a negative impact on minors in particular.</p>

<div id="flap-content">
<p>The EU Commission’s proposed Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (commonly known as “Chat Control”) aims to combat the circulation of CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on digital platforms by requiring service providers to implement some sort of detection mechanism that automatically scans users’ (media) messages for both known and potential CSAM and reports detected cases to authorities.</p>
</div>

<p>It doesn’t matter how the EU Commission is trying to sell it – as “client-side scanning,” “upload moderation,” or “AI detection” –, Chat Control is still mass surveillance. And regardless of its technical implementation, mass surveillance is always an incredibly bad idea, for a whole plethora of reasons. Here are just three:</p>

<div id="info-1">
            <p>One distinguishing factor between totalitarian states and democracies is that only in the former can the government invade citizens’ privacy for no apparent reason. Modern democracies recognize privacy as a basic human right. The EU itself acknowledges it in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a> (article 7):</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><i>Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.</i></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Imagine, for example, the police could randomly enter your home without having any reason to believe you’re involved in illegal activities, simply to snoop around and see whether they can find something suspicious by sheer chance.
            </p>

            <p>In a healthy democracy, it should be the citizens who oversee the government – mass surveillance is the inversion of this democratic principle. With a measure like Chat Control, the EU would violate one of its own basic rights and put its citizens under general suspicion, thereby profoundly disrupting the trust between citizens and the government.
            </p>
        </div>

<div id="info-2">
            <p>Mass surveillance of standard communication channels like instant messengers only affects law-abiding citizens. Given their involvement in illegal activities, criminals will go to any length to avoid surveillance. After all, why would any criminal continue to use a communication channel that’s known to be under government surveillance?  
            </p>
            <p>However, flying under Chat Control’s radar wouldn’t even require resorting to some other, obscure means of communication that can’t be (or isn’t yet) surveilled. Criminals could, for example, simply manually encrypt illegal content before sharing it.
            </p>
            <p>Ordinary, unsuspecting Internet users, for whom it wouldn’t be practical to handle day-to-day communication with friends and family members in this manner, would therefore be the only ones really affected by mass surveillance. And besides <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/kinderpornografie-zahl-der-falschen-verdaechtigungen-bei-online-bildern-massiv-gestiegen-a-a746b118-82e7-4560-8ba4-45f02489768c">inevitable false positives</a> (think family photos of a beach vacation), minors (i.e., the ones who should be protected) engaging in consensual “sexting” would probably amount for the vast majority of CSAM reports.
            </p>
        </div>

<div id="info-3">
            <p>It’s not just citizens’ privacy that would suffer from the proposed mass surveillance. Because Chat Control essentially requires communication services to install a backdoor, it’s also citizens’ security that would take a massive hit.</p>
            <p>The reason secure communication services like Threema employ end-to-end encryption is to make sure no one except the intended recipient is able to read a message, not even the service provider. Introducing a backdoor into such a system is like adding a weak link to a strong chain lock. Sure, the government can now open the lock without a key, but so can any burglar.
            </p>
            <p>The negative impact a backdoor has on security can hardly be overstated. It’s not just the first place anyone would try to penetrate a system that’s otherwise secure, it’s like an API for hackers. And EU interior ministers seem to be well aware of this: why else would <a href="https://www.eureporter.co/business/data/mass-surveillance-data/2024/04/15/leak-eu-interior-ministers-want-to-exempt-themselves-from-chat-control-bulk-scanning-of-private-messages/">they themselves want to be exempt from Chat Control’s surveillance?</a>
            </p>
        </div>

<p>Of course, sharing CSAM is an absolutely intolerable, horrific crime that must be punished. Before CSAM can be shared online, however, a child must have suffered abuse in real life, which is what effective child protection should be trying to prevent (and what Chat Control does not focus on). For this and many other reasons, child protection organizations such as Germany’s Federal Child Protection Association are against Chat Control, <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/resource/blob/935798/3c6f75f6c2056130bca757bf7b4d0445/Stellungnahme-Tuerk-data.pdf">arguing that it’s “neither proportionate nor effective</a>.”</p>

<p>Besides, there’s no way of really knowing whether Chat Control would actually be (or remain) limited to CSAM. Once the mass-surveillance apparatus is installed, it could easily be extended to detect content other than CSAM without anyone noticing it. From a service provider’s point of view, the detection mechanism, which is created and maintained by third parties, essentially behaves like a black box.</p>

<h3>What can you do?</h3>

<p>Since the matter may be decided this Wednesday, June 19, 2024, time is a critical factor. If you’re a EU citizen, please consider <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/council-to-greenlight-chat-control-take-action-now/">contacting your government’s representative <i>today</i></a>, asking them to vote against Chat Control.</p>

<p>It may also help to take to the digital streets, spread the word online, and raise awareness for the EU’s dubious plan to establish an unprecedented mass-surveillance apparatus that would essentially nullify the right to data privacy and set a highly dangerous precedent in doing so.</p>

<div>
    <h4>What would Chat Control mean for Threema users in the EU?</h4>
    <p>While Threema would be subject to Chat Control, the business solution Threema Work would be out of scope according to our current knowledge. However it’s still not entirely clear how Chat Control would have to be implemented by service providers, and it’s questionable whether such a blatant violation of the right to privacy would hold up in European courts.
    </p>
    <p>What is crystal clear, however, is that there will never be a Threema version that’s spying on its users in any way, shape, or form. The reason Threema was created is to provide a highly secure, completely private, and anonymous means of communication. Once it’s no longer possible to offer such a service in the European Union, we will be forced to take consequences.
    </p>
    <p>We will carefully consider all options (including legal actions, technical workarounds, etc.) first, and if we come to the conclusion that there’s no other way, we’ll call on fellow communication services to join us in leaving the EU.

            <span>Abstract:</span>ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) is a new hardware feature introduced in ARMv8.5-A architecture, aiming to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities. The low overhead of MTE makes it an attractive solution to mitigate memory corruption attacks in modern software systems and is considered the most promising path forward for improving C/C++ software security. This paper explores the potential security risks posed by speculative execution attacks against MTE. Specifically, this paper identifies new TikTag gadgets capable of leaking the MTE tags from arbitrary memory addresses through speculative execution. With TikTag gadgets, attackers can bypass the probabilistic defense of MTE, increasing the attack success rate by close to 100%. We demonstrate that TikTag gadgets can be used to bypass MTE-based mitigations in real-world systems, Google Chrome and the Linux kernel. Experimental results show that TikTag gadgets can successfully leak an MTE tag with a success rate higher than 95% in less than 4 seconds. We further propose new defense mechanisms to mitigate the security risks posed by TikTag gadgets.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By Sam Lijin - <a href="https://twitter.com/sxlijin">@sxlijin</a></p><p><em>Update (Jun 18): check out the discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40713952">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1di2r2x/every_way_to_get_structured_output_from_llms/">/r/LocalLLaMA</a>! Thanks
for all the feedback and comments, folks- keep it coming!</em></p><p>This post will be interesting to you if:</p><ul>
<li>you're trying to get structured output from an LLM,</li>
<li>you've tried <code>response_format: "json"</code> and function calling and been disappointed by the results,</li>
<li>you're tired of stacking regex on regex on regex to extract JSON from an LLM,</li>
<li>you're trying to figure out what your options are.</li>
</ul><p>Everyone using LLMs in production runs into this problem sooner or later: what
we really want is a magical black box that returns JSON in exactly the format we
want. Unfortunately, LLMs return English, not JSON, and it turns out that
converting English to JSON is kinda hard.</p><p>Here's every framework we could find that solves this problem, and how they compare.</p><p>(Disclaimer: as a player in this space, we're a little biased!)</p><h2 id="comparison"><a id="comparison">Comparison</a></h2><p>Note: we've omitted LangChain from this list because we haven't heard of anyone
using it in production - look no further than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/top/?t=all">the top posts of all time on
/r/LangChain</a>.</p><p><sup>*</sup>: Honorable mention to Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/aici">AICI</a>, which is
working on creating a shim for cooperative constraints implemented in
Python/JS using a WASM runtime. Haven't included it in the list because it
seems more low-level than the others, and setup is very involved.</p><p><sup>1</sup>: Applying constraints to OpenAI models can be very error-prone,
because the OpenAI API does not expose sufficient information about the
underlying model operations for the framework to actually apply constraints
effectively. See <a href="https://lmql.ai/docs/models/openai.html#openai-api-limitations">this discussion about
limitations</a>
from the LMQL documentation.</p><p><sup>2</sup>: Transformers refers to "HuggingFace Transformers"</p><p><sup>3</sup>: Constrained streaming generation produces partial objects, but
no good ways of interacting with the partial objects, since they are not yet
parse-able. We only consider a framework to support streaming if it allows
interacting with the partial objects (e.g. if streaming back an object with
properties <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, you can access <code>obj.foo</code> before <code>bar</code> has been
streamed to the client).</p><h2 id="criteria"><a id="criteria">Criteria</a></h2><p>Most of our criteria are pretty self-explanatory, but there are two that we
want to call out:</p><h3 id="does-it-handleprevent-malformed-json-if-so-how">Does it handle/prevent malformed JSON? If so, how?</h3><p>LLMs make a lot of the same mistakes that humans do when producing JSON
(e.g. a } in the wrong place or a missing comma), so
it's important that the framework can help you handle these errors.</p><p>A lot of frameworks "solve" this by feeding the malformed JSON back into the LLM
and asking it to repair the JSON. This kinda works, but it's also slow and
expensive. If your LLM calls individually take multiple seconds already, you
don't really want to make that even slower!</p><p>There are two techniques that exist for handling or preventing this: actually
parse the malformed JSON (BAML takes this approach) or constrain the LLM's token
generation to guarantee that valid JSON is produced (this is what Outlines,
Guidance, and a few others do).</p><p><strong>Parsing the malformed JSON is our preferred approach</strong>: it most closely aligns
with what the LLM was designed to do (emit tokens), is fast (takes microseconds),
and flexible (allows working with any LLM). It does have limitations: it can't
magically make sense of completely nonsensical JSON, after all.</p><p>Applying constraints to LLM token generation, by contrast, can be robust, but
has its own issues: doing this efficiently requires applying runtime transforms
to the model itself, so this only works with self-hosted models (e.g. Llama,
Transformers) and does not work with models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's
Claude.</p><h3 id="can-you-see-the-actual-prompt-do-you-have-full-control-over-the-prompt">Can you see the actual prompt?

designed to return data matching your specific schema. To do that, you need to</p><ol>

<p><em>NOTE: This is based on, but completely rewritten, from a Twitter post: <a href="https://x.com/TheGingerBill/status/1802645945642799423">https://x.com/TheGingerBill/status/1802645945642799423</a></em></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> It makes Go <em>feel</em> too “functional” rather than being an unabashed imperative language.</p>
<p>I recently saw a post on <a href="https://x.com/ohmypy/status/1801180323406844062">Twitter</a> showing the upcoming Go iterator design for Go 1.23 (August 2024). From what I can gather, many people seem to dislike the design. I wanted to give my thoughts on it as a language designer.</p>
<p>The <em>merged PR</em> for the proposal can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61897">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61897</a></p>
<p>It has a in-depth explanation of the design explaining why certain approaches were chosen instead, so I do recommend reading it if you are familiar with Go.</p>
<p>Here is the example from the original Tweet I found:</p>
<pre><code>func Backward[E any](s []E) func(func(int, E) bool) {
	return func(yield func(int, E) bool) {
		for i := len(s)-1; i &gt;= 0; i-- {
			if !yield(i, s[i]) {
				// Where clean-up code goes
				return
			}
		}
	}
}

s := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
for _, el in range Backward(s) {
	fmt.Print(el, " ")
}
// c b a
</code></pre>
<p>This example is clear enough in <em>what</em> it does, but the entire design of it is a bit crazy to me for the general/majority use case.</p>
<p>From what I understand it appears that the code will be transformed into something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>Backward(s)(func(_ int, el string) bool {
	fmt.Print(el, " ")
	return true // `return false` would be the equivalent of an explicit `break`
})
</code></pre>
<p>This means that Go’s iterators are much closer to what some languages have with a “for each” method (e.g. <code>.forEach()</code> in JavaScript) and passing a callback to it. And fun fact, this approach is already possible in Go &lt;1.23 but it does not have the syntactic sugar to use it within a <code>for range</code> statement.</p>
<p>I will try to summarize the rationale Go 1.23 iterators, but it seems that they ware wanting to minimize a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the iterator look/act like a generator from other languages (thus the <code>yield</code>)</li>
<li>Minimize the need for sharing too many stack frames</li>
<li>Allow for clean-up with <code>defer</code></li>
<li>Reduce data being stored outside of the control flow</li>
</ul>
<p>As <a href="https://research.swtch.com/">Russ Cox (rsc)</a> explains in the original proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note regarding push vs pull iterator types: The vast majority of the time, push iterators are more convenient to implement and to use, because setup and teardown can be done around the yield calls rather than having to implement those as separate operations and then expose them to the caller. Direct use (including with a range loop) of the push iterator requires giving up storing any data in control flow, so individual clients may occasionally want a pull iterator instead. Any such code can trivially call Pull and defer stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russ Cox goes into more detail in his article <a href="https://research.swtch.com/pcdata">Storing Data in Control Flow</a> about why he likes this approach to design.</p>
<h3 id="more-complex-example">More Complex Example</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not worry about what this actually does, I just wanted to show an example of the clean-up needed with something like <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>An example from the original PR shows an example of a much more complex approach requiring clean-up where values which are <em>pulled</em> directly:</p>
<pre><code>// Pairs returns an iterator over successive pairs of values from seq.
func Pairs[V any](seq iter.Seq[V]) iter.Seq2[V, V] {
	return func(yield func(V, V) bool) bool {
		next, stop := iter.Pull(it)
		defer stop()
		v1, ok1 := next()
		v2, ok2 := next()
		for ok1 || ok2 {
			if !yield(v1, v2) {
				return false
			}
		}
		return true
	}
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="an-alternative-pseudo-proposal-state-machine">An Alternative Pseudo-Proposal (State Machine)</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am not suggesting Go does this whatsoever.</p>
<p>When designing <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>, I wanted the ability for the user to design their own kind of “iterators”, but have them be very simple; in fact, just normal procedures. I didn’t want to add a special construct to the language just for this—this would complicate the language too much which is what I wanted to minimize in Odin.</p>
<p>One possible pseudo-proposal I could give for Go iterators would look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>func Backward[E any](s []E) func() (int, E, bool) {
	i := len(s)-1
	return func(onBreak bool) (idx int, elem E, ok bool) {
		if onBreak || !(i &gt;= 0) {
			// Where clean-up code goes, if there is any
			return
		}
		idx, elem, ok = i, s[i], true
		i--
		return
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>This pseudo-proposal would operator like this:</p>
<pre><code>for it := Backward(s);; {
	_, el, ok := it(false)
	if !ok {
		break // it(true) does not need to be called because the `false` was called
	}

	fmt.Print(el, " ")
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is similar what I do in Odin <strong>BUT</strong> Odin does not support stack-frame-scope-capturing closures, only non-scope-capturing procedure literals. Because Go is garbage-collected, I see little need to no utilize them like this. The main difference is that Odin does not try to unify the ideas into one construct.</p>
<p>I know some people will this think this approach is a lot more complicated. It is doing the opposite of what Cox prefers with storing data in control flow, and store the data outside of it. But this is usually what I want from an iterator rather than what Go is going to do. And this is the problem: it removes the elegance of storing the data in the control flow–the push/pull distinction that Cox explains.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am very much an imperative programmer and I like to know how things actually execute, rather than trying to make it “elegant looking” code. So the approach I wrote above is fundamentally about thinking with regards to execution.</p>
<p>n.b. The typeclass/interface route would not work in Go because this would not be an orthogonal design concept and actually be more confusing than necessary—this is why I did not originally propose it. Different languages have different requirements as to what works in them.</p>
<h2 id="gos-apparent-philosophy">Go’s Apparent Philosophy</h2>
<p>The approach that Go 1.23 takes seems to go in the face of the <em>apparent</em> philosophy of making Go for the general (frankly mediocre) programmer at Google who doesn’t want to (nor can) use a “complex” language like C++.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="http://herpolhode.com/rob/">Rob Pike</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know many people are offended by this comment, but it’s <strong>brilliant</strong> language design by understanding who you are designing the language for. It is not insulting, but rather the a matter of fact statement as Go was originally for the people who work(ed) at Google, and similar industries. You might be a “better and more capable” programmer than the average Googler but that doesn’t matter. There is a reason people love Go: it’s simple, opinionated, and most people can pick it up very quickly.</p>
<p>However this iterator design does seem out of character to Go, especially for the someone like proposer Russ Cox (assuming he was <em>actual</em> the original proposer) on the Go team. It makes Go a lot more complicated, and even more “magical” too. I understand how the iterator system works because I am <em>literally</em> a language design and compiler implementer. It also has the possible issue to it won’t be a well performing approach either because of its need for closures and callbacks.</p>
<p>Maybe the argument for its design is that the <em>average Go programmer</em> is not meant to <strong>implement</strong> iterators but just <strong>use</strong> them. And that the majority of the iterators that people will need will be already available in Go’s standard library, or by the third-party package itself. So the onus is put on the package <em>writer</em>, not the package <em>user</em>.</p>
<p>This is why I think a lot of people seem to be “angry” over the design. It goes against everything Go was originally “meant to be” in the eyes of a lot of people, and it seems like a really complicated “mess”. I understand the “beauty” that it looks like a generator with the <code>yield</code> and inline code approach, but I do not think that is necessarily in the vein of what Go is to a lot of people. Go does hide a lot of how the magic works under the scenes, especially with garbage collection, <code>go</code>routines, <code>select</code> statement, and many other constructs. However, I think this is a little too magical in that it <em>exposes</em> the magic to the user a little too much, whilst looking overly complex to the average Go programmer.</p>
<p>The other aspect where people find this “confusing” is that it’s a <code>func</code> that returns <code>func</code> that takes a <code>func</code> as an argument. And that the body of the <code>for range</code> is transformed into a <code>func</code> and all <code>break</code>s (and other escaping control flow) are converted into a <code>return false</code>. It’s just three levels of procedures deep, which again feels like a functional language rather than an imperative language.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> that I am not suggesting they replace the iterator design with what I am suggesting, but rather a generalized iterator approach may have not been a good thing Go in the first place. For me at least, Go is an unapologetic imperative language with first-class CSP-like constructs. It’s not trying to be a functional-like language. Iterators are in that weird place where they do exist in imperative languages, but they are very “functionally” as a concept. Iterators can be very <em>elegant</em> in functional languages, but in some many unabashed imperative languages, they always feel “weird” somehow <strong>because</strong> they are being unified into a separate construct rather than separating out the parts of it (initialize+iterator+destroy).</p>
<h2 id="aside-odins-approach">Aside: Odin’s Approach</h2>
<p>As I alluded to previously, in Odin an iterator is just a procedure call where the last value of the multiple return is just a boolean indicating whether to continue or not. And because Odin does not support closures, the equivalent Go <code>Backward</code> iterator in Odin is a little more code to type.</p>
<p><strong><strong>NOTE:</strong> Before people say “that looks even more complex”, please continue reading the article. Most Odin iterators are not like this, and I would never recommend writing such an iterator where a trivial for-loop would be preferred for both the reader and the writer of the code.</strong></p>
<pre><code>// Explicit struct for the state
Backward_Iterator :: struct($E: typeid) {
	slice: []E,
	idx:   int,
}

// Explicit construction for the iterator
backward_make :: proc(s: []$E) -&gt; Backward_Iterator(E) {
	return {slice = s, idx = len(s)-1}
}

backward_iterate :: proc(it: ^Backward_Iterator($E)) -&gt; (elem: E, idx: int, ok: bool) {
	if it.idx &gt;= 0 {
		elem, idx, ok = it.slice[it.idx], it.idx, true
		it.idx -= 1
	}
	return
}


s := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
it := backward_make(s)
for el, _ in backward_iterate(&amp;it) { // `for el in` could have been written too
	fmt.print(el, " ")
}
// c b a
</code></pre>
<p>This does <em>appear to be</em> a lot more complicated that the Go approach because it requires you to write a lot more code. However, it’s actually a hell of a lot simpler to understand, comprehend, and even faster to execute. The iterator does not call the for-loop’s body, rather the body calls the iterator. I know Cox loves the ability of <a href="https://research.swtch.com/pcdata">Storing Data in Control Flow</a>, and I do agree it is nice but does not fit well within Odin, especially with the lack of closures (because Odin is a manual memory managed language).</p>
<p>An “iterator” is just syntactic sugar for the following:</p>
<pre><code>for {
	el, _, ok := backward_iterate(&amp;it)
	if !ok {
		break
	}
	fmt.print(el, " ")
}

// With `or_break`

for {
	el, _ := backward_iterate(&amp;it) or_break
	fmt.print(el, " ")
}
</code></pre>
<p>Odin’s approach is just removing the magic and making it extremely clear what is going on. “Construction” and “destruction” must be handled manually with explicit procedures. And that iteration is just a simple procedure which is called each loop. All three constructs are handled separately rather merged into one confusing one like in Go 1.23.</p>
<p>Odin does not hide the magic, whilst Go’s approach is actually very magical. Odin makes you handle the “closure-like” values manually along with the construction and destruction of the “iterator” itself.</p>
<p>Odin’s approach also trivially allows you to have as many multiple return values as wanted too! A good example of this is Odin’s <code>core:encoding/csv</code> package where the <code>Reader</code> can be treated like an iterator:</p>
<pre><code>// core:encoding/csv
iterator_next :: proc(r: ^Reader) -&gt; (record: []string, idx: int, err: Error, more: bool) {...}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>// User code
for record, idx, err in csv.iterator_next(&amp;reader) {
	...
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="aside-c-iterators">Aside: C++ Iterators</h2>
<p>I will try to not get into a huge rant about C++ “iterators” in this article. C++ iterators are much more than <em>mere iterators</em> whilst at least Go’s approach is still a <em>mere iterator</em>. I completely understand why C++ “iterators” do what they do, but 99.99% of the time I just want a <em>mere iterator</em>; not something that has all of the algebraic properties that allow it to be utilized in more “general” places.</p>
<p>For people who don’t know C++ very well, an iterator is a custom <code>struct</code>/<code>class</code> which requires it to have overloaded <code>operators</code> on it to make it act like a “pointer”. Historically, a C++ “iterator” would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
	auto &amp;&amp; __range = range-expression ;
	auto __begin = begin-expr ;
	auto __end = end-expr ;
	for ( ; __begin != __end; ++__begin) {
		range-declaration = *__begin;
		loop-statement
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>And would be wrapped in a “macro” before C++11 ranged-for loop syntax (and <code>auto</code>) became a thing.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is that C++ “iterators” require you to define 5 different operations at a minimum.</p>
<p>The following three operator overloads:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>operator==</code> or <code>operator!=</code></li>
<li><code>operator++</code></li>
<li><code>operator*</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Along with two stand-alone procedures or bound methods which return an iterator value:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>begin</code></li>
<li><code>end</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If I was to design C++ <em>mere iterators</em>, I would have just add a simple method to a <code>struct</code>/<code>class</code> called <code>iterator_next</code> or something. And that’s it. Yes it does mean the other algebraic properties are lost, but I honestly do not need these EVER for any problem I am working on. When I am working on those kinds of problems, they will always be either a contiguous array, or I will implement the algorithm manually because I want to guarantee the performance will be good for that data-structure. However, there is a reason I made my own language (Odin) because I completely disagree with the entire C++ philosophy, and I want to get away from that madness.</p>
<p>C++ “iterators” are a hell of a lot more complicated than Go’s iterators but they are much more “direct” with the local operation. At least with Go, you don’t need to construct a type with 5 different properties rather</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I feel like Go’s iterators do make sense with the design principles applied to them <strong>BUT</strong> <em>seem</em> antithetical to what most people view Go as being. I know Go “has had to” get more complex over the years, especially with the introduction of Generics (which I do think are actually well designed, with only a few syntax quibbles), but the introduction of iterators of this ilk <em>feels</em> wrong.</p>
<p>I think the short of it is that it feels like it goes against the apparent philosophy of Go that many people believe, coupled with it being a very functional way of doing things rather than imperative.</p>
<p>And because of those reasons, I think that is why people don’t like the iterator stuff, even if I completely understand the design choices made. It doesn’t “feel” like what Go original was to many people.</p>
<p>Maybe the concerns of mine (and others) are overblown and most people will never actually implement them and just use them, and that them being this complicated to implement.</p>
<p>Second to last controversial take: Maybe Go needed to “gate-keep” even more and just tell the “functional-bros” to go away and stop asking for such features which make Go a much more complicated and complex language.</p>
<p>Last controversial take: if it was me, I would just not have allowed custom iterators into Go whatsoever, but I am not on the Go team (nor do I want to be).</p>

Depending on their personal needs and preferences, the level of abstraction with which they model the world, and where they sit in the idealism-cynicism spectrum, any of the following can be legitimately said to be <em>the job</em> of  software engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing code.</li>
<li>Building and maintaining quality software.</li>
<li>Building and maintaining <em>good enough</em> software <em>cost-effectively</em>.</li>
<li>Managing complexity.</li>
<li>Delighting users.</li>
<li>Solving problems.</li>
<li>Satisfying customer needs.</li>
<li>Making money for their employing organization or their customers.</li>
<li>Making money (for themselves).</li>
</ul>
<p>There surely are more. Some of these goals can be abstracted, reduced to, or derived from others. Some are ultimately incompatible or contradictory, and can only coexist with others in tension. For example: we can assume (to some extent) that quality software will delight our users and make money for our employers. But we also need to sacrifice quality to stay within budget or introduce features that annoy users but generate profit.</p>
<p>
Each goal proceeds from a particular way of modeling the world and our activity. As with any abstraction, they serve their purpose in the right context and become <em>false</em> when applied outside of it; many problems in software development can be explained by such a skewed perspective, something I explored in a <a href="https://olano.dev/blog/code-is-run-more-than-read">previous post</a>. In the next discussion, let’s assume that <em>managing complexity</em> is the main duty of a software engineer.</p>
<p>∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p>
Complexity is anything that makes it hard to understand and modify a system. In <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/aposd.php"><em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em></a>, John Ousterhout explains why we should make it our main concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we want to make it easier to write software, so that we can build more powerful systems more cheaply, we must find ways to make software simpler. (…) Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is strategic programming. (…) If software developers should always be thinking about design issues, and reducing complexity is the most important element of software design, then software developers should always be thinking about complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>urtext</em> of the software complexity discussion is Fred Brooks’s <a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks_1986_-_No_Silver_Bullet.pdf"><em>No Silver Bullet</em></a>. Brooks distinguishes between essence and accident in software, posing that complexity is an essential difficulty of software systems —one of the things currently bounding our productivity. In <a href="https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf"><em>Out of the Tar Pit</em></a>, Moseley and Marks build on Brooks’s ideas, defining the better-known (and more tractable) types of complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Complexity</strong> is inherent in, and the essence of, the <em>problem</em> (as seen by the <em>users</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Accidental Complexity</strong> is all the rest —complexity with which the development team would not have to deal in the ideal world (e.g. complexity arising from performance issues and from suboptimal language and infrastructure).</li>
</ul>
<p>The user’s point of view is key to the distinction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is any possible way that the team could produce a system that the users will consider correct without having to be concerned with a given type of complexity then that complexity is not essential. (…) One implication of this definition is that if the user doesn’t even know what something is (e.g. a thread pool or a loop counter — to pick two arbitrary examples) then it cannot possibly be essential by our definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, any real-world implementation of the system will necessarily have to introduce <em>some</em> accidental complexity. The goal of the software engineer, then, is to <em>minimize</em> accidental complexity and <em>assist</em> with essential complexity.</p>
<p>∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p>
Subtle semantic differences aside, both authors of <em>No Silver Bullet</em> and <em>Out of the Tar Pit</em> agree in
that there’s an essence to a problem: something that engineers can’t change, that the system must conform to, and that contributes a type of complexity that cannot be escaped. From <em>No Silver Bullet</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the complexity [the software engineer] must master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which his interfaces must conform. (…) In many cases the software must conform because it has most recently come to the scene. In others it must conform because it is perceived as the most conformable. But in all cases, much complexity comes from conformation to other interfaces; this cannot be simplified out by any redesign of the software alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, I want to challenge the notion that essential complexity is irreducible. The fact that we can’t remove it by changing software alone doesn’t mean that there’s nothing we can do about it. What if we were to attack the essence? What if the problem definition wasn’t outside of our purview? What if we could get the world to conform to the software, and not just the other way around? Brooks already hinted at this possibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The buyer of a $2-million machine in 1960 felt that he could afford $250,000 more for a customized payroll program, one that slipped easily and nondisruptively into the computer-hostile social environment. Buyers of $50,000 office machines today [1986] cannot conceivably afford customized payroll programs; so they adapt their payroll procedures to the packages available. Computers are now so commonplace, if not yet so beloved, that the adaptations are accepted as a matter of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This doesn’t come as a surprise to us: we’ve been seeing for decades how human behavior (and user expectations) can be shaped by software: instant messaging, social media, content streaming —all drastically changed our everyday habits. If we admit that users can be made to adjust to the system —that software has the potential to change people and organizations—, then the problems that software solves for them can be redefined: the essence is not set in stone but open to discussion, part of what the engineer can work with.</p>
<p>
We can thus simplify the goal of the software engineer from minimizing <em>accidental</em> complexity and assisting with <em>essential</em> complexity, to minimizing complexity <em>of any kind</em>. In his follow-up essay <em>“No Silver Bullet” Refired</em>, Brooks quotes a reader that perfectly synthesizes this stance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience most of the complexities which are encountered in systems work are symptoms of organizational malfunctions. Trying to model this reality with equally complex programs is actually to conserve the mess instead of solving the problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Redefining the problem may seem like a cheating, but it’s just business as usual for senior engineers: <em>Why are we working on this? Do we really need it? What problem are we trying to solve? Who benefits from us solving it? What if, instead of X, we initially ship X1, which takes us 20% of the effort and provides 80% of the functionality?</em></p>
<p>
Strictly following Moseley and Marks’s definition, the fact that we can get the user (or the customer, or the product owner) to accept a change of requirements, implies that the removed complexity <em>wasn’t essential in the first place</em>. Instead, we made progress in uncovering the true essence of the problem. The point is that this progress required  engineers to question assumptions and dissuade stakeholders; without their involvement, the unnecessary features would have become part of the problem specification, “ossified” into its essence.</p>
<p>∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p>
In general, given a complex component of a software system (or an organization), it can happen that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complexity is accidental, so we can remove it.</li>
<li>The complexity is essential and we need to keep it.</li>
<li>The complexity is essential but we could remove it by redefining the problem specification.</li>
<li>The knowledge to tell whether something is essential or not is lost, the customer or the product owner can’t tell, or there isn’t such an authority to make the call.</li>
</ul>
<p>I frequently found the latter situation when working with legacy software, where the only specification is the system itself —bugs and unknowns included— and any observable feature, a <em>de facto</em> functional requirement, essential to the problem. The conservative approach to maintaining such systems is limited to internal refactors; a more disruptive reduce-complexity-at-all-costs attitude would assume that anything is up for removal until proven otherwise. In <a href="https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire"><em>Kill It with Fire</em></a>, Marianne Bellotti describes resilience engineering along those lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we encountered systems that had been forgotten and we couldn’t figure out what they were doing, we would usually just turn them off and see what happened. (…) When we turned off a system, we waited for someone to complain. That person was either the system owner or the owner of a downstream dependency, but either way, we ended the experiment with more information about what the system was doing than we started with. (…) If no one complained, we tended to just leave the system off and move on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even if systems can’t be removed, the new information improves organizational understanding, which reduces complexity.</p>
<p>∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p>
Taking this argument to its extreme: engineers could envision simpler implementations of the systems, then persuade the owning organizations to make their processes converge with those implementations —doing with the organization that uses a system what the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html">Inverse Conway Maneuver</a> tries to do with the organization that develops it. Left to their own devices, software engineers would act as the philosophical razor, removing the complexity of the world; automating employees —the engineers themselves included— out of a job; simplifying systems, along with the organizations that own them, out of existence.</p>
<p>
Of course, this <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> results from taking our initial premise beyond its reasonable limits. We started with the assumption that the software engineer’s sole purpose is to minimize complexity, ignoring, among other things, the economic interests that determine their work. This can serve as a reminder that, since our work indeed has the power to affect individuals and organizations, we shouldn’t wield it unconsciously, hiding behind the comfort of an abstraction. We occasionally need to leak out of our interface, into the unstructured mess that is the world.</p>

implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s). I show GPT-4o the problem as images and in various ascii representations.</p><p><span>My approach is similar in spirit to the approach applied in </span><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">AlphaCode</a><span> in which a model generates millions of completions attempting to solve a programming problem and then aggregates over them to determine what to submit.</span></p><p>Actually getting to 50% with this main idea took me about 6 days of work. This work includes constructing few-shot prompts, building better text representations of these grids, iterating against the train set, and implementing various other tweaks to improve performance.</p><p><span>I started on this project a few days before Dwarkesh Patel recorded the recent </span><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/francois-chollet" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">podcast</a><span> with Chollet. This was inspired by Dwarkesh talking to my coworker Buck about ARC-AGI, and then Buck being like “come on, surely you can do better than current SOTA using LLMs”. Then, I tested GPT-4o a bit and it seemed to get what was going on. I’ve recently been doing some research that involved getting Claude 3 Opus to do reasoning right at the edge of its capabilities, and thought I might have an edge based on my experience from that project.</span></p><p>At a high level, the method I use is:</p><ul><li><p>Provide the ARC-AGI problem to GPT-4o, with both an image representation and with various text representations for each grid in the problem. The text representations include showing which cells are occupied by different connected components of colors and showing diffs between the input and output (in cases where the grid shapes are the same).</p></li><li><p>Instruct GPT-4o to reason about what the transformation is, reason how to implement the transformation as code, and then finally actually implement the transformation in code.</p></li><li><p><span>Use a few-shot prompt with several carefully handwritten examples of step-by-step reasoning</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-6-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">6</a></span><span> to actually get GPT-4o to do this reasoning somewhat effectively. The resulting prompt is usually around 30k tokens long including images.</span></p><ul><li><p>We actually have a pair of few-shot prompts: one prompt for when the grid size changes (in any of the examples) and one for when it doesn’t.</p></li><li><p>We also ensemble over multiple pairs of few-shot prompts. This doesn’t help much, but I already had the samples in the cache.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Sample vast, vast numbers of completions (~5,000 per problem) from GPT-4o.</p></li><li><p>Take the most promising 12 completions for each problem, and then try to fix each by showing GPT-4o what this program actually outputs on the examples, and then asking GPT-4o to revise the code to make it correct. We sample ~3,000 completions that attempt to fix per problem in total across these 12 starting implementations.</p><ul><li><p>We use a few-shot prompt for revisions with step-by-step reasoning.</p></li><li><p>We also have a text representation which shows the diff between the actual output and the expected output.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><span>Then, we select 3 submissions</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-7-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">7</a></span><span> to make based on a majority vote over programs which get the examples correct. (In the case where we don’t have 3 distinct submissions from programs which get the examples right, we apply some heuristics to pick a submission, but this doesn’t matter much.).</span></p></li></ul><p><span>In addition to iterating on the training set, I also did a small amount of iteration on a 100 problem subset of the public test set. All the results I presented here were computed on a different subset of the public test set that does not overlap.&nbsp; The train and test set are not IID, and the test set is both much harder and somewhat qualitatively different (I think), so using a subset of the test set for iteration was useful for quickly getting a better sense of how things change with difficulty. It's unfortunate that these sets aren’t IID: it makes iteration harder and more confusing.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-8-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">8</a></span></p><p><span>More of the details of my approach and a bunch of tricks I use to improve performance, can be found at the bottom of this post.

(It does show a simple ascii grid like 8|0|3 where 8, 0, 3 are the colors of that row.)</p></li><li><p>V1 - 1024 samples/pb: 27%. This variant splits into two buckets and uses the spreadsheet style ascii representations (when in the equal image size bucket). It uses different few-shot prompt examples (though the examples overlap with V0).</p><ul><li><p>V1.1 - 1024 samples/pb: 28%: This is just a variant with somewhat arbitrarily different prompts for diversity and because I thought these prompts might be better. (They aren’t really better.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>V2 - 1024 samples/pb: 30%. This variant includes the ascii diff between the input and output and again includes different examples.</p></li><li><p>V2 - 2048 samples/pb: 34%</p></li><li><p>V0 (1024) + V1 (1024) + V1.1 (1024) + V2 (2048): 37%.</p><ul><li><p>This performance is the same as what I would expect from 4096 samples from V2, so the diversity doesn’t seem to help more than the downside of V0/V1/V1.1 being worse than V2.</p></li><li><p>To reach 37% with just V0, I would need around 43,000 samples! (Based on the fit I show below.) So, using better prompting and representations makes a big difference.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Final version (Revision step (3040 / pb with most problems selected) + V0 (1024) + V1 (1024) + V1.1 (1024) + V2 (2048)): 50%</p><ul><li><p>To reach 50% with just samples from V2, I would need 100,000 samples! So the revision is doing a huge amount of work.

This massively increases costs for approaches which focus more on doing multi rounds of revision and iteration on all or most implementations rather than just doing a large number of 1-step revisions on one implementation (or a small number of implementations).</span></p></li></ol><p>Removing these non-reasoning weaknesses would improve the performance of my solution by a significant amount.

Each one of them requires very little knowledge. Each one of them is very low on complexity. You don't need to think very hard about it. They're actually extremely obvious for human [sic]</p><p>Even children can do them but LLMs cannot. Even LLMs that have 100,000x more knowledge than you do still cannot. The only thing that makes ARC special is that it was designed with this intent to resist memorization. This is the only thing. This is the huge blocker for LLM performance.</p><p>If you look at LLMs closely, it's pretty obvious that they're not really synthesizing new programs on the fly to solve the task that they're faced with.</p></blockquote><p>Contra Chollet, I think that current LLMs are well described as doing at least some useful learning when doing in-context learning.</p><p>In particular, given my results you have to reject one of the following claims:</p><ol><li><p>Getting modest performance on ARC-AGI (e.g. 50%+ on test) requires at least a little runtime "learning" on each problem.</p></li><li><p>Program selection on only a moderate (e.g. 6,000) number of programs (like the way I do it) doesn't count as "learning" in the typical way people think of learning.</p></li><li><p>Current LLMs never "learn" at runtime (e.g. the in-context learning they can do isn't real learning).</p></li></ol><p>Claim 1 seems likely true to me for a reasonable notion of “learning”. I think François Chollet agrees here. Most of my doubts about this claim are concerns that you can basically brute force ARC-AGI without interestingly doing learning (e.g. brute-force search over some sort of DSL or training on a huge array of very similar problems). These concerns apply much less to the kind of approach I used.</p><p>Claim 2 seems true to me: the distribution of programs you are searching over has to be pretty close to the right program for Best-of-6k to work at all: if you did best-of-6k for random python programs, this would not work! Perhaps François Chollet disagrees here, but I think this view would be unreasonable.</p><p><span>Therefore, I think Claim 3 is false: </span><strong>I think LLMs actually do some relevant “learning” when doing in-context learning. </strong><span>Overall performance is very weak (otherwise I wouldn’t have needed to draw thousands of samples in my solution), but it’s some learning nevertheless. (Though there are various obstacles to GPT-4o performing well other than reasoning and learning ability such as vision and coding limitations.)</span></p><p>(One caveat is that this could be false if a substantial fraction of GPT-4o’s performance comes from dataset contamination. This seems very unlikely to me.)</p><p>It’s worth emphasizing that GPT-4o’s learning within a single context seems much less competent than typical human learning. But it is learning nonetheless. My view isn’t that GPT-4o is smart relative to humans in the typical way we mean smart, but I do think it has something which is well described as intelligence.</p><p>Progress has not stalled. I think ARC-AGI will be one benchmark among many that just gets solved by scale, and that as LLMs are scaled up, we should expect them to be able to solve tasks of increasing complexity when used with the appropriate tools, resources and prompting/scaffolding. (In this case, performance is due to scale and 6 days of iteration.)</p><p><span>I think it is plausible that scaling LLMs</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-12-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">12</a></span><span> by another 2-10 OOMs in effective training compute, and giving them tools, resources and scaffolding to solve real-world tasks can result in "AGI"</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13-145731248" href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt#footnote-13-145731248" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">13</a></span><span>, understood as AI capable of massively accelerating R&amp;D.

And every time you get evidence that indicates that scaling might be dangerously powerful (and I hope this post provided some), you should update appropriately in favor of more caution.</span></p><p><span>ARC-AGI probably isn't a good benchmark for evaluating progress towards TAI: substantial "elicitation" effort could massively improve performance on ARC-AGI in a way that might not transfer to more important and realistic tasks. I am more excited about benchmarks that directly test the ability of AIs to take the role of research scientists and engineers, for example those that </span><a href="https://metr.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">METR</a><span> is developing. (I think developing these evaluations and the science of conducting these evaluations is a highly leveraged way of reducing the risk that powerful AGI takes humanity by surprise; if you’re interested in contributing to them, you can see open roles at METR </span><a href="https://metr.org/hiring" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span>.

(There is an open leaderboard which has no such constraints.) I expect that SOTA LLMs will be pushing the frontier of progress in ARC-AGI based on these results and general views about what will happen with SOTA LLMs in the next few years. Higher limits on runtime compute seem important for advance warning: if an approach currently costs 10x human labor costs but can do a task, then it will probably cost way less in a few years (or less time) as further optimizations accrue. For instance, substantially optimizing the runtime compute used by my approach seems doable.</span></p><p>Overall, I appreciate the approach of ARC-AGI and I appreciate that Chollet and Knoop have made strong and relatively specific claims. (Some of which now seem to be contradicted!) Nonetheless, I think there are substantially better ways to benchmark progress toward transformative AI.</p><p>I use a bunch of tricks to improve performance:</p><ul><li><p>I split problems into two buckets: problems where the grid is the same size in the input and the output (in the examples) and problems where the size differs on any example input. I use a different prompt for these two cases. I use different examples and I also use a more extensive ascii representation in the case where the grids are the same size, as this representation is more useful in this case. I also use different prompts when having GPT-4o fix attempted implementations.</p></li><li><p>I use various ascii representations (in the case where grids are the same size) to make it easier for GPT-4o, which is very bad at this type of vision, to analyze the grid. Few-shot examples use these representations when reasoning. We show:</p><ul><li><p>The grid as a 2d array where each location has both the color and that location is spreadsheet/chess style notation (e.g. A7, B3, etc.)</p></li><li><p>The list of all locations (in spreadsheet style notation) at which a given color occurs. We split this up into connected components to make shapes easier to understand.</p></li><li><p>A normalized view of connect components (shapes) which shows the spreadsheet notation with shapes translated to have minimum row and column at 0. This makes it easier to compare shapes without getting confused by offsets.</p></li><li><p>A “diff” between the input and output represented as pairs of distinct colors and the locations at which the input has the first color and the output has the second color (e.g., black changes to green).[^diffonly] This is only used in a subset of examples (see below about ensembling over few-shot prompts).</p></li><li><p>When revising implementations, I also show an ascii diff between the expected and actual output for each of the examples. This is shown regardless of whether the input/output grid for the examples are the same size. (Though it can only be shown if the expected and actual output have the same shape.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I do a bit of local search to optimize prompts (on different subsets of the data from the subsets where I report performance!). Mostly, this looks like deciding which few-shot examples to include and which to put at the start/end of the prompt (which the model probably pays more attention to).</p></li><li><p>I use a few-shot prompt for the revision operation rather than just asking the model to revise. In the few shot prompt, I include some cases where revision is both reasonably doable and the model failed to successfully revise (on a prior version of the prompt on the train set).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>I use a somewhat non-trivial hamming distance approach for picking which implementations to revise though I don’t think details here matter much (based on my testing). I end up selecting 12 solutions which are ranked in closeness to the output and then using 3040 samples split over these solutions. I allocate the samples by reducing the samples by 25% for each successive item (the first item gets 384 samples, the second gets 288, the third 224 (I round to the closest 32), and so on).&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>I use the geometric mean of the hamming distance ranks to each of the outputs in the examples. (That is, I get the distances for each implementation, I rank them based on these distances, and then I take the geometric mean of these ranks across examples.) I also encourage slightly more diversity by penalizing for being too close to the solutions I’ve already selected. I only revise implementations that produce valid grids. I also skip implementations that produce a grid with a size that doesn’t match the expected output for problems where the size shouldn’t change (based on the examples).</p></li><li><p>I somewhat arbitrary upsample completions from better prompts, in particular the V2 prompt described above is upsampled. I just guessed at a constant offset to add for V2 to to remove for V0 based on some eyeballing of the typical geometric mean and what I thought might make sense. I didn’t optimize these values.</p></li><li><p>I only do revision on problems with fewer than 32 solutions that are correct on the examples with the idea being that we probably got the other solutions correct and thus don’t need to run this. I filter out solutions which are correct on the examples (as it's unclear what revision should do in this case).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I ensemble over several few-shot prompts. I think this somewhat improves performance over more samples with a fixed few-shot prompt (the diversity improvement is larger on the test distribution than the train distribution I think) and I already had a bunch of these samples from prior runs.</p></li><li><p>To pick what to submit, I do a majority vote and pick the top-3. First, I do a majority vote over the implementations which are correct on the training set. If this doesn’t produce three outputs (because there are less than 3 distinct outputs from implementations which are correct on the training set), I do a majority vote over implementations where I weight implementations based on how close they are to the expected output on the examples. In particular, I use the same geometric mean of hamming distance ranks metric discussed above where the weight for the majority vote is the reciprocal of this geometric mean.</p><ul><li><p>I don’t think the details of this matter much (and it isn’t optimized), I just thought something like this would be a good idea.</p></li><li><p>I also reject outputs which are equal to the test input. There are no cases in ARC-AGI where the test output is equal to the test input. This is more important than you might have thought because implementations which make no changes sometimes do well according to the hamming distance metric but are surely wrong. (If there are multiple test inputs, we reject if any are the same.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>I use the n option from the GPT-4 API to make more samples cheaper.</p></li></ul><p>Some tricks I don’t use that might improve performance:</p><ul><li><p>I currently spend the same number of samples on each problem. You could terminate early on problems which are consistently solved. I think this might reduce cost by perhaps 25-35%.</p></li><li><p>In the OpenAI API, I use n &lt; 128 (typically 32 or 16) because n=128 typically errors from what I’ve seen. Currently it seems like about half of my cost is input tokens, so going to n=128 would roughly halve the cost.</p></li><li><p>It would probably help to divide the problems into substantially more categories and then build specialized prompts and tools for each category. This somewhat defeats the point of ARC-AGI though and I’m not sure what these categories would be.</p></li><li><p>Doing a second or third revision round could help substantially. (Relative to spending these samples elsewhere.)</p></li><li><p>Further extending the debugging/revision process could help substantially.</p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning of GPT-4o to better understand the representations I use (and be able to see) would surely help a bunch (though it would be expensive).</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<p>             Stop Using Fandom
                2024-06-16

     fandom is a wiki website (allegedly)

if you are unfortunate enough to browse a fandom wiki
without an ad blocker, you will experience what i like
to call "attention assault"

upon opening a fandom page (for me, it was the hollow
knight wiki), you will note the very subtle aroma of a
1/3 page banner ad, placed ever so daintily at the top of
the page.

my ad was for furniture - ah yes, just what i wanted.
a multi-thousand-dollar furniture purchase to go with my
video game bug lore.

i have been using fandom for 1 second

and i already want to leave

...

as i scroll down, i'm assaulted by an auto-playing video
ad for dog food.

i do not have a dog.

in the top-left corner of the video sits a little "1/2",
indicating the presence of a second ad. another dog food
ad. actually, exactly the same dog food ad.

this "content" is in the middle of the hollow knight
fandom wiki. when i scroll down, the video shrinks into
the bottom-right corner of my screen and stalks me
around the website, begging for attention.

after the ads finish playing, a 60 minute video called
"honest trailers" starts. this must be the actual video
that i've been sitting through ads to witness.

"honest trailers" is not hollow knight related - it's two
guys vaping &amp; reviewing the new mario movie trailer.
they're arguing about whether chris pratt is a good FIT
to voice act MARIO

after about 5 seconds (no, i'm not kidding), another ad
break occurs.

it's the same dog food ad. AGAIN.

...

scrolling further down, i reach the end of the wiki page,
and there are two banner ads waiting, as if to bid me
farewell after my arduous journey through this shit-ass
website.

- one 1/3 page footer ad for Ubisoft+
- one 1/4 page sidebar ad for sunscreen

i don't need sunscreen. i need fandomscreen.

          some fandom history

from the very beginning, fandom was about profit:
  2004: jimmy founds wikicities
  2006: wikicities renamed to wikia
  2006: random venture capital firms invest $4M
  2006: amazon.com invests $10M
  2012: venture firms + amazon invest $11M
  2014: venture firms invest $15M
  2016: wikia renamed to fandom
  2018: enormous private equity firm acquires fandom

  grand total: $40M

and what, dear readers, do venture capitalists want when
they invest $40M into something?

returns. at all costs.

let the enshittification begin.

&gt; but wait, what does fandom actually _do_?

what valuable service does fandom provide to the world?

fandom generates enough money to retain a staff of 300+,
and rent several offices, including a very beautiful
building in downtown san francisco.

as far as i can tell, this is fandom's business model:
  1. users write wiki content on fandom
  2. fandom displays your content on a wiki page
  3. pelt fandom visitors with ads
  4. $$$$$$$$ YUM YUM YUM, MONEY!! $$$$$$$$$


many fandom communities noticed fandom degrading.

at first, it was the ads. huge, annoying, irrelevant ads
embedded directly in the content.

obtrusive ads obviously suck, but hey, adblockers are a
thing, so maybe ours users could j...

INTRODUCING:
  THE MCDONALD'S GRIMACE SHAKE PROMOTION CONTROVERSY!

in 2023, mcdonald's paid fandom an unknown[1] amount of
money to temporarily replace the mcdonald's wiki main
page + grimace article with advertisements promoting the
grimace shake.

the grimace shake.

i can't make this shit up.

fandom set the precedent that companies could pay them
and make user content go *poof*

          fandom shall burn

wikis aren't quite like other websites.

  - wiki software is largely open source
  - wiki content authors are often technical
  - users don't care where wikis are hosted

three simple ingredients. one predictable outcome.

              mass exodus.

the runescape[2] and minecraft[3] communities acted
first, migrating their treasured wikis to their own
domains.

many other wikis followed.
  hollow knight (yay bugz!)
  terraria
  animal crossing
  stardew valley
  EVE Online
  Factorio
  dota2
  ...
  AND MANY, MANY MORE[4]

over 300 wikis have migrated away from fandom, and i can
only hope that this trajectory accelerates. nothing makes
me happier than passionate communities showing everyone
that a better world is possible.


if you want to help,

  1. download Indie Wiki Buddy

     indie wiki buddy tells you when a fandom page has an
     alternative community-led wiki. it's a great plugin
     that will help you support and discover independent
     wikis.

  2. if you must use fandom, turn on your ad blocker
  3. if you own a wiki on fandom, move it off!

my offer: if you are a fandom wiki owner &amp; you would
          like to move your wiki content elsewhere, i
          will offer you my expertise at $0/hour. i know
	  lots about servers, software, and maintenance.
	  just email me - let's get you out of fandom's
	  ecosystem.

                  stay weird
                stay independent
              fuck venture capital
           long live the human internet

<p>The Belgian EU Council presidency seems set to have bulk Chat Control searches of our private communications greenlighted by EU governments on Wednesday 19 June. This confirms concerns that <strong>the proponents of Chat Control intend to exploit the period shortly after the European Elections during which there is less public attention and the new European Parliament is not yet constituted.</strong> If Chat Control is endorsed by Council now, experience shows there is a great risk it will be adopted at the end of the political process.</p>



<p>The good news is that <strong>many EU governments have not yet decided whether to go along with this final Belgian push for Chat Control </strong>mass surveillance, among them </p>



<ul>
<li>Italy, </li>



<li>Finland, </li>



<li>the Czech Republic, </li>



<li>Sweden, </li>



<li>Slovenia, </li>



<li>Estonia, </li>



<li>Greece and </li>



<li>Portugal.</li>
</ul>



<p>Only Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland are relatively clear that they will not support the proposal, but this is not sufficient for a “blocking minority”.</p>



<p><strong>So you need to take action now.</strong> More than ever, the resistance of civil society against Chat Control is crucial. There are many things you can do. The three most important steps are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Contact your government and tell it to vote against Chat Control on Wednesday, 19 June (find contact details below).</li>



<li>Ring the alarm bells online. You can use <a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/cwyRic7cC5zcfHk">campaign sharepics and explanatory videos in all languages</a>. Don’t let the Council presidency get away with pushing this through silently now.</li>



<li>Meet at least one person offline and plan to take action together. For example involve non-governmental organisations, academics, companies or the media in your country, organise open letters or opinion articles in the media or even protests (some protests are currently being organised for Tuesday, 18 June).</li>
</ol>



<h3>Contact your government</h3>



<p>It is crucial we demonstrate that civil society is alert now. You can either contact your ministeries of the interior and of justice, or you can contact your government’s ‘permanent representatation’ to the EU. You can find the contact details for all permanent representations on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/COREPER/">website „EU Whoiswho“</a>.</p>



<p>Tell your government that the <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2024/05/2024-05-28_Council_Presidency_LEWP_CSAR_Compromise-texts_9093.pdf">current draft</a> on Chat Control (officially called “Regulation … to prevent and combat child sexual abuse”) is unacceptable. You can find a summary of the draft in this <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/majority-for-chat-control-possible-users-who-refuse-scanning-to-be-prevented-from-sharing-photos-and-links/">blogpost</a>, and there is critical analysis by <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/be-scanned-or-get-banned/">European Digital Rights</a> and <a href="https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/May-2024-CDT-Europe-Feedback-on-the-Belgian-Presidencys-compromise-on-the-Regulation-on-Child-Sexual-Abuse-Material.pdf">CDT</a>. Be polite but also resolute and ask them to clearly voice their disagreement with the proposal and to vote against the proposal.</p>



<p>Further, ask them to insist on a formal vote and for the abstentions to be properly counted by the Presidency. (Otherwise, in the Permanent Representatives Committee, sometimes the procedural trick is used not to ask for abstentions and to ignore them).</p>



<h3>Timeline</h3>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/CM-3141-2024-INIT/en/pdf">13 June</a>, ministers of the interior discussed the progress of discussions (<a href="https://video.consilium.europa.eu/event/en/27508">find a recording here</a>). The Belgian Council presidency <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-10666-2024-INIT/en/pdf">announced</a> that they will present a new compromise proposal afterwards. According to documents <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/anlasslose-massenueberwachung-frankreich-wackelt-in-der-ablehnung-der-chatkontrolle/#dokument">leaked by netzpolitik.org</a>, the COREPER 2 meeting in which they will put it to a vote will already take place on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/mpo/2024/6/coreper-2-permanent-representatives-committee-(337001)/">19 June</a>.</p>



<p><strong>So we all need to take action as soon as possible</strong> and demand a firm “No” by our governments against the Chat Control proposal to ward off this attempt to greenlight Chat Control in the Permanent Representatives Committee on 19 June. <strong>Time is pressing. This may be our last chance to stop Chat Control!</strong></p>

  <p>Today I’m telling a story about Ms. Pac-Man, and while it mentions her unorthodox debut to the world of video games and her apparent disappearance in 2022, this is more about what made her unique as a female video game protagonist. In fact, she was (is?) so different that Namco may have been trying to invent a replacement for her almost from the beginning. </p><p>And yes, this piece takes a decisive anti-Pac-Mom stance.</p><h3>‘The Most Popular Girl in the Game World’</h3><p>As she appears in the classic arcade marquee art, Ms. Pac-Man is a lot sexier than a sentient yellow mouth should be. This isn’t incorrect, per se, as her in-game sprite offers her a few extra splashes of color that tell us that we’re controlling not just a female version of Pac-Man but a bit of a glamorpuss. In pixel form, she’s rocking a bow, some eye make-up, four red pixels to represent lips and a single black one to represent a beauty mark — and all of this adds up to considerably more detail that we saw on the plain-faced regular ol’ Pac-Man, who’s not even given eyes in his arcade debut. But the marquee art takes those abstract suggestions of femininity and cranks them up to eleven.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>For this depiction of her, Ms. Pac-Man was given long legs that drape over the edge of the “M” in the title. She’s even wearing heels, as unsuitable as those might seem for an evening of chasing down ghosts. She’s got rouged cheeks and pouty lips. She’s got a tuft of hair to justify the presence of a bow (bows being one of the most popular ways to demonstrate femininity in old video games), and she’s got blue eyeshadow to accentuate the focus of this piece of art, in the dead center of the marquee, which can only be described as Ms. Pac-Man’s come-hither stare.</p><p>“Hey, big boy,” she seems to say. “Is that roll of quarters in your pocket for me?” As if to draw the whole scene together, we’ve also got Blinky checking her out — leering, even. You have to wonder if he knows that Ms. Pac-Man plans to eat him shortly. Maybe that’s what he wants.</p><p>I’m not saying Ms. Pac-Man’s sexiness is good or bad. The game proved to be popular, of course, but I couldn’t tell you how many people ended up plunking a quarter in because they were impressed by this character being so hot to trot. A person could reasonably assume that this Ms. Pac-Man art was created with a male audience in mind, but that actually wasn’t the intention of the people who made this female-centric follow-up. Speaking to the magazine <a href="https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_03_1982-05_Reese_Communications_US/page/n31/mode/2up">Electronic Games in May 1982</a>, Midway spokesman Stan Jarocki explained that the sequel featured cutscenes of Ms. Pac-Man meeting, marrying and having a Pac-Baby with the original title’s hero — all in an effort to appeal to the “lady arcaders,” as he puts it. “Pac-Man was the first commercial video game to involve large numbers of women as players,” he said. “It expanded our customer base and made Pac-Man a hit. Now we’re producing this new game as our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who played and enjoyed Pac-Man.”</p><p>Jarocki’s statement is supported by promotional material from back in the day. For example, <a href="https://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/P/Pacman-MsPacman-Troubleshooting-Guide-Part1.pdf">Midway’s official literature</a> for the game forefronted the fact that this time around, the protagonist was female, saying Ms. Pac-Man “is sure to be the most popular girl in the game world.” But the same text also promises that this sequel would be tougher than the original, so there’s an implicit statement in here that the female gamers lining up to play Ms. Pac-Man would be up to the task — at least as capable as the male players. That’s messaging that video game companies sometimes still bungle today, honestly.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://thehistorybandits.com/2015/11/25/lady-arcaders-and-ms-pac-mans-significance-in-womens-video-gaming/">The History Bandits</a> points out, flyers advertising the Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinet explicitly show female players at the controls, which is notable because at the time, western video arcades were perceived as being dominated by male players.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now, there have already been detailed recountings of the strange process through which the world got Ms. Pac-Man — the game and I guess by extension the character as well. I’ll point you to accounts by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/11/03/inside-the-development-of-ms-pac_2d00_man.aspx">Game Informer</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3067296/the-mit-dropouts-who-created-ms-pac-man-a-35th-anniversary-oral-history">Fast Company</a> in case you want to learn more, but the gist of the story is that while Pac-Man was created in Japan, by programmers at Namco, the sequel was born in the U.S., devised by the Massachusetts-based General Computer Corporation. Initially, it was Crazy Otto, a purposefully off-brand homebrew remake of Pac-Man featuring new maze layouts, different enemy behaviors and a host of other changes. As was common for Japanese game developers back in the day, Namco had contracted with Midway, a U.S.-based video game publisher, to distribute Pac-Man in North America, and it was actually Midway that bought Crazy Otto from General Computer Corporation. </p><p>The most significant change was swapping out Otto for a new playable hero who scanned readily as part of the Pac-family. The game that came to be known as Ms. Pac-Man debuted in February 1982. According to some metrics it is the best-selling stand-alone arcade game of all time, beating out even the original Pac-Man.</p><p>Just having a female face on a financially successful video game should be win enough, but there’s also a political bent to this character that makes the whole story a lot bigger.</p>

  <h3>Striking a Blow for Women’s Rights</h3><p>For the purposes of this essay, I’m more interested in the title this game was given. According to the Fast Company interview, the most obvious candidate, Pac-Woman, was only briefly a contender — dropped, according to company co-founder Doug Macrae, because it “did not roll off the tongue very well.” Pac-Girl isn’t even mentioned, despite the fact that it follows the pop culture precedent set by Superman’s female counterpart being Supergirl and Batman’s being Batgirl.&nbsp;</p><p>The next candidate was Miss Pac-Man, but that was nixed because one of the game’s interstitial scenes shows the female hero having a baby, and the decision-makers didn’t want the hero of a family video game doing that out of wedlock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms. Pac-Man is such a direct remake of Crazy Otto that the the interstitial scenes showing the Pac-spouses meeting play out identically to the ones of Otto meeting Ms. Otto.</p>

  <p>The Fast Company piece posits that it was the wife of Mike Horowitz, one of the programmers, who suggested that Ms. Pac-Man was a better name than Mrs. Pac-Man. Eileen Mullarkey declined to take Horowitz’s name when she married him and went instead by Ms. Mullarkey. “My wife just thought, you know, she’s an independent woman,” Horowitz explains. “In the progression of the animations, the implicit thing is they do get married, because they have a child. But she’s still a Ms.”</p><p>Ms. Mullarkey wasn’t the only one to view it this way. There’s a Simpsons joke about the political implications of using Ms. over Mrs. in the season four episode “Lisa’s First Word,” which flashes back to when Lisa was a baby. Marge narrates, “Well, this story begins in that unforgettable spring of I983. Ms. Pac-Man struck a blow for women's rights, and a young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh.” It’s a decent joke, but Marge isn’t exactly wrong to consider the feminist implications here. The honorific <em>Ms.</em> was invented specifically to give women an option that wouldn’t be decided by their marital status. While the first use of it <a href="https://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/hunting-the-elusive-first-ms/">dates back in 1901</a>, <em>Ms.</em> was adopted by feminists in the 1960s, and Gloria Steinam used it as the title of her women’s magazine, which debuted in 1971. When the Marvel comics character Carol Danvers got superpowers, also in 1971, she got the name Ms. Marvel to telegraph that her new solo series would have feminist themes.&nbsp;</p><p>In my head, this feminist aspect to Ms. Pac-Man lets me view her arcade art a little differently. Sure, she might look like she was designed for the male gaze, but the fact that she is a Ms. rather than a Mrs. or a Miss lets me imagine that there’s more to her than a sexed-up image — or, to buy into the fiction of the Pac-universe for a second, rather than painting that face for Pac-Man or any man, for that matter, she’s just doing it for herself. She’s getting dressed up for a day on the job, and the job just happens to be gobbling dots and chasing ghosts.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is, after Ms. Pac-Man, Namco standardized her design, and a result of this was no further appearances looking quite as coquettish as she did in the cabinet art.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pac-Mom first appears in <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Pac-Man_Museum_%2B">Pac-Man Museum+</a>, a collection of older Pac-Man games released for various consoles in 2022. Notably missing among the titles included is Ms. Pac-Man, and in fact the ports of Pac-Land, Pac-in-Time and Pac-Attack that once featured the character Ms. Pac-Man now feature Pac-Mom in her place. It’s as if Ms. Pac-Man never existed, and the effort to disappear her from history <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-pac-man-is-being-replaced-and-its-likely-due-to-a-legal-dispute/1100-6502364/">didn’t go unnoticed</a>.</p>

  <p>The switch would seem to result from the longstanding legal tangle that resulted from Ms. Pac-Man’s unusual creation. Again, outlets <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/26/20886032/ms-pac-man-lawsuit-bandai-namco-atgames-rights-royalties">such as Polygon</a> have already told this story in detail, but the gist of it is that some royalties associated with Ms. Pac-Man were never fully resolved to Namco’s liking. That didn’t prevent the company from using the character in subsequent games until 2020, when a lawsuit was settled out of court between Namco and AtGames, an American retrogaming company that bought the Ms. Pac-Man royalty rights from General Computer Corporation. (The Pac-Man Wiki has an entire page devoted <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/History_of_Ms._Pac-Man_legal_issues">to legal issues relating to Ms. Pac-Man</a>, in case you want to read more. She’s a complicated lady!) Namco has not explicitly said that it has dropped Ms. Pac-Man following that settlement, but this is what those of us watching have concluded. Why else would Namco invent this Pac-Mom abomination all of a sudden?</p><p>Some Pac-Man fans <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VAnEvWELWg">are</a> <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pac-man-world-re-pac-ms-pac-man-replacement/">confused</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/tyirdf/ms_pac_man_has_been_replaced_by_pacmom_for_the/">by</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pac-man-ms-bandai-namco-change-edit-preservation-arcade-1848766506">this</a>, and I’d bet a fair number of them are simply annoyed with Namco playing fast and loose with video game history. After all, this would be like if Nintendo re-released a Super Mario game and swapped out Princess Peach for a Princess Pineapple or Princess Pumpkin and just acted like it wasn’t weird. From my perspective, dropping Ms. Pac-Man is additionally discourteous just because the character and the game marked a crucial milestone in the industry pivoting to acknowledge to female gamers.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, I really like how at least early on, the character had this feminist bent to her while also being sexy, just because so often that was not the stereotype we got in the 1980s and 1990s for any women supporting gender equality. That’s maybe a lot to hang on a sexy piece of cabinet art and political implications of using Ms. over Mrs. or Miss, I’ll admit, but to pivot from the character depicted at the beginning of this essay to something called Pac-<em>Mom</em> makes me think Namco misunderstood the situation. To reiterate, Ms. as a courtesy title allowed women to define themselves on their own terms, not in relation to whether they’re married. Calling this new character Pac-Mom literally defines her in relation to other characters — her kids.</p><p>To make matters worse, she’s not given even a glimmer of Ms. Pac-Man’s sexy style. Okay, she has heels, but to invoke another Simpsons joke, she looks like a Pac-Man equivalent of the Malibu Stacy doll that was given a new pink hat to foil Lisa’s attempt at introducing a doll with a more feminist bent. There’s just not much to like about Pac-Mom, especially in comparison to who she’s replacing.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pac of the Clones</h3><p>Here’s the thing, though: While Pac-Mom got headlines in gaming press when she appeared in Pac-Man Museum+, she’s only the latest offering by Namco as some kind of Ms. Pac-Man replacement. There does exist a longstanding rumor that the Japanese gaming company was never completely happy with her debut video game, either because of the aforementioned royalty payments or because she originated outside the company. Hell, maybe Namco wanted someone a little more demure than the sexpot in the cabinet art. I don’t know if any of that is true, but it does raise the question of why Namco kept testing out new characters that were essentially less interesting versions of Ms. Pac-Man. I can’t think of another major video game franchise that did this, in fact. For comparison’s sake, the Sonic franchise has introduced scads of new female characters over the years but has never created someone who seemed to be a replacement for Sonic’s chief female counterpart, Amy Rose.</p><p>As early as 1983, just a year after Ms. Pac-Man was released, Namco was trying to pair Pac-Man with a female counterpart of their own making. In Pac &amp; Pal, the titular pal is <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Miru">Miru</a>, who is a ghost but a friendly one. She is controlled by the computer and helps Pac-Man collect fruit. However, every fruit Miru collects lowers the maximum amount of points that the player can rack up, so in addition to navigating the maze and avoiding the ghost, there’s an added challenge in collecting all the fruit before Miru can.</p>

<p>Miru does not especially look like the enemy ghosts. In fact, she looks a lot like a green version of Pac-Man, minus the mouth, but the fact that she’s sporting a bow and eyelashes also means that she looks a lot like Ms. Pac-Man, who does not appear in the game. Early sketches of Miru — whose name early on was Midori-chan, because she’s green — show that the designers toyed with different versions where she sometimes resembled Ms. Pac-Man even more.</p>

Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoONttAY4Lk">the game’s story mode</a>, I’m not clear whether she’s supposed to be a new character, Ms. Pac-Man renamed or Ms. Pac-Man before she marries Pac-Man. But the game was developed and published by Namco, so the change was presumably intentional. What’s even stranger about the game is that it also introduces parents for Pac-Girl: <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Pac-Master">Pac-Master</a> and <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Ms._Pac-Master">Ms. Pac-Master</a>. The latter looks strikingly like Pac-Mom.</p>

  <p>I… don’t know what to say about her otherwise, except that the title was neither developed nor published by Namco, and perhaps that could explain how this character was allowed to exist, even if Namco presumably retained the right to veto and creative decisions that were too off-brand.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2022, a series of pop-up stores sold Pac-Man merchandise that featured not Ms. Pac-Man but yet another new female character: <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man#Pac-Marie">Pac-Marie</a>.

  <p>Pac-Marie never appeared in a video game, and because she essentially only exists to sell merch, I suppose it would make sense that she could have allowed Namco to skip on royalty payments associated with Ms. Pac-Man… provided that the people buying didn’t mind having a knock-off Pac-character on the stuff they bought. The items also feature a new junior version of Pac-Man — and I’ve got more on the Pac-kids in the miscellaneous notes section — which could be explained by the fact that the more familiar Pac-offspring also originated in the Midway-produced sequels, but then again the stores also featured a new line-up of ghosts, even if the standard ghost gang is owned outright by Namco: <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Harry">Harry</a> (a lime-green ghost who wears a beret), <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Terry">Terry</a> (a turquoise ghost who wears a ball cap), <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Kelly">Kelly</a> (a pink ghost sporting a ponytail like Pac-Marie’s), and <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Rocky_(Pac-Store)">Rocky</a> (a spiky-headed purple ghost).</p><p>Clearly Namco has been trying to create a replacement for Ms. Pac-Man for a while, and I guess they thought Pac-Mom is the best candidate they’ve made so far, hence her history-erasing presence in Pac-Man Museum+. And that’s too bad, because Ms. Pac-Man was once the no. 2 ambassador for the Pac-Man series at large. Don’t forget, for example, that she was playable in the Namco-developed, arcade-only Mario Kart GP games.</p>

  <p>But while Ms. Pac-Man technically appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a background cameo in the Pac-Land stage, it did strike me as odd that she wasn’t included as a playable alternate costume for Pac-Man, in the way Olimar and Alph from Pikmin occupy the same slot in the roster. I mean, shouldn’t a title so interested in the history of video games acknowledge one of the first breakout female protagonists in a popular video game?</p><p>As it stands now, Ms. Pac-Man’s last playable appearance was in 2018, during a limited-time Pac-Man event in the 2013 mobile title Sonic Dash.</p>

  <p>That’s a fairly ignominious end for her career, and I can only hope that Namco can find a way to use Ms. Pac-Man again. At the very least, if they’re lending out Pac-Man characters out as DLC for other company’s titles, more people would be willing to pay money to play as her before they do so to play as Pac-Mom, new hat notwithstanding.</p><h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3><p>Believe it or not, I only ended up writing this post as a result of Drawn Together — yes, the early-2000s Comedy Central series. A few weeks back, we covered it on my podcast, <a href="https://www.gayestepisodeever.com/episodes/drawn-together-xandir-comes-out">Gayest Episode Ever</a>, which looks at LGBTQ-themed episodes of old sitcoms. Despite its deserved reputation as a shock humor show, Drawn Together actually did a decent job with the coming out episode for its gay character, Xandir, who is a parody of Link from Legend of Zelda and Cloud from Final Fantasy VII. The episode also features a joke where it’s revealed that Ms. Pac-Man is actually just Pac-Man cross-dressing.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1718503756071_424963">
  <p>In recording the episode, Pac-Mom came up and I was reminded that she is a sorry substitute for a video game legend. However, the Pac-Man in drag joke is more interesting than you might initially think, because Ms. Pac-Man is, in a sense, the original game’s protagonist, Crazy Otto, with a female persona slapped onto him. But I feel like the point Drawn Together is making is more than the difference between the male and female Pac-heroes is a few simple cosmetic alterations. (If you like pop culture deep dives like I do on this site, you can subscribe to Gayest Episode Ever<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gayest-episode-ever/id1357463744"> on Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7z85L3qZh0DXAXRZQWoCPB">on Spotify</a>.)</p><p>In looking up the history of Ms. Pac-Man, I was reminded that some of the earliest designs for her give her what can only be called shoulder-length hair despite the character’s total lack of shoulders. It’s not a great look, honestly. Masaya Nakamura, president of Namco, nixed the idea of the heroine having hair: “Love the concept. Get rid of the hair,” Macrae recalls Nakamura saying in the Fast Company piece. For this we should be thankful.</p>

  <p>It’s curious, though, that the model used in the Hanna-Barbera Pac-Man cartoon got hair that looks fairly close to what the designs originally envisioned for her.</p><p>If you’ve ever played a version of Pac-Man where you’re racing around the maze, eating dots and avoiding ghosts, but your character onscreen has legs, there’s a good chance you’re playing Crazy Otto, the game that was Ms. Pac-Man before Ms. Pac-Man existed. It’s actually interesting to see when the Pac-Man characters are given legs and when they’re not, but there’s also a bit of an urban legend surrounding this particular “Pac-Man with legs,” because a screenshot of it was featured in <a href="https://time.com/archive/6882586/living-beating-the-game-game/">a 1982 Time magazine feature on gaming</a>, mislabeled as regular Pac-Man.</p>

  <p>The mistake didn’t go unnoticed, and as Gaming Alexandria editor Ethan Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/GameResearch_E/status/1432772255344381954">noted in 2021</a>, someone wrote in to Electronic Games asking what was going on. In fact, Johnson dissects the entirety of the July 1982 issue <a href="https://twitter.com/GameResearch_E/status/1432769393315000320">here</a>.</p><p>Speaking <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/05/pac-man-30-years/">to Wired magazine back</a> in 2010 to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of Pac-Man, created Toru Iwatani said that even that first game was made with the aim of courting female gamers.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Around the time that we launched Pac-Man, video arcades were filled with games where you shoot aliens. It seemed very dark. It was for men, it wasn't fashionable at all. When women would go out, they'd go out in a group of friends or with a boyfriend as a couple. And I realized that if women and couples were going to come to game centers, they had to be cheerful places.</em></p><p><em>When you think about things women like, you think about fashion or fortune telling or food or dating boyfriends. So I decided to theme the game around “eating” — after eating dinner, women like to have dessert.</em></p></blockquote><p>So there you go, women of the world: You got an eating game because you can’t stop ordering dessert. Enjoy.</p><p>Technically, Ms. Pac-Man was not the first video game to try out “Pac-Man but with a female hero.” In October 1981, about five months before Ms. Pac-Man, Universal released Lady Bug, a very Pac-Man-esque title that has you controlling a ladybug through a garden maze, avoiding other insects. While ladybugs can be male (and while the Japanese word for ladybug, <em>tentomushi</em> (天道虫), doesn’t carry connotations of gender the way the the English word does), the Japanese title for the game is explicitly <em>Redī Bagu</em> (レディーバグ) and the cabinet art distinctly feminine.</p>

  <p>Along with the erasure of Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Man Museum+ also saw the erasure of Pac-Man’s two children. Traditionally, the most famous of the Pac-children is <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Jr._Pac-Man#Pac-Little">Jr. Pac-Man</a>, who technically debuted as a baby in the interstitial scenes in Ms. Pac-Man only to age up for <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Jr._Pac-Man_(game)">his own 1983 game</a>, produced by Bally Midway. But there’s also <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Pac-Man" target="_blank">Baby Pac-Man</a>, who debuted in a 1982 pinball game — Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man, produced and developed by Bally Midway — before getting <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._%26_Mrs._Pac-Man">their own game</a>, a maze/pinball hybrid released in 1982. (Baby Pac-Man is gendered inconsistently from one game to the next, but has more recently been depicted as female.) In the revised Pac-canon, however, Pac-Mom is the mother of similar but apparently legally distinct characters: <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Jr._Pac-Man#Pac-Boy">Pac-Boy</a> and <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Baby_Pac-Man#%22Replacement%22_characters">Pac-Sis</a>. Additionally, in the line of merch that features Pac-Marie as a replacement for Ms. Pac-Man, there is also a new baby character: Pac-Little.</p><p>Speaking of characters with inconsistent genders from one installment to the next, the ghost <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Sue">Pinky</a> has apparently always been female in Japan, but curiously western adaptations of Pac-Man lore either didn’t know this or changed it outright. The Hanna-Barbera cartoon, for example, made Pinky male, and that’s surprising when you look at old video games and their insistence that pink characters are female and female characters are pink. Ms. Pac-Man introduced a new ghost, <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Sue">Sue</a>, as the title character’s archrival, and she’s pretty much always been female, although she’s inconsistently colored: orange in some versions, purple in others, and blue in the cartoon series.&nbsp;Sue’s last appearance was 2015’s Pac-Man’s 256, but I’d willing to bet that whatever agreement sidelined Ms. Pac-Man would have sidelined Sue as well.</p><p>Finally, if you want an explanation why Scott Pilgrim is wrong and Pac-Man was not, in fact, named after his resemblance to a hockey puck, read my other Pac-Man piece <a href="https://www.thrillingtalesofoldvideogames.com/blog/pac-man-hockey-pucks-paku-paku">here</a>.</p>

    <p>In April 2024, I found and reported two critical bugs to <a href="https://www.sei.io/">Sei Network</a> concerning their layer-1 blockchain. One of these issues impacted the chain’s availability, and the other its integrity. The Sei Foundation awarded me $75,000 and $2,000,000 respectively for these reports.</p>

<p>Both issues were caught after the code had been audited, merged, and slated for release but <strong>before</strong> it was shipped to production. As a result, no funds were put at risk. If it had made it to mainnet, the funds at risk from issue 2 would have been the entire Sei token market cap, or about $1B USD mark to market.</p>

<h2 id="issue-1">Issue 1</h2>

<p>If exploited, the first issue would have caused the chain to halt.</p>

<p>The Sei Network is a “Cosmos chain”, meaning it leverages the Cosmos SDK for its blockchain application and uses a tendermint fork (well, actually, Sei’s own fork of a fork) for consensus. Cosmos applications operate on blocks, which contain transactions, which further contain individual messages. Each of these messages triggers a state transition. The Cosmos SDK is written in Go.</p>

<p>Cosmos uses go panics for error handling. Transaction runs out of gas? panic. Try to spend more coins than you have? panic. Invalid inputs? panic.</p>

<p>To handle this, transactions are run within a <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/advanced/runtx_middleware">recovery loop</a> called the <code>RunTx recovery middleware</code>. When Cosmos processes a block of transactions, the flow is kind of like this (heavily simplified).</p>

<p>There’s some preprocessing to set up a block, transactions are safely processed within a recovery loop, and then there is some work to do at the end of a block. Every Cosmos <code>module</code> can specify its own start and end processing hooks too. These hooks are one type of <code>ABCI method</code>. Unfortunately, by default, ABCI methods are not run in a recovery loop. Woops! If you panic <em>there</em>, the program will simply crash.</p>

<p>I first learned of this Cosmos footgun from Trail of Bits’ fantastic <code>building-secure-contracts</code> repo. ref: <a href="https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/abci_panic">https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/abci_panic</a></p>

<p>Sei had a panic in one of its ABCI EndBlockers, which would have reliably halted the chain if the code was reached. Remediation would have required a hard fork.</p>

<p>While looking through all of the ABCI hooks in the Sei codebase for reachable panics, one stood out to me: <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/49eb8b3d205d4a73c5e2b2bb3a433f886279028b/x/evm/module.go#L232">https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/49eb8b3d205d4a73c5e2b2bb3a433f886279028b/x/evm/module.go#L232</a></p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The above code, at the end of every block, goes through each transaction and tries to empty the “coinbase address” of any tokens. The way this is done is first the coinbase address’s balance is retrieved via a call to <code>GetBalance</code> and then this resulting balance is transferred out by a call to <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code>.</p>

<p>What the coinbase address represents in Sei doesn’t matter here. What’s important is that it is a deterministic address, calculable in advance. The address is calculated as a function of a tx’s index in a block. So the first tx in a block always has a “coinbase address” of <code>sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>The mistake here stems from the fact that cosmos chains have a notion of locked and unlocked balances. The <code>GetBalance</code> function called above returns the total of locked+unlocked funds. If, for example, the coinbase address has 42sei of locked funds and 1000sei of unlocked funds, the <code>GetBalance</code> call will report a total balance of 1042sei. However, because we can only transfer unlocked funds, the <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code> call will return an error if we call it with any number greater than 1000ei. When <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code> is called with an amount of 1042 sei, it will return an error and then we will reach the call to panic.</p>

<p>One way to end up with locked funds is via a vesting account. If, for example, I want to grant you one thousand tokens linearly over four years then I can create a vesting account and the unlocks are handled automatically by Cosmos. When creating a vesting account I can specify its address and any unused address will do. I don’t need the keys to it or anything.</p>

<p>Now we have all the pieces needed to reach an ABCI panic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a vesting account at the <code>sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv</code> address with some tokens.</li>
  <li>Send an EVM tx to Sei to reach this code block.</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the vesting account all we have to do is run a command like  <code>seid tx vesting create-vesting-account sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv 1000000000000000usei 1800000000 --from my_account --fees 50000usei</code> from the seid CLI tool.</p>

<p>Once this command is executed and the vulnerable code is run, the coinbase balance will be greater than zero but not entirely transferable. The call to <code>GetBalance</code> will return the sum of locked and unlocked tokens. Calling <code>SendCoinsAndWei</code> with this sum will return an error, and a panic will be triggered. The application will crash and the chain will halt.</p>

<p>To fix the issue, the call to <code>GetBalance</code> was simply replaced with a call to <code>SpendableCoins</code>. Easy! For safety, later on the panic was removed entirely.</p>

<h2 id="issue-2">Issue 2</h2>

<p>If exploited, the second issue would have allowed an attacker to freely transfer funds out of any account.</p>

<p>When browsing through the fix commit and subsequent changes made as a result of the previous issue, I noticed some interesting code at the junction of Sei’s Cosmos and Geth modules.</p>

<p>At this time the Sei team was just wrapping up their work on Sei V2. V2 introduced the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to Sei. Integrating the EVM into a system like Cosmos is a sensitive process. Neither of these systems were designed with the other’s compatibility in mind and trying to combine them is difficult. It’s easy to introduce subtle yet disastrous bugs to your blockchain when doing this.</p>

<p>In the fix PR for the previous issue, an unrelated bug was also patched in the evm account balance handling code. Looking at this file, I noticed that <code>SubBalance</code> and <code>AddBalance</code> had provisions for negative numbers:</p>

    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Subtracting -x Sei tokens from an account is just redirected to be the same as adding +x. Similarly, adding -x Sei tokens to an account is redirected to the code for subtracting +x.</p>

<p>That’s interesting. I wonder, how are balance transfers handled in the EVM anyways?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Transfer subtracts amount from sender and adds amount to recipient using the given Db</span>
<span>func</span> <span>Transfer</span><span>(</span><span>db</span> <span>vm</span><span>.</span><span>StateDB</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>recipient</span> <span>common</span><span>.</span><span>Address</span><span>,</span> <span>amount</span> <span>*</span><span>big</span><span>.</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If one could slip a negative amount into <code>Transfer</code>, they could siphon Sei <em>from</em> an account rather than transferring Sei <em>to</em> an account.</p>

<p>What guards are there before we reach Transfer?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// CanTransfer checks whether there are enough funds in the address' account to make a transfer.</span>
<span>// This does not take the necessary gas in to account to make the transfer valid.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>CanTransfer</span><span>(</span><span>db</span> <span>vm</span><span>.</span><span>StateDB</span><span>,</span> <span>addr</span> <span>common</span><span>.</span><span>Address</span><span>,</span> <span>amount</span> <span>*</span><span>big</span><span>.</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks like an account can make transfers as long as it has more than the <code>amount</code> being transferred. Looks good so far. Say I want to steal 100sei; I’d need to send a transfer of -100sei. Well, even a 0sei balance is more than -100sei. So for negative amounts this check will always pass.</p>

<p>Of course, there may be even more checks prior to this. Or not. It’s a big codebase, I don’t know. Let’s just write the code and see what happens.</p>

<p>In SeiV2 there are three high level ways to trigger this EVM transfer code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From EVM space, use a <code>CALL</code>, <code>CREATE</code> or <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> opcode</li>
  <li>Send a top level EVM Message packaged in a transaction</li>
  <li>From cosmwasm space, send an internal EVM message</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these routes allow transfers of negative value then we will be able to steal the entire unlocked balance from any account.</p>

<hr>
<p>Right off the bat the first option will not work. The EVM uses 256 bit registers that we can set freely as opcode arguments but the state transition handling code for <code>CALL</code> and <code>CREATE</code> treat these as unsigned integers, so they are always positive. <code>SELFDESTRUCT</code> triggers transfers but doesn’t take a value argument.</p>

<hr>
<p>The second option seems promising. We only need to construct a <code>MsgEVMTransaction</code> with negative value. However, Sei’s <code>MsgEVMTransaction</code> type uses the RLP encoding from Geth for the data field, which itself includes the <code>value</code> field. <code>value</code> is typed as a big int, which is a signed type and can be negative! Unfortunately there is no valid RLP encoding for a negative big int: when encoding, the sign information is discarded. When decoding, the output is always positive.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// WriteBigInt encodes a big.Int as an RLP string.</span>
<span>// Note: Unlike with Encode, the sign of i is ignored.</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>EncoderBuffer</span><span>)</span> <span>WriteBigInt</span><span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>*</span><span>big</span><span>.</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>w</span><span>.</span><span>buf</span><span>.</span><span>writeBigInt</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>The third option uses yet another execution mode contained in Sei. Really Sei V2 has three modes of executing transactions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cosmos messages</li>
  <li>cosmwasm</li>
  <li>EVM</li>
</ul>

<p>Technically cosmwasm and EVM programs are both triggered by high level cosmos messages, but it’s worth considering them separately. Cosmos transactions contain messages that execute specific functions. For example a message might execute an action like “stake some coins” or “send some coins”. These functions are baked into the chain code and are not generally programmable by end users.</p>

<p>The community found this a bit limiting, so to add more flexibility cosmwasm was introduced to bring a web assembly environment to Cosmos. This enabled general-purpose smart contract programming by end users.</p>

<p>Finally, Sei V2 builds on both of these and adds a bespoke EVM environment to the mix. The way this is done is by linking to go-ethereum and adding hooks to connect the EVM state mutations to the underlying Cosmos system and storage.</p>

<p>So now in addition to the fixed functions that can be called by messages, we also have the ability to specify messages that “create a cosmwasm or EVM program” or “execute a cosmwasm or EVM program”. The cosmwasm (web assembly) module is well tested and widely used. Sei’s EVM integration is custom, only used by Sei, and brand new.</p>

<p>At the time of my report, a Cosmos message in Sei could bounce execution back and forth between these environments as much as it wants. One could, for example, send a transaction that contains a message to call a cosmwasm program, which then dispatches a cosmos message to send coins, receives its result and calls an EVM contract.</p>

<p>Calling an EVM smart contract from cosmwasm in SeiV2 is slightly different from making a top-level EVM call directly. To make a cosmwasm -&gt; EVM call we use one of the following “internal” message types instead of <code>MsgEVMTransaction</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MsgInternalEVMCall</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Sender</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>Value</span>  <span>*</span><span>github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types</span><span>.</span><span>Int</span>
	<span>To</span>     <span>string</span>
	<span>Data</span>   <span>[]</span><span>byte</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>MsgInternalEVMDelegateCall</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Sender</span>       <span>string</span>
	<span>CodeHash</span>     <span>[]</span><span>byte</span>
	<span>To</span>           <span>string</span>
	<span>Data</span>         <span>[]</span><span>byte</span>
	<span>FromContract</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Remember, what we’re interested in is triggering a transfer with a negative <code>amount</code> or <code>value</code> (these terms are used interchangeably at times). Of these two internal call types, only <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> allows us to specify a value to go along with the call. And it’s a signed int!</p>

<p>To find out whether or not I could successfully use <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> to make a siphoning transfer I added the following test to Sei’s test suite and ran it.</p>

<p>Sure enough, we can send an internal EVM call from an attacker account to a victim account with a negative value and siphon out that value from the victim’s balance.</p>

<p>At this point all funds on the chain are at risk. An attacker could freely steal Sei tokens from centralized exchanges, cold wallets, etc. Given that Sei is trading at around a $1 billion market cap with &gt;$100M of daily volume between derivatives and spot, there is a lot of profit opportunity here.</p>

<p>But for fun, we can take this bug even further.</p>

<p>Cosmos chains operate on proof of stake consensus. For Sei, this means that the 50 validators with the most stake are responsible for producing and verifying new blocks on the chain. All 50 validators’ stakes are held in one account called the “bonded token pool”.</p>

<p>An attacker can become the #1 most powerful validator on the chain by simply stealing the balance of the bonded token pool, and staking that sum again themselves. When they do this the tokens are returned to the same account they stole them from.  If you create 50 accounts, and do this 50 times, you will own all of the top 50 validators and control the chain. Because the active validator set is recalculated at the end of every block in an ABCI method, this whole attack can be done in one block.</p>

<p>Under the tendermint consensus system, anyone with &gt;2/3rds stake can arbitrarily choose what blocks are canonical on the chain. At this point the chain is considered compromised and needs to be hard forked from before the attack. Some things the attacker can do include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Censor anyone’s transactions. If someone tried to use this same exploit to steal coins back from the attacker, their transactions can be ignored and will never land in a block.</li>
  <li>Commit invalid state transitions. The attacker can use their 2/3rds stake to attest to whatever blocks they want, including ones with arbitrary information and proofs in the block header.</li>
  <li>Double spend coins.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the token theft mechanism is perfectly valid according to the chain’s code, certain types of faults like committing invalid blocks will be rejected by honest full nodes. These nodes will simply stop advancing their local chain in the face of a safety fault. But other attacks, like transaction censoring, are not detectable.</p>

<p>Light clients that only check validator proofs, like those used in IBC, will accept any of the attacker blocks.</p>

<p>Timeline:</p>
<ul>
  <li>April 23, 2024: I create the report on Immunefi</li>
  <li>April 24, 2024: The Sei team merge a PR fixing the bug</li>
  <li>April 24, 2024: The Sei team confirm the report</li>
  <li>May 22, 2024: The Sei team send payment of $2,000,000</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to thank the Sei Foundation for their commendable efforts in securing the Sei protocol. It is only due to their thoroughness in designing Sei’s security strategy that these bugs were able to be caught before the vulnerable code was deployed to mainnet. The issues described here are subtle and persisted through Sei’s internal code review and several external audits. However Sei has gone above and beyond, putting a large amount of resources towards setting up a public bug bounty program in their pursuit of defense in depth. In rapidly addressing and honestly rewarding these reports, the Sei Foundation has demonstrated their absolute commitment to protecting their users.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<p>Particularly attentive readers might notice that the test I added to confirm issue 2 is not actually an end to end proof of concept.</p>

<p>In the test I constructed a <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> directly. But in a real attack scenario we would have to create a cosmwasm contract compiled to webassembly, populate this struct from there, serialize it to JSON, and send it as a submessage from cosmwasm back to the main cosmos application which would construct the <code>MsgInternalEVMCall</code> for us.</p>

<p>These two scenarios are not identical. The JSON-&gt;Msg encoder and handler functions are both custom written by the Sei team and were skipped in my test. It is reasonable to wonder whether or not there they contain additional guards that might prevent the attack but were skipped in the test I made.</p>

<p>When submitting my report to Sei I was very confident that there were no such guards, as I had read all of the code many times at that point and knew it inside and out. But eventually I wanted to test stealing tokens from the bonded validator pool to take over the validator set. I ended up making a proper end to end proof of concept because I wasn’t sure whether or not the bonded token pool had any special status as an account, potentially with some sort of lock on its tokens, and wanted to test this.</p>

<p>The following cosmwasm contract exploits the bug and drains the bonded token pool.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://htmx.org/posts/2024-06-17-htmx-2-0-0-is-released/">https://htmx.org/posts/2024-06-17-htmx-2-0-0-is-released/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40709769">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
  <h2 id="htmx-2-0-0-release">htmx 2.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I’m very happy to announce the release of htmx 2.0.  This release ends support for Internet Explorer and tightens up some
defaults, but does not change most of the core functionality or the core API of the library.</p>
<p>Note that we are not marking 2.0 as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-dist-tag#purpose"><code>latest</code></a> in NPM 
because we do not want to force-upgrade users who are relying on non-versioned CDN URLs for htmx.  Instead, 1.x will
remain <code>latest</code> and the 2.0 line will remain <code>next</code> until Jan 1, 2025. The website, however, will reference 2.0.</p>
<h3 id="major-changes">Major Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>All extensions have been moved out of the core repository to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx-extensions/">their own repo</a>
and website: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://extensions.htmx.org/">https://extensions.htmx.org</a>.  They are now all versioned individually and can be developed outside of
the normal (slow) htmx release cadence.
<ul>
<li>Most 1.x extensions will work with 2.x, however the SSE extension did have a break and must be upgraded.</li>
<li>The older extensions remain in the <code>/dist/ext</code> directory so as to not break the URLs of CDNs like unpkg, but please
move to the new extension URLs going forward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We removed the deprecated <code>hx-sse</code> and <code>hx-ws</code> attributes in favor of the extensions, which were available and
recommended in 1.x.</li>
<li>HTTP <code>DELETE</code> requests now use parameters, rather than form encoded bodies, for their payload (This is in accordance w/ the spec.)</li>
<li>We now provide specific files in <code>/dist</code> for the various JavaScript module styles:
<ul>
<li>ESM Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.esm.js</code></li>
<li>UMD Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.umd.js</code></li>
<li>AMD Modules: <code>/dist/htmx.amd.js</code></li>
<li>The <code>/dist/htmx.js</code> file continues to be browser-loadable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>hx-on</code> attribute, with its special syntax, has been removed in favor of the less-hacky <code>hx-on:</code> syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-changes">Minor Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>We made some default changes:
<ul>
<li><code>htmx.config.scrollBehavior</code> was changed to <code>'instant'</code> from <code>'smooth'</code></li>
<li>As mentioned previously, <code>DELETE</code> requests now use query parameters, rather than a form-encoded body.  This can
be reverted by setting <code>htmx.methodsThatUseUrlParams</code> to  the value <code>['get']</code>,</li>
<li><code>htmx.config.selfRequestsOnly</code> now defaults to <code>true</code> rather than <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Not much, really:</p>

<p dir="auto">If you are invovled in developing, supporting, or maintaining an application that sends emails, this guide is a must read. This guide is your key to peace of mind, knowing that your emails will reach your customers as intended and your domain is shielded from abuse from cybercriminals and spammers.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's about ensuring they reach the intended destination - the recipient's inbox, not the spam or junk folder. For instance, You've built an e-commerce application or a SaaS platform that sends transactional emails like order confirmations or password resets or important customer notification emails. These emails are crucial touchpoints for your customers. But what if they never see them? What if these important communications end up in spam or junk?</p>
<p dir="auto">While email is one of the most common communication channels, it's also a favorite target for cybercriminals and a playground for spammers. Here are some real-world examples of how they can abuse email systems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: A cybercriminal wants to steal sensitive information from the customers of a well-known bank. The criminal could spin up or use a compromised server to send emails that appear to come from the bank's domain, asking customers to update their account information. If the bank hasn't implemented SPF, the email could pass the receiving server's checks and land in the customer's inbox. The customer, thinking the email is from their bank, clicks the link and enters their login details on a fake website controlled by the criminal. The criminal can now access the customer's bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Brand Impersonation</strong>: A cybercriminal could impersonate a popular e-commerce platform and send emails to users asking them to confirm their purchase of an expensive item. The email could contain a link to a fake customer support page where the user is asked to enter their login details to cancel the purchase. If the e-commerce platform hasn't implemented DKIM, the email could pass the receiving server's checks and land in the user's inbox. The user, thinking the email is from the e-commerce platform, enters their login details on the fake page, giving the criminal access to their account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Business Email Compromise (BEC)</strong>: A cybercriminal could impersonate a company's CEO or another high-ranking official and send an email to the finance department, asking them to make a payment to a new vendor. If the company hasn't implemented DMARC, the email could pass the receiving server's checks and land in the finance department's inbox. The finance department, thinking the email is from the CEO, could make the payment to the criminal's bank account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">By understanding and implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, you can protect your domain from being used in these types of attacks, safeguard your customers and employees, and maintain your reputation.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, why bother? Because your emails matter, your customers matter, and your reputation matters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Choose This Guide?</h2><a id="user-content-why-choose-this-guide" aria-label="Permalink: Why Choose This Guide?" href="#why-choose-this-guide"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With so many articles out in the internet why should I choose this guide? This guide stands out for its simplicity, clarity, and convenience. It demystifies SPF, DKIM, and DMARC with clear explanations and examples avoiding the technical jargon as much as possible. Hosted on GitHub, it integrates seamlessly with your development environment, providing quick access to information right from your IDE (visual studio code ,etc.) or command line. Plus, it's a document that will stay in Github and guaranteed that won't go anywhere that can be edited by you or anyone or the community to ensure it stays updated and relevant.</p>

<p dir="auto">While this guide aims to simplify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, it's not intended to be a comprehensive guide about these topics. It's not a guide for setting up an email server, nor does it cover advanced topics like encryption or secure email gateways.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</h3><a id="user-content-spf-sender-policy-framework" aria-label="Permalink: SPF (Sender Policy Framework)" href="#spf-sender-policy-framework"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">SPF: It's like a list of friends who can send emails for you. The SPF Record is this list. If an email says it's from you but it's not sent by a friend on your list, it's probably not really from you.</p>
<p dir="auto">As the owner of a domain, you can use SPF to create a list of 'email friends' - these are the mail servers that are allowed to send emails on your behalf. This helps stop people who aren't your 'email friends' from pretending to be you. The SPF Record, a DNS TXT record, is where you keep this list of 'email friends'.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DNS TXT record for an SPF your 'email friends' typically looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="v=spf1 ip4:123.123.123.123 ~all"><pre>v=spf1 ip4:123.123.123.123 <span>~</span>all</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here's the command I usually run to fetch that:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</h3><a id="user-content-dkim-domainkeys-identified-mail" aria-label="Permalink: DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)" href="#dkim-domainkeys-identified-mail"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DKIM: It's like a secret note inside your emails. When you send an email, you put a secret note inside. This note is made using a special secret code only you know.
When your email arrives, the receiver checks the secret note using a public code that everyone knows. This public code is stored in a place called the DKIM Record.
If the secret note matches the public code, the email is really from you and hasn't been changed. This helps stop bad people from pretending to send emails from you or changing your emails.</p>
<p dir="auto">This public code, also known as a public key, is stored in a DNS TXT record known as the DKIM Record, which is accessible to everyone. It's like the decoder for your secret code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DNS TXT record, where the public code (or public key) for DKIM is stored, typically looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=NICfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDBolTXCqbxwoRBffyg2efs+Dtlc+CjxKz9grZGBaISRvN7EOZNoGDTyjbDIG8CnEK479niIL4rPAVriT54MhUZfC5UU4OFXTvOW8FWzk6++a0JzYu+FAwYnOQE9R8npKNOl2iDK/kheneVcD4IKCK7IhuWf8w4lnR6QEW3hpTsawIDAQ0B&quot;"><pre>v=DKIM1<span>;</span> k=rsa<span>;</span> p=NICfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDBolTXCqbxwoRBffyg2efs+Dtlc+CjxKz9grZGBaISRvN7EOZNoGDTyjbDIG8CnEK479niIL4rPAVriT54MhUZfC5UU4OFXTvOW8FWzk6++a0JzYu+FAwYnOQE9R8npKNOl2iDK/kheneVcD4IKCK7IhuWf8w4lnR6QEW3hpTsawIDAQ0B<span><span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here's the command I usually run to fetch that:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="dig TXT selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com"><pre>dig TXT selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note: Replace <code>selector1</code> with your actual selector, and <code>yourdomain.com</code> with your actual domain. This command will fetch the DNS TXT record where your public code is stored.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance)</h3><a id="user-content-dmarc-domain-based-message-authentication-reporting--conformance" aria-label="Permalink: DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance)" href="#dmarc-domain-based-message-authentication-reporting--conformance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DMARC: It's like the boss of SPF and DKIM. It takes the rules from SPF and DKIM and makes a big rule book. This rule book tells everyone what to do if an email from your domain doesn't follow the rules. For example, one rule could be to send a report if an email doesn't pass the checks. The DMARC Record, a place everyone can see, holds this rule book.</p>
<p dir="auto">If an email passes the SPF and DKIM checks, the receiver then looks at the DMARC rule book to decide what to do with the email. They might follow the rule to send a report, or they might follow another rule depending on what your rule book says.</p>
<p dir="auto">DMARC allows domain owners to declare their rules in the rule book. This rule book, stored in the DMARC Record, a DNS TXT record, specifies your DMARC policies and how receivers should handle mail that violates these rules. If both SPF and DKIM checks pass, the receiver then checks the DMARC rule book to decide what to do with the email.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DNS TXT record for DMARC 'rule book' typically looks like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com"><pre>v=DMARC1<span>;</span> p=none<span>;</span> rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here's the command I usually run to fetch that:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="dig _dmarc.example.com TXT"><pre>dig _dmarc.example.com TXT</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Real World Examples of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Are Used</h2><a id="user-content-real-world-examples-of-spf-dkim-and-dmarc-are-used" aria-label="Permalink: Real World Examples of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Are Used" href="#real-world-examples-of-spf-dkim-and-dmarc-are-used"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's look at how SPF, DKIM, and DMARC work in real-world example scenarios:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Mobile Apps</strong>: Mobile apps that send emails, such as a fitness app sending workout summaries or a banking app sending transaction alerts, also use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. When the app sends an email, the receiving server checks if the sending server's IP is in the SPF record of the sender's domain. It then uses the DKIM record to verify the email's DKIM signature. If both checks pass, the server applies the DMARC policy to decide what to do with the email. This ensures that the emails reach the user's inbox and not the spam folder, and protects the app's reputation by preventing email spoofing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Email Service Providers</strong>: Providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to authenticate incoming emails. For instance, when an email arrives, Gmail checks if the sending server's IP is in the SPF record of the sender's domain. It then uses the DKIM record to verify the email's DKIM signature. If both checks pass, Gmail applies the DMARC policy to decide what to do with the email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Social Media Platforms</strong>: Social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter that send notification emails also use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. When a user receives a notification email, their email provider checks if the sending server's IP is in the SPF record of the social media platform's domain. It then uses the DKIM record to verify the email's DKIM signature. If both checks pass, the provider applies the DMARC policy to decide what to do with the email. This ensures that the emails reach the user's inbox and not the spam folder, and protects the social media platform's reputation by preventing email spoofing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Businesses</strong>: Businesses use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to protect their email communication and brand reputation. For example, a business might send promotional emails to its customers. By implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, the business ensures that its emails are not marked as spam and that its domain is not used for email spoofing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Government Agencies</strong>: Government agencies use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to secure their email communication and prevent phishing attacks. For instance, a government agency might send notifications to citizens. By using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, the agency ensures that its emails reach the citizens' inbox and that cybercriminals cannot send phishing emails that appear to come from the agency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Now I Know These Things, What's Next?</h2><a id="user-content-now-i-know-these-things-whats-next" aria-label="Permalink: Now I Know These Things, What's Next?" href="#now-i-know-these-things-whats-next"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Now that you've learned the basics of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, you might be thinking about using these tools to make your emails more secure. Here's a simple guide to help you get started:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Identify the Email Address and Domain</strong>: First, you need to know the email address and domain your app uses. You'll need to add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to this domain. A simple way to find this out is by sending an email from your app to yourself. For example, you could sign up for an account on your site and click on 'forgot password' to receive an email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Current Status</strong>: Next, check if you already have SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. If you do, make sure they're set up correctly. You can learn how to do this in the next section, 'Checking Your SPF, DKIM, DMARC Status'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Domain Access</strong>: Make sure you have the rights to change the DNS records of your domain. You'll need this to add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. If you don't have access, you'll need to request the person who does to add these records for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>DMARC Monitoring</strong>: Once you've set up DMARC, you'll need to keep an eye on DMARC reports to make sure everything's working as it should and fix any problems. Decide who will do this and which email address will receive the DMARC reports.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The usual order is to set up the SPF record first, then DKIM, and finally DMARC.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Checking Your SPF, DKIM, DMARC Status</h2><a id="user-content-checking-your-spf-dkim-dmarc-status" aria-label="Permalink: Checking Your SPF, DKIM, DMARC Status" href="#checking-your-spf-dkim-dmarc-status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a straightforward with tools like MXToolbox and DMARCTester. Here's how you can use these tools:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>MXToolbox</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Visit <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" rel="nofollow">https://mxtoolbox.com/</a></li>
<li>Use the 'SPF Record Lookup', 'DKIM Record Lookup', and 'DMARC Record Lookup' tools to check the respective records for your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>DMARCTester</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Visit <a href="https://www.dmarctester.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.dmarctester.com/</a></li>
<li>This site offers two ways to check your email security:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Send an Email</strong>: The site generates a unique email address for you. You can then send an email from your application or mail server to this address.</li>
<li><strong>Paste Email Headers</strong>: Alternatively, you can send an email from your application to your own email address, then copy the email headers and paste them into the tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Remember, these checks help you understand what's missing or needs improvement to enhance your email security and reputation, make sure you take note of that and take action.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: When using online tools, only share what's needed. Always check the site's privacy rules to keep your info safe. I'm sharing these tools because they're helpful, not because I am affiliated with them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ's with SPF, DKIM and DMARC</h2><a id="user-content-faqs-with-spf-dkim-and-dmarc" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ's with SPF, DKIM and DMARC" href="#faqs-with-spf-dkim-and-dmarc"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">What email address should I use for DMARC reporting?</p>
<p dir="auto">It's a good idea to use an email address that multiple people can check. This is often a shared mailbox. Ideally, this email address should be from the same domain that you're setting up DMARC for. If you decide to use an email address from a different domain, you'll need to add an extra step: You'll have to add a special record (called a DNS TXT record) to authorize the other domain to receive DMARC reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">What's the difference between ~all, -all, ?all, and +all in an SPF record?</p>
<p dir="auto">These are used to tell receiving servers what to do if an email comes from a server that isn't listed in your SPF record.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">~all (SoftFail): This means "It's okay if the server isn't on my list, but be aware that it might not be legit." The email will still be accepted, but it might be marked as suspicious. This is often used when you're still testing your SPF record or making changes to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">-all (Fail): This means "Only accept emails from servers on my list. Reject everything else." This is used when you're sure of all the servers that should be sending emails for your domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">?all (Neutral): This means "I'm not saying whether servers should be on my list or not. Treat the email as you normally would." This doesn't really give any instructions about how to handle the email, so it's not used very often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">+all (Pass): This means "Accept emails from all servers, even if they're not on my list." This isn't recommended because it could allow spammers to send emails that look like they're from your domain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The choice between these depends on how strictly you want to enforce SPF rules for your domain. It’s generally recommended to use ~all while testing or setting up your SPF record, and switch to -all once you are confident that your SPF record is correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Can I set up DMARC without SPF?</p>
<p dir="auto">Technically, you can, but it's not a good idea. DMARC is like a security guard for your emails. It uses two tools, SPF and DKIM, to check if an email is really from you. If an email fails both the SPF and DKIM checks, it also fails the DMARC check.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you set up DMARC without SPF, it's like the security guard is missing one of its tools. It can still use DKIM to check emails, but it won't be as effective.</p>
<p dir="auto">SPF isn't perfect and can't stop all fake emails on its own. That's why it's best to use it together with DKIM and DMARC. This gives you a more complete email security system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I've looked at an email header and I see multiple SPF fails and some SPF passes. Which one should I believe?</p>
<p dir="auto">Think of an email header like a story. The most recent events are at the top, and the oldest events are at the bottom. So, the original sender’s information is usually towards the bottom of the header.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you see multiple SPF fails and a couple of SPF passes, it might feel like the story is getting confusing. But don't worry! You should trust the SPF check that's related to your domain or the domains that you trust (like your 'friends list'). The other SPF checks are for other domains that were part of the email's journey, and their pass or fail status doesn't affect your domain's SPF status.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Wrapping Up</h2><a id="user-content-wrapping-up" aria-label="Permalink: Wrapping Up" href="#wrapping-up"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Just like a secret handshake, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are the hidden heroes of email security. They're the reason your email recipients can trust messages from your domain. So, the next time you hit 'send', remember that these three musketeers are working tirelessly behind the scenes to keep your email safe.</p>

<p><a href="http://proton.me/">Proton</a>, the secure-minded email and productivity suite, is becoming a nonprofit foundation, but it doesn't want you to think about it in the way you think about other notable privacy and web foundations.</p>
<p>"We believe that if we want to bring about large-scale change, Proton can’t be billionaire-subsidized (like Signal), Google-subsidized (like Mozilla), government-subsidized (like Tor), donation-subsidized (like Wikipedia), or even speculation-subsidized (like the plethora of crypto “foundations”)," Proton CEO Andy Yen wrote in a blog post announcing the transition. "Instead, Proton must have a profitable and healthy business at its core."</p>
<p>The announcement comes exactly 10 years to the day after a crowdfunding campaign saw 10,000 people give more than $500,000 to launch Proton Mail. To make it happen, Yen, along with co-founder Jason Stockman and first employee Dingchao Lu, endowed the Proton Foundation with some of their shares. <a href="https://proton.me/foundation">The Proton Foundation</a> is now the primary shareholder of the business Proton, which Yen states will "make irrevocable our wish that Proton remains in perpetuity an organization that places people ahead of profits." Among other members of the Foundation's board is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, inventor of HTML, HTTP, and almost everything else about the web.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Of particular importance is where Proton and the Proton Foundation are located: Switzerland. As Yen noted, Swiss foundations do not have shareholders and are instead obligated to act "in accordance with the purpose for which they were established." While the for-profit entity Proton AG can still do things like offer stock options to recruits and even raise its own capital on private markets, the Foundation serves as a backstop against moving too far from Proton's founding mission, Yen wrote.</p>
<h2>There’s a lot more Proton to protect these days</h2>
<p>Proton has gone from a single email offering to a wide range of services, many of which specifically target the often invasive offerings of other companies (read, mostly: Google). You can now take your cloud files, passwords, and calendars over to Proton and use its VPN services, most of which offer end-to-end encryption and open source core software hosted in Switzerland, with its notably strong privacy laws.
</p><p>None of that guarantees that a Swiss court can't compel some forms of compliance from Proton, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/privacy-focused-protonmail-provided-a-users-ip-address-to-authorities/">happened in 2021</a>. But compared to most service providers, Proton offers a far clearer and easier-to-grasp privacy model: It can't see your stuff, and it only makes money from subscriptions.</p>
<p>Of course, foundations are only as strong as the people who guide them, and seemingly firewalled profit/non-profit models <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-ceo-says-company-could-become-benefit-corporation-information-2024-06-15/">can be changed</a>. Time will tell if Proton's new model can keep up with changing markets—and people.</p>
