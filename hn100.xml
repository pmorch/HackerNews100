<p>I released version 1 of my <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/">table seating planning software</a>, PerfectTablePlan, in February 2005. 20 years ago this month. It was a different world. A world of Windows, shareware and CDs. A lot has changed since then, but PerfectTablePlan is now at version 7 and still going strong.</p>

<p>PerfectTablePlan v7</p>



<p>I have released several other products since then, and done some training and consulting, but PerfectTablePlan remains my most successful product. It’s success is due to a lot of hard work, and a certain amount of dumb luck.</p>



<p>I was getting married and I volunteered to do the seating plan for our wedding reception. It sounded like a relatively straightforward optimization problem, as we only had 60 guests and no family feuds to worry about. But it was surprisingly difficult to get right. I looked around for some software to help me. There were a couple of software packages, but I wasn’t impressed. I could do better myself! So I wrote a (very rough) first version, which I used for our wedding.</p>



<p>Things weren’t going great at my day job, at a small software startup. Maybe I could commercialize my table planner? I was a bit wary, as my potential competitors all seemed rather moribund and I didn’t think I would be able to make a living off it. But I thought I could do everything worth doing in 6-12 months and then start on the next product. Wrong on both counts!</p>



<p>Web-based software was still in its infancy in 2005. So I decided to write it as desktop software using C++ and cross-platform framework Qt, which I had plenty of experience in. Initially, I just released a Windows version. But I later added a Mac version as well. Qt has had its commercial ups and downs in the last 20 years, but it has grown with me and is now very robust, comprehensive and well documented. I think I made a good choice.</p>



<p>I financed PerfectTablePlan out of my own savings and it has been profitable every year since version 1 was launched. I could have taken on employees and grown the business, but I preferred to keep it as a <a href="https://successfulsoftware.net/2013/11/06/lifestyle-programming/">lifestyle business</a>. My wife does the accounts and proof reading and I do nearly everything else, with a bit of help from my accountant, web designers and a few other contractors. I don’t regret that decision. 20 years without meetings, ties or alarm clocks. My son was born 18 months after PerfectTablePlan was launched and it has been great to have the flexibility to be fully present as a Dad.</p>



<p>CDs, remember them? I sent out around 5,000 CDs (with some help from my father), before I stopped shipping CDs in 2016.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of PerfectTablePlan it became clear that things were increasingly moving to the web. But I couldn’t face rewriting PerfectTablePlan from scratch for the web. Javascript. Ugh. Also PerfectTablePlan is quite compute intensive, using a genetic algorithm to generate an automated seating plan and I felt it was better running this on the customer’s local computers than my server. And some of my customers consider their seating plans to be confidential and don’t want to store them on third party servers. So I decided to stick with desktop. But, if I was starting PerfectTablePlan from scratch now, I might make a different decision.</p>



<p>Plenty of strange and wonderful things have happened over the last 20 years, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>PerfectTablePlan has been used by some very famous organizations for some very famous events (which we mostly don’t have permission to mention). It has seated royalty, celebrities and heads of state.</li>



<li>PerfectTablePlan was used as part of a <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/newsletters/newsletter10_web.html">demonstration of the (controversial) first commercial quantum computer by D-Wave</a>.</li>



<li>A mock-up of PerfectTablePlan, including icons I did myself, was <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/newsletters/newsletter_8.html">used without our permission</a> by Sony in their ‘Big day’ TV comedy series. I threated them with legal action. Years later, I am still awaiting a reply.</li>



<li>I got to grapple with some interesting problems, including the mathematics of <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/html/genetic_algorithm.html">large combinatorial problems</a> and <a href="https://successfulsoftware.net/2008/07/18/a-mathematical-digression/">elliptical tables</a>. Some customers have seated 4,000 guests and 4000! (4000x3999x3998 .. x 1) is a mind-bogglingly huge number.</li>



<li>A well known wedding magazine ran a promotion with a valid licence key clearly visible in a photograph of a PerfectTablePlan CD. I worked through the night to release a new version of PerfectTablePlan that didn’t work with this key.</li>



<li>I found out that <a href="https://www.perfecttableplan.com/html/the_dog_ate_my_cd.html">CDs are edible</a>.</li>



<li>I sponsored the <a href="https://thejunipertrust.org/jt_projects/bampti-kindergaten-school/">building of a kindergarten in Nepal</a>.</li>



<li>I once had to stay up late, in a state of some inebriation, to fix an issue so that a world famous event wasn’t a disaster (no I can’t tell you the event).</li>
</ul>



<p>The lowest point was the pandemic, when sales pretty much dropped to zero.</p>



<p>Competitors and operating systems have come and gone and the ecosystem for software has changed a lot, but PerfectTablePlan is still here and still paying the bills. It is about 145,000 lines of C++. Some of the code is a bit ugly and not how I would write it now. But the product is very solid, with very few bugs. The website and user documentation are also substantial pieces of work. The PDF version of the documentation is nearly 500 pages.</p>



<p>I now divide my time between PerfectTablePlan and my 2 other products: <a href="https://www.easydatatransform.com/">data wrangling software</a> Easy Data Transform and <a href="https://www.hyperplan.com/">visual planner</a> Hyper Plan. Having multiple products keeps things varied and avoids having all my eggs in one basket. In May 2024 I released PerfectTablePlan v7 with a load of improvements and new features. And I have plenty of ideas for future improvements. I fully expect to keep working on PerfectTablePlan until I retire (I’m 59 now).</p>

<p>The scientists behind NASA's largest and most powerful space telescope ever built are bracing for potentially crippling budget cuts, and the observatory is only halfway through its primary mission.</p><p>The team overseeing NASA's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/21925-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/21925-james-webb-space-telescope-jwst.html"><u>James Webb Space Telescope</u></a> (JWST) has been directed to prepare for up to 20% in budget cuts that would touch on every aspect of the flagship observatory's operations, which are managed by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Maryland. The potential cut comes even as the space observatory is more in demand than ever before, with astronomers requesting the equivalent of nine years' worth of Webb observing time in one operational year.</p><p>"NASA is having budget constraints across the entire board, so the institute is being asked to consider a significant — about 20% — cut to our operational budget for the mission starting later this year," Tom Brown, who leads the Webb mission office at STScI, told a crowd of scientists last month at the 245th American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. "So the impacts of that, if it comes to pass, pretty much cut across the entire mission."</p><p>NASA's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/nasa-white-house-2025-budget-request" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/nasa-white-house-2025-budget-request"><u>$25.4 billion budget request for 2025</u></a> set aside $317 million to fund the Webb space telescope, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/15892-hubble-space-telescope.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/15892-hubble-space-telescope.html"><u>Hubble Space Telescope</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/18669-chandra-x-ray-observatory.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/18669-chandra-x-ray-observatory.html"><u>Chandra X-ray Observatory</u></a> that together comprise NASA's currently operational "Great Observatories." The Hubble Telescope program is facing a potential 20% budget cut of its own, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://spacenews.com/hubble-budget-cuts-could-impact-science-and-mission-operations/"><u>according to SpaceNews</u></a>. And Chandra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/chandra-x-ray-observatory-nasa-fy2025-budget" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/chandra-x-ray-observatory-nasa-fy2025-budget"><u>is facing the end of its mission</u></a>, with NASA's 2025 budget request including plans to wind down operations, with its budget dropping from $41.1 million this year to just $5.2 million in 2029.</p><p>But unlike Hubble, which turns 35 this spring, and Chandra, which launched in 1999, Webb is in its prime, approaching the midpoint of a primary 10-year mission.

Its infrared optics have looked deep into the universe's past, observed distant galaxies and exoplanets, and even peered at our own local solar system planets closer to home.</p><p>"In a nutshell, it is truly fulfilling its promise," Macarena Garcia Marin, STScI's Webb project scientist, said during the same town hall event. "Across every field, JWST is truly delivering cutting-edge science."</p><p>Some of Webb's budget challenges stem from its operational costs, which were set "idealistically low" in 2011 when the observatory was saved from cancellation. Those costs, coupled with inflation rates that were much higher than expected and less flexibility in NASA's budget, have also contributed, Brown said.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/news-events/events/2025/_documents/0125-jwst-townhall-mission-status-brown.pdf"><u>presentation by Brown</u></a>, a 20% cut to Webb's operational budget would definitely affect how much science the telescope could perform. The impacts would be felt across teams that review proposals for observing targets, data analysis, observatory efficiencies, and anomaly resolution when something goes wrong, not to mention the need to engage with the scientific community and public on Webb's science results.</p><p>"It's a huge cut. That's not like kind of trying to nibble away at the edges," Brown told Space.com. "That impacts everything across the board, all the way up to how many modes we're offering to the observers."</p><p>Those impacts, Brown said, would likely be felt for the first time in October, when the next fiscal year begins.</p><p>Brown's comments at the Webb observatory town hall at AAS came just before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/we-will-pursue-our-manifest-destiny-into-the-stars-president-trump-wants-astronauts-to-raise-the-american-flag-on-mars" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/we-will-pursue-our-manifest-destiny-into-the-stars-president-trump-wants-astronauts-to-raise-the-american-flag-on-mars"><u>inauguration of President Donald Trump</u></a>, who in subsequent weeks created the Department of Government Efficiency headed by SpaceX CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/18849-elon-musk.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/18849-elon-musk.html"><u>Elon Musk</u></a> to reduce government spending.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) can offer assistance for coding. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of LLMs in practical coding contexts, Carlos et al. introduced the SWE-bench dataset, which comprises 2,294 real-world GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests, collected from 12 widely used Python repositories. Several impressive LLM-based toolkits recently are developed and evaluated on this dataset. However, a systematic evaluation of the quality of SWE-bench remains missing. In this paper, we addressed this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the SWE-bench dataset. We conducted a manual screening of instances where SWEAgent + GPT-4 successfully resolved issues by comparing the model-generated patches with the actual pull requests. SWE-Agent+GPT-4 was at the top of SWE-bench leaderboard during the time of our study. Our analysis reveals some critical issues with the SWE-bench dataset: 1) 32.67% of the successful patches involve cheating as the solutions were directly provided in the issue report or the comments. We refer to as solution leakage problem. 2) 31.08% of the passed patches are suspicious patches due to weak test cases, i.e., the tests were not adequate to verify the correctness of a patch. When we filtered out these problematic issues, the resolution rate of SWE-Agent+GPT-4 dropped from 12.47% to 3.97%. We also observed that the same data quality issues also exist in the two variants of SWE-bench, i.e., SWE-bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified. In addition, over 94% of the issues were created before LLM's knowledge cutoff dates, posing potential data leakage issues.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, startups have been taught to prioritize growth over everything else. Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">Paul Graham famously wrote about "ramen profitability"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks." Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next <em>great</em> engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p><strong>Raise on Your Own Terms </strong></p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Apple said it will issue additional guidance in the future to affected users and that it "does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/">UK government's demand</a> came through a "technical capability notice" under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), requiring Apple to create a backdoor that would allow British security officials to access encrypted user data globally. The order would have compromised Apple's Advanced Data Protection feature, which provides end-to-end encryption for iCloud data including Photos, Notes, Messages backups, and device backups.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple said in a statement. "ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices."</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple's decision to pull the feature rather than comply with the UK's demands is consistent with the company's previous statements that it would consider withdrawing encrypted services from the UK rather than compromise security. Apple has long opposed creating backdoors in its products, maintaining that such access points would inevitably be discovered by malicious actors.</p>

Additionally, the IPA makes it illegal for companies to disclose the existence of such government demands.</p>
<p>US security agencies, including the FBI and NSA, have been advocating for increased use of encryption to protect against Chinese cyber threats, creating potential conflicts between UK and US security interests.</p>
<p>"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before,” said Apple on Friday, per <em>Bloomberg</em>. The company added that it "remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom."</p>
<p>Note that the loss of Advanced Data Protection in the UK does not affect the existing end-to-end encryption of several other Apple features available in the country, including iMessage, FaceTime, password management and health data.</p>

<p>Imagine a computer is a garage. We can't put everything on the floor, so we buy ten shelves. Then we dedicate each one to an area of our life -- <code>life admin</code>, <code>home business</code>, and <code>tennis club</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-room-to-grow" id="user-content-fnref-room-to-grow" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

A SHELF FOR EACH MAJOR AREA OF OUR LIFE.</figcaption> </picture> 
<h3 id="step-2-add-some-boxes">Step 2: Add some boxes</h3>
<p>Each shelf has space for ten boxes, so we categorise what we want to store. In life admin we decide on five and label them: <code>me</code>, <code>house</code>, <code>money</code>, <code>online</code>, and <code>travel</code>. Our boxes have space for a number, so we add that too.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-startat11" id="user-content-fnref-startat11" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="step-3-file-your-stuff-in-folders">Step 3: File your stuff in folders</h3>
<p>We put our documents in manila folders. Each folder gets a number starting at <code>.11</code> so we can track them. In this case, we've put some insurance policies in <code>15.23 Travel insurance</code>. Then put the folder in a box.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-how-we-structure-our-file-system">This is how we structure our file system</h3>
<p>Let's return to our computer. The shelves have become our area folders. The boxes are category folders. And the manila folders are the IDs where we save our files.</p>

A NEAT FILE STRUCTURE WITH AREAS, CATEGORIES, AND IDS.</figcaption> </picture> 
<h2 id="benefits-of-the-johnnydecimal-id">Benefits of the Johnny.Decimal ID</h2>
<p>Each of our storage folders now has a number, the ID. It always has two digits, a decimal, and two digits. For example, <code>15.23</code> <code>22.11</code> <code>31.17</code>. This number is really useful.</p>
<h3 id="it-provides-structure">It provides structure</h3>
<p>The ID tells us exactly where a thing is. The numbers before the decimal are the item's category, and they define the structure of your system.</p>
<p>At a glance, you know what sort of thing the item contains. You'll be astonished at how many of your category numbers you remember.</p>
<h3 id="theyre-easy-to-communicate">They're easy to communicate</h3>
<p>They're short, memorable, and can be spoken out loud. Say it like "sixteen oh-two" or "thirty-one dot seventeen".</p>
<p>This is really handy when you want to tell someone (including your future self) where a thing is.</p>
<h3 id="things-stay-where-they-are">Things stay where they are</h3>
<p>If you use the alphabet to name folders, they move when a new one is created. So you never get a chance to develop muscle memory.</p>
<p>Numbers solve this problem. In the example above, <code>11 Me</code> comes before <code>12 House</code> because the folders sort by number. If we made a new folder, <code>16 Aardvark collection</code>, nothing would move.</p>
<h3 id="it-imposes-limits">It imposes limits</h3>
<p>The 'no more than ten' concept is at the heart of Johnny.Decimal.</p>
<p>When you start looking for something, you have no more than ten area folders to choose from. Select one and ignore the rest. Now you have no more than ten category folders to choose from. Repeat the process.</p>
<p>You then arrive in a folder with no more than one hundred IDs. If the ID was created recently it will have a higher number. If not, lower. And things created together, stick together. The alphabet isn't around to ruin the party.</p>

In the months between November 5 and January 20, members of DOGE including Steve Davis (president of Musk’s Boring Company) and the young engineer Luke Farritor were operating out of the company’s DC office, according to a source with knowledge.</p><p>The company did not respond to questions about whether these employees will retain their salaries and positions at the company during their time with DOGE. Many of the so-called department’s operatives have joined as “special government employees,” who are limited to working 130 days in a year. Last week <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/musk-krause-treasury-bfs-conflict-of-interest/">WIRED reported</a> that Tom Krause, a DOGE operative at the Treasury Department, would continue to maintain his position as CEO of the Cloud Software Group while also performing the duties of fiscal assistant secretary.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I still often find myself in discussions where the main focus is the choice of technologies.

<p>What truly makes a difference for users is your attention to the <strong>product</strong> and their <strong>needs</strong>.</p>
<p>Every programming language shines in specific contexts. Every framework is born to solve certain problems. But none of these technical decisions, in isolation, will define the success of your product from a user’s perspective.</p>

      A peer who downloads more data than they upload on torrenting networks is known as a "leech"  sucking up data without contributing to the swarm.

          <p>Just because Meta admitted to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">torrenting a dataset of pirated books for AI training</a> purposes, that doesn't necessarily mean that Meta seeded the file after downloading it, the social media company claimed in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kadrey-v-Meta-Reply-In-Support-of-Motion-to-Dismiss-2-20-25.pdf">court filing</a> this week.</p>
<p>Evidence instead shows that Meta "took precautions not to 'seed' any downloaded files," Meta's filing said. Seeding refers to sharing a torrented file after the download completes, and because there's allegedly no proof of such "seeding," Meta insisted that authors cannot prove Meta shared the pirated books with anyone during the torrenting process.</p>
<p>Whether or not Meta actually seeded the pirated books could make a difference in a copyright lawsuit from book authors including Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. Authors had previously alleged that Meta unlawfully copied and distributed their works through AI outputs—an increasingly common complaint that so far has barely been litigated. But Meta's admission to torrenting appears to add a more straightforward claim of unlawful distribution of copyrighted works through illegal torrenting, which has long been considered established case-law.</p>
<p>Authors have <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.426.0.pdf">alleged</a> that "Meta deliberately engaged in one of the largest data piracy campaigns in history to acquire text data for its LLM training datasets, torrenting and sharing dozens of terabytes of pirated data that altogether contain many millions of copyrighted works." Separate from their copyright infringement claims opposing Meta's AI training on pirated copies of their books, authors alleged that Meta torrenting the dataset was "independently illegal" under California's Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA), which allegedly "prevents the unauthorized taking of data, including copyrighted works."</p>
<p>Meta, however, is hoping to convince the court that torrenting is not in and of itself illegal, but is, rather, a "widely-used protocol to download large files." According to Meta, the decision to download the pirated books dataset from pirate libraries like LibGen and Z-Library was simply a move to access "data from a 'well-known online repository' that was publicly available via torrents."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To defend its torrenting, Meta has basically scrubbed the word "pirate" from the characterization of its activity. The company alleges that authors can't claim that Meta gained unauthorized access to their data under CDAFA. Instead, all they can claim is that "Meta allegedly accessed and downloaded datasets that Plaintiffs did not create, containing the text of published books that anyone can read in a public library, from public websites Plaintiffs do not operate or own."</p>
<p>While Meta may claim there's no evidence of seeding, there is some testimony that might be compelling to the court. Previously, a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, had <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.8.pdf">testified</a> that Meta allegedly modified torrenting settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," which seems to support authors' claims that some seeding occurred. And an internal <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.415175/gov.uscourts.cand.415175.417.9.pdf">message</a> from Meta researcher Frank Zhang appeared to show that Meta allegedly tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers. Once this information came to light, authors asked the court for a chance to depose Meta executives again, alleging that new facts "contradict prior deposition testimony."</p>
<h2>Torrenting terminology may confuse court</h2>
<p>How successful Meta's torrenting defense will be is still up in the air, but authors pointed out that even if Meta somehow managed to avoid seeding any of the torrented books, the social media giant still participated in an "online piracy ring." Further, in a footnote, the authors told the court that "IP pirates like Meta also upload or share files with others during (leeching) and after (seeding) downloading." Additionally, TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/meta-says-it-made-sure-not-to-seed-any-pirated-books/">noted</a> that Meta "taking precautions is not the same as preventing" seeding.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Authors will likely push to persuade the court that merely by torrenting the file, Meta made "pirated works available to other users worldwide" while making it clear that even Meta can't claim to have prevented all seeding. A lawyer representing the authors declined to comment on whether ongoing discovery may surface more evidence to help prove the seeding claims. Lack of evidence could be a problem since TorrentFreak suggested the torrenting terminology may be foreign to the court, potentially muddying what authors feel otherwise is a straightforward claim that Meta allegedly knew it was violating laws by torrenting the pirated books.</p>
<p>Meta has been silent so far on claims about sharing data while "leeching" (downloading) but told the court it plans to fight the seeding claims at summary judgment.</p>
<p>At this time, Meta has moved to dismiss the authors' CDAFA claim as being preempted by copyright law, but unsurprisingly, the authors told the court that they strongly disagree.</p>
<p>"Had Meta bought Plaintiffs’ works in a bookstore or borrowed them from a library and then trained its LLMs on them without a license, it would have committed copyright infringement, but no CDAFA violation," the authors alleged. "Meta’s decision to bypass lawful acquisition methods and become a knowing participant in an illegal peer-to-peer piracy network provides the 'extra element' and is 'qualitatively different' to establish an independent CDAFA violation."</p>
<p>Authors further linked the CDAFA claim to their copyright infringement claim opposing Meta's AI training. They alleged that by torrenting their works "from pirated databases in lieu of executing lawful licensing arrangements, Meta not only deprived Plaintiffs of that licensing revenue, but it also deprived Plaintiffs of additional revenue they could have generated from 'other users worldwide' because Meta simultaneously made the copyrighted works available to download by any interested Internet user in the process of acquiring Plaintiffs’ data" to train AI.</p>
<p>Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment.</p>

</span><strong>Note</strong></p><p>The Docker Hub plan limits will take effect on March 1, 2025. No charges on
Docker Hub pulls or storage will be incurred between December 10, 2024,
and February 28, 2025.</p></blockquote><p>When using Docker Hub, unauthenticated and Docker Personal users are subject to
strict limits. In contrast, Docker Pro, Team, and Business users benefit from a
consumption-based model with a base amount of included usage. This included
usage is not a hard limit; users can scale or upgrade their subscriptions to
receive additional usage or use on-demand usage.</p><p>The following table provides an overview of the included usage and limits for each
user type, subject to fair use:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>User type</th><th>Pulls per month</th><th>Pull rate limit per hour</th><th>Public repositories</th><th>Public repository storage</th><th>Private repositories</th><th>Private repository storage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Business (authenticated)</td><td>1M</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Up to 500 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Team (authenticated)</td><td>100K</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Up to 50 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Pro (authenticated)</td><td>25K</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Up to 5 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Personal (authenticated)</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>40</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Up to 1</td><td>Up to 2 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Unauthenticated users</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>10 per IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 subnet</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For more details, see the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/pulls/">Pull usage and limits</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/storage/">Storage usage and limits</a></li></ul><p>When utilizing the Docker Platform, users should be aware that excessive data
transfer, pull rates, or data storage can lead to throttling, or additional
charges. To ensure fair resource usage and maintain service quality, we reserve
the right to impose restrictions or apply additional charges to accounts
exhibiting excessive data and storage consumption.</p><h3 id="abuse-rate-limit"><a href="#abuse-rate-limit">Abuse rate limit</a></h3><p>Docker Hub has an abuse rate limit to protect the application and
infrastructure. This limit applies to all requests to Hub properties including
web pages, APIs, and image pulls. The limit is applied per IPv4 address or per
IPv6 /64 subnet, and while the limit changes over time depending on load and
other factors, it's in the order of thousands of requests per minute. The abuse
limit applies to all users equally regardless of account level.</p><p>You can differentiate between the pull rate limit and abuse rate limit by
looking at the error code. The abuse limit returns a simple <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response. The pull limit returns a longer error message that includes
a link to documentation.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>This week, I was thrilled to read about <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252840-collusion-rings-threaten-the-integrity-of-computer-science-research/fulltext#FNA">the first well-documented case of explicit academic fraud in the artificial intelligence community</a>.
I hope that this is the beginning of a trend, and that other researchers will be inspired by their example and follow up by engaging in even more blatant forms of fraud in the future.</p>

<p>Explicit academic fraud is, of course, the natural extension of the sort of mundane, day-to-day fraud that most academics in our community commit on a regular basis.
Trying that shiny new algorithm out on a couple dozen seeds, and then only reporting the best few.
Running a big hyperparameter sweep on your proposed approach but using the defaults for the baseline.
Cherry-picking examples where your model looks good, or cherry-picking whole datasets to test on, where you’ve confirmed your model’s advantage.
Making up new problem settings, new datasets, new objectives in order to claim victory on an empty playing field.
Proclaiming that your work is a “promising first step” in your introduction, despite being fully aware that nobody will ever build on it.
Submitting a paper to a conference because it’s got a decent shot at acceptance and you don’t want the time you spent on it go to waste, even though you’ve since realized that the core ideas aren’t quite correct.</p>

<p>The problem with this sort of low-key fraud is that it’s insidious, it’s subtle.
In many ways, a fraudulent action is indistinguishable from a simple mistake.
There is plausible deniability – oh, I simply forgot to include those seeds, I didn’t have enough compute for those other ablations, I didn’t manage to catch that bug.
It’s difficult to bring ourselves to punish a well-meaning grad student for something that could plausibly have been a simple mistake, so we let these things slide, and slide and slide until they have become normalized.
When standards are low, it’s to no individual’s advantage to hold themselves to a higher bar.
Newcomers to the field see these things, they learn, and they imitate.
Often, they are directly encouraged by mentors.
A graduate student who publishes three papers a year is every professor’s dream, so strategies for maximal paper output become lab culture.
And when virtually every lab endorses certain behaviors, they become integral to the research standards of the field.</p>

<p>But worst of all: because everybody is complicit in this subtle fraud, nobody is willing to acknowledge its existence.
Who would be such a hypocrite as to condemn in others, behaviors they can see clearly in themselves?
And yet, who is willing to undermine their own achievements by admitting that their own work does not have scientific value?<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
The sad result is that, as a community, we have developed a collective blind-spot around a depressing reality: even at top conferences, the median published paper contains no truth or insight.
Any attempts to highlight or remedy the situation are met with harsh resistance from those who benefit from the current state of affairs.
The devil himself could not have designed a better impediment to humanity’s progression.</p>

<p>But now that blatant academic fraud is in the mix, the AI community has a fighting chance.
By partaking in a form of fraud that has left the Overton window of acceptability, the researchers in the collusion ring have finally succeeded in forcing the community to acknowledge its blind spot.
For the first time, researchers reading conference proceedings will be forced to wonder: does this work truly merit my attention?
Or is its publication simply the result of fraud?</p>

<p>It would, of course, be quite difficult to actually distinguish the papers published fraudlently from the those published “legitimately”.
(That fact alone tells you all you really need to know about the current state of AI research.)
But the mere <em>possibility</em> that any given paper was published through fraud forces people to engage more skeptically with <em>all</em> published work.
Readers are forced to act more like reviewers, weighing the evidence presented against their priors, attempting to identify ways in which surprising conclusions could be the result of fraud – explicit or subtle – rather than fact.
People will apply additional scrutiny to deal with explicit forms of fraud like collusion rings, but in doing so will also develop a sensitivity to the more subtle forms of fraud that are already endemic to the community.
This will, in turn, put pressure on authors to produce work which can withstand such scrutiny; results obtained without any fraud at all, leading to publications with genuine scientific merit.</p>

<p>That same harsh light is also cast on ourselves, on our motivations.
This situation seems to have evoked in many researchers feelings of empathy.
These actions are understandable; such an occurrence was inevitable; everyone does this, just more discreetly.
We are not surprised that people behave unscientifically in order to get their papers published; we are surprised that someone was willing to take it this far.
The most notable thing about the collusion ring is not that it was more fraudulent than is typical, but that the fraud was more <em>intentional</em>.</p>

<p>This surfaces the fundamental tension between good science and career progression buried deep at the heart of academia.
Most researchers are to some extent “career researchers”, motivated by the power and prestige that rewards those who excel in the academic system, rather than idealistic pursuit of scientific truth.
Well-respected senior figures are no exception to this. (In fact, due to selection effects, I suspect most are actually <em>more</em> career-motivated than is typical.)
We must come to terms with the fact that, since the incentives for career progression are not perfectly aligned with good science, almost any action motivated by career progression will interfere with one’s ability to do good science.
We must encourage a norm of introspection, of probing one’s own motivations, where any decisions made to obtain science-adjacent benefits are viewed with the deepest suspicion.
And we must ensure that explicit suggestions to modify one’s science in the service of one’s career – “you need to do X to be published”, “you need to publish Y to graduate”, “you need to avoid criticizing Z to get hired” – carry social penalties as severe as a suggestion of plagiarism or fraud.</p>

<hr>

<p>Prof. Littman says that collusion rings threaten the integrity of computer science research.
I agree with him.
<em>And I am looking forward to the day they make good on that threat.</em>
Undermining the credibility of computer science research is the best possible outcome for the field, since the institution in its current form does not deserve the credibility that it has.
Widespread fraud would force us to re-strengthen our community’s academic norms, transforming the way we do research, and improving our collective ability to progress humanity’s knowledge.</p>

<p>So this is a call to action: <strong>please commit more academic fraud</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Blatant</em> fraud.
<em>Aggressive</em> fraud.
Form more collusion rings!
Blackmail your reviewers, bribe your ACs!
Fudge your results – or fabricate them entirely!
(But don’t skimp on the writing: your paper needs to be written in perfect academic English, formatted nicely, and tell an intuitive, plausible-sounding story.)
Let’s make explicit academic fraud commonplace enough to cast doubt into the minds of every scientist reading an AI paper.
Overall, science will benefit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Together, we can force the community to reckon with its own shortcomings, and develop stronger, better, and more scientific norms.
It is a harsh treatment, to be sure – a chemotherapy regimen that risks destroying us entirely.
But this is our best shot at destroying the cancer that has infected our community.
I believe with all my heart that we can make it through this challenge and emerge stronger than ever.
And when we do, the secrets to artificial intelligence will be waiting.</p>

    <p>This post is the second in a series. Read <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">part one here</a>.</p>


<p><i>“From a mathematics and trajectory standpoint and with a certain kind of technology, there’s not too many different ways to go to Mars.  It’s been pretty well figured out. You can adjust the decimal places here and there, but basically if you're talking about chemical rockets, there's a certain way you're going to go to Mars.” - John Aaron<a href="#aaron" name="fn_aaron"><sup>[1]</sup></a> </i>


</p><p>Unlike the Moon, which hangs in the sky like a lonely grandparent waiting for someone to visit, Mars leads a rich orbital life of its own and is not always around to entertain the itinerant astronaut. There is just one brief window every 26 months when travel between our two planets is feasible, and this constraint of orbital mechanics is so fundamental that we’ve known since Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic what a mission to Mars must look like.<a href="#early_mars" name="fn_early_mars"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

</p><p>Using chemical rockets, there are just two classes of mission to choose from: (The durations I give here can vary, but are representative).



</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/mars_mission_types.png">

</p><ul>
<li><b>Long Stay</b>: Spend six months flying to Mars, stay for 17 months, spend six months flying back  (~1000 days total).  This is sometimes called a conjunction class mission.  This profile trades a simple out-and-back trajectory for a long stay time at Mars. </li>

<li><b>Short Stay</b>: Spend six months flying to Mars, stay for 30-90 days, spend 400 days flying back (~650 days total).  This is also called an opposition class mission. This profile trades a short Martian stay time for a long and frankly terrifying trip home through the inner solar system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before comparing the merits of each, it’s worth stressing what they have in common—both are <i>long</i>, more than double the absolute record for space flight (438 days), five times longer than anyone has remained in space without resupply (128 days), and about ten times humanity’s accumulated time beyond low Earth orbit (82 days).<a href="#durations" name="fn_durations"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  It is this inconvenient length, more than any technical obstacle, that has kept us from going to Mars since rockets capable of making the trip first became available in the 1960's. <a href="#first_rockets" name="fn_first_rockets"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

</p><p>And because this length is set by the relative motions of the planets, it’s resistant to attack by technology.   You can build rockets that go faster, but unless you make <i>Mars</i> go faster, you’ll mostly end up trading transit time for longer stay times.  Getting a round trip below the 500 day mark requires fundamental breakthroughs in either propulsion or refueling. <a href="#breakthroughs" name="fn_breakthroughs"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/trades_delta_v.png">

</p><p>Delta-v requirements for short stay missions of varying length (left) and a long-stay mission (orange line right) for comparison. Note the sharp jump at around 500 days. <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20150001240/downloads/20150001240.pdf">source</a>. 

</p><p>
That’s the bad news. The good news is that these constraints are so strong that we can say a lot about going to Mars without committing to any particular spacecraft or mission design.  Just like animals that live in the sea are likely to have good hearing and a streamlined body shape, there are things that have to hold true for any Mars-bound spacecraft, just from the nature of the problem.


<br>


</p><h2>I. No escape, no rescue</h2>

<p>A trip to Mars will be commital in a way that has no precedent in human space flight.  The moon landings were designed so that any moment the crew could hit the red button and return expeditiously to Earth; engineers spent the brief windows of time when an abort was infeasible chain smoking and chewing on their slide rules. <a href="#apollo_abort" name="fn_apollo_abort"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

</p><p>But within a few days of launch, a Mars-bound crew will have committed to spending years in space with no hope of resupply or rescue.  If something goes wrong, the only alternative to completing the mission will be to divert into a long, looping orbit that gets the spacecraft home about two years after departure.<a href="#mars_abort" name="fn_mars_abort"><sup>[7]</sup></a>   And if they get stuck on Mars, astronauts will find themselves in a similar position to the early Antarctic explorers, able to communicate home by radio, but forced by unalterable cycles of nature to wait months or years for a rescue ship. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/mars_abort_types.png">

</p><p>Delta-v in km/sec required to return to Earth in 50, 70, and 90 days from various points in a long-stay Mars mission. Values above 10 km/sec are not realistic at our current technology level. <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/43238?show=full">source</a></p>

<p>The effect of this no-abort condition is to make Mars mission design acutely risk-averse. You can think of flying to Mars like one of those art films where the director has to shoot the movie in a single take. Even if no scene is especially challenging, the requirement that everything go right sequentially, with no way to pause or reshoot, means that even small risks become unacceptable in the aggregate. 

</p><p>To get a feel for this effect, consider a toy model where we fly to Mars on a 30 month mission.  Every month there is a 3% chance that a critical system on our spacecraft will fail, and once that happens, the spacecraft enters a degraded state, with a 5% chance every month that a subsequent failure kills the crew. 

</p><p>In this model,  the probability that the crew gets home safely works out to 68%.  But if we add an abort option that can get them home in six months, that probability jumps to 85%.  And with a three month abort trajectory, the odds of safe return go up to 92%. 

</p><p>These odds are notional, but they demonstrate how big an effect the absence of abort options can have on safety.<a href="#abort_code" name="fn_abort_code"><sup>[8]</sup></a> 

</p><p>This necessary risk aversion introduces a tension into any Mars program. What’s the point of spending a trillion dollars to send a crew if they’re going to cower inside their spacecraft?  And yet since going outside is one of the most dangerous things you can do on Mars, early missions have to minimize it. The first visitors to Mars will have to land in the safest possible location and do almost nothing. 


</p><p>Risk is closely tied with the next issue, reliability.



</p><h2>II. Reliability</h2> 

<p>The closest thing humanity has built to a Mars-bound spacecraft is the International Space Station.  But ‘reliable’ is not the first word that leaps to the lips of ISS engineers when they talk about their creation—not even the first printable word. Despite twenty years of effort, equipment on the station breaks constantly, and depends on a stream of replacement parts flown up from Earth.<a href="#iss_failures" name="fn_iss_failures"><sup>[9]</sup></a> 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/heat_exchanger.jpg">

</p><p>A defective heat exchanger packaged for return to Earth from ISS in 2023</p>

<p>Going to Mars will require order of magnitude reliability improvements over the status quo. Systems on the spacecraft will need to work without breaking, or at least break in ways the crew can fix.  If there’s an emergency, like a chemical leak or a fire, the crew must be able to live for years in whatever’s left of the ship.  And the kind of glitches that made for funny stories in low Earth orbit (like a <a href="https://idlewords.com/urine_icicle.htm">urine icicle blocking the Space Shuttle toilet</a>) will be enough to kill a Mars-bound crew.

</p><p>Complicating matters is that traditional reliability engineering practices don’t work in life support, where everything is interconnected, often through the bodies of the crew.  Life support engineering is much more like keeping a marine aquarium than it is like building a rocket. It’s not easy to untangle cause from effect, the entire system evolves over time, and there’s a lot of “spooky action at a distance” between subsystems that were supposed to be unrelated.<a href="#urine_calcium" name="fn_urine_calcium"><sup>[10]</sup></a>  Indeed, failures in life support have a tendency to wander the spacecraft until they find the most irreplaceable thing to break.

</p><p>Nor is it possible to brute-force things by filling the spacecraft with spare parts. The same systemic interactions that damage one component can eat through any number of replacements. The bedrock axiom of reliability engineering—that complex designs can be partitioned into isolated subsystems with independent failure rates—does not hold for regenerative life support.

</p><p>The need for long and expensive test flights to validate life support introduces another kind of risk aversion, this time in the design phase.  With prototypes needing to be flown for years in space, there will be pressure to freeze the life support design at whatever point it becomes barely adequate, and no amount of later innovation will make it onto the spacecraft.  

</p><p>This is a similar dynamic to one that afflicted the Space Shuttle, a groundbreaking initial design so expensive to modify that it froze the underlying technology at the prototype phase for thirty years.  In that period we learned nothing about making better space planes, but burned through decades and billions of dollars patching up the first working prototype.
 
</p><p>Such timorousness goes against the grain of a development strategy that proven spectacularly successful in recent years for SpaceX, an approach you could call “fly often and try everything”.  With hardware to spare, SpaceX is not afraid to make wholesale changes between tests of its Starship rocket, relying on rapid iterations to advance the state of the art at an exhilarating pace.

</p><p>But this Yosemite Sam approach to testing won’t work for Mars. It only takes a few hours for engineers to collect the data they need after a Starship launch, while test runs of Mars-bound systems will last for years.  The inevitable outcome is a development program that looks an awful lot like NASA, with long periods of fussing and analysis punctuated by infrequent, hideously expensive test flights. 

</p><h2>III. Autonomy</h2>

<p>Autonomy is a concept alien to NASA, which has been micromanaging astronauts from the ground since the first Mercury astronaut had to <a href="https://idlewords.com/shepard_pee.htm">beg controllers for  permission to pee</a> (the request went all the way up the reporting chain to Wernher Von Braun).  

</p><p>To this day, missions follow a test pilot paradigm where the crew works from detailed checklists prepared for them months or years in advance.  On the space station, this takes the form of a graphical schedule creeping past a red vertical line on a laptop screen, with astronauts expected to keep pace with the moving colored boxes.  Most routine work on the space station (like pumping water or managing waste heat) is relegated to specialized teams on the ground and is not even visible to the crew. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/shepard_in_space.jpg" width="600">

</p><p>Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7, explaining that he really has to go pretty bad.</p> 

<p>But as a Mars-bound spacecraft gets further from Earth, the round-trip communications delay with ground control will build to a maximum of 43 minutes, culminating in a week or more of communications blackout when the Sun is directly between the two planets.  This physical constraint means that  the crew has to have full control over every system on the spacecraft, without help from the ground.

</p><p>Autonomy sounds like a good thing! Who wants government bean-counters deciding how astronauts spend their space time? But the ground-driven paradigm has its advantages, most notably in limiting workload. The ISS is run by a staff of hundreds who together send some 50,000 commands per day to the station. The seven astronauts on board are only called in as a last resort, and even so the demands on their time are so great that the station has struggled to perform its scientific mission.<a href="#iss_workload" name="fn_iss_workload"><sup>[11]</sup></a>

</p><p>One benefit of NASA’s backseat driving has always been that in an emergency, the crew has access to unlimited real-time expert help on Earth. The starkest illustration of this came on Apollo 13, when an oxygen tank in the service module ruptured 56 hours into the flight.  It took the crew and mission controllers nearly an hour to get their bearings, at which point there was only a short window of time left to power down the spacecraft in a way that would preserve their ability to return to Earth.  

</p><p>A <a href="https://idlewords.com/apollo_13_annotated.htm">transcript of that first hour</a> shows how difficult it was for crew and ground to figure out what was happening, and prioritize their response. It casts no aspersions on the crew of Apollo 13 to say they could not have survived a Mars-like communications delay.  

</p><p>And while this mission is the most famous example of ground controllers backstopping an Apollo crew, there were at least five more occasions in the Apollo program when timely help from the ground averted serious trouble:

</p><ul>
<li>Apollo 12 was hit twice by lightning after launch, scrambling the electrical system and lighting up the command module with warning lights. Flight controller John Aaron recognized the baffling error pattern and passed into NASA legend by telling the crew to flip an obscure switch that restored sanity to their displays.</li> 

<li>On Apollo 14, the descent radar on the lunar module failed to lock on properly, returning spurious range data. Without a timely call from ground control (who told the pilot to reset a breaker), the problem would likely have led to an aborted landing. </li>

<li>On Apollo 15, the crew struggled to contain a water leak that threatened to become serious. After fifteen minutes, engineers on the ground were able to trace the problem to a pre-launch incident with a chlorination valve and relay up a procedure that solved the problem.</li>

<li>Also on Apollo 15, a sliver of loose metal floating in a switch caused an intermittent abort signal to be sent to the lunar module engine.  Suppressing the signal so the lunar module could descend safely required reprogramming the onboard computer in a procedure guaranteed to raise the hairs on the head of every modern software developer.</li>

<li>On Apollo 16, a pair of servo motors on the service module failed in lunar orbit. Mission rules called for an abort, but after some interactive debugging with the command module pilot, ground controllers found a workaround they judged safe enough to continue with the landing.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these incidents stand out, Apollo transcripts reveal numberless other examples of crew and ground working closely to get on top of problems. The loss of this real-time help is a real risk magnifier for astronauts going to Mars. 

</p><h2>IV. Analysis</h2>

<p>Another way in which the ISS depends on Earth is for laboratory analysis of air and water samples, which are collected on a regular schedule and sent down with each returning capsule. The tests that can be performed on the station itself are rudimentary, alerting crew to the presence of microbes or contaminants, but without the detailed information necessary to trace a root cause.

</p><p>For Mars, this analytic capability will have to move into the spacecraft. In essence, this means building a kind of Space Theranos, an automated black box that can perform biochemical assays in space without requiring repair or calibration. Such an instrument doesn’t exist anywhere, but a Mars mission requires two flavors of it—one that works in zero G, and another for Martian gravity.<a href="#theranos" name="fn_theranos"><sup>[12]</sup></a> 

</p><p>This black box belongs to a category of hardware that pops up a lot in Mars plans: technologies that would be multibillion dollar industries if they  existed on Earth, but are assumed to be easy enough to invent when the time comes to put them on a Mars-bound spacecraft.  <a href="#magic_tech" name="fn_magic_tech"><sup>[13]</sup></a>

</p><p>Some Mars boosters even cite these technologies as examples of the benefits going to Mars will bring to humanity.  But this gets things exactly backwards—problems that are hard on Earth don’t get easier by firing them into space, and the fact that nonexistent technologies are on the critical path to Mars is not an argument for going there.

</p><h2>V. Automation </h2>

<p>The requirement that the crew be able to handle the ship when some members are incapacitated and there is no communication with Earth means that an ISS-size workload has to be automated to the point where it can be run by two or three astronauts. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/cimon_gerst.jpg">

</p><p>Astronaut Alexander Gerst (right) interacting with CIMON, NASA's $6 million AI chatbot</p>

<p>Automation means software, and lots of it.  To automate the systems on a Mars-bound spacecraft will be a monumental task, like trying to extend the autopilot on an airliner to make it run the airport concession stands, baggage claim, and airline pension plan.  The likely outcome is an ISS-like hotchpotch of software tested to different levels of rigor, running across hundreds of processors. But this hardware will be exposed to a far harsher radiation environment than systems on the ISS, making software design and integration a particular challenge.

</p><p>A special case of the automation problem comes up on long-stay missions, when  the orbiting spacecraft has to keep itself free of mold, fungus, and space raccoons for the year and a half that the crew are on the Martian surface. Anyone who owns a vacation home knows that this problem—called “quiescence” in the Mars literature—is already hard to solve on Earth. 

</p><p>Unless carefully managed, the interplay between automation, complexity and reliability can enter a pathological spiral.   Adding software to a system makes it more complex. To stay reliable, complex systems have to degrade gracefully, so that the whole continues to function even if an individual component fails. But these degraded modes, as well as unexpected interactions between them, introduce their own complexity, which then has to be managed with software, and so on. 

</p><p>The upshot is that automation introduces its own, separate reason for running full-length mock missions before actually going to Mars. There will be too many bugs in a system this complex to leave them all for the first Mars-bound crew to discover.

</p><h2>Implications </h2>

<p>The extreme requirements for autonomy, reliability, and automation I’ve outlined are old news to designers of deep-space probes. The solar system is full of hardware beeping serenely away decades after launch, most spectacularly the forty-six-year-old Voyager spacecraft. 

</p><p>But  no one has ever tried attaching a box of large primates to a deep space probe with the goal of keeping them alive, happy, and not tweeting about how NASA sent them into the vast empty spaces to die.  A Mars-bound spacecraft will be the most complicated human artifact ever built, about a hundred times bigger than any previous space probe, and inside it will be a tightly-coupled system of software, hardware, bacteria, fungi, astronauts, and (for half the mission) whatever stuff the crew tracks with them back onto the spacecraft.

</p><p>Designing such a machine means taking something at the ragged edge of human ability (building interplanetary probes) and combining it with something that we can’t even do yet on Earth (keep a group of six or eight humans alive for years with regenerative life support).<a href="#biosphere2" name="fn_biosphere2"><sup>[14]</sup></a>  

</p><p>My argument is not that it is impossible to do this, but that it is impossible to do it quickly.  Preparing for Mars will be an iterative, open-ended undertaking in which every round of testing eats up years of time and most of our space budget, like Artemis and the ISS before it.  The first decade of a Mars program will be indistinguishable from the last forty years of space flight—a series of repetitive, long-duration missions to orbit. The only thing NASA will need to change is the program name. 

</p><p>Nor is this a problem that can be delegated to billionaire hobbyists. Life support is going to be a grind no matter whose logo is on the rocket.  The sky could be thick with Starships and we’d still be stuck doing all-up trials of hardware and software on these multi-year missions to nowhere.  

</p><p>The only way to explore Mars in our lifetime is to ditch the requirement that people accompany the machinery.

</p><h2>Choosing a profile</h2> 

<p>But since we’re determined to go to Mars, and have two profiles to choose from, which one is better? 

</p><p>Everyone agrees that only the long-stay profile makes sense for exploration. There’s no point in spending 95% of the trip in transit just to get a rushed couple of weeks at the destination. 

</p><p>But on early missions, where the goal is just to get the crew home alive, the choice is tricky.

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/long_stay.png">


</p><h2>Long Stay</h2>

<p>The virtue of the long stay profile is simplicity. You fly your rocket to Mars, wait 17 months for the planets to align, and then fly the same trajectory home.  Each leg of this transfer journey lasts about as long as an ISS deployment, and it’s possible to tweak the transfer time by burning more fuel (although the crew then has to stay longer on Mars to compensate). 

</p><p>At every point in the mission, the ship remains between 1 AU and 1.5 AU from the Sun. This simplifies thermal and solar panel design and greatly reduces the risk to the crew from solar storms.  

</p><p>But the problem of what to do with all that time on Mars is vexing.  500 days is a long time for a first stay anywhere, even someplace with nightlife and an atmosphere.   And as we’ll see, an orbital mission is probably out of the question.  The requirement that the crew go live on Mars on their first visit adds enormously to the level of risk. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/short_stay.png">

</p><h2>Short Stay</h2>

<p>The appeal of the short stay profile is right in the name. Instead of staying on Mars so long they have to file taxes, the first arrivals can plant the flag, grab whatever rock is nearest the ladder, and get the hell out of there.  Or they can choose to skip the landing and make the first trip strictly orbital, following a tradition in aerospace engineering of attempting the impossible sequentially instead of all at once.

</p><p>But the problem with the short stay profile is that trip home. The return trajectory cuts well inside the orbit of Venus, complicating the design of the spacecraft and adding spectacular ways for the crew to die during the weeks near perihelion. For most of that journey, the ship is on the wrong side of the Sun, hampering communications with Earth while leaving the crew with no warning of solar storms.

</p><p>And that crew has to spend two consecutive years in deep space, maximizing their exposure to radiation and microgravity, the biggest known risks to astronaut health. 

</p><p>The short stay profile also requires more propellant, in some years a prohibitive amount. If your strategy for mitigating risk on Mars is to launch crews during every synodic period, so that there are always potential rescuers en route to Mars, then this is a problem.  
￼

</p><p>A diagram comparing the delta-v requirements for short stay and long stay missions across future launch dates. Since propellant requirements go up exponentially with delta v, a mission in 2041 requires five times as much propellant as one in 2033. <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20130010385/downloads/20130010385.pdf">source</a>“
</p>

<h2>Orbit or Land?</h2> 

<p>Once you’ve picked a profile, the other decision to make is whether to land the spacecraft. 

</p><p>Obviously you have to land a crew at some point; if you don’t, the other space programs will make fun of you, and there will be hurtful zingers at your Congressional hearing. 

</p><p>But since surviving a trip to Mars requires tackling a sequence of unrelated problems (arrival, entry, landing, surface operations, ascent, rendezvous), there is a case for cutting the problem in half by making the first mission orbital. This was the approach taken by the Apollo program, which looped the first crew around the Moon before a working lunar lander existed.

</p><p>Not having to carry a lander on the first mission means more room for spare parts and consumables, which improves the margin of safety for the crew.  It also buys time for engineers to work on the hard problems of entry, landing, quiescence, and ascent without holding back the entire program. 

</p><p>But there are powerful arguments against an orbital mission. Since so much of the risk in going to Mars is a simple function of time, why roll the dice more than necessary? And given the expense and physical toll on crew,  how do you justify not attempting a landing?  Imagine driving to Disneyland, turning the car around in the parking lot, and announcing to your family that you’re now ready for the real trip next year.  There will be angry kicking from the backseat, and mutiny.  
 
</p><p>NASA has waffled for years over which option to choose.  In the 2009 design reference architecture, they favored sending a crew of four on the long stay trajectory.  Their more recent plans envision a shoestring mission on a short-stay profile with four crew members, two of whom attempt a landing. 

</p><p>Elon Musk, for his part, has proposed solving the problem in stages, sending volunteers to settle Mars first, then figuring out how to get them home later.<a href="#spacex_plan" name="fn_spacex_plan"><sup>[15]</sup></a>   

</p><p>What makes the choice genuinely hard is that we lack answers to two key questions:

</p><p><b>1. How does the human body respond to partial gravity?</b>

</p><p>Decades in space have given us a good idea of what prolonged periods in free-fall do to astronauts, and how they recover after returning to Earth.   But we have no idea what happens in partial gravity, either on the Moon (0.16 g) or on Mars (0.38 g). In particular, we don’t know whether Martian gravity is strong enough to arrest or slow the degenerative processes that we observe in free fall.<a href="#deconditioning" name="fn_deconditioning"><sup>[16]</sup></a>  

</p><p>The answer to this question will drive a key decision: whether or not to spin the spacecraft. As we’ll see, spinning a spacecraft to create artificial gravity is an enormous hassle, but whether it’s avoidable depends on the unstudied effects of long stays in partial gravity.<a href="#partial_g" name="fn_partial_g"><sup>[17]</sup></a> 

</p><p><b>2. What is the risk to the crew from the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation?</b>

</p><p>Radiation in space comes in many varieties, most of which are well-understood from experience with their analogues on Earth.  

</p><p>Low-dose heavy-ion radiation, however, is different.  It doesn’t exist outside of particle accelerators on Earth and is hard to study in low orbit, where both the magnetosphere and the bulk of our planet shield astronauts from most of the flux they’d experience in free space.  

</p><p>Heavy ion radiation has biological effects that are not captured by the standard model of radiation damage to tissue. In particular, there is a class of phenomena called non-targeted effects (NTEs) that are known to damage cells far from the radiation track. This is a weird effect, like if found yourself hospitalized because your neighbor got hit by a car.  It’s believed that NTEs disrupt epigenetic signaling mechanisms in cells, but the phenomenon is poorly understood.

</p><p>Uncertainty about the effects of low-dose heavy ion radiation widens our best guess at radiation risk by at least a factor of two.<a href="#radiation_uncertainty"><sup>[18]</sup></a> At the low end of the range, these effects are just a curiosity, and Mars missions can be planned using traditional models of radiation exposure. At the high end of the range, long-duration orbital missions may not be survivable, and astronauts on the Martian surface will either have to live in a cave or cover their shelter with meters of soil.

</p><p>Prediction of tumor prevalence after 1 year of galactic cosmic radiation exposure. The solid line at bottom shows the standard radiation model (TE). The dotted lines show the influence of non-targeted effects (NTE) under different assumptions. Note the nearly threefold uncertainty in predicted tumor prevalence in the unshielded case. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28500351/">source</a>

</p><p>This uncertainty about biological effects makes radiation the greatest uncharacterized known risk facing a Mars-bound crew, and it affects every aspect of mission design. 

</p><p>It’s helpful to combine the three main risk factors in going to Mars into one big chart:

￼
<table>
<caption>Technical Risk</caption>

<tbody><tr><th></th><th>Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>
<tr><td>Short Stay</td>
<td>Spacecraft trajectory complicates spacecraft design, communications are a challenge.</td>
<td>Requires working lander and ascent stage, less margin than orbital mission.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long Stay</td>
<td>Lowest complexity, large mass budget for spares and consumables. </td>
<td>Highest complexity, all-up mission must work on the first try.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<table>
<caption>Radiation Risk</caption>
<tbody><tr><th></th><th>Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>
<tr><td>Short Stay</td>
<td colspan="2">600 days in deep space, return trip requires close solar approach (0.7 AU).  Risk from solar particle events may require flying near solar minimum, incurring higher GCR dose.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long Stay</td>
<td>Risk of death or incapacitation from heavy ion component of GCR may exceed 50%
</td>
<td>Lowest radiation exposure, but adequately shielding the habitat on Mars increases complexity and contamination risk 
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<table>
<caption>Deconditioning Risk</caption>
<tbody><tr><th></th><th>Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>
<tr><td>Short Stay</td>
<td colspan="2">1.5 times beyond human endurance record; crew at risk for bone fractures and eye damage.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long Stay</td>
<td>2.5 times beyond human endurance record.
</td>
<td>Physiological effects of partial gravity unknown. 

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>The gray areas in these grids represent knowledge gaps that have to be filled before we decide how to go to Mars.


</p><p>How long this preliminary medical research would take is anyone’s guess, but it has to be some multiple of the total mission time.  Studying partial gravity in particular is tricky—you can do it on the Moon (42% of martian gravity) and hope the results extend to Mars, or you can build rotating structures in space and do more precise tests there.

</p><p>Studying radiation effects means flying animals outside the magnetosphere for a few years and then watching them for tumors, which (unless the radiation news is really bad) is also going to take some time.

</p><p>In software engineering we have a useful concept called “yak shaving”. To get started on a project you must first prepare your tools, which often involves reconfiguring your programming environment, which may mean updating software, which requires finding a long-disused password, and pretty soon you find yourself under the office chair with a hex wrench. (The TV show Malcolm in the Middle has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0">a beautiful illustration</a> of yak shaving in the context of home repair.) 

</p><p>The same phenomenon afflicts us in trying to go to Mars. It would be one thing if, given enough rockets and money, explorers could climb on a spaceship and go. But there is always this chain of necessary prerequisites. We paint <i>Destination: Mars!</i> on the side of our spaceship and then find ourselves in low Earth orbit a decade later, centrifuging mice. It’s dispiriting.


</p><p>It’s tempting to say “you can just build things” and dismiss all this research and testing as timid and unnecessary. But this would mean ignoring the biggest risk factor for Mars, which I’ll include here for the sake of completeness.

<table>
<caption>Unknown Risks</caption>
<tbody><tr><th></th><th>Orbit</th><th>Land</th></tr>


<tr><td>Short Stay</td>
<td>Unknown
</td>
<td>Unknown

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long Stay</td>
<td>Unknown
</td>
<td>Unknown 

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>A trip to Mars is so difficult that we don’t have the luxury of ignoring known risks—we need all the room we can spare in our risk budget for the things we don’t know to worry about yet.

</p><p>My goal in all this is not to kill a cherished dream, but to try to push people to a more realistic view of what it means to commit to a Mars landing, and in particular to think about going to Mars in terms of opportunity costs.

</p><p>In recent years, there’s been a remarkable division in space exploration.  On one side of the divide are missions like Curiosity, James Webb, Gaia, or Euclid that are making new discoveries by the day. These projects have clearly defined goals and a formidable record of discovery. 

</p><p>On the other side, there is the International Space Station and the now twenty-year old effort to return Americans to the moon. These projects have no purpose other than perpetuating a human presence in space, and they eat through half the country’s space budget with nothing to show for it.  Forget even Mars—we are further from landing on the Moon today than we were in 1965.

</p><p>In going to Mars, we have a choice about which side of this ledger to be on. We can go aggressively explore the planet with robots, benefiting from an ongoing revolution in automation and software to launch ever more capable missions to the places most likely to harbor life.  

</p><p>Or we can stay on the treadmill we’ve been on for forty years,  slowly building up the capacity to land human beings on the safest possible piece of Martian real estate, where they will leave behind a plaque and a flag.  But we can’t do both.

</p><p><a name="early_mars" href="#fn_early_mars">[2]</a> For an early example, see the 1928 Scientific American article, “<a href="https://idlewords.com/can_we_go_to_mars.htm">Can we go to Mars?</a>”, While understandably hand-wavy about the means of propulsion, it describes a conjunction-class orbital mission not substantially different from NASA’s 2009 Design Reference Architecture.

</p><p><a name="durations" href="#fn_durations">[3]</a> Valerii Polyakov set the 437 day record on a space flight that landed in 1995. The International Space Station went without resupply from Nov 25, 2002 to April 2, 2003. Nine Apollo missions went beyond low Earth orbit, the longest of these (Apollo 17) was gone 12.4 days.

</p><p><a name="first_rockets" href="#fn_first_rockets">[4]</a> The Saturn V was capable of launching about 20 tons on a Mars flyby trajectory. NASA <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/j/jagmarsflyby1966.html">undertook preliminary planning</a> for such a mission (requiring four Saturn V launches) in 1967.  

</p><p><a name="breakthroughs" href="#fn_breakthroughs">[5]</a> In 1987 a team chaired by Sally Ride proposed <a href="https://archive.is/gmZoN">a ‘split/sprint’ mission architecture</a> that is probably the best way to get to Mars. In this architecture, slow-moving tankers pre-position cryogenic propellant depots in Mars orbit, and then in the next synodic period a human mission (the “sprint” part of the mission) lands briefly on Mars, refuels from the orbiting depots, and get home within 400 days.  Such a mission requires about 15 heavy launches and two nonexistent technologies: long-term storage of liquid hydrogen in space, and the ability to pump liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in space.  (Interestingly, both of these technologies are part of Blue Origin's plan to build a moon lander). 

</p><p>The other way to get to Mars fast is with nuclear thermal rockets. A nuclear thermal rocket is just a nuclear reactor that shoots hot hydrogen out one end. Nuclear thermal rocket designs are about twice as efficient as chemical rockets, making it feasible to fly missions with higher delta V requirements.

What kind of a failure scenario would even benefit from a two-year abort option is an interesting philosophical question.

<p><a name="urine_calcium" href="#fn_urine_calcium">[10]</a> An early urine reprocessor on the space station <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170008985">failed after it got clogged up by calcium crystals</a> from the astronauts' dissolving bones, an effect of weightlessness that wasn't properly accounted for in the design. 

</p><p><a name="iss_workload" href="#fn_iss_workload">[11]</a> The 50,000 command figure is from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ebooks/the-international-space-station-operating-an-outpost-in-the-new-frontier/">The ISS: Operating an Outpost in the New Frontier</a>, a detailed primer on space station operations. ISS utilization has gone up in recent years, but still remains below 80 hours/week—two full-time equivalents. The seven-member crew spends most of their waking time on mandatory exercise, housekeeping, and station repair. 

</p><p><a name="theranos" href="#fn_theranos">[12]</a> Existing instruments in space are usually set up to identify chemicals on a target list of 10-20 substances, a much easier task than identifying arbitrary compounds. 
</p><p>For the state of the art on the latter, see <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20230002433/downloads/ICES_Paper-SWIM_Draft-2023-03-02_no_copyright.pdf">Progress on the Organic and Inorganic Modules of the Spacecraft Water Impurity Monitor, a Next Generation Complete Water Analysis System for Crewed Vehicles</a> (ICES-2023-110).

</p><p><a name="magic_tech" href="#fn_magic_tech">[13]</a> Other examples of magic Mars technology include leakless seals for spacesuits, waterless washing machines, biofilm-proof coatings, nutritionally complete meals that can be stored for years at room temperature, and autonomous solar-powered factories for turning CO2 into hundreds of tons of methane.

</p><p><a name="biosphere2" href="#fn_biosphere2">[14]</a> The endurance record for closed-system life support belongs to Biosphere 2, which kept a crew alive for 17 months before oxygen fell to dangerous levels because of unanticipated interactions with building materials. 

</p><p><a name="spacex_plan" href="#fn_spacex_plan">[15]</a> Plans involving Starship and Mars depend on being able to produce hundreds of tons of propellant on the Martian surface so the rockets can launch again. In the absence of any details from Musk or SpaceX, the closest thing we have to a detailed plan is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54012-0">this analysis in Nature</a>.

</p><p><a name="deconditioning" href="#fn_deconditioning">[16]</a> For all we know, the set of problems collectively called "deconditioning" could get worse in partial gravity. This goes against our intuitions, but there have been bigger surprises in space.

</p><p><a name="partial_g" href="#fn_partial_g">[17]</a> Another decision that hinges on the effects of partial gravity is whether or not to include heavy exercise equipment on the Mars surface habitat, where space and mass are at a premium.</p>
