Here's an example from <b>Horizon 3</b>:</p><p><img src="https://www.tyleo.com/img/forza-horizon-3-de4ab5d4.webp"></p><p>Inspired by this design, I've always wanted to create a similar effect using HTML. On this page, I share my attempt at achieving a beautiful glass effect, along with sample code and assets for anyone who wants to explore this technique themselves. Here's a look at the final product:</p><div data-click-drag-area="true"><p><img src="https://www.tyleo.com/img/moon-be3d2442.png"></p></div><h3 id="final-recipe-lookahead">Final Recipe Lookahead</h3><p>Before diving into the core of this tutorial, some readers may prefer to skip straight to the final recipe so they can paste it right into their own page. Those readers can find it conveniently tucked away in this toggle.</p><div><h3>Light Reflection Asset</h3><p><img src="https://www.tyleo.com/img/light-f71eeaec.png"></p><h3>JavaScript Version</h3><p>This works on all platforms.</p><h4>HTML</h4><div><pre>1

Many guides stop here, but there's room for improvement! Right now, our glass looks flat and boring. Real glass has an interesting visual character around its edges that we're missing. Let's bring that to life.</p><h4>Edges</h4><p>First we'll add edges to our glass. Others, like<!-- --> <a href="https://css.glass/">css.glass</a>, do this using<!-- --> <span><span>border</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>px</span><span> solid</span></span>. Borders affect the element's size and how it interacts with children. I prefer using<!-- --> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow"><span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span></a>. By using <span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span> the children seamlessly fill the content area of the glass without negative<!-- --> <span><span>margin</span></span>s or other magic. This allows them to behave like decals applied to the glass surface.</p><p><span><span>box-shadow</span></span> requires at least two size values and supports up to four. The first two define the shadow's x and y offsets. To mimic the edges of glass, we use two translucent white<!-- --> <span><span>box-shadow</span></span>s.</p><p>The first shadow represents the edge of the glass as seen from outside. In our example this appears along the bottom and left edges. The second shadow represents the edge as seen through the glass. In our example this appears along the top and right edges.</p><p>Since light diminishes when viewing the edge through the glass, the top and left edges are softer and more translucent compared to the bottom and right edges. This subtle difference creates the illusion that the glass is slightly elevated at the bottom-right corner.</p><div><pre>1

But another key characteristic of glass is its ability to <i>reflect</i> light off its surface. This reflective quality is the secret sauce to give our glass a distinctive look from other HTML glass examples.</p><h4>Rays of Light</h4><p>We'll blend in a image of light rays to create this effect. If you're interested in creating a similar image yourself, there are plenty of tutorials online. Here's one from<!-- --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwgkK6PUkQ4">YouTube</a>, and here's<!-- --> <a href="https://phlearn.com/tutorial/light-rays-levels-photoshop/">a detailed textual walkthrough</a> <!-- -->if you prefer that approach.

The first is to set it as the <span><span>background-image</span></span> of our glass element. Doing this directly on the element causes the<!-- --> <span><span>box-filter</span></span> to blur the<!-- --> <span><span>background-image</span></span>—we don't want that.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h2><a id="user-content-prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink: Prerequisites" href="#prerequisites"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following packages are needed to run bocker.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>btrfs-progs</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>iproute2</li>
<li>iptables</li>
<li>libcgroup-tools</li>
<li>util-linux &gt;= 2.25.2</li>
<li>coreutils &gt;= 7.5</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Because most distributions do not ship a new enough version of util-linux you will probably need to grab the sources from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.25/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and compile it yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally your system will need to be configured with the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A btrfs filesystem mounted under <code>/var/bocker</code></li>
<li>A network bridge called <code>bridge0</code> and an IP of 10.0.0.1/24</li>
<li>IP forwarding enabled in <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code></li>
<li>A firewall routing traffic from <code>bridge0</code> to a physical interface.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For ease of use a Vagrantfile is included which will build the needed environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if you meet the above prerequisites you probably still want to <strong>run bocker in a virtual machine</strong>. Bocker runs as root and among other things needs to make changes to your network interfaces, routing table, and firewall rules. <strong>I can make no guarantees that it won't trash your system</strong>.</p>

              <p>What appears to be evidence of some of the oldest alphabetic writing in human history is etched onto finger-length, clay cylinders excavated from a tomb in Syria by a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers.</p>

<p>The writing, which is dated to around 2400 BCE, precedes other known alphabetic scripts by roughly 500 years, upending what archaeologists know about where alphabets came from, how they are shared across societies, and what that could mean for early urban civilizations, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>"Alphabets revolutionized writing by making it accessible to people beyond royalty and the socially elite. Alphabetic writing changed the way people lived, how they thought, how they communicated," said <a href="https://neareast.jhu.edu/directory/glenn-m-schwartz/">Glenn Schwartz</a>, a professor of archaeology at Johns Hopkins University who discovered the clay cylinders. "And this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now."</p>

<p>Schwartz will share details of his discovery on Thursday, Nov. 21, at the <a href="https://www.asor.org/am/">American Society of Overseas Research's Annual Meeting</a>.</p>

<p>A Near Eastern archaeologist, Schwartz studies how early urban areas developed throughout Syria and how smaller cities emerged in the region. With colleagues from the University of Amsterdam, he co-directed a 16-year-long archaeological dig at Tell Umm-el Marra, one of the first medium-size urban centers that popped up in western Syria.</p>

<p>At Umm-el Marra, the archaeologists uncovered tombs dating back to the Early Bronze Age. One of the best-preserved tombs contained six skeletons, gold and silver jewelry, cookware, a spearhead, and intact pottery vessels. Next to the pottery, the researchers found four lightly baked clay cylinders with what seems to be alphabetic writing on them.</p>

<p>"The cylinders were perforated, so I'm imagining a string tethering them to another object to act as a label. Maybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to," Schwartz said. "Without a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate."</p>

<p>Using carbon-14 dating techniques, researchers confirmed the ages of the tombs, the artifacts, and the writing.</p>

<p>"Previously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE," Schwartz said. "But our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought."</p>

<p>I was studying the silicon die of the Pentium processor and noticed some puzzling structures where
signal lines were connected to the silicon substrate for no apparent reason.
Two examples are in the photo below, where the metal wiring (orange) connects to small square regions of doped silicon (gray), isolated from the rest of the circuitry.
I did some investigation and learned that these structures are
"antenna diodes," special diodes that protect the circuitry from damage during manufacturing.
In this blog post, I discuss the construction of the Pentium and explain how these antenna diodes work.</p>

<p>Intel released the Pentium processor in 1993,
starting a long-running brand of high-performance processors: the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and so on.
In this post, I'm studying the original Pentium, which has 3.1 million transistors.<span id="fnref:versions"><a href="#fn:versions">1</a></span>
The die photo below shows the Pentium's fingernail-sized silicon die under a microscope. 
The chip has three layers of metal wiring on top of the silicon so the underlying silicon is almost entirely obscured.</p>
<!--
The tiny white squares around the edges of the chip are bond pads. Bond wires attached to these pads provide the
connections between the chip and its grid of 273 external pins.

<p>Modern processors are built from CMOS circuitry, which uses two types of transistors: NMOS and PMOS.
The diagram below shows how an NMOS transistor is constructed.
A transistor can be considered a switch between the source and drain, controlled by the gate.
The source and drain regions (green) consist of silicon doped with impurities to change its semiconductor properties, forming N+ silicon.
The gate consists of a layer of polysilicon (red), separated from the silicon by an absurdly thin insulating oxide layer.
Since the oxide layer is just a few hundred atoms thick,<span id="fnref:gate"><a href="#fn:gate">2</a></span> it is very fragile and easily damaged by excess voltage.
(This is why CMOS chips are sensitive to static electricity.) 
As we will see, the oxide layer can also be damaged by voltage during manufacturing.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/mosfet-n.jpg"><img alt="Diagram showing the structure of an NMOS transistor." height="231" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/mosfet-n-w400.jpg" title="Diagram showing the structure of an NMOS transistor." width="400"></a></p><p>Diagram showing the structure of an NMOS transistor.</p>
<p>The Pentium processor is constructed from multiple layers.
Starting at the bottom, the Pentium has millions of transistors similar to the diagram above.
Polysilicon wiring on top of the silicon not only forms the transistor gates but also provides short-range wiring.
Above that, three layers of metal wiring connect the parts of the chip.
Roughly speaking, the bottom layer of metal connects to the silicon and polysilicon to construct logic gates from the transistors, while the upper layers of wiring
travel longer distances, with one layer for signals traveling horizontally and the other layer for signals traveling vertically.
Tiny tungsten plugs called vias provide connections between the different layers of wiring.
A key challenge of chip design is routing, directing signals through the multiple layers of wiring while packing the circuitry as densely as possible.</p>
<p>The photo below shows a small region of the Pentium die with the three metal layers visible.
The golden vertical lines are the top metal layer, formed from aluminum and copper.
Underneath, you can see the horizontal wiring of the middle metal layer.
The more complex wiring of the bottom metal layer can be seen, along with the silicon and polysilicon that form transistors.
The small black dots are the tungsten vias that connect metal layers, while the larger dark circles are contacts with the
underlying silicon or polysilicon.
Near the bottom of the photo, the vertical gray bands are polysilicon lines, forming transistor gates.
Although the chip appears flat, it has a three-dimensional structure with multiple layers of metal
separated by insulating layers of silicon dioxide. This three-dimensional structure will be important in the discussion below.
(The metal wiring is much denser over most of the chip; this region is one of the rare spots where all the layers are visible.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/metal-layers.jpg"><img alt="Closeup of the Pentium die showing the metal layers.

The L-shaped hook towards the lower left is a connection to an antenna diode.
This photo shows a tiny part of the floating point unit. To show all the layers in focus, I combined multiple images with focus stacking.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process for an integrated circuit is extraordinarily complicated but
I'll skip over most of the details and focus on how each metal layer is constructed, layer by layer.
First, a uniform metal layer is constructed over the silicon wafer.
Next, the desired pattern is produced on the surface using a process called photolithography:
a light-sensitive chemical called "resist"
is applied to the wafer and exposed to light through a patterned mask. 
The light hardens the resist, creating a protective coating with the pattern of the desired wiring.
Finally, the unprotected metal is etched away, leaving the wiring.</p>
<p>In the early days of integrated circuits, the metal was removed with liquid acids, a process called wet etching.
Inconveniently, wet etching tended to eat away metal underneath the edges of the mask, which became a problem as integrated circuits
became denser and the wires needed to be thinner.
The solution was dry etch, using a plasma to remove the metal.
By applying a large voltage to plates above and below the chip, a gas such as HCl is ionized into a highly reactive plasma.
This plasma attacks the surface (unless it is protected by the resist), removing the unwanted metal.
The advantage of dry etching is that it can act vertically (anisotropically), providing more control over the line width.</p>
<p>Although plasma etching improved the etching process, it caused another problem: plasma-induced oxide damage, also
called the "antenna effect."<span id="fnref:antenna"><a href="#fn:antenna">3</a></span>
The problem is that long metal wires on the chip could pick up an electrical charge from the plasma, producing a large voltage.
As described earlier, the thin oxide layer under a transistor's gate is sensitive to voltage damage.
The voltage induced by the plasma can destroy the transistor by blowing a hole through the gate oxide or
it can degrade the transistor's performance by embedding charges inside the oxide layer.<span id="fnref:damage"><a href="#fn:damage">4</a></span></p>
<p>Several factors affect the risk of damage from the antenna effect.
First, only the transistor's gate is sensitive to the induced voltage, due to the oxide layer.
If the wire is also connected to a transistor's source or drain, the wire is "safe" since the source and drain provide
connections to the chip's substrate, allowing the charge to dissipate harmlessly.
Note that when the chip is completed, every transistor gate is connected to another transistor's source or drain (which provides
the signal to the gate), so there is no risk of damage. 
Thus, the problem can only occur during manufacturing, with a metal line that is connected to a gate on one end but isn't
connected on the other end.
Moreover, the highest layer of metal is "safe" since everything is connected at that point.
Another factor is that the induced voltage is proportional to the length of the metal wire, so short wires don't pose a risk.
Finally, only the metal layer currently being etched poses a risk; since the lower layers are
insulated by the thick oxide between layers, they won't pick up charge.</p>
<p>These factors motivate several ways to prevent antenna problems.<span id="fnref:papers"><a href="#fn:papers">5</a></span>
First, a long wire can be broken into shorter segments, connected by jumpers on a higher layer.
Second, moving long wires to the top metal layer eliminates problems.<span id="fnref:top-metal"><a href="#fn:top-metal">6</a></span>
Third, diodes can be added to drain the charge from the wire; these are called "antenna diodes".
When the chip is in use, the antenna diodes are reverse-biased so they have no electrical effect.
But during manufacturing, the antenna diodes let charge flow to the substrate before it
causes problems.</p>
<p>The third solution, the antenna diodes, explains the mysterious connections that I saw in the Pentium.
In the diagram below, these diodes are visible on the die as square regions of doped silicon.
The larger regions of doped silicon form PMOS transistors (upper) and NMOS transistors (lower). 
The polysilicon lines are faintly visible; they form transistor gates where they cross the doped silicon.
(For this photo, I removed all the metal wiring.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/silicon-diagram.jpg"><img alt="Closeup of the Pentium die showing transistors. The metal and polysilicon layers have been removed to show the silicon." height="574" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/silicon-diagram-w450.jpg" title="Closeup of the Pentium die showing transistors. The metal and polysilicon layers have been removed to show the silicon." width="450"></a></p><p>Closeup of the Pentium die showing transistors. The metal and polysilicon layers have been removed to show the silicon.</p>
<p>Confusingly, the antenna diodes look almost identical to "well taps", connections from the substrate to the chip's positive voltage supply,
but have a completely different purpose.
In the Pentium, the PMOS transistors are 
constructed in "wells" of N-type silicon.
These wells must be raised to the chip's positive voltage, so there are numerous well tap connections
from the positive supply to
the wells.
The well taps consist of squares of N+ doped silicon in the the N-type silicon well, providing an electrical connection.
On the other hand, the antenna diodes also consist of N+ doped silicon, but embedded in P-type silicon.
This forms a P-N junction that creates the diode.</p>
<p>In the Pentium, antenna diodes are used for only a small fraction of the wiring. The diodes require extra area on the
die, so they are used only when necessary. Most of the antenna problems on the Pentium were apparently resolved through
routing.
Although the antenna diodes are relatively rare, they are still frequent enough that they caught my attention.</p>
<p>Antenna effects are still an issue in modern integrated circuits.
Integrated circuit fabricators provide rules on the maximum allowable size of antenna wires for a particular manufacturing process.<span id="fnref:rules"><a href="#fn:rules">7</a></span>
Software checks the design to ensure that the antenna rules are not violated, modifying the routing and inserting diodes as
necessary.
Violating the antenna rules can result in damaged chips and a very low yield, so it's more than just a theoretical issue.</p>

This causes a moment of potential chaos, which is why you want to control the energy and channel it in a positive direction.</span></p><p>Feeling nervous about giving your senior leader feedback is a good thing. It means you have survival instincts that help with self-preservation.</p><p>Giving a senior leader feedback shouldn’t be your first option:</p><ul><li><p>Your first option is to ask yourself, “What can I do that’s within my control to improve this situation?”</p></li><li><p>Your second option is, “Can I live with this? How much does this bother me? Is it worth giving them feedback and what are my chances of success doing it?”</p></li><li><p>Your third, fourth, and fifth option: Thinking more about the above</p></li><li><p>Your final option: “I think I want to give this senior leader some feedback.”</p></li></ul><p><span>In other words, make sure YOU aren’t the problem. Make sure you are </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/15-principles-for-managing-up" rel="">managing up</a><span>, asking </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-present-to-your-ceo" rel="">clarifying</a><span> </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/question-behind-the-question" rel="">questions</a><span>, </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/act-like-an-owner" rel="">acting like an owner</a><span>, etc to get what you need. It’s easy to blame a leader, but before you do that, try reflecting on how you could behave differently to improve outcomes for both of you. </span><strong><span>It’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/weskao_as-a-feedback-receiver-i-need-to-develop-activity-7258123868723138561-OTmF/" rel="">low-agency</a><span> to assume other people should change.</span></strong></p><p><span>If you do want to give your senior leader feedback, proceed with the appropriate level of caution. You may want to adjust the tactics below based on your specific leader, their idiosyncrasies, </span><a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/understanding-the-worldview-of-a-bureaucrat" rel="">worldview</a><span>, your relationship, the level of trust they have in you, etc.</span></p><p>For example, you might realize your relationship or credibility isn’t strong enough for you to give them feedback—that’s an equally appropriate conclusion.</p><p>The only path I’d advise against: Going in with guns blazing, assuming you have moral high ground simply because you are right.</p><p>If you are self-aware and could realistically see your senior leader taking the feedback well, read on.</p><p>Here’s what I do that might be useful for you too.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve taught this framework to my clients, and they love it. I’m going to share it with you.</p><p>The framing of “even more” works so well because you’re speaking from a place of generosity and giving the benefit of the doubt.</p><p><span>You’re assuming they’re doing X—and that they should do it </span><em>even</em><span> more. You are assuming they are great--and you want to make them </span><em>even</em><span> stronger.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>🚫</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>You</strong><span>: “We might need to give guidance to new hires.”</span></p><p><strong>Senior leader</strong><span>: “You think I don’t know that I need to give new hires guidance? I obviously gave them guidance. GTFO.”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>✅</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>You</strong><span>: “We may need to give even more guidance to new hires.”</span></p><p><strong>Senior leader</strong><span>: “Hmm yeah. I gave them some guidance, but that probably wasn’t enough.”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p><p>The “before” scenario is binary—the senior leader either did or didn’t give guidance. And if they didn’t, well, they messed up. They feel threatened that you noticed.</p><p>The “after” is a spectrum: You are generous in assuming that they did give guidance. You’re suggesting they may want to amp this up even more. This is much easier for them to accept.</p><p><span>This isn’t simply an issue of semantics or phrasing. This is about positioning to </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/strategy-not-self-expression" rel="">increase the chances they change their behavior</a><span>.</span></p><p>Getting anyone to listen and change their behavior, especially someone more senior? That’s a huge win.</p><p><span>[The “even more” technique works with </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/super-specific-feedback" rel="">giving feedback to direct reports too</a><span>. It’s super versatile.]</span></p><p>Talk about yourself so it doesn’t seem like you’re pointing fingers. I do this whenever I want to say something the person might find insulting.</p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫</strong><span> “You should try X.”</span></p><p><strong>✅</strong><span> “I used to struggle with this, and when I tried X, it really helped.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><p>By the way, saying “you should try X” is fine--there’s nothing inherently wrong about it. The reason I would avoid it is because of the power dynamic and CONTENT of what I’m saying.&nbsp;</p><p>If there’s a power dynamic and/or the content of what I’m saying might be sensitive for the person, that’s when I share about my own experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not saying YOU are struggling with X, I’m saying I used to and what I did. And if that lesson applies to what you’re dealing with, that’s cool, but no pressure.</p><p>Most people are extreme in one of two ways:</p><ol><li><p>They think “respecting the person’s power” means being 100% supplicant. They do everything the powerful person says, and never push back even when they have reason to. → These people are spineless.</p></li><li><p><span>They share their POV in the </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/tone-and-words-use-accurate-language" rel="">most blunt, low-finesse way</a><span> without any regard for their recipient’s </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/unspoken-power-dynamics-of-calendly" rel="">person’s ego</a><span>. They think, “Well, I’m right, so I should just say the thing with zero framing.” → These people are insubordinate.</span></p></li></ol><p>Both are bad. Both lack judgment.</p><p>What you want to do is: Share your POV in a way that doesn’t threaten the senior person, and gets them to listen.</p><p><span>One simple way you can achieve this is by using </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/tone-and-words-use-accurate-language" rel="">diplomatic, curiosity-forward language</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>These phrases help you ease into the suggestion in a way that feels non-threatening:</p><ul><li><p>"We might want to try…”</p></li><li><p>“I wonder if...”</p></li><li><p>"Perhaps we could...”</p></li><li><p>“What are your thoughts on...”</p></li><li><p>“One approach might be...”</p></li></ul><p><span>You adopt the vibe of a helpful team member who </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/oarb-framework-appeal-to-self-interest" rel="">has your leader’s best interest in mind</a><span> and wants to serve your organization.&nbsp;</span></p><p>You are forward-looking. Instead of focusing on what went wrong (which risks making your leader feel defensive), you’re focused on what to potentially do going forward.</p><p>If you've been reading this newsletter for a minute, you know I bang on the drum of sharing your logic. I believe most people do not share their rationale enough.</p><p>Don’t just make a high-level, hand-waving statement. </p><p><span>Instead, share examples of what worked well in the past because it helps your feedback land. </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/rigorous-thinking" rel="">Supporting your claims</a><span> makes you more persuasive and objective--and increases the chances your senior leader will </span><a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-get-an-enthusiastic-yes" rel="">take your recommendation</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Example 1: Guidance during projects</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫</strong><span> “We need to give more feedback during projects.”</span></p><p><strong>✅ </strong><span>“I noticed when we reviewed the design mockups weekly with the client, they loved the final result. For this project, early check-ins could help us make sure we’re aligned before going too far down a certain direction and could prevent rework.”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Example 2: Setting priorities</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫</strong><span> “The team needs clearer priorities.”</span></p><p><strong>✅</strong><span> “The team made amazing progress when we all focused on the website update last month. It might help to have one or two clear priorities for the team this month that everyone can rally behind.”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Example 3: Training new hires</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫 </strong><span>“We should spend more time training new people.”</span></p><p><strong>✅ </strong><span>“When we were able to dedicate that first week to training Steve, he got up to speed pretty quickly. The bit of upfront time seemed to have paid off, and taking a similar training approach for our next hire could help them ramp up just as fast. What do you think?”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Ends with a clear, actionable suggestion</p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/oarb-framework-appeal-to-self-interest" rel="">Shows the upside</a><span> of updating their approach</span></p></li><li><p>Keeps it simple, logical, and positive</p></li></ul><p>Personally, I think phrasing a recommendation as a statement reduces cognitive load. You can follow up with an open-ended question, like “what do you think?”</p><p><span>Notice how the examples above are </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-be-concise" rel="">concrete AND concise</a><span>. Avoid long diatribes and </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/start-right-before-you-get-eaten-by-the-bear" rel="">over-explaining</a><span>—use your judgment to share </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-i-give-the-right-amount-of-context" rel="">just enough context</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>And for goodness sake, do </span><em>not</em><span> have a “well actually…” vibe when you share logic and data. This is obnoxious and will probably backfire. Notice how in the examples above, I’m sharing rationale, and doing it in a collaborative way.  </span></p><p>To recap, here are the points:</p><ol><li><p>Deploy the “even more” technique</p></li><li><p>Use yourself as an example</p></li><li><p>Adopt a diplomatic, curiosity-forward language</p></li><li><p>Bring data and examples to support your point</p></li></ol><p>Which principle above do you want to try? Which do you think will work best with the senior leader you have in mind and why? Hit reply because I’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Thanks for being here, and I’ll see you next Wednesday at 8am ET.</p><p>Wes</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg" width="1456" height="818" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:818,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:175870,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22f0ef58-bce9-4b64-b354-fbe43c6a8b31_1536x863.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The February 2025 cohort of my course is now open. I’m thrilled to see the testimonials from alumni continue to roll in too. Here’s what students are saying:</p><blockquote><p>“I decided to join Wes’ course because I've been a huge fan of her newsletter for a long time. It's always easy to get stuck in your own head or to be verbose in your writing when people are constantly asking for something from you and there's no time to think about your audience. I found the frameworks and perspective Wes shared really valuable, especially in a world where concise and clear written communication is critical. I would recommend this class for anyone who needs to align a large group of stakeholders or bring a valuable recommendation to executives.” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Angela Santurbano, </span><strong>Principal Product Manager, Square</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Highly, highly recommended. This is the rare communication course I’ve taken that focuses on how I actually get things done at work: Slacks, emails, last minute cross-functional meetings, and constantly managing up. It’s also the rare virtual course where the activities are challenging, actually mirror real life scenarios, and provide a valuable opportunity to practice skills. On top of all that, Wes is giving real-time constructive feedback to her students. Sign up!” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Fred Geyer, </span><strong>Manager, Employee Onboarding Experience, HelloFresh</strong></p><blockquote><p>“This course was filled with clear, actionable insights to improve communication habits and practices in my everyday work. I'm excited to implement the strategies Wes covered.” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Jess Mordo, Senior Manager, </span><strong>Senior Manager (Acquisition Marketing),</strong><span> </span><strong>Grammarly</strong></p><blockquote><p>“This course provides a practical set of tools and tactics to apply immediately to your writing. It sparked valuable discussions within my team, who also attended, and I highly recommend it to anyone frequently operating in a ‘debate and commit’ environment. Wes’s approach to clear, kind, and persuasive writing is especially relevant if you rely on channels like Slack or Teams.”</p></blockquote><p><span>- Morgan King, </span><strong>Director of Client Support, Stitch Fix</strong></p><blockquote><p>“This was an excellent course. I appreciated the real-world examples, appropriate level and complexity of coursework, and the ask-me-anything Q&amp;A sessions. Very well done!” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Eric Livingston, </span><strong>Senior Director of Product Management, Salesforce</strong></p><p><span>In the past week, operators from Adobe, Meta, Shopify, Autodesk, Grammarly, Klayvio, Chick-fil-A, eBay, Square, Equifax, Roblox, etc have signed up.

<h2>Reverse engineers bust sleazy gig work platform (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/23/hack-the-class-war/#robo-boss">permalink</a>)</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  A COMPUTER CAN NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE</p>
<p>  THEREFORE A COMPUTER MUST NEVER MAKE A MANAGEMENT DECISION
</p></blockquote>
<p>Supposedly, these lines were included in a 1979 internal presentation at IBM; screenshots of them routinely go viral:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1385565737167724545?lang=en">https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1385565737167724545?lang=en</a></p>
<p>The reason for their newfound popularity is obvious: the rise and rise of algorithmic management tools, in which your boss is an app. That IBM slide is right: turning an app into your boss allows your <em>actual</em> boss to create an "accountability sink" in which there is no obvious way to blame a human or even a company for your maltreatment:</p>
<p><a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-unaccountability-machine/">https://profilebooks.com/work/the-unaccountability-machine/</a></p>
<p>App-based management-by-bossware treats the bug identified by the unknown author of that IBM slide into a feature. When an app is your boss, it can force you to scab:</p>

<p>Or it can steal your wages:</p>

<p>But tech giveth and tech taketh away. Digital technology is infinitely flexible: the program that spies on you can be defeated by another program that defeats spying. Every time your algorithmic boss hacks you, you can hack your boss back:</p>

<p>Technologists and labor organizers need one another. Even the most precarious and abused workers can team up with hackers to disenshittify their robo-bosses:</p>

<p>For every abuse technology brings to the workplace, there is a liberating use of technology that workers unleash by seizing the means of computation:</p>

<p>One tech-savvy group on the cutting edge of dismantling the Torment Nexus is Algorithms Exposed, a tiny, scrappy group of EU hacker/academics who recruit volunteers to reverse engineer and modify the algorithms that rule our lives as workers and as customers:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a></p>
<p>Algorithms Exposed have an admirable supply of seemingly boundless energy. Every time I check in with them, I learn that they've spun out yet another special-purpose subgroup. Today, I learned about Reversing Works, a hacking team that reverse engineers gig work apps, revealing corporate wrongdoing that leads to multimillion euro fines for especially sleazy companies.</p>
<p>One such company is Foodinho, an Italian subsidiary of the Spanish food delivery company Glovo. Foodinho/Glovo has been in the crosshairs of Italian labor enforcers since before the pandemic, racking up millions in fines – first for failing to file the proper privacy paperwork disclosing the nature of the data processing in the app that Foodinho riders use to book jobs. Then, after the Italian data commission investigated Foodinho, the company attracted new, much larger fines for its out-of-control surveillance conduct.</p>
<p>As all of this was underway, Reversing Works was conducting its own research into Glovo/Foodinho's app, running it on a simulated Android handset inside a PC so they could peer into app's data collection and processing. They discovered a nightmarish world of pervasive, illegal worker surveillance, and published their findings a year ago in November, 2023:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/Exercising%20workers%20rights%20in%20algorithmic%20management%20systems_Lessons%20learned%20from%20the%20Glovo-Foodinho%20digital%20labour%20platform%20case_2023.pdf">https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/Exercising%20workers%20rights%20in%20algorithmic%20management%20systems_Lessons%20learned%20from%20the%20Glovo-Foodinho%20digital%20labour%20platform%20case_2023.pdf</a></p>
<p>That report reveals all kinds of extremely illegal behavior. Glovo/Foodinho makes its riders' data accessible across national borders, so Glovo managers outside of Italy can access fine-grained surveillance information and sensitive personal information – a major data protection no-no.</p>
<p>Worse, Glovo's app embeds trackers from a huge number of other tech platforms (for chat, analytics, and more), making it impossible for the company to account for all the ways that its riders' data is collected – again, a requirement under Italian and EU data protection law.</p>
<p>All this data collection continues even when riders have clocked out for the day – it's as though your boss followed you home after quitting time and spied on you.</p>
<p>The research also revealed evidence of a secretive worker scoring system that ranked workers based on undisclosed criteria and reserved the best jobs for workers with high scores. This kind of thing is pervasive in algorithmic management, from gig work to Youtube and Tiktok, where performers' videos are routinely suppressed because they crossed some undisclosed line. When an app is your boss, your every paycheck is docked because you violated a policy you're not allowed to know about, because if you knew why your boss was giving you shitty jobs, or refusing to show the video you spent thousands of dollars making to the subscribers who asked to see it, then maybe you could figure out how to keep your boss from detecting your rulebreaking next time.</p>
<p>All this data-collection and processing is bad enough, but what makes it all a thousand times worse is Glovo's data <em>retention</em> policy – they're storing this data on their workers for <em>four years</em> after the worker leaves their employ. That means that mountains of sensitive, potentially ruinous data on gig workers is just lying around, waiting to be stolen by the next hacker that breaks into the company's servers.</p>
<p>Reversing Works's report made quite a splash. A year after its publication, the Italian data protection agency fined Glovo <em>another</em> 5 million euros and ordered them to <em>cut this shit out</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://reversing.works/posts/2024/11/press-release-reversing.works-investigation-exposes-glovos-data-privacy-violations-marking-a-milestone-for-worker-rights-and-technology-accountability/">https://reversing.works/posts/2024/11/press-release-reversing.works-investigation-exposes-glovos-data-privacy-violations-marking-a-milestone-for-worker-rights-and-technology-accountability/</a></p>
<p>As the report points out, Italy is extremely well set up to defend workers' rights from this kind of bossware abuse. Not only do Italian enforcers have all the privacy tools created by the GDPR, the EU's flagship privacy regulation – they also have the benefit of Italy's 1970 Workers' Statute. The Workers Statute is a visionary piece of legislation that protects workers from automated management practices. Combined with later privacy regulation, it gave Italy's data regulators sweeping powers to defend Italian workers, like Glovo's riders.</p>
<p>Italy is also a leader in recognizing gig workers as de facto employees, despite the tissue-thin pretense that adding an app to your employment means that you aren't entitled to any labor protections. In the case of Glovo, the fine-grained surveillance and reputation scoring were deemed proof that Glovo <em>was</em> employer to its riders.</p>
<p>Reversing Works' report is a fascinating read, especially the sections detailing how the researchers recruited a Glovo rider who allowed them to log in to Glovo's platform on their account.</p>
<p>As Reversing Works points out, this bottom-up approach – where apps are subjected to technical analysis – has real potential for labor organizations seeking to protect workers. Their report established multiple grounds on which a union could seek to hold an abusive employer to account.</p>
<p>But this bottom-up approach also holds out the potential for developing direct-action tools that let workers flex their power, by modifying apps, or coordinating their actions to wring concessions out of their bosses.</p>
<p>After all, the whole reason for the gig economy is to slash wage-bills, by transforming workers into contractors, and by eliminating managers in favor of algorithms. This leaves companies extremely vulnerable, because when workers come together to exercise power, their employer can't rely on middle managers to pressure workers, deal with irate customers, or step in to fill the gap themselves:</p>

<p>Only by seizing the means of computation, workers and organized labor can turn the tables on bossware – both by directly altering the conditions of their employment, and by producing the evidence and tools that regulators can use to force employers to make those alterations permanent.</p>

    <p>Growing up, there was a more positive view of tech. The future looked awesome - media showing how the future could look like had amazing ideas about how tech could help us and look cool doing it. It was all about comfort, less work, personalized assistance, reducing friction and hassle, unconventional designs, improved materials. The ads were painting a bright future with glossy robots, blinking datacenters, transhumanist image of cyborg-esque humans <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>; an age of knowledge and connection, productivity and ease. We didn't have to think about how it was made, who would lose their job over it, how it would be profitable, how it would be repaired or recycled if broken, how much energy it would use or what rare metals would be needed. It was just <em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>Then came social media, and smartphones. A lot of tools in one, how convenient! How amazing to have the ability to record audio or take pictures while being so affordable! Now even poor people or people in poorer countries could access the internet and some valuable education unrestricted by their environments. I don't know if we had this view organically or if it was pushed on us by the tech companies in interviews and posts - but I distinctly remember this view that this would make society better, that it would be a big step forward for humankind.</p>
<p>The interconnection was presented as the ability to finally collaborate knowledge more quickly and enter a new knowledge era. The ability to produce and share your own content and become a star overnight online without casting managers and directors or record studios emboldened the idea of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps, a geographically unlimited American Dream. Everyone could suddenly be rich or become educated. More free time, more money, more means for people to leave their economic class upward and have financial freedom. The option of having communication channels outside of journalism and documentaries was portrayed as more uncensored as authentic or fringe voices were being heard, documenting events live that would have maybe never been reported on otherwise. There was this idea that it would somehow severely reduce or end xenophobia and racism as we would all suddenly be able to interact with each other globally and learn that the others weren't so bad - a very simplified, almost childlike view of racism. There'd be clean energy, a solution for climate change; poverty would be solved. Ideally, we would now all come together and create something big while overcoming limits and bigotry.</p>
<p>And the tech companies were all just there to facilitate that for the greater good. Right. But is that true?</p>
<p>They're still evoking this image. Their ads featuring grandparents who don't have to feel alone because the family can videocall, or students quickly finding out facts for their assignment, neighborhoods organizing via their platforms, the image of tech enhancing the family life with grocery lists and drawings and games for the family!<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> Nevermind that most of these are pretty dystopian if you sit and think on it. But more people are picking up on it now as it gets more overt, more apparent, that the marketing people and higher ups in tech seem to live in a bubble detached from the reality of millions; not realizing that a spot featuring how AI is writing the fan-letter for a child is not cute, not innovative or something to strive towards <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I do think the internet and tech managed to hit some of the advantages and goals - so far, it <em>did</em> facilitate more political knowledge and resistance<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, circumvented government censorship<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>, let people meet and change each others lives who would have likely never met otherwise<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>; helped to gather knowledge<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, gave better access to scientific studies, papers, statistics, and culturally important media<sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup>, helped piracy and archiving efforts<sup id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9">9</a></sup> and gave disabled and chronically ill more options to socialize<sup id="fnref-10"><a href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> - just to name a few things. But in my view, these positives are increasingly being overshadowed.</p>
<p>What about the goal of coming together to share knowledge and help everyone get better access to education? I think the internet undeniably helped with Wikipedia, YouTube tutorials, specialized blogs, forums and more - but now, the forums and specialized indie websites and blogs have been dying and are strongly de-prioritized by search engines, therefore hard to find <sup id="fnref-11"><a href="#fn-11">11</a></sup>. Informational posts on social media are walled off behind login screens<sup id="fnref-12"><a href="#fn-12">12</a></sup>. At the same time, it is the top breeding ground for disinformation<sup id="fnref-13"><a href="#fn-13">13</a></sup>, aided by AI that hallucinates information<sup id="fnref-14"><a href="#fn-14">14</a></sup>. Together with the Fake News President, I've seen our time described as the "post-truth era" <sup id="fnref-15"><a href="#fn-15">15</a></sup>. It doesn't matter what the truth is, it is for who has the most power and money to decide what the truth is.</p>
<p>How about the bootstrap mentality? The internet has undoubtedly made people rich or well-off who may wouldn't otherwise be; but it's apparent that these are often people accused (and sometimes convicted) of sexual assault, harassment, abusing their employees, wage theft, tax fraud, and other crimes <sup id="fnref-16"><a href="#fn-16">16</a></sup>.  They are people who need to game the attention economy by increasingly disrespectful and shocking content, gore, rage bait, dehumanizing pranks<sup id="fnref-17"><a href="#fn-17">17</a></sup>, extreme consumerism like huge shopping hauls, sloppy large mukbangs, shredding lamborghinis<sup id="fnref-18"><a href="#fn-18">18</a></sup>, gambling streams and websites<sup id="fnref-19"><a href="#fn-19">19</a></sup>, game shows<sup id="fnref-20"><a href="#fn-20">20</a></sup> and more. And they have to do that to sell us products we don't need, banking on our insecurities. We've created an internet economy that incentivizes the worst in humanity - for clout, for money.</p>
<p>Educational content is still there, but everything is getting increasingly more paywalled. Scientific data is still harder to access and read<sup id="fnref-21"><a href="#fn-21">21</a></sup>. The sensationalized rage bait articles are freely accessible, but the thorough analyses and takedowns are restricted<sup id="fnref-22"><a href="#fn-22">22</a></sup>. Archives get taken down<sup id="fnref-23"><a href="#fn-23">23</a></sup>, people are less willing to upload content for free. There's Patreon, and Udemy, and Skillshare, and more. You get a snippet, but the rest is in their 199$ course. Some of them are surely good and worth it, but it's still a shame that we have to do this when we were sold on a free future with less economic worries and in times where many people cannot even afford proper food.</p>
<p>What about xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination and bias? People are perceived as being more polarized and extreme<sup id="fnref-24"><a href="#fn-24">24</a></sup>, there's talk of echo chambers and divided nations<sup id="fnref-25"><a href="#fn-25">25</a></sup>. Comment sections are often toxic and full of hate speech<sup id="fnref-26"><a href="#fn-26">26</a></sup>. Members of oppressed groups are bullied off of platforms<sup id="fnref-27"><a href="#fn-27">27</a></sup>. Ads used online have been shown to be discriminatory because certain groups of people are specifically targeted and shown different prices, worse job offers or similar things<sup id="fnref-28"><a href="#fn-28">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The sustainability of it all is the cherry on top. We are now at a point when it isn't just cool and aspirational. Now we <em>do</em> have to think about how it was made, who <em>will</em> lose their job over it<sup id="fnref-29"><a href="#fn-29">29</a></sup>, on whose backs it makes profit<sup id="fnref-30"><a href="#fn-30">30</a></sup>, how it will be repaired or recycled if broken<sup id="fnref-31"><a href="#fn-31">31</a></sup>, how much energy or water it <em>uses</em><sup id="fnref-32"><a href="#fn-32">32</a></sup> or what rare metals or finite resources it <em>needs</em><sup id="fnref-33"><a href="#fn-33">33</a></sup>. The fantasy is over.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/avas/ai-1.webp" alt="&quot;You know what the biggest problem with pushing all-things-AI is? Wrong direction. I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I an do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.&quot; by Joanna Maciejewska"></p>
<p>Has the tech world kept up this image, their promise, their goals? No. Even with AI now and the ads released for Gemini, ChatGPT and others, they still bank on the utopian world state they failed to deliver even until now. It's like we're made to believe it is always just. out. of. reach. but the next technological advancement will fix it and finally make it real.</p>
<p>But they're lying. Obviously, companies will say and do what brings them the most money, this isn't new or a shocker. But greenwashing <sup id="fnref-34"><a href="#fn-34">34</a></sup> is a problem. Making wonderfully diverse ads while internally still discriminating against women, people of color, disabled people and more <sup id="fnref-35"><a href="#fn-35">35</a></sup> is a problem. Claiming you care about progress , innovation and talent but supporting anti-immigrant policies is a problem<sup id="fnref-36"><a href="#fn-36">36</a></sup>. Presenting your products as a solution for systemic issues that you help facilitate by your voting and your wages and political donations or endorsements is disgusting, and so is using marketing to curate an image of the caring, careful, fair pay, progressive and ecological company while union-busting<sup id="fnref-37"><a href="#fn-37">37</a></sup>, regularly losing your data or misusing it<sup id="fnref-38"><a href="#fn-38">38</a></sup> forcing RTO<sup id="fnref-39"><a href="#fn-39">39</a></sup> and pushing for deregulation in everything<sup id="fnref-40"><a href="#fn-40">40</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I want to have a closer look on some tech companies and VC lobbying, their values, endorsements and political or environmental consequences.</p>

<li><mark>Amazon</mark> (owner of Amazon and its services like Prime and Music, Audible, Twitch, IMDb, Goodreads, Whole Foods, Kindle and Fire TV, Echo etc.) - As previously mentioned in the footnotes, there has been union-busting, which effectively means being hostile to fair and livable wages, good <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20230201-0" target="_blank">working conditions</a> and worker protections in general.

<li><mark>Alphabet</mark> (owner of Google and its services, YouTube, Waymo, Waze, Android, Fitbit ...) - often criticized for privacy violations, <a href="https://archive.is/GdWnH" target="_blank">offensive</a> tech, political censorship especially in regards to China, Turkey and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220329150922/https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-censors-war" target="_blank">Russia</a>, bad working conditions &amp; handling of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/01/tech/google-walkout-one-year-later-risk-takers/index.html" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> complaints, violating <a href="https://archive.ph/VKXEU" target="_blank">HIPAA</a> and more. They also ran an <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/google-had-secret-project-to-convince-employees-that-unions-suck/" target="_blank">anti-union</a> campaign.
Most notable figure is Sundar Pichai, its CEO. Pichai has made headlines for firing of employees over <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sundar-pichai-tells-google-staff-104845522.html" target="_blank">political expression</a> against Google being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nimbus" target="_blank">allegedly complicit</a> in genocide.</li>
<li><mark>X</mark> is obviously by now very associated with Elon Musk and his personal brand/views that most people are very aware of, so I won't get too deeply into it. He created a super-PAC to support Donald Trump<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2022/11/27/elon-musks-political-shift-how-the-billionaire-moved-from-backing-obama-to-endorsing-desantis/" target="_blank">Since 2021</a>, he has donated exclusively to Republicans. His companies are well known for an extremely unforgiving and abusive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23833447/tesla-elon-musk-ultra-hardcore-employees-land-of-the-giants" target="_blank">work culture</a>, are actively contributing to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-23/tesla-pollution-fined-epa" target="_blank">pollution</a> and helping erode forests and cause <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/03/1131695382/tesla-ev-electric-vehicles-europe-germany-drought-climate-change-factory" target="_blank">water issues</a>.</li>
<li><mark>Andreessen Horowitz</mark>, better known as <mark>a16z</mark>, is a private venture capital firm. They are known for investing into tech startups and used to invest into well known brands such as Skype, Twitter, Facebook, Groupon, Roblox, Stripe, Medium, Coinbase, Soylent, Buzzfeed, Airbnb and more - but also Anduril, which manufactures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries" target="_blank">autonomous weapons</a>. As you can see, they have their money in a lot of things we use, so I think it is important to mention them. They committed to <a href="https://archive.ph/20221031200731/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/31/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/" target="_blank">$400 million in equity investment</a> towards acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk back in 2022. Especially Marc Andreessen has been known to donate to Republicans, especially in support of deregulation, no government intervention and 'free speech', and against environmental sustainability and reduced gender inequalities, as per his own tech-optimism manifesto. They have made significant investments in cryptocurrency, which is environmentally questionable and constantly involved in <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/" target="_blank">scams and thefts</a>. Last July, the co-founders publicly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/andreessen-horowitz-co-founders-explain-why-theyre-supporting-trump/" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Donald Trump<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup>.</li>
<li><mark>YCombinator</mark> is a startup accelerator and venture capital firm; they helped start the companies DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Reddit, Stripe or Twitch, and many more. They should be on this list for the same reasons that a16z is. Its CEO, Garry Tan, is known to be vitriolic online, anti-progressive, opposed to regulation and deceleration, and very <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/09/27/garry-tan-y-combinator-declares-war-san-francisco-politics-progressives-elon-musk/" target="_blank">supportive</a> of Elon Musk.</li>
<li><mark>Sequoia Capital</mark> is a venture capital firm with who has in the past invested in Apple, Nvidia, ByteDance, Cisco, and many more - even the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank">FTX</a> that engaged in fraud. It has come under scrutiny for potentially <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8d70626-b949-4a1b-969f-58896eb2ef71" target="_blank">helping</a> China's military.

<li>There are also some notable people to be looking out for; like <mark>David Sacks</mark> (Venture capitalist and former PayPal COO), who has donated repeatedly to the Republican Party, hosted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks#Support_for_political_campaigns" target="_blank">fundraisers</a> for Republican figures like Vance, Masters, Kennedy, and Trump<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup>, being a speaker at the 2024 RNC and calling the Trump trial a <a href="https://archive.is/o/Cp5xF/https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1796294540388876543" target="_blank">sham</a>; or <mark>Peter Thiel</mark> (co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies#Controversies" target="_blank">Palantir Technologies</a> and PayPal and early Facebook investor) donated over $1 million to Trump’s<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup> campaign in 2016 and allegedly <a href="https://archive.is/dbMG8" target="_blank">warmed up to Trump</a> again this year.

</ul>
<p>This is just a selection (I am writing a casual blog post after all, not a book) - there’s surely more to dig up and more companies to talk about. Yes, there have been notable efforts to ease the negative effects these companies have or use their money for good<sup id="fnref-42"><a href="#fn-42">42</a></sup>, but it is not enough, and there is a worrying trend of Tech veering strongly to the right and using the money they get from us and our data for questionable causes. And how is any of this in alignment with techs lofty, amazing sounding goals and marketing image? The solution cannot be to just throw more tech at it.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is to say: the tech utopia fantasy is truly dead to me. The image of the cool, hippie, leftist Silicon Valley tech is wrong. The companies themselves and the VC’s they take money from are supporting values and governments that do not act in your best interest and do not even align with their marketing image. Don’t be further misled. Stop giving them your money, time and data as much as possible for you. They won't bring us closer to these ideals they promise.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry for the people seeing it on HackerNews, didn’t post it there and it wasn’t intended for that audience 🤷🏻‍♀️ yes, it’s an “immature rant”, because it starts with “I have to rant about the home office situation […] specifically at my place of employment”. This is not a professional article, it’s a personal blog; it was written after I was on the phone with the disability rep, talking to each other about these matters. I fear since this isn’t the US private sector I’m talking about, it may not match your experiences.</p>

<p>I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the fake positivity and cute-sounding arguments for returning to the office. It falls flat for so many and it’s trying to make it sound more legitimate by evoking this image of collaboration, being social, kindness, having a good time together when that’s not the point. The point is micromanagement and needing to justify the large office spaces they invested into. Very rarely are there positions or departments who truly need to collab in person, and then they can just do that for the occasion, not a fixed amount of days per week or month where they need to go in at all times.</p>
<p>It’s a joke. At my place, we don’t innovate, we don’t develop new products for a mass market; we do lots of data entry, emails, and writing reports in SharePoint or with comments and track changes in Word. Excel spreadsheets and databases. Absolutely everything is digitized, we send auto-emails and all communication is via Teams or Mail and very rarely over phone. Documents arrive digitally. All the collaboration is already online and there is no need for an office presence. Even when you are in office, you don’t even see the people for the work since it’s all online!</p>
<p>But they’ll look at FAANG and be like: “Ooh, they’re asking everyone to be back at the office because of better collaboration!” You clown, the collaboration happens the same regardless where my ass sits and we are not designers or knowledge workers solving issues, we handle data! We are not pioneers or a Silicon Valley tech firm!</p>
<p>Asking everyone back to the office for the supposed social aspect is truly the fruit-bowl-ification of it all. It’s about as convincing to work for you as the mention of the kicker table in your job listings. I like my coworkers, and I call them often just to talk, or create Teams meetings just to catch up in private matters and not a work meeting. But asking people back into the office to be more social and combat supposed isolation is dumb! The people who need this are not prevented to come in and do just that anyway. But you’re asking people to waste fuel and time commuting there, tired, sitting their ass off at a table for that? You’re asking me as an immunocompromised and chronically ill person in pain and dealing with fatigue to show up and do the same stuff I do at home so others can play family at work?</p>
<p>Babes, I am less social with the office than without. When I come home from the office I lie in bed and that’s it. I am drained. I haven’t had the time or energy to see the people I truly care about much. This isolates me more. When I get sick from it (like last year at the Christmas function when someone brought Covid!) I am isolated at home. And for what, so people who insist on office time have someone they see in the hallway on the way to the toilet?</p>
<p>They haven’t taken it away yet, but the threat seems to always be there and often serves as a way to enact pressure or as a bargaining chip. Behave or we can’t do that anymore, it’s a privilege not a right, we do this out of goodwill, some people abuse this and so on.</p>
<p>Home office is the only way for many people to have a decent work output because family, household, caretaking, further education, illness and free time activities are better taken care of this way and people can work focused in silence without noise and interruption.  It lessens stress and burnout and allows people to see more of their loved ones - much more meaningful socially than office interactions.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t had home office possibilities, I would’ve been gone from work for 8 months minimum due to my illness. But this way, I was still able to do the daily work, launch new features needed in our database, sign stuff as a representative and more. Home office is so important for disabled and chronically ill people to get and retain employment, and team members and coworkers deserve it as well to not have to take over someone else’s work for so long just because of a refusal to let people work from home. You cannot dangle what people need to effectively work in front of them like a carrot and subtly threaten to take it away. It’s ableist. You wouldn’t dare to do that with elevators or other accessibility features at the office, so don’t do it with that either.</p>
<p>And that’s also what I sent the staff council and our disability representative at work. So far, I received positive feedback for that.</p>
<p>The past few years but especially this year, I saw my coworkers bust their ass to make it all work. More work, more responsibilities, no extra hires, no pay increase. I busted my ass to make it all work despite my illness. Twice in a row in my three years in that spot, I got a performance bonus for my great work. Well, they told us all this year there won’t be any for anyone despite it all.</p>
<p>If they take away or severely limit home office too, I’m throwing, man. Then do your shit alone and drive all the young capable people away, in the place where like 50% of the work force will retire in the next 5 years. Fuck around and find out.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The recently announced Oort-cloud comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) is remarkable in at least three respects: (i) it was discovered inbound as far as ~29 au from the Sun (with prediscovery images up to ~34 au); (ii) it showed cometary activity already at almost 24 au; and (iii) its nuclear magnitude (Hr ~ 8.0) indicates an exceptionally large object. Detection of gases is expected in the upcoming years as the comet is heading towards a ~11 au perihelion in 2031. We used ALMA in extended configuration (resolution ~0.064") to measure the 1287 um (233 GHz) continuum flux of the comet. Observations were performed on August 8, 2021 at a 20.0 au distance from the Sun. The high spatial resolution was chosen in order to filter out any dust contribution. We detected the thermal emission of the object at ~10 sigma, with a flux of 0.128+/-0.012 mJy. Based on observational constraints and our theoretical estimates of the dust contribution, the entirety of the measured flux can be attributed to the nucleus. From NEATM modelling combined with the Hr magnitude, we determine a surface-equivalent diameter of 137+/-17 km and a red geometric albedo of 5.3+/-1.2 %. This confirms that 2014 UN271 is by far the largest Oort-cloud object ever found (almost twice as large as comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp), and except for the Centaur 95P/Chiron which shows outburst-like activity, the largest known comet in the Solar System. On the other hand, the object albedo is typical of comets, adding credence for a "universal" comet nucleus albedo. With its distant perihelion and uniquely large size, 2014 UN271 is the prominent archetype of distant comets, whose activity is driven by hypervolatiles. Post-perihelion thermal measurements will permit to study possible albedo changes, such as a surface brightening compared to pre-perihelion, as was observed for Hale-Bopp.
