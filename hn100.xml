  <p>Recently a Dutch hacker was able to take control of 4 million solar panel installations
(<a href="https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/hacker-kan-stekker-uit-zonnepanelen-trekken-en-stroomnet-platleggen?share=vxhD9wJigd%2BV9Hxm%2FzJhJ8Ki24WROlg0mGxB7I%2B3Sbp08mD0JfFSgg9OfCbaxdU%3D">FTM, Dutch</a> and
<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/hacker-shines-spotlight-on-vulnerability-of-solar-panels-installed-in-europe/">Euractiv, English</a>). And this wasn’t the first time either something like this has
happened (<a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/06/dutch-agency-investigates-cybersecurity-of-pv-inverters-after-hack/">PV Magazine</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual, huge thanks are due to the many beta readers and experts who helped improve this article with their feedback, valuable insights and knowledge! This post was machine translated (not too well) <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/de-gigantische-en-ongereguleerde-elektriciteitscentrales-in-de-cloud/">from the original Dutch version</a>, which was also more focused on The Netherlands. What follows mostly applies to EU countries, but if you squint, you can also read it from a more international perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The short version: most consumer and business solar panels are centrally managed by a handful of companies, mostly from countries outside of Europe. In the Netherlands alone, these solar panels generate a power output equivalent to at least 25 medium sized nuclear power plants. There are almost no rules or laws in Europe governing these central administrators. We pretend that these companies only deserve the regulation we’d apply to (say) an online birthday calendar.</p>
<p>These cloud-based management platforms could, by accident, after a hack, or intentionally, simultaneously shut down all their millions of solar panels (permanently). And then the entire European electricity grid would collapse. Given the recent findings of fine ethical hackers (<a href="https://www.divd.nl/newsroom/articles/divd-responsibly-discloses-six-new-zero-day-vulnerabilities-to-vendor/">DivD</a>) and the confirmation from Dutch electricity network manager (TSO) TenneT, this is not a theoretical scenario.</p>
<p>We’ve sleepwalked into this situation – individual solar panels can’t cause much damage, and didn’t need too many rules. But over time, the number of installations has increased enormously, and their management (needlessly) has become concentrated on just a few places, with lots of new risks as a consequence.</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/panel-panel-english.png"></p>

</center>
<p>Things can’t go on like this. The central capability to shut down gigawatts of power must be removed, or we need to regulate the central administrators as energy companies. It is one or the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://topsectorenergie.nl/documents/1241/2024-Secura-Publicatieversie-Scenarios_en_Maatregelen_Cyberweerbare_Zonnestroo_vqXh809.pdf">We are now more vulnerable than ever</a>, since in a country like The Netherlands, 15 GW of power is currently controlled from far-off places, and we don’t even know exactly by whom. And those parties fall under virtually no law or regulation. The same thing goes for heat pumps, home batteries, and EV charging points, by the way.</p>
<p>The upcoming EU NIS2 directive offers some opportunities for improvement, but it’s necessary to make this explicit. Otherwise the concentrated solar power suppliers will claim not to fall under this regulation. Industry group SolarPower Europe <a href="https://api.solarpowereurope.org/uploads/Solar_Power_Europe_2024_A_harmonised_cybersecurity_baseline_for_solar_PV_cbfbbd0f1b.pdf">has also called for explicit NIS2 rules for solar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-longer-story">The longer story</h2>
<p>I’m not telling anything new on this page, but I would like to summarize this terrible situation. First of all, we must thank <a href="https://nluug.nl/evenementen/nluug/voorjaarsconferentie-2018/talks/willem-westerhof-how-an-intern-hacked-the-power-grid/">Willem
Westerhof</a> who has been trying to get attention for this problem since 2016.</p>
<p>Willem worked together with his employer <a href="https://www.secura.com/">Secura</a> on a recent large report for the Dutch “Topsector Energie” about the problematic situation.</p>
<p>So, what’s going on. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_grid_of_Continental_Europe">Synchronous Grid of Continental Europe</a> is a massive achievement, integrated over most of Europe and even beyond. It enables us to share the capacity of thousands of large power stations (solar panels, wind turbines) with each other.</p>
<p>Besides these large power generators, there are also tens of millions of European households and companies that contribute to the grid with solar panels.</p>
<p>The power grid must be balanced at all times. Exactly as much energy must be fed into the network as is used in that instance. If too much power goes onto the network, it
leads to an elevated frequency and possibly excess voltage. And vice versa, too little power leads to a depressed frequency. To protect the European network, parts of countries or entire countries could then be disconnected, with devastating consequences. Getting the network back on track afterwards is quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Recently, for example, there was an international outage <a href="https://www.voxnews.al/english/aktualitet/raporti-i-fshehte-shqiperia-shkaktoi-kolapsin-energjitik-ne-qershor-i69928">in Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and
Croatia</a>, and that was no fun at all.</p>
<p>That’s why we set high standards for large power providers. Their power plants are under surveillance, their equipment must meet many requirements, and personnel must have the right diplomas and certifications. Incidents are investigated, and fines can be levied. European networks and providers are continuously working together to keep the network stable and safe.</p>
<p>But who regulates the gigantic power output from Europe’s solar panels?</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-regulate">What we do regulate</h2>
<p>A solar panel can not be connected directly to the grid; there’s an
<em>inverter</em> between the panel and the network. This device converts the power from the panel into a form that the electrical grid can handle.</p>
<p>These devices must meet rules, including rules that say when an installation should disconnect itself from an over-full local network (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2016_112_R_0001">see article
13</a> of the Rules for Generators). There are also rules on how inverters should be connected physically So, this part is (in theory) well taken care of. A single inverter can’t do much damage to the broader power grid. It might blow up your fuses though.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, we have decided that only inverters approved by the Belgian <a href="https://www.synergrid.be/nl/">Synergrid</a> may be installed (<a href="https://www.netbeheernederland.nl/publicatie/lijst-van-omvormers-rfg-type">see publication from
NetbeheerNederland</a>). However, insiders tell me that we never enforce this and lots of stuff is connected to the grid.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-are-not-regulating">What we are not regulating</h2>
<p>Most inverters are directly or indirectly linked to the internet. The setup makes a connection with its manufacturer, and uploads statistics about the solar panels and power production.</p>
<p>The owner of the panels and inverters can meanwhile establish a connection with that manufacturer using an app or website, and <em>via the manufacturer</em> see how their own panels are doing:</p>
<center>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/cloud-solar-panel-english.webp"></p>
</div>
</center>
<p>It wasn’t necessary from a technical standpoint to let everything run through the manufacturer’s servers, but it was chosen to do it this way. Almost all consumer devices now work like this. Compare surveillance cameras or modern cars. Everyone seems to want to do something with your data somehow!</p>
<p>Through the website or app, the owner can not only see how things are going with the panels, but these can also be turned on and off. It’s also possible to install new <em>software</em> (firmware) on the inverters via the manufacturer, either automatically or manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turning the power on or off can also happen if your own app doesn’t have a button for it. There is support to do so for use by installers/mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="and-thats-when-things-get-exciting">And that’s when things get exciting</h2>
<p>Because everything runs through the manufacturer, they are able to turn all panels on and off. Or install software on the inverters so that the <em>wrong</em> current flows into the grid. Now, a manufacturer won’t do this intentionally, but it is easy enough to mess this up.</p>
<p>As an example, computer security company CrowdStrike also installs new software automatically for users, and recently an error in an update caused millions of computers worldwide to crash, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident">costing days and billions to fix</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that the manufacturer gets hacked, and subsequently sends out attacker controlled and wrong software updates to the inverters, with possibly dire consequences.</p>
<p>There are also people that claim that the many Chinese companies managing our power panels for us might <em>intentionally</em> want to harm us. Who knows.</p>
<p>In these exciting times, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">this situation is not robust or trustworthy enough</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-then">What can happen then?</h2>
<p>Above, we saw that the electrical network is very sensitive. There must be exactly as much power going in as out. To make this possible, various generators stand by to add more power, or remove it, when imbalances occur.</p>
<p>Beyond this “fine tuning”, there is also larger capacity available to <a href="https://netztransparenz.tennet.eu/electricity-market/about-the-electricity-market/balancing-markets/">relatively quickly (for example) absorb a failed
power plant</a>.</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/Overview_of_balancing_process.png">
The three levels of balancing. Source: <a href="https://netztransparenz.tennet.eu/electricity-market/about-the-electricity-market/balancing-markets/">TenneT</a>.</p>

</center>
<p>This is managed so well that we even account for partial solar eclipses (which lead to a predictable reduction in solar power). It’s really very impressive.</p>
<p>The exciting thing is that manufacturers of solar inverter panels can switch the power on or off for millions of installations at people’s homes, or on the roofs of businesses.</p>
<p>And if you turn all those panels off at the right moment, half of the European power grid collapses. The largest players manage far more power than the balancing methods (FCR, aFFR, mFFR) could ever handle. TenneT, the Dutch transport operator, has indicated the grid could absorb a 3 GW disruption. In total (including large installations), there are now over 25 GW of solar panels installed in the Netherlands, much more than that 3 GW. There is a single inverter
manufacturer that globally controls 195 GW, with probably half of that located in Europe.</p>
<p>Also very alarming is that Dutch ethical hackers Wietse Boonstra and Hidde Smit (impressive people) managed to modify software <em>in</em> solar panel installations, <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21881">without permission from the
manufacturer</a>. This makes the damage you can cause much greater, and also much slower to resolve. Because that software can seriously mess with the power grid, or possibly even permanently disrupt an installation.</p>
<h2 id="oh-no">Oh no</h2>
<p>If you had a control panel to switch off dozens of nuclear reactors simultaneously, you’d have to comply with all kinds of safety regulations, and inspectors would come by to check if you were doing it right. This applies also to large solar and wind installations, by the way.</p>
<p>Because inverters and solar panels at home are “ordinary” consumer appliances, there is no inspection and no legislation. This makes sense since a single installation can’t cause that much damage.</p>
<p>But because we didn’t pay attention, the management of those “consumer appliances” has now moved to just a few suppliers who, on sunny days, even measured individually, control a significant part of our power supply.</p>
<center>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/nuclear-control.webp"><br>
The power of 25 medium-sized (“Borssele”) nuclear reactors all in one handy app!</p>
</div></center>
<p>And we regulate these large suppliers just as strictly as an online birthday calendar, which is to say: almost not at all.</p>
<h2 id="and-now">And now?</h2>
<p>Some steps are being taken. The recent Secura report commissioned by the Dutch <a href="https://topsectorenergie.nl/documents/1241/2024-Secura-Publication-Version-Scenarios_and_Measures_Cybersecurity_for_Solar_PV.pdf">Topsector
Energie</a> is very valuable in determining just how bad things are.</p>
<p>This all screams for legislation of course. For now, the big central management platforms mostly escape legislation. The panels in the field must individually comply with <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2016_112_R_0001">(lightweight)
rules</a>. And the website where you manage those panels is considered to be just a website, and not part of the power grid.</p>
<p>At least, that is how we look at things now. To improve this situation quickly, it might be possible to start regarding these central management companies as “grid managers” instead of as birthday calendar managers. You’d have to read some laws very creatively to make this happen, I fear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a new directive is emerging at the European level, NIS2, which is being implemented in EU countries right now, but is not quite there yet.</p>
<p>This is a general directive that applies to all kinds of service providers. The directive states that “energy” falls under the category of “Very Critical Sectors”. So, there should be some room to improve things.</p>
<p><strong>Crucially, when EU member states implement this directive, they should make it very explicit that solar panel managers fall
under its scope, as long as they have the ability to install updates or switch many panels on or off.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, there is another European law in the making, the <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/">Cyber Resilience Act</a> (CRA). This law focuses on devices (inverters, panels), but I suspect that the accompanying central control panel, app and services will also be included (since your device won’t function without them). The CRA has strong hooks to require a high level of security.</p>
<p>SolarPower Europe, an interest group, <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/hacker-shines-spotlight-on-vulnerability-of-solar-panels-installed-in-europe/">has also thought about it</a> and
writes in <a href="https://api.solarpowereurope.org/uploads/Solar_Power_Europe_2024_A_harmonised_cybersecurity_baseline_for_solar_PV_cbfb.pdf">this document</a>: “In the context of the broad cybersecurity principles established in NIS2, <strong>requirements specific to the solar sector should be in place for its implementation</strong>. Such requirements should apply to entities that control sufficient capacities to disrupt the grid”. It also mentions that Australia and Germany already have rules, although they don’t enforce them. SolarPower Europe also mentions the Cyber Resilience Act in their report.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, why are all those panels centrally connected anyway? I’d like to know what my panels are doing, but you don’t need the internet for that. My (now somewhat older) panels have never been  connected to the internet. Despite this, I have beautiful graphs.
This requires a different way of working, but it is technically perfectly possible to connect directly with your own installation to get graphs. It would also be a good idea for cameras, washing machines, heat pumps, cars/charging stations, and <em>home batteries</em>. Since the last three also have the ability to disrupt the electricity grid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an interim step, we might need to demand that control panels stick to providing pretty graphs, and make it impossible to remotely switch panels/loaders/batteries on or off.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We are <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/publicspaces-digitale-autonomie-7-juni-2024/">sleepwalking</a> into a terrible situation where <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/5g-elephant-in-the-room/">a few
parties</a> have almost complete control over our entire energy supply, while these parties don’t fall under any energy law. We regulate them as if they were a normal website, which means we hardly regulate them at all.</p>
<p>We could creatively examine existing legislation to see if it offers possibilities to do something about it, but that looks to be tricky.</p>
<p>New laws are emerging that could help subject these parties to stricter rules. NIS2 and the Cyber Resilience Act appear suitable for this purpose. And to remove any doubt, it could be explicitly stated in the member state implementations that central management parties indeed fall under its scope, something <a href="https://www.solarpowereurope.org/advocacy/position-papers/setting-a-harmonised-cybersecurity-baseline-for-solar-pv">SolarPower Europe also advocates
for</a> (<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/hacker-shines-spotlight-on-vulnerability-of-solar-panels-installed-in-europe/">article in Euractiv</a>).</p>
<p>Because gigantic non-EU companies might not be impressed by individual country laws, it is essential to collaborate within the EU.</p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Max, Alex, and Austin, the team behind Sorcerer (<a href="https://sorcerer.earth/">https://sorcerer.earth</a>). Sorcerer builds weather balloons that last for over six months, collecting 1000x more data per dollar and reaching previously inaccessible regions.</p><p>In 1981, weather disasters caused $3.5 billion in damages in the United States. In 2023, that number was $94.9 billion (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series</a>). The National Weather Service spends billions annually on its network of weather balloons, satellites, and aircraft sensors – generating hundreds of terabytes of data every day. This data, called observation data, is fed into massive supercomputers running advanced physics to produce global weather forecasts. Despite this cost, there are still places in the US where we don't know what the temperature will be two days from now: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/how-accurate-is-the-weather-forecast/" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interacti...</a>. And for the rest of the world that lacks weather infrastructure? There’s always the Weather Rock: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock</a>.</p><p>The most important data for these forecasts come from vertical data ‘slices’ of the atmosphere, called soundings. Every day 2,500 single-use latex radiosondes are launched across the globe to collect these soundings. They stay aloft for about two hours before popping and falling back to Earth. Launch sites for these systems are sparse in Latin America and Africa, and they’re completely non-existent over oceans. This leaves about 80% of the globe with inadequate weather data for accurate predictions.</p><p>The coverage gap became painfully evident to Max and Alex during their time at Urban Sky. While building balloons for high-altitude aerial imaging, they kept running into a problem: no matter what weather forecast they used, they couldn’t get accurate wind predictions for the upper atmosphere. They tried all of the free and commercial forecast products, but none of them were accurate enough. Digging into it more, we learned that a big part of the problem was the lack of high-quality in-situ data at those altitudes.</p><p>To solve this problem, our systems ascend and descend between sea level and 65,000ft several times a day to collect vertical data soundings. Each vehicle (balloon + payload) weighs less than a pound and can be launched from anywhere in the world, per the FAA and ICAO reg. Here’s one we launched from Potrero Hill in SF, <a href="https://youtu.be/75fN5WpRWH0" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/75fN5WpRWH0</a> and here’s another near the Golden Gate Bridge, <a href="https://youtu.be/7yLmzLPUFVQ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/7yLmzLPUFVQ</a>. Although we can’t “drive” these balloons laterally, we can use opposing wind layers to target or avoid specific regions. Here’s what a few simulated flight paths look like, to give you an idea: <a href="https://youtu.be/F_Di8cjaEUY" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/F_Di8cjaEUY</a></p><p>Our payload uses a satellite transceiver for communications and a small, thin film solar panel array to generate power. In addition to the weather data, we also get real-time telemetry from the vehicles, which we use to optimize their flight paths. This includes maintaining the optimal spacing between balloons and steering them to a recovery zone at the end of their lifespan so we can recycle them.</p><p>These systems spend most of their time in the stratosphere which is an extremely unforgiving environment. We’ll often see temperatures as low as -80°C while flying near the equator. Throughout the day, we experience extreme temperature cycling as they ascend and descend through the atmosphere. We’ll often encounter 100mph+ wind shears near the boundary with the troposphere (the tropopause) that can rip apart the balloon envelope. These conditions make the stratosphere a very difficult place to deploy to prod.</p><p>The real magic of what we’re building will come into play when we have hundreds of these systems in the air over data-sparse regions. But even now, we can do useful and interesting things with them. Some of our early customers are companies who fly very big, very expensive things into the stratosphere. They use our balloons to give them a clear idea of what conditions are ahead of their operations, and we’re working on a forecast product specifically designed for the stratosphere.</p><p>The combination of long duration and low cost is novel. We can theoretically maintain thousands of balloons in the atmosphere at any given time for a tenth of the cost of one useful weather satellite. We’re also using the data we collect to train AI models that produce forecasts with better accuracy than existing numerical (supercomputer) forecasts. Because we’re collecting totally unique data over areas that lack observation, our models will maintain a consistent edge versus models that are only trained on open data.</p><p>We’re really excited to be launching Sorcerer here with you! We’d love to hear what you think. And if you find one of our balloons in the Bay Area: Sorry! It’s still a work in progress (and please get it back to us).</p><p>I’ll leave you all with a bonus video of Paul Buchheit launching one of our balloons, which we thought was pretty cool: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sngF9VvDzg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sngF9VvDzg</a></p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

        <summary>
            I classified the entirety of SafeDocs using a mixture of LLMs, Embeddings Models, XGBoost
            and just for fun some LinearRegressors. In the process I too created
            some really pretty graphs!

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>How would you classify all the pdfs in the internet? Well, that is
            what I tried doing this time.</p>
        <p>Lets begin with the mother of all datasets: Common Crawl or CC is a
            web archive of all of the internet, it currently is petabytes in size
            and has been running since 2007. Maybe, you know about the <a href="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/archive.org">Internet Archive</a> which
            is almost the same but
            with the main difference being that Common Crawl focuses more on
            archiving the internet for scientists and researchers instead of digital
            preservation.</p>
        <p>What this translates into is that CC doesn’t save all of the pdfs
            when it finds them. Specifically, when Common Crawl gets to a pdf, it
            just stores the first megabyte of information and truncates the
            rest.</p>
        <p>This is where <a href="https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/file-corpora/cc-main-2021-31-pdf-untruncated/">SafeDocs</a>
            or CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED enters the picture. This corpus was
            originally created by the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/safe-documents">DARPA SafeDocs
                program</a> and what it did was refetch all the different pdfs from a
            snapshot of Common Crawl to have untruncated versions of them. This
            dataset is incredibly big, it has roughly 8.4~ million pdfs that
            uncompressed total 8TB. This corpus is the biggest pure pdf dataset on
            the internet<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>So I tried classifying it because it doesn’t sound that hard.</p>
        <h2 id="dataset-generation">Dataset generation</h2>
        <p>Lets define what classifying all of this pdfs using different labels
            actually means. For example: I wanted to tag a <em>Linear Algebra</em>
            pdf as <em>Math</em> or an <em>Anatomy</em> textbook as
            <em>Medicine</em>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/fineweb_edu_pipeline.svg" alt="Training pipeline for the embeddings model in FineWeb-Edu">
            
        </figure>
        <p>The reason for all of this is because I wanted to use LLMs in my
            personal projects and I got this idea after reading the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1">Fineweb
                technical blog / paper</a>. The FineWeb team endedup creating a subset
            for “educational” content based on the bigger FineWeb dataset. What they
            did was use a Teacher and student approach where the LLM generates
            labels from unstructured text and then you train a smaller student or
            “distilled” learner capable of classifying based on the labels
            generated.</p>
        <p>So I decided to follow the same approach. The problem is that 8TB of
            data is still a lot of information. I don’t have 8TB laying around, but
            we can be a bit more clever. The original dataset has the metadata
            available for download. Its only 8GB of pure text!</p>
        <p>In particular I cared about a specific column called
            <code>url</code>. I really care about the urls because they essentially
            tell us a lot more from a website than what meats the eye. For
            example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf</code></pre>
        <p>Specifically this part:</p>
        <pre><code>Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf</code></pre>
        <p>Tells us a lot of information.</p>
        <p>I know that this url is going to be <em>education</em> or
            <em>technology</em> adjacent. For now, lets just say its education
            because it has the “Introduction” part in its name.
        </p>
        <p>Here is where the bit of prompt engineering that I used enters the
            picture.</p>
        <h3 id="few-shot-prompting">Few shot prompting</h3>
        <p>Few shot prompting is a fancy name for making an LLM learn with
            examples without training it. Its a really cool trick that you can use
            to make the models outputs more coherent and consistent. I am going to
            give you an extremely easy example of how one of this prompts look
            like:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/few_shot_prompting.gif" alt="Few Shot prompting example of an addition">
            
        </figure>
        <p>This might feel like magic if it is the first time you are using it,
            but LLMs are incredible at following patterns and just showing how to do
            things can make it improve their performance.</p>
        <p>Using this method I generated 100k labels (to start) using this
            specific <a href="https://github.com/snat-s/m/blob/main/classify_metadata/prompt.txt">prompt</a>
            and the Llama-3-70B model through the <a href="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/together.ai">together</a>
            API.</p>
        <p>The distribution of 100k labels looks originally like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pdf_classification_piechart.png" alt="Distribution of 100k labels">
            
        </figure>
        <p>So, as you can see, there is a lot of really small data points that
            are going to be extremely annoying to classify. So guess what I’m going
            to do? I’m going to ditch anything with less than 250 labels and label
            them as <code>other</code> just to keep the most frequent classes.</p>
        <p>Because this labels are unbalanced, I decided to balance them and
            just take 5k samples at the most of each possible label. This left me
            with a total of 59k labels:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pdf_classification_piechart_equally_distributed.png" alt="59k label pie chart, more distributed">
            
        </figure>
        <p>With this newly minted dataset, I decided to start going after the
            training of the new student classifier!</p>
        <h2 id="model-training">Model Training</h2>
        <h3 id="idea-1">Idea 1</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/embeddings.svg" alt="Example of embeddings">
            
        </figure>
        <p>I am going to introduce the idea of an embeddings model. For short,
            an embeddings model is a model capable of passing things like text,
            images, video or any other “unstructured” information to vectors in an
            ndimensional space with semantic meaning. In other words, you can have
            some points that are near each other like dog, cat, elephant and this
            ones are going to be separated from something like car, truck or
            vehicle.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, this models are great for generating clusters of
            meaning. This is going to be extremely useful for us, because we are
            going to just make this model be capable of classifying the specific
            labels that we ended up having through a process called finetuning.</p>
        <p>Finetuning is were you grab an already trained model for a generic
            task and just train it a little bit more for your particular problem.
            This case being classification. If you want to learn more about
            finetuning you should check out the first <a href="https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html">fast.ai
                lecture</a>
            where they finetune a model.</p>
        <p>In the FineWeb paper, they used a total of 500k labels. Thats a lot
            more than what I currently had, but at the time, I decided to ignore
            this<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I went on with my
            life and decided
            to just start testing some models. And oh boy, I realized that you can
            do a lot with just a gaming laptop.</p>
        <p>In FineWeb Edu they used a specific embeddings model based on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m">snowflake-arctic-embed-m</a>.
            But it is not the best embeddings model based on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">Massive Text
                Embeddings Benchmark</a>. So I decided to try some models that ranked
            really well in here. The problem with this benchmark is that most of the
            models are too big, with roughly 7B parameters, I can not afford to run
            that and expect it to classify 8 million pdfs quickly. So I decided to
            instead go for the next best thing, <a href="https://huggingface.co/dunzhang/stella_en_400M_v5">Stella_en_400M</a>.
            But the problem was that I wanted to read how it worked and I don’t
            really like when a model is published and you go to a Github link that
            has a <strong>TODO: add the rest of info</strong> in their README.</p>
        <p>So, I decided to try out a range of models including the base model
            for Stella called gte-large-1.5 and Arctic Embed. Along with others like
            all-mpnet-base, distillbert, flant-t5-small and bert-base-uncased.</p>
        <p>Finetuning a model is pretty simple with Huggingface because it
            abstracts a lot of the code from you and thanks to just freezing the
            main model and training the embeddings and the classifier head I could
            run the entire thing in my laptop without the need of an external GPU<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. After a series of runs, I found
            that for my problem the most performant model was
            <code>Alibaba-large-gte-1.5</code>, it got up to 59.14% of accuracy.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/accuracy_first_experiments.png" alt="accuracy of different models through time">
            
        </figure>
        <p>I was a bit disappointed at this point because I had paid for a bunch
            of labels and it seemed that I needed to be more careful on the training
            or generate a bigger dataset.</p>
        <p>But in my true lowest moment, I remembered that XGBoost existed. Yes,
            this story is going to become an traditional ML story.</p>
        <h3 id="idea-2">Idea 2</h3>
        <p>For those of you in the know, you could see this coming, XGBoost is
            THE undisputed king of tabular data, it currently is the state of the
            art. If you don’t know the internals for XGBoost, I’m not explaining it
            in detail but don’t worry about it, the <a href="https://youtu.be/OtD8wVaFm6E?si=jDFbWR25-FakqryZ">StatsQuest
                Youtube Channel</a> has an amazing series of videos where they explain
            them in like two hours.</p>
        <p>For now, think about XGBoost as the <code>if else</code> version of
            AI. They are THE simple transparent box that classifies extremely
            well.</p>
        <p>This time, I am going to reframe the problem. Do you remember that
            the model that I used in the first place was really good at generating
            this embeddings? Well, what if this embeddings could be used to train
            another model? What if we could pass from having text to training on
            tabular data? This time the pipeline to train the model would look like
            the following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/xgb_pipeline.svg" alt="xgboost training pipeline">
            
        </figure>
        <p>Another big extra from this would be that I can run a lot more
            experiments because training an XGBoost model is way faster than
            training an embeddings model. So I decided to generate all of the
            embeddings for the PDF links. Generating all of the embeddings is a
            total of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiagopedroza/url-embeddings-cc-provenance">40GBs</a>
            uncompressed.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last change that I decided to do was to train simpler
            models. Instead of training a big classifier, it could potentially be
            better to just train a binary classifier per class. This idea I learned
            from an old <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/xgboost-baseline-0-680">Kaggle
                competition</a>. Thanks you <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte">Chris</a>! The main idea behind
            this is to have tiny models that are really good capable of super fast
            inference for specific problems, instead of trying to solve all of it
            with just one big model.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, the combined models have this as result!</p>
        <pre><code>Average Performance:
accuracy     0.839750
precision    0.859758
recall       0.819733
f1           0.838937</code></pre>
        <p>This approach is already winning against the original naïve deep
            learning approach that I had by <strong>24.83%</strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="idea-3">Idea 3</h3>
        <p>But guess what? You don’t actually need deep learning to generate
            embeddings. You can just split the text into smaller parts and count the
            occurrences of it. There is a this thing called TFIDF (Term
            Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) that is almost that but it has a
            fancier formula. TFIDF is a numerical statistic that reflects how
            important a word is to a document in a collection. It’s calculated
            as:</p>
        <pre><code>TFIDF(t,d,D) = TF(t,d) * IDF(t,D)

Where:
TF(t,d) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)
IDF(t,D) = log(Total number of documents in corpus D / Number of documents containing term t)</code></pre>
        <p>This method assigns higher weights to terms that are frequent in a
            specific document but rare across the entire corpus, making it great for
            feature extraction in text analysis. So I decided to go full on out and
            just go back to the basics of NLP. To my surprise, the resulting models
            where not complete garbage!</p>
        <p>They were actually capable of predicting something that wasn’t as bad
            as I was expecting:</p>
        <pre><code>Average Performance:
accuracy     0.675200
precision    0.683185
recall       0.646316
f1           0.662497</code></pre>
        <p>Better than my naïve approach!</p>
        <p>I even trained a Linear Regressor ensemble that is better than the
            baseline deep learning model.</p>
        <pre><code>Average Performance:
accuracy     0.706802
precision    0.723558
recall       0.663038
f1           0.690286</code></pre>
        <p>This is the moment where I felt that I messed up and I should have
            gone back to the basics. If the point of this was actual production, I
            would be happy with this models!</p>
        <p>But lets be real, I am just having fun in here, I don’t really care
            about what is the best, I want to try new things and I won’t let Deep
            Learning down.</p>
        <h3 id="idea-4">Idea 4</h3>
        <p>Back to the world of Deep Learning, at the end of the day, all of
            this are just experiments and I wanted to see how far I could stretch my
            capacity of using a single Deep Learning Classifier. My goal was
            extremely simple. I wanted to get to at least 70% accuracy.</p>
        <p>The first thing that I made was generate a lot more labels, I feel
            like I did Deep Learning a disservice by using so little data. So I
            generate another 400k labels using Llama3.1-7B (this time a smaller
            model because I don’t want to break the bank on inference).</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/accuracy_for_new_dataset.png" alt="Some of the runs I did for the new dataset">
            
        </figure>
        <p>I did some experiments and to not bore you I saw that the more data
            the better for my specific runs. So I decided to just do a dry run with
            two different models, this time, influenced by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783">The Llama 3
                Herd of Models</a>
            from Meta I used the <code>roberta-base</code> model and the good old
            <code>gte-large</code> from before.
        </p>
        <p><code>gte-large</code> got me a lot closer to what I was expecting
            with results of up to 69.22% accuracy on the training dataset[2].</p>

        <p>I genuinely think that it was a skill issue from my side that I was
            uncapable of making the Deep Learning model perform at the top of the
            performance chart. Anyways, for now I am just going to grab the best
            model which was the XGBoost embeddings model and really dial it in
            because I want to do other projects in my free time.</p>
        <h3 id="hyper-parameter-sweep">Hyper Parameter Sweep</h3>
        <p>The last thing that I tried was a hyper parameter sweep on the
            XGBoost embeddings model because it was the most performant overall. A
            hyperparameter sweep is basically a way to move all the different nobs
            that the base model has so that it can perform to the best of its
            abilities.</p>

        <p>Now that we have some models, we can do the fun part and generate
            labels for the rest of the entire dataset!</p>
        <h2 id="classifying-all-the-corpus">Classifying all the corpus</h2>
        <p>The code is nothing fancy. It literally loads to memory some
            embeddings and then predicts them. The distribution of predictions looks
            like the following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/predictions_8448751_pie.png" alt="Distribution of predictions for XGBoost ensemble">
            
        </figure>
        <p>It took roughly an hour to predict all of the pdf tags but this was
            because I didn’t make it run on GPU because I forgot to set it up that
            way. But even then, I would have to say that it is not that bad times
            wise!</p>
        <p>Finally, I wanted to generate some incredibly aesthetically pleasing
            pictures. And after doing some test runs on my local machine I decided
            to do some PCA and UMAP visualizations of a looot of points. Like, ALL
            of the predictions + embeddings. I am pretty sure this are not the
            biggest runs of PCA and UMAP but they might be up there.</p>
        <p>For PCA I made a visualization of the entire dataset. All of the
            eight and a half million dots in a single picture:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pca_visualization_8448751_no_classes.png" alt="PCA of all the points">
            
        </figure>
        <p>For the classifications, it looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pca_visualization_8448751_samples.png" alt="PCA classification of all the points">
            
        </figure>
        <p>And if we decouple each class it looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pca_visualization_all_classes_no_na.png" alt="PCA classification decoupled">
            
        </figure>
        <p>Finally, for UMAP, I had to rent out a bigger machine and thanks to
            the kind sponsorship of some credit from my internship. I rented out a
            Standard_E48s_v3 from Azure, this machine has 48 cores, 384 GB RAM and
            768 GB disk. I ran only 6.5 million points through UMAP because 6.5
            million was the closest I could get the machine before it went out of
            memory. I have a screenshot that shows all of the might of UMAP draining
            the RAM.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/chonky_ram.jpg" alt="Chonky use of RAM">
            
        </figure>
        <p>So finally, for the UMAP visualization, it looks like the
            following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/umap_visualization_6500000_no_classes.png" alt="UMAP unclassified">
            
        </figure>
        <p>And the classifications look like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/umap_visualization_6500000_samples.png" alt="UMAP classified">
            
        </figure>
        <p>Per class plot looks like the following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/umap_visualization_all_classes_no_na.png" alt="UMAP classified">
            
        </figure>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I feel like it was a fun experience to do overall but I could have
            done a little bit better. Specifically with the Deep Learning stuff. At
            the time I hadn’t rented a lot GPUs and I was just using my laptop, so I
            got desperate and decided to call it quits in the sake of time. This
            article is already pretty long as it is.</p>
        <p>At the same time, its impressive to have gone this far. I really
            think that it is a big project that I got out this time. Considering
            that pdfs are a mixture of data and images, I think we are going to
            start seeing them more and more in training pipelines for VLMS/Omni
            models. If you want to try another massive dataset, you should try <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11271">MINT-1T</a> which has a mixture
            of PDFs + websites!</p>
        <p>After all of this, I can confidently tell you that even now, I am
            pretty sure you can do a lot better and you can easily surpass this.</p>
        <p>That is why, I am releasing all of the datasets in this <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/snats/url-classifications">huggingface
                repo</a>. If you are just interested in the embeddings, you can find
            them in Kaggle right <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiagopedroza/url-embeddings-cc-provenance">here</a>.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>An exciting feature <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D99517">just landed in the main branch of the Clang
compiler</a>. Using the <code>[[clang::musttail]]</code> or
<code>__attribute__((musttail))</code> statement attributes, you can now get guaranteed
tail calls in C, C++, and Objective-C.</p>



<p>While tail calls are usually associated with a functional programming style, I
am interested in them purely for performance reasons.  It turns out that in
some cases we can use tail calls to get better code out of the compiler than
would otherwise be possible—at least given current compiler
technology—without dropping to assembly.</p>

<p>Applying this technique to protobuf parsing has yielded amazing results: <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb/pull/310">we
have managed to demonstrate protobuf parsing at over
2GB/s</a>, more than double the
previous state of the art.  There are multiple techniques that contributed to
this speedup, so “tail calls == 2x speedup” is the wrong message to take away.
But tail calls are a key part of what made that speedup possible.</p>

<p>In this blog entry I will describe why tail calls are such a powerful
technique, how we applied them to protobuf parsing, and how this technique
generalizes to interpreters. I think it’s likely that all of the major language
interpreters written in C (Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, etc.) could get significant
performance benefits by adopting this technique.  The main downside is
portability: currently <code>musttail</code> is a nonstandard compiler extension, and
while I hope it catches on it will be a while before it spreads widely enough
that your system’s C compiler is likely to support it.  That said, at build
time you can compromise some efficiency for portability if you detect that
<code>musttail</code> is not available.</p>

<h2 id="tail-call-basics">Tail Call Basics</h2>

<p>A tail call is any function call that is in tail position, the final action to
be performed before a function returns.  When <em>tail call optimization</em> occurs,
the compiler emits a <code>jmp</code> instruction for the tail call instead of <code>call</code>.
This skips over the bookkeeping that would normally allow the callee <code>g()</code> to
return back to the caller <code>f()</code>, like creating a new stack frame or pushing the
return address.  Instead <code>f()</code> jumps directly to <code>g()</code> as if it were part of
the same function, and <code>g()</code> returns directly to whatever function called
<code>f()</code>. This optimization is safe because <code>f()</code>’s stack frame is no longer
needed once the tail call has begun, since it is no longer possible to access
any of <code>f()</code>’s local variables.</p>

<p>While this may seem like a run-of-the-mill optimization, it has two very
important properties unlock new possibilities in the kinds of algorithms we can
write.  First, it reduces the stack memory from from ++O(n)++ to ++O(1)++ when
making ++n++ consecutive tail calls, which is important because stack memory is
limited and stack overflow will crash your program.  This means that certain
algorithms are not actually safe to write unless this optimization is
performed.  Secondly, <code>jmp</code> eliminates the performance overhead of <code>call</code>, such
that a function call can be just as efficient as any other branch. These two
properties enable us to use tail calls as an efficient alternative to
normal iterative control structures like <code>for</code> or <code>while</code>.</p>

<p>This is by no means a new idea, indeed it goes back to at least 1977 when Guy
Steele wrote <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5753">an entire paper</a>
arguing that procedure calls make for cleaner designs than <code>GOTO</code>, and that
tail call optimization can make them just as fast. This was one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Scheme_programming_language#The_Lambda_Papers">“Lambda
Papers”</a>
written between 1975 and 1980 that developed many of the ideas underlying Lisp
and Scheme.</p>

<p>Tail call optimization is not even new to Clang: like GCC and many other
compilers, Clang was already capable of optimizing tail calls. In fact, the
<code>musttail</code> attribute in our first example above did not change the output of
the compiler at all: Clang would already have optimized the tail call under
<code>-O2</code>.</p>

<p>What is new is the <em>guarantee</em>. While compilers will often optimize tail calls
successfully, this is best-effort, not something you can rely on. In
particular, the optimization will most likely not happen in non-optimized
builds:</p>



<p>Here the tail call was compiled to an actual <code>call</code>, so we are back to ++O(n)++
stack space. This is why we need <code>musttail</code>: unless we can get a guarantee from
the compiler that our tail calls will <em>always</em> be optimized, in all build
modes, it isn’t safe to write algorithms that use tail calls for iteration.  It
would be a pretty severe limitation to have code that only works when
optimizations are enabled.</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble-with-interpreter-loops">The Trouble With Interpreter Loops</h2>

<p>Compilers are incredible pieces of technology, but they are not perfect.  Mike
Pall, author of LuaJIT, decided to write LuaJIT 2.x’s interpreter in assembly
rather than C, and he cites this decision as a major factor that explains <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/badl2/luajit_2_beta_3_is_out_support_both_x32_x64/c0lrus0/">why
LuaJIT’s interpreter is so
fast</a>.
He later went into more detail about <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2011-02/msg00742.html">why C compilers struggle with interpreter
main loops</a>.  His two
most central points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The larger a function is, and the more complex and connected its control
flow, the harder it is for the compiler’s register allocator to keep the most
important data in registers.</li>
  <li>When fast paths and slow paths are intermixed in the same function, the
presence of the slow paths compromises the code quality of the fast paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>These observations closely mirror our experiences optimizing protobuf parsing.
The good news is that tail calls can help solve both of these problems.</p>

<p>It may seem odd to compare interpreter loops to protobuf parsers, but the
nature of the protobuf wire format makes them more similar than you might
expect.  The protobuf wire format is a series of tag/value pairs, where the tag
contains a field number and wire type.  This tag acts similarly to an
interpreter opcode: it tells us what operation we need to perform to parse this
field’s data.  Like interpreter opcodes, protobuf field numbers can come in any
order, so we have to be prepared to dispatch to any part of the code at any
time.</p>

<p>The natural way to write such a parser is to have a <code>while</code> loop surrounding a
<code>switch</code> statement, and indeed this has been the state of the art in protobuf
parsing for basically as long as protobufs have existed. For example, <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/f763a2a86084371fd0da95f3eeb879c2ff26b06d/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.pb.cc#L2175-L2227">here is
some parsing code from the current C++ version of protobuf</a>.  If we represent the
control flow graphically, we get something like this:</p>

<center>
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRKuMNm6Tw_Sn2xJxBDQMHT0u0osp9DUA0Ldr-MhMVp63GPinzYB9JT0qRY9HTymmsesomq3aZe7QEs/pub?w=740">
</center>

<p>But this is incomplete, because at almost every stage there are things that
can go wrong.  The wire type could be wrong, or we could see some corrupt
data, or we could just hit the end of the current buffer.  So the full
control flow graph looks more like this.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTGgQuAThUGv9ejI_pjujfKRM8rgo7c5b8lP7uveSkJTkJMbZDrtDbJzmRA4HOoDozwjj9WWPlDu8JX/pub?w=740">
</center>

<p>We want to stay on the fast paths (in blue) as much as possible, but when we
hit a hard case we have to execute some fallback code to handle it.  These
fallback paths are usually bigger and more complicated than the fast paths,
touch more data, and often even make out-of-line calls to other functions to
handle the more complex cases.</p>

<p>Theoretically, this control flow graph paired with a profile should give the
compiler all of the information it needs to generate the most optimal code.  In
practice, when a function is this big and connected, we often find ourselves
fighting the compiler.  It spills an important variable when we want it to keep
it in a register.  It hoists stack frame manipulation that we want to shrink
wrap around a fallback function invocation.  It merges identical code paths
that we wanted to keep separate for branch prediction reasons.  The experience
can end up feeling like trying to play the piano while wearing mittens.</p>

<h2 id="improving-interpreter-loops-with-tail-calls">Improving Interpreter Loops With Tail Calls</h2>

<p>The analysis above is mainly just a rehash of of Mike’s <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2011-02/msg00742.html">observations about
interpreter main
loops</a>.  But instead of
dropping to assembly, as Mike did with LuaJIT 2.x, we found that a tail call
oriented design could give us the control we needed to get nearly optimal code
from C.  I worked on this together with my colleague Gerben Stavenga, who came
up with much of the design.  Our approach is similar to the design of the
<a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">wasm3 WebAssembly interpreter</a> which describes
this pattern as a <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3/blob/main/docs/Interpreter.md#m3-massey-meta-machine">“meta
machine”</a>.</p>

<p>The code for our 2+GB/s protobuf parser was submitted to
<a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb">upb</a>, a small protobuf library written
in C, in <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb/pull/310">pull/310</a>.  While it
is fully working and passing all protobuf conformance tests, it is not rolled
out anywhere yet, and the design has not been implemented in the C++ version of
protobuf.  But now that <code>musttail</code> is available in Clang (and <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb/pull/390">upb has been
updated to use it</a>), one of
the biggest barriers to fully productionizing the fast parser has been removed.</p>

<p>Our design does away with a single big parse function and instead gives each
operation its own small function.  Each function tail calls the next operation
in sequence.  For example here is a function to parse a single fixed-width
field.  (This code is simplified from the actual code in upb; there are many
details of our design that I am leaving out of this article, but will hopefully
cover in future articles).</p>

<p>For a function this small and simple, Clang gives us code that is
basically impossible to beat.</p>

<pre><code>upb_pf32_1bt:                           # @upb_pf32_1bt
        mov     rax, r9
        shr     rax, 24
        bts     r8, rax
        test    r9b, r9b
        jne     .LBB0_1
        mov     r10, r9
        shr     r10, 48
        mov     eax, dword ptr [rsi + 1]
        mov     dword ptr [rdx + r10], eax
        add     rsi, 5
        jmp     dispatch                        # TAILCALL
.LBB0_1:
        jmp     fallback                        # TAILCALL
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is no prologue or epilogue, no register spills, indeed there is
no usage of the stack whatsoever.  The only exits are <code>jmp</code>s from the two tail
calls, but no code is required to forward the parameters, because the arguments
are already sitting in the correct registers.  Pretty much the only improvement
we could hope for is to get a conditional jump for the tail call, <code>jne
fallback</code>, instead of <code>jne</code> followed by <code>jmp</code>.</p>

<p>If you were looking at a disassembly of this code without symbol information,
you would have no reason to know that this was an entire function. It could
just as easily be a basic block from a larger function.  And that, in essence,
is exactly what we are doing.  We are taking an interpreter loop that is
conceptually a big complicated function and programming it block by block,
transferring control flow from one to the next via tail calls.  We have full
control of the register allocation at every block boundary (well, for six
registers at least), and by using the same set of parameters for each function,
we eliminate the need to shuffle any values around from one call to the next.
As long as the function is simple enough to not spill those six registers,
we’ve achieved our goal of keeping our most important state in registers
throughout all of the fast paths.</p>

<p>We can optimize every instruction sequence independently, and crucially, the
compiler will treat each sequence as independent too because they are in
separate functions (we can prevent inlining with <code>noinline</code> if necessary).
This solves the problem we described earlier where the code from fallback paths
would degrade the code quality for fast paths. If we put the slow paths in
entirely separate functions from the fast paths, we can be guaranteed that
the fast paths will not suffer.  The nice assembly sequence we see above is
effectively frozen, unaffected by any changes we make to other parts of the
parser.</p>

<p>If we apply this pattern to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/badl2/luajit_2_beta_3_is_out_support_both_x32_x64/c0lrus0/">Mike’s example from
LuaJIT</a>,
we can more or less <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/K8Mo6hcGa">match his hand-written assembly with only minor code
quality defects</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>#define PARAMS unsigned RA, void *table, unsigned inst, \
               int *op_p, double *consts, double *regs
#define ARGS RA, table, inst, op_p, consts, regs
typedef void (*op_func)(PARAMS);
void fallback(PARAMS);

#define UNLIKELY(x) __builtin_expect(x, 0)
#define MUSTTAIL __attribute__((musttail))

void ADDVN(PARAMS) {
    op_func *op_table = table;
    unsigned RC = inst &amp; 0xff;
    unsigned RB = (inst &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff;
    unsigned type;
    memcpy(&amp;type, (char*)&amp;regs[RB] + 4, 4);
    if (UNLIKELY(type &gt; -13)) {
        return fallback(ARGS);
    }
    regs[RA] += consts[RC];
    inst = *op_p++;
    unsigned op = inst &amp; 0xff;
    RA = (inst &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff;
    inst &gt;&gt;= 16;
    MUSTTAIL return op_table[op](ARGS);
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting assembly is:</p>

<pre><code>ADDVN:                                  # @ADDVN
        movzx   eax, dh
        cmp     dword ptr [r9 + 8*rax + 4], -12
        jae     .LBB0_1
        movzx   eax, dl
        movsd   xmm0, qword ptr [r8 + 8*rax]    # xmm0 = mem[0],zero
        mov     eax, edi
        addsd   xmm0, qword ptr [r9 + 8*rax]
        movsd   qword ptr [r9 + 8*rax], xmm0
        mov     edx, dword ptr [rcx]
        add     rcx, 4
        movzx   eax, dl
        movzx   edi, dh
        shr     edx, 16
        mov     rax, qword ptr [rsi + 8*rax]
        jmp     rax                             # TAILCALL
.LBB0_1:
        jmp     fallback
</code></pre>

<p>The only opportunity for improvement I see here, aside from the <code>jne fallback</code>
issue mentioned before, is that for some reason the compiler doesn’t want to
generate <code>jmp qword ptr [rsi + 8*rax]</code>. Instead it prefers to load into <code>rax</code>
and then follow with <code>jmp rax</code>.  These are minor code generation issues that
could hopefully be fixed in Clang without too much work.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>One of the biggest caveats with this approach is that these beautiful assembly
sequences get catastrophically pessimized if any non tail calls are present.
Any non tail call forces a stack frame to be created, and a lot of data spills
to the stack.</p>

<p>To avoid this, we tried to follow a discipline of only calling other functions
via inlining or tail calls.  This can get annoying if an operation has multiple
points at which an unusual case can occur that is not an error.  For example,
when we are parsing protobufs, the fast and common case is that varints are
only one byte long, but longer varints are not an error.  Handling the unusual
case inline can compromise the quality of the fast path if the fallback code is
too complicated.  But tail calling to a fallback function gives no way of
easily resuming the operation once the unusual case is handled, so the fallback
function must be capable of pushing forward and completing the operation.  This
leads to code duplication and complexity.</p>

<p>Ideally this issue could be solved by adding
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#preserve-most"><code>__attribute__((preserve_most))</code></a>
to the fallback functions and then calling them normally, without tail calls.
The <code>preserve_most</code> attribute makes the callee responsible for preserving
nearly all registers, which moves the cost of the register spills to the
fallback functions where we want it.  We experimented some with this attribute
but ran into some mysterious problems that we were not able to get to the
bottom of.  It may have been an error on our part; revisiting this is future
work.  <em>[<strong>Update: 2023-03-14:</strong> it turns out this was a bug in Clang, which was
<a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D141020">fixed two months ago</a>]</em></p>

<p>The other major limitation is that <code>musttail</code> is not portable.  I very much
hope that the attribute will catch on, spreading to GCC, Visual C++, and other
popular compilers, and even get standardized someday.  But that day is far off,
so what to do in the meantime?</p>

<p>When <code>musttail</code> is not available, we need to perform at least one true
<code>return</code>, without a tail call, for every conceptual loop iteration.  We have
not yet implemented this fallback in upb, but I expect it will involve a macro
that either tail calls to dispatch or just returns, based on the availability
of musttail.</p>

<p>One can choose to focus on the car crash, or the lessons learned from the car crash.</p>



<p>Let’s do a little of both.</p>



<p>The proposition of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/livingcomputermuseum.org" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/livingcomputermuseum.org">Living Computer Museum</a> was initially simple, and rather amusing in a <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/10/26/1826239/living-computer-museum-opens-to-public-in-seattle">Slashdot-baity</a> sort of way: You could apply to get an account on a real, actual ancient Mainframe hooked up to the Internet, which meant you could literally connect into real, actual ancient hardware. I assure you that to a segment of the population, this is an irresistible proposition. It’s also, ultimately, one that even the most ardent fans of “how it was” will leaf away from, because mainframes are their own wacky old world, like using a taffy-pull hook, and appeal on a day-to-day basis to a relative handful of die-hards.</p>



<p>But in 2011, the Living Computer Museum announced itself with the kind of slick webpage that promised computer history buffs a new wonderland.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to take in with this verbiage, but let’s keep going, for now.</p>



<p>In 2012, the Living Computer Museum opened its actual, physical doors to the public in Seattle. A year later, I visited. It was rather nice. I got a grand and lovely tour by some very polite and friendly people, some of whom I’d known for years. The rooms, well appointed, well-lit, and in the case of the machine rooms, done to a sparkling arrangement, clamored for my attention and approval.</p>

<p>There were computer museums for years, decades before Living Computer Museum, scattered among the United States and the world. I’ve been to many of them – sometimes as an honored guest and backstage VIP, and sometimes just because I hastily read my “find me weirdo geek stuff” Google Maps results and negotiated public transit to walk into the door and walk around like a strutting mayor to see what’s what. In that pantheon, I would put LCM in the realm of “very well appointed, especially the mainframes” but not in the realm of “nobody, ever, has ever tried anything like this”. Just off the top of my head, the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum in Mountain View</a> has brought not just mainframes and historical computers back from oblivion, but hosted events in which their maintainers and figures have gotten a chance to get their stories on record.</p>



<p>Still, one couldn’t argue with it – the LCM was a solid new outpost in Telling Computer History, and it was on my shortlist of potential homes for materials I might donate in the future. I had a lovely conversation with a member of management about how they maintained functionality and also what their contingencies were for any sort of “endgame” that might befall the endeavor. He assured me they had storage aplenty, in the extremely unlikely event they had to face a closure. Ultimately I didn’t donate my materials there, simply because I found nearer geographic or mission-aligning homes.</p>



<p>My next, and it turns out last, major visit to the Living Computer Museum (outside of a few drive-bys) came in 2018, when I spoke at an event being held there. This gifted me with a chance to see how things had changed in 5 years, and how they had.</p>

<p>Here, then, was something approaching a dream. We had the display cases of technology and the clean carpets and cathedral ceilings of available space, filled not just with computers on desks but entire computer-related environments: classroom, arcade, basement, that showed youngsters what sort of context these computers had lived in.  I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyndemoya/?originalSubdomain=au">Cynde Moya</a>, who had been described to me years earlier as a hard-nosed disciplined caretaker of the materials, and who turned out to be everything they said except hard-nosed – a truly dear overseer of things physical within these walls. </p>



<p>This was April 2018. I lived in the world I live all the time: full of hope, equally full of expectation of doom. But hope was winning.</p>



<p>In October of 2018, Paul Allen was dead.</p>

<p>I suppose everyone has opinions on billionaries, their position in the world, what they represent, and maybe almost everyone has, spoken or unspoken, an awareness that the level of money billions represents disengages you, whether you think so or not, from humanity.</p>



<div><p>I mean, sure, they cry, laugh, stub their toe, wonder if that’s rain coming, get surprised when the killer’s revealed in a well-done noir thriller. But there’s this cloud of wealth that is ever-present and depending on how it is maintained, or manifested, it slowly bleaches out the edges of living until you realize there is a shocking serenity in their countenance, a noise-cancelling blur that surrounds them, because there are always people whose job is to be aware of them and whose job is to ensure the serenity is maintained. </p><p>And there’s the sheer spending power of a billion. I’m sure I could toss out a hundred funny examples of the sheer numerical force of a billion dollars. For example, you could have someone buy a 2025 Subaru Outback, itself the rough amount on the lower end (nationally) of a Domino’s Pizza General Manager’s yearly salary before taxes, and push it into a lake. Taking Christmas and the pusher’s birthday off, to run through a billion dollars of Subaru Outbacks would take you 61 solid years. </p></div>



<p><em>But that’s not even very accurate</em>. During that 61 years of pushing Subaru Outbacks into a lake (in Neutral, of course, I’m not a <strong>monster</strong>), the remaining amount of the money not being spent to purchase lake-bound outbacks would actually be<em> <strong>MORE. THAN. A. BILLION. </strong></em>You would actually be richer than you started, if you invested it in even the most brain-dead obvious multi-percent-a-year funds, or left it in any bank. That’s because time and space warp around money.</p>



<p>So do people.</p>

<div><p>In 2018, after getting cancer in 2009 and 1982, Allen got it again, and this third (public) bout with it ended him, at age 65. His net worth at the time of his demise is the kind that publications who make it their business to will guess at, and the guess sat around $20 billion. Everyone has kind of accepted that, but it’s not really important if it’s $50, $15 or $5 billion. It’s a lot of money. </p><p>With his billions, over the decades, Allen owned or partly owned three sports teams, at least 10 companies ranging from airplanes, scientific research, media, and space flight. He owned massive real estate, a movie theater, threw buckets of cash at schools, the arts, and ultimately, a few museums.</p><p>To manage it all, he had a company whose purpose was to manage the money, because he wasn’t going to do it himself. The company’s name is Vulcan, Inc. Even after divestment and shutdown after Allen’s death, it has 700 employees. It is one of the largest trusts in the world. It is also now called Vale Group, but I’m going to keep calling it Vulcan.</p></div>

<p>Vulcan, a company whose job is to manage money and where that goes, is still quite intensely active as an entity, even with Paul Allen’s death. His sister, Jody Allen, chairs the organization she co-founded with her brother in 1986. This company is absolutely gargantuan in its scope and range, and remember, it is a company that just manages a ton of money – that’s the company’s entire purpose. </p>



<p><em>I wish to take a short moment to not demonize Jody Allen. </em>As the remaining sibling in charge of this company, functionally working through her brother’s holdings, many of which she clearly had no interest or extant position in, and doing so for six years and counting, can’t be anything else than the strangest mixture of pain and endless complication. The $20 billion she’s now in charge of might soften the blow, but likely not by much.</p>



<p>And I apologize for the whiplash here. I’m not overly interested in going down the paths of describing what Jody should be doing, or what her responsibilities are. I am not privy to whatever deep law and lore and functions buried within Vulcan’s iron heart she and her army of people are dealing with, that <em>six years later</em> they are still slowly divesting organizations. I know she has personally called for cullings but I am not informed about the deepest depths of how the aspects of these billions function.</p>



<p>I want to refocus to the fact that Vulcan is divesting itself of the Living Computer Museum.</p>



<p><strong>I want to refocus to the fact that the Living Computer Museum was never a museum.</strong></p>

<p>Look, don’t jump down my throat about this. I’m as shocked as you are.</p>



<p>I didn’t get some inkling from the phone call I had a decade before about potentially donating to Living Computer Museum. I don’t have some spidey-sense about failure or darkness – I just see it everywhere in everything and I treat every day like it’s the one before they find a lump.</p>



<div><p>If, before it closed, you had made me stand in the center of the LCM and answer whether it was a museum, I’d have happily held up my top hot and shouted “Why yes! One of the finest in all the realms!”</p><p>And for all I’d know, it <em>was</em> a museum. There’s no laws on what a thing can call itself regarding being a museum, exhibition, tour, or display. It’s against the law to take money to attend the museum and you get led to an empty lot, sure. But if something has the vestements and affectation of a museum, and you see the big sign saying Museum out front and you go in and there’s displays and staff and events and meetings, you would certainly think it was a museum.</p></div>



<p>Turns out it wasn’t.</p>

<div><p>The auction house Christie’s announced it was doing an auction of some of the best portions of Paul Allen’s estate, first with art, and now it would be selling off technology. To fans and studiers of the Living Computer Museum, these items seemed familiar – some of them were on display in the museum. </p><p>I found out that some of these to-be-auctioned items would be on display near where I live, so I hopped in my car, parked grandiosely illegally in front of the building, and let myself in. </p></div>

<p>On display were all sorts of computer history of the “early major days” variety, ranging from a Xerox Star to an Englebart Mouse and even a Pac-Man machine. All had descriptions, all were held out where you could get very near them assuming the guard wasn’t watching too closely, and all of it with a starry-eyed disco-ball aesthetic indicating you were in a space lounge.</p>



<p>So yes, items from the museum were now going to be sold to the highest bidder in a few months. These were some of them, and likely there would be more.</p>



<p>And then, among the relics, I found Stephen Jones.</p>

<p>Stephen Jones and I go a long way back. He was interviewed by me for the BBS Documentary in 2003. So that’s 20 years I’ve known the guy. At our interview session, he showed me his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PXL2000">PXL-2000</a> and his Delorean, both of which I can assure you are high-end geek possessions of the time. And I found his conversation style charming, and his passion for technical subjects perfect for my film. </p>



<p>Stephen’s primary non-profit endeavor, the <a href="https://sdf.org/">SDF Public Access UNIX system</a>, was in full swing back then, and is still around now.  “Do cool computer things, but don’t try to turn everything into a financial instrument” is not the motto, but it should be. It represents, to me, a lovely ideal of a truly living computer community, incorporating new technology as it expresses itself being something neat, or worth bringing in. Laptop Amish, if you’re stretching around for an anology, which you shouldn’t be. It’s a computer club. And he’s a big part of it.</p>



<p>He was also my initial “in” for the dish on the now-not-so-Living Computer Museum. We’d gone a long way, and here we were, in Christie’s in New York City, standing among offered-for-auction pieces of a gone billionaire’s museum, and maybe we needed to talk in detail, so we did. And I grilled him.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to that initial 2011 announcement page on the Living Computers Museum website, before it was officially an open building.</p>

<p>In the light of its piecemeal disassembly, a lot of this writing hits different. Here’s what I’ve picked up, from Stephen and others, and which I assume for some readers will be new information.</p>



<p>First, this was always intended to be an actual, non-profit, independent/independent-subsidiary museum. It never became that. It is not that. At best, the Living Computer Museum was a billionaire’s (sorry, multi-billionaire’s) collection of computers and technology. </p>



<p>Think of it another way: Jay Leno has a <a href="https://www.lenosgarage.com/">very famous garage</a> that has many wonderful cars and vehicles in it. It is currently, as of this writing, run by a very competent manager named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernard-juchli-27a57311/">Bernard Juchli</a>, who has been keeping the collection in line for over 20 years. That is, to say, that Leno has a massive collection of cars, competent staff to take care of it, facilities to show them (he has had a number of documentaries and television shows about the garage) and he could probably even open it to the public for an admission price. But you would be hard pressed to call it a “museum” in any sense beyond “it is a display people see videos about”.</p>



<div><p>As per the request in that 2011 webpage grab, people donated many computers and pieces of history to go into the museum. They expected, no doubt, that they and their children and their childen’s children could stop by displays and point and talk about the family connection to these items. </p><p>That was a mirage, a misunderstanding.</p></div>



<div><p>This was Paul’s collection of computers, aided by friends and fans. It was always that. The Living Computer Museum, it turns out, cost millions, over ten million a year, to operate as it was set up, and it never came close to making that amount of income from door sales and t-shirts. It never came close to even figuring out how it would.</p><p>It’s perhaps not surprising this misunderstanding could happen, and with what felt like all the time in the world, a mere five years and change of being open to the public might have seemed like a mere revving up for the grand plan of what would come next. But nothing came next. It was a collection you could walk through in a really, really nice display case.</p></div>



<p>And now it’s time to sell the collection.</p>

<p>Before I end up on a huge rant about what it means to be a museum, let me at least give you some relative good news.</p>



<p>The current rough plan is that the big-ticket items, like this Apple I, will be sold at auction. They’ll make beaucoup bucks, go into private collections or maybe even other institutions, and that’s that for the headliners. But that leaves a lot of other stuff.</p>



<p>SDF has a rough plan to raise funds and digitize software, documentation and other related items that are <em>not </em>part of these big-ticket sales (which will be relatively few) so that unique bits of history that are <em>not</em> headline-grabbing trinkets will, potentially, have a chance at being shared with the public.</p>



<p><strong>And I’ve stepped into it. I’ve offered to take software and documentation and store it at the Internet Archive, and of course to work with SDF on ways to digitize/rip/scan materials and, also, host them at the Internet Archive.</strong></p>



<p>It’s all preliminary, but my card is in the hat. Things are not going to be discarded, if I have anything to do with it. A lot can change, and we’ve already seen expectation vs. outcome with this whole experience, but rest assured, I’ve at least tried to provide one last safety net for the kind of history that easily finds itself gone because nobody steps forward. Internet Archive has stepped forward. Stay tuned to see how that works out.</p>

<p>But you know, what did we <em>learn</em> here? What did we actually <em>come away with</em> in the realm of lessons or teachings about what issues this whole mishegaas has churned up?</p>



<p>I have found, perhaps not to my surprise, that a few people in my orbit are displeased I have punched the dead billionaire, ostensibly about all the good the dead billionaire did. But I wish to point out the dead billionaire did give away all that money and yet still had 20 billion dollars at the end, money that went off and did not do as many nice things as the money given away. So much contributed, tax-free, and yet there’s even more. Perhaps this is not the best place to point out that every billionaire is, in many ways, a failure of society, but maybe we can put a pin in it when we have our first trillionaire, assuming that criticizing a trillionaire is not made illegal at that soonish juncture.</p>



<p>I did have some people say, in not so many words, that <em>of course </em>the Living Computer Museum would collapse once its Master of the House was no longer in charge, and I would take this time to point out that Gordon Bell, co-founder of the Computer History Museum, passed on in May of 2024 and yet the Computer History Museum lives and breathes in his absence. It wasn’t a hard problem.</p>



<p>It’s easy to call me ungrateful, but my ungratefulness comes from the narrative people weave near the power of money, like those myths formed around gods and devils, to explain why things are how they are. I appreciate life and its little whorls and eddies that capture us by surprise and we sink or swim. I do not appreciate acting like someone spending a lot of money on something that slightly amuses them earns them the greatest respect. Especially when, as I do now, I walk among a literal army of people working to clean up the mess left behind, after their march to oblivion.</p>

<p>A previously lost cache of celebrity and historical interviews from a long-dormant radio show have been discovered, digitized, and made available for all.</p>



<p>The Internet Archive is now home to 53 episodes of <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe">The Famous Computer Cafe</a>, a 1980s radio show about the new world of home computers. The program included computer industry news, product reviews, and interviews, and aired from 1983 through 1986 on radio stations in southern and central California.</p>



<p>The creators of The Famous Computer Cafe saved every episode on reel-to-reel tapes, but over the years the tapes were forgotten, and, ultimately, lost. Earlier this year archivist Kay Savetz recovered several of the tapes in a property sale, and recognizing their value and worthiness of professional transfer, launched a GoFundMe to have them digitized, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe">made them available at Internet Archive</a> with the permission of the show’s creators.</p>



<p>While full of time-capsule descriptions of 1980s technology news, the most exciting aspect of the show has been the variety and uniqueness of the interviews. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zx56qfqhKMmgaGyN6ZQ1lqaaNAohDXqgRHS1qM_vID0/edit?usp=sharing">list of people</a> that the show interviewed is a who’s-who of tech luminaries of the 1980s: computer people, musicians, publishers, philosophers, journalists. Interviews in the recovered recordings include <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe?tab=collection&amp;query=Timothy+leary&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype:%22audio%22">Timothy Leary</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1984-12-21_Douglas_Adams_and_Steve_Meretzky">Douglas Adams</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1984-11-17_Bill_Gates_and_Kazuhiko_Nishi">Bill Gates</a>, Atari’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1985-01-17_Jack_Tramiel_and_Bobby_Kotick">Jack Tramiel</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe?tab=collection&amp;query=atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a>, and dozens of others. The recovered shows span November 17 1984 through July 12, 1985.</p>



<p>Many more of the original reel-to-reel tapes — including shows with interviews with Ray Bradbury, Robert Moog, Donny Osmond, and Gene Roddenberry — are still lost, and perhaps are still waiting to be found in the Los Angeles area.</p>



<p>The stories of how The Famous Computer Cafe was created — and saved, 40 years later —&nbsp;is explored in <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2024/08/podcast-342-the-famous-computer-cafe/">an episode of the Radio Survivor podcast</a>. The podcast interviewed show co-creator Ellen Fields and archivist Kay Savetz, providing a dual perspective of how the show was created and how it was recovered.</p>



<p>The recovery of these interviews, 40 years after their original airing, holds out hope that many more relics and treasures still await discovery.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows Roblox is huge. But as COVID receded into memory, Roblox shifted from “new” to “familiar,” and gaming experienced its <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/gaming2024" target="_blank">largest contraction in nearly a quarter century</a>, the platform continued to grow. And grow. And grow. As a result, there is now a significant disparity between the perceived size of Roblox and its actual, unprecedented scale.</p><p>During the average day, more than 80MM people log onto Roblox. As a historical point of contrast, this means that more people log onto Roblox every 10 or so minutes than used <em>Second Life</em> in a month at its peak. On a monthly basis, Roblox now counts more than 380MM users according to RTrack – 2x as many as PC gaming leader Steam, 3x that of Sony’s PlayStations, 3x the number of unique <em>annual </em>users of the Nintendo Switch in a <em>year</em>, and 5x as many as have bought an Xbox console in the last decade. After accounting for duplication across these platforms, as well as the gap between monthly and annual Switch users, it’s likely Roblox has more monthly users than the entire AAA gaming ecosystem combined. What’s more, NPD/Circana reports that Roblox is <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1823016887443509700/photo/1" target="_blank">typically</a> one of the 3–7 most played games on PlayStation and Xbox (Roblox is not available on Switch or Steam), and SensorTower <a href="https://sensortower.com/state-of-mobile-2024" target="_blank">says that in 2023</a>, Roblox averaged more iOS/Android monthly active users than any other game (including <em>Candy Crush</em>!).</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723939387829_17010">
  <p>Compared to its most similar competitors—the social virtual world platforms, <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> — Roblox has about 5x and 2.25x as many monthly players. For non-gamers, Roblox has about two thirds as many monthly users as Spotify and half as many as Snap (though it probably has a lower share of daily-to-monthly active users) and is roughly as popular as Instagram circa Q4 2015, and Facebook in Q3 2009. </p><p>Each month, players spend close to six billion hours using Roblox. This time excludes the viewing of Roblox content on Twitch or YouTube, the largest video platform on earth and which counts non-live gaming content as its second most popular genre, with Roblox one of its five most watched games. Most estimates suggest the average Disney+ account watches no more than 20 hours per month, which would mean about 3.1 billion hours in total monthly watch time—barely half of Roblox’s total.</p>

<p>Not only is Roblox enormously popular, but its growth has been shockingly linear (there is some quarter-to-quarter seasonality, which is common to all media products and particularly significant for Roblox given its over-indexing to children and thus the school calendar). Even at its present scale, it’s difficult to argue that growth won’t continue and that the platform should pass a half billion MAUs and 100 million DAUs. This growth is also resilient. And in contrast to other supposed pandemic darlings such as Zoom, Shopify, and Peloton, Roblox never contracted after the pandemic. Instead, it maintained its overall “pull forward” as well as its accelerated rate of growth. </p>

<p>The composition of Roblox’s growth has also been healthy. The share of Roblox’s total monthly users who use the platform on the average day has grown from 16%–19% pre-pandemic to 22% today. The hours played per DAU and per MAU has also grown, showing that new users are not less engaged users. The share of players over 13 has grown from 40% to 58% (in total there are now 2.5x as many users over 13 as there were users of any age pre-pandemic). Though U.S. and Canadian players are up 250% since the pandemic, their share of the total user base has fallen from 35% to 22% because APAC and ROW users surged 650% and 750%, respectively, taking their share from ~16% and ~21% to 24% and 27%. The global share of players also maps nearly exactly to the global share of playtime, demonstrating that Roblox, like all major social platforms, is a global phenomenon.</p>




















  
  



</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723921664409_30295">
  <p>Although Roblox has diversified its playerbase away from high-income markets and toward more developing ones, revenues per MAU and DAU are up compared to pre-pandemic levels (spending has come down a bit since the peak of the pandemic, though spending was inflated due to a surge in new users that spent heavily to fill their otherwise empty virtual closets). More impressively, spend per hour is also up since before the pandemic—even though users currently play more per month than at any point during Roblox’s existence, with the sole exception of the peak of the pandemic. In other words, Roblox continues to scale its appeal, usage, and monetization.</p><p>Annual spending on Roblox is over $3.8 billion and will pass $4 billion by the end of the year, a quarter of which goes to developers. Given these figures, it is no surprise that Roblox users are hyper-productive. In 2022, Roblox’s users designed 170,000 virtual clothing/accessory items and 15,000 virtual worlds each day (current figures are not known, though average daily users have grown 40% and the ease of creation has improved, as has the quality of the output). Over a hundred user-created worlds have been played over a billion times (and one has over 50 billion plays). </p>

  <p>So yes, Roblox is unquestionably “working.” Yet Roblox is also unprofitable. <em>Very</em> unprofitable. What’s more, Roblox’s losses continue to swell because its impressive rate of revenue growth has been outpaced by that of its costs. Over the last four quarters, Roblox’s income from operations was ($1.2B) on revenues of $3.2B, representing a -38% profit margin. During the company’s four pre-pandemic quarters, income was ($66MM) on $508MM, for a -13% profit margin. Put another way, revenues are now 6.2x greater, but losses are 18x greater. This is not the typical path of a company, least of all a tech company that is a <em>platform</em> and at Roblox’s scale. So what gives and what’s the significance of the answer?</p><p><strong>Growth, But Not Profits</strong></p><p>Obviously, Roblox has a cost<em>s</em> problem. Over the last twelve months it has averaged $138 in costs for every $100 in revenue. </p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_8732">

<p>Unfortunately, many of these costs are outside of Roblox’s control. To start, an average of 23% of revenues are consumed by various App Store/platform fees (this sum is less than 30% because roughly 20% of sales are direct via browser or PC, where Roblox pays credit card processing fees but not 30% store commissions). Another 26% of revenues are paid out to Roblox’s UGC developers. Though the company could theoretically reduce these payments, doing so would harm both brand and developer investment, both of which drive topline. If anything, Roblox wants to grow revenue share, as it would enable developers to invest even more into the platform (many developers are also understandably annoyed they <em>only</em> get a quarter of the revenue they generate, too). In total, Roblox loses 49% of revenue before it even gets to its own costs (let alone the potential of profits).</p>




















  
  



</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_10383">
  <p>Infrastructure and Trust &amp; Safety devours another 28% of revenues on average, down from a peak of 37% but only a point below its six-year average. Unlike App Store fee and developer revenue shares, these costs are not strictly marginal ones. There is a fixed cost per hour for Roblox to operate, and it’s not particularly low, but it does not increase if users increase their spending. As such, this category can see declines on a percentage revenue basis. However, this will not be easy. For example, the clearest way to increase spending is usually to increase playtime, which results in incremental services costs (Roblox has three times the users of PlayStation, but Roblox has only 50% more playtime because its players play half as much per month).</p><p>In order to attract more players—especially older players with money to spend and the discretion to spend it—more playtime per player, and more spend per player and play hour, Roblox is also investing in experiences that, on average, are more expensive to operate, as is the case with Generative AI. Roblox is increasingly focused on using GenAI to provide real-time player communications (e.g., transcription and translation), as well as power asset and world creation, and operate AI agents and NPCs – none of which is cheap to create or operate. The company is also investing deeply in more AI tools and human moderators in order to combat harassment, predation, and more. In August 2024, Turkey banned Roblox outright for the “protection of our children”; a month earlier, <em>Bloomberg</em> published <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">a brutal report</a> on the platform’s “pedophile problem.”</p><p>So after just three of Roblox’s six cost categories, 77% of revenues are eaten. Combined, the next three are about as costly today—though they have comparatively greater room for improvements and are more under Roblox’s control. Both General &amp; Administrative (13%) and Sales &amp; Marketing (5%) costs are down a few points compared to a few years ago and should continue to decline. Yet even if Roblox cuts these categories down by a third each, that’s only six points of the thirty-eight needed just to break even.</p><p>The biggest and most interesting category is R&amp;D. As a platform, R&amp;D is not just the foundation of Roblox’s present-day scale, it’s essential to all future growth - and to that end, the company reinvests much of its current revenues in order to grow future ones (and the company’s history of doing so is precisely why they are so large today). Specifically, improvements in Roblox’s tools and capabilities help attract developers and enable them to produce “better” and “more” experiences, which helps attract more users, retain users as they age up, and encourage more user spend—all of which increases Roblox’s revenue, which in turn funds more R&amp;D and provides more money to developers, who can then invest more in their experiences. As already mentioned, much of Roblox’s R&amp;D investments are in Generative AI. Roblox Founder and CEO David Baszucki <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23775268/roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-gaming-metaverse-robux-virtual-reality">has said</a> he believes generative AI will enable users to type or speak entire worlds into existence by 2028, and earlier this year, the company <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/06/robloxs-road-to-4d-generative-ai">began to demo</a> these tools, too, inclusive of detailed object components and attributes (e.g., when a car is created, it is made up of many parts, rather than just being a “car,” and the car not only moves but has the properties of reflection, the ability to inflict and sustain damage, etc.). Roblox has also said they are working to integrate LLMs into their NPCs and to power real-time translation. By dropping the cost, time, and difficulty involved in creating Roblox experiences while also bolstering their levels of immersion and facilitating more/easier social play, Roblox should be able to increase the platform’s popularity, usage, and revenue.</p><p>At the same time, Roblox’s R&amp;D investments are <em>enormous</em>. R&amp;D now takes up 44% of revenues on average, equivalent to $1.5B on a run-rate basis. In comparison, Sony’s PlayStation <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sony-boost-gaming-unit-with-217-bln-rd-war-chest-2024-nikkei-2023-07-12/" target="_blank">anticipates spending</a> $2.2B in 2024, with these investments spanning R&amp;D at its twenty-one largely independent studios, virtual reality devices, accessories (including the cloud-based PlayStation Portal), the PlayStation 6 (and, it is rumored, handheld), its network technologies, and so on. In 2024, Unity Technologies will spend “only” $1.1B on R&amp;D, and even the most fantastical (and doubtless egregious) forecasts for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI,</em> anticipated to drop in October 2025, suggest it will cost a billion to develop in total after close to a decade. It is difficult to imagine R&amp;D will continue to grow with sales—let alone in excess of sales, as has been the case over the last few years. For most large technology companies, R&amp;D stabilizes at 6%–12%. Yet even if R&amp;D dropped to 10% (about as much as Spotify and Uber spend), Roblox would still be unprofitable.</p>

  <p><strong>Profit Light but Cash Heavy?</strong></p><p>Though Roblox isn’t profitable, there are some significant caveats to the situation. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow—a far more important measure than accounting-defined profits—were $650MM, about 20% of revenue. Roblox has been cash-positive for at least twenty-four quarters. Hard to say that’s not a business that’s “working!”</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_12138">
  <p>Part of the cause for this discrepancy is Roblox’s approach to revenue recognition. When a user buys $30 in Robux, the platform’s virtual currency, Roblox recognizes $30 in bookings. An average of $3 of that $30 is spent on a “consumable” (i.e., a single-user or otherwise perishable good), and so Roblox recognizes that $3 as revenue right away. The remaining $27 is spent on “durable” goods such as an avatar. As an avatar can and often will be used over time, Roblox recognizes this revenue over the average lifetime of a Roblox user. This lifetime is currently 27 months, and so the remaining $27 is allocated as $1 for each of the next $27 months, which means that Month One has a total of $4 recognized ($3+$1) and $26 deferred.</p><p>Roblox’s accounting practices are generally viewed as conservative. To point, Roblox notes that on average, a user uses all of their newly purchased Robux within only three days. Users do not, as Roblox’s revenue recognition policies seem to suggest, take more than two years to spend their Robux account balance on a miscellany of avatars, outfits, and other items. Roblox also does not allow refunds of Robux or virtual goods, and so the company does not hold a liability to the user (the spend is due to the App Store and developers). Most evidence suggests that the usage of virtual goods, like most cosmetics, is front-loaded. As such, a straightline allocation is probably a misfit versus, say, a double or triple declining balance. Furthermore, Roblox is effectively P&amp;L penalized when it increases the lifetime of a customer—which should be a good thing!—because it extends the revenue recognition period. If Roblox users go from an average of 27 months to 30, for example, then the Month One “loss” above increases from $4.50 to $4.60. Indeed, this has happened since the company went public. In Q1 2021, Roblox users averaged 23 months on the platform, and now they last 27.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_13529">
  <p>Roblox’s accounting methodology does mean that some costs (i.e., App Store fees and developer payments) are also deferred, which partly offsets the consequence of delayed revenue recognition. But all operating costs (i.e., Infrastructure, Trust &amp; Safety) and personnel costs (R&amp;D, S&amp;M, G&amp;A) are incurred right away, and so the net effect of Roblox’s revenue recognition policy is that it shrinks accounting profits as long as total user spend is growing (and the degree of this compression increases as the rate of user spending increases). On average, Roblox’s bookings per quarter (i.e., the money users are spending on Roblox that quarter) exceed the revenues recognized by Roblox by about 23%. This isn’t enough to overcome Roblox’s 138% in costs per dollar, but as a percentage of bookings, costs shrink down to 114%.</p><p>So how does Roblox generate so much cash? Over the last twelve months, Roblox’s total compensation to its employees was $1.8B. However, 53% of this compensation was in the form of stock, a non-cash expense. As such, Roblox is able to “shield” its operating cash flow by a sum equivalent to about 31% of revenues (between 2-4x that of most tech companies).</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_14836">
  <p>It would be misleading to ignore the cost of stock-based compensation – especially since companies tend to shift total compensation toward cash and away from stock as they mature, which would decrease profits at the very time a company is supposed to be steadily earning them. If stock-based compensation is normalized to around 10%, then another 21% of revenue would be consumed by cash expenses. This would increase Roblox’s costs from 114% of bookings to 135%—just short of the 138% provided by Roblox’s GAAP methodology.</p><p><strong>How Does Roblox Get Profitable? </strong></p><p>A detailed picture of Roblox’s P&amp;L paints both a better picture (Roblox is generating lots of operating cash flow, R&amp;D should eventually fall by a quarter of revenue or more) and a worse one (30% of costs are paid in stock, at least half of revenue must be paid out). So how does Roblox become a “great” business? </p><p>First, one additional profit caveat is necessary. For users in the United States and Canada, Roblox’s Average Billings per Daily Active User (“ABPDAU,” a Roblox measure) is $37 per quarter, more than four times as high as European ABPDAU, over six times as high as the Asia-Pacific market, and nearly nine times that of all other markets (Rest of Word). This gap is so large that UCAN net ABPDAU (i.e. after 23% App Store fees and 26% developer revenue share) is still a multiple of gross ABPDAU elsewhere.</p><p>On a globally blended basis, ABPDAU is $13, and we know that Roblox loses roughly 35% on that spend, meaning costs are about $18. In UCAN, Roblox more than doubles that cost basis.</p>

<p>The more than 50% net income margins on UCAN users is important because not only is Roblox “working” for developers and consumers, it is working as a business . . . for at least 25% of players. Sure, that’s a bit cheap: “Roblox does make money, just not all the time and not enough for the times they don’t!” But Roblox is also unique as a social platform.</p>

  <p>Because of Roblox’s high cost to serve per hour, users in lower-income or lower-propensity-to-spend markets typically reduce profitability, rather than just harm overall margins. For Facebook, Twitter, Snap, etc., low monetizing users are still accretive because however little revenue they generate, the marginal costs incurred are near zero. This issue is exacerbated on the revenue side, too. Unlike other social platforms, Roblox’s revenue is nearly all via user spending rather than advertising. As such, Roblox pays 25% of its revenue to Apple and Google (30% of transactions on those platforms) whereas Facebook, Snap, et al pay effectively 0. Note that Facebook, which has structurally lower costs to service users than Roblox and is far more mature, has an operating margin of roughly 40% — if the company had to pay out 25-30% first, it would never have “tech company” profit margins, let alone profit dollars.</p><p>So to achieve overall profitability, Roblox needs to either increase its average bookings per DAU from $13 to at least $18 or achieve a level of revenue scale such that all fees other than developer payouts (currently $3.38 per $13) are effectively halved. In practice, both pushes will likely be needed; fortunately, there are a few mechanisms for each.</p><p>First is <strong>App Store</strong> <strong>fees</strong>. In various markets around the world, Apple’s iOS platform and Google’s Android are being forced to open up their app distribution and monetization models, at least in part. The specifics vary by market, by platform, and sometimes type of transaction. There’s not yet reliable data to suggest the degree to which Roblox might save on commissions (at a minimum, they will substitute a 30% fee with a 4% credit card processing expense, but additional iOS/Android fees might also apply), and the more complicated purchasing flow may require discounts and/or lead to fewer transactions, which would harm revenue. Accordingly, the net opportunity may be a reduction from 25% to 20% in the medium term, with a longer-term possibility of something closer to 10%.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>increase</strong> <strong>ABPDAU</strong> so that profitable users are more directly profitable and unprofitable users are less directly unprofitable. This would mean more revenue, which reduces the mostly-fixed costs of R&amp;D, G&amp;A, and S&amp;M. In the average month, fewer than 6% of users and 17% of average DAUs purchase Robux. There are many natural reasons to skip buying Robux in a given month—some MAUs are just trying Roblox for the first time, others don’t use the platform enough to routine spenders, a large portion of users are likely too young and thus purchasing depends on parental permissions, there are financial discounts for bulk purchasing (which naturally results in a delay to the next purchase), and so on. But there is clearly upside here. As a point of example, PlayStation, which has 120MM MAUs to Roblox’s 375MM and 50MM DAUs to Roblox’s 80MM, generated over $31 billion in revenue over the last twelve months compared to Roblox’s $3.8 billion in bookings.</p><p>These increases can come from further aging up Roblox’s userbase (older users can typically spend more—mainly because they’re no longer reliant on their parents for money), higher-end experiences (PlayStation is evidence of the premium users will pay for “premium” games), growing cultural cachet (which should enable higher prices for Roblox’s virtual goods), as well as more playtime per user (PlayStation has about twice the hours per user per month).</p><p><strong>Advertising</strong> solves a few goals for Roblox. First, it turns all users into revenue-generating users (no matter how miniscule) while also increasing the revenue for high-spending customers (which helps cover all other costs and/or subsidize the money-losing users). Second, it means that marginal consumption will continuously result in marginal revenues rather than just marginal cost (primarily via Infrastructure and Trust &amp; Safety expenses). Third, neither the Apple App Store nor Google’s Google Play collect a portion of ad revenues. Accordingly, all advertising would necessarily decrease app store fees as a percentage of revenue. For instance, if Roblox currently earns $10 per month from each paying user, they pay $2.40 to app stores, which is 24% of their revenue. However, if they generate an additional $3 from advertising on top of that $10, the $2.40 payment to stores would now represent just 18% of their total revenue. Moreover, as already stated, that additional revenue from non-paying users would go directly to Roblox (i.e. 0% would go to app stores). There are marginal IT&amp;S costs to support advertising on a per-hour basis, as well as R&amp;D to continuously improve Roblox’s ad platform, plus incremental G&amp;A for ad sales, ad ops, and ad service, etc. However, IT&amp;S should be relatively modest (and far cheaper than the other way to increase ABPDAU—more playtime), and the latter cost categories should be mostly fixed costs and thus offer greater operating leverage.</p><p>Advertisers have been investing in Roblox for years through the production of their own branded worlds. As with all of Roblox’s worlds, Roblox doesn’t charge for their creation (though certainly, some brands do pay agencies to construct them). Instead, Roblox is “compensated” through the engagement and purchases that world might inspire (to this end, Roblox might even be <em>paying</em> the advertiser through its developer royalty payments). At the same time, Roblox did have ways to generate <em>advertising</em> revenue from these world-builders, as well as from those whose <em>primary</em> business was the creation and operation of Roblox worlds. Specifically, Roblox would sell banner ads inside its launcher/application (think the Netflix homescreen), as well as sponsored search results. However, these ads were limited to the promotion of virtual worlds or items (e.g., Starbucks could promote Starbucks World or virtual Starbucks aprons, but not real-world Starbucks drinks or coupons, etc.). These restrictions, though “good” for users, had pretty severe constraints on advertising revenue as it meant that advertiser’s who lacked Roblox worlds or integrations couldn’t buy any ads (lots of Facebook ad spend is for local businesses, but your local hair stylist can’t build a Roblox world, nor can a local doctor’s office, etc., and even if they could, they probably shouldn’t). And those companies or organizations that <em>did</em> have a world or various items had the business cases from platform advertising effectively limited constrained to the efficacy of those worlds or various items (yes, in theory Starbucks advertising a sellable apron also aided Starbuck’s overall brand awareness, but that’s a pretty inefficient way to advertise online).</p><p>Since late 2022, Roblox has begun to prioritize new ad units and technologies to support its burgeoning ad business. In 2024, for example, Roblox launched in-world billboards that, unlike other ad units, could advertise whatever (e.g. an upcoming music, real world sneakers, etc.), and could be programmatically bid upon by advertisers and served across any worlds that chose to support billboard ads. This sort of advertising has existed “unofficially” for years (a developer would just build a billboard and either sell the ad slot directly or, more commonly, hook into an outside ad network to have the unit filled). In 2023, however, Roblox began to block developers from pinging a third-party server for ad units. Developers are still permitted to sell custom ads inside their world, but programmatic insertion, dynamic pricing, and/or targeting all require the use of Roblox’s ad network. </p>

<p>Another new unit are “Immersive Ads,” which are portals that enable a user to travel directly from one Roblox experience into another. In this case, Pepsi or Nike might (programmatically) purchase a “portal” inside hit sports-themed worlds (e.g. a Golden State Warriors world, a FIFA world, etc.) that make it easier to directly acquire these world’s users compared to just throwing up a digital billboard. This format, too, was originally “hacked” by independent Roblox developers whom would cut their own deals with other world developers, but Roblox has since built it natively into their platforms and requires developers to use their system. Developers can still try to bypass Roblox through custom deals, but only Roblox's platform provides advanced analytics, such as tracking how many users entered the portal, how long they stayed in the destination, and what activities they engaged in, and advertisers can only programmatically purchase immersive ads through Roblox.</p>

  <p>The last new ad unit lets advertisers sponsor items that users can claim for free. For example, Nike might do a deal through Roblox whereby any users who visit Developer World A on a given weekend would receive a free virtual pair of Air Jordan Sneakers. Again, this could be achieved through a direct deal between Nike and Developer A, but Roblox’s own platform offers programmatic placement, better analytics, a greater number of partnering worlds, related tools, etc. </p><p>It’s not clear how big Roblox’s advertising business might become. In November 2023, Baszucki <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-about-advertising-and-ai/">told Ben Thomspon</a> “Yeah, I don’t think we’ve ever said advertising is going to be the meat of our business” – but he also argued “the size of the potential immersive advertising experience is uncharted right now. It’s immersive, there’s so much time spent there, the memories are really profound when I go with a friend to do that. So I do think it’s uncharted and very big.” Baszucki also mentioned “someday on Roblox, when we go to Nike World, we will not just be trying on virtual Nike shoes. We may be buying the physical versions as well from that place because it’s been such a connection for us with that brand.” Regardless of any physical tie-ins, it’s obvious that with over 350 million young, and otherwise hard-to-reach players, Roblox has the potential to generate meaningful revenue even if <em>most</em> of its business is based on user subscription.</p><p><strong>Master Builder(man)</strong></p><p>Smaller App Store payments, more ARPU, and a bigger ad platform are the <em>linear </em>opportunities for Roblox.</p>

Very few products ever get to Roblox’s size, let alone continue growing. And at this present size, altogether “new” opportunities start to emerge.</p>

  <p>In 2023, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/08/roblox-connect-avatar-calling/" target="_blank">Roblox launched new features</a> that enabled “basic” communications capabilities between connected players that were <em>not</em> actively using a Roblox word, including messaging and voice calling, as well as avatar-to-avatar "video calling” that uses a phone or tablet’s front-facing camera to power real-time motion capture. This functionality puts Roblox in more direct competition with social networks and platforms such as Snap and WhatsApp, which boast 800MM and 2.8B users each, but underindex to younger Gen Zs and especially Gen Alphas. Moreover, such functionality is not just “bigger” than immersive socializing, it’s also cheaper to operate and easier to advertise through. Roblox Founder/CEO David Baszucki seems to believe instant messaging is just one of many 2D use cases that the company will soon be able to conquer. At the Roblox Developer Conference in 2023, he teased a forthcoming dating product for verified users over the age of 17, corporate recruiting integrations, and educational programs, among others.</p><p><strong><em>Matthew Ball (</em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew"><strong><em>@ballmatthew</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong></p>

<p dir="auto">This app extends the functionality of the FlipperZero's bluetooth capabilities, enabling it to act as an Apple AirTag, Samsung SmartTag, or a Tile Tracker. It utilizes the FlipperZero's BLE beacon to broadcast a SmartTag signal to be picked up by the FindMy Network. I made this to serve as a versatile tool for tracking purposes, offering the ability to clone existing tags, generate OpenHaystack key pairs for integration with Apple's FindMy network, and always know where your FlipperZero is.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Tag Emulation: Clone your existing Apple AirTag, Samsung SmartTag, or Tile Tracker to the FlipperZero, or generate a key pair for use with the FindMy network without owning an actual AirTag.</li>
<li>Customization: Users can adjust the interval between beacon broadcasts and modify the transmit power to suit their needs, optimizing for both visibility and battery life.</li>
<li>Efficient Background Operation: The app is optimized to run in the background, ensuring that your FlipperZero can still be tracked with minimal battery usage and without stopping normal use.</li>

  <summary><b>Option A: Cloning Existing Tag (Preferred and allows you to track without additional setup)</b></summary>
<p dir="auto">1A. Scan and import tag via ESP32 with BLE. Use the Airtag scanner ESP32 firmware and Flipper app.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Pair a Tag:</strong> First, pair an AirTag, Samsung SmartTag or Tile Tracker with your device.</li>
<li><strong>Enter 'Lost' Mode:</strong> Keep the tag away from the device it's registered to for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Download nrfConnect or use an ESP32</strong> Install nrfConnect from the Google Play Store. (Apple version doesn't reveal the needed Raw data, looking for a workaround)</li>
<li>OR <strong>Use an ESP32-WROOM / ESP32-S3</strong> Don't have an android? No problem! You can get all the data you need from an ESP32: <a href="https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/ESP32-AirTag-Scanner">https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/ESP32-AirTag-Scanner</a> (Skip to step 7 if using an ESP32)</li>
<li><strong>Filter and Scan:</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open the app, click on filters, and exclude all except for the brand of your tag (Apple/Samsung).</li>
<li>Adjust the RSSI to the lowest setting (-40 dBm).</li>
<li>Initiate a scan. Wait for your SmartTag to appear as a "FindMy" device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capture Data:</strong> Click <strong>Raw</strong> or <strong>View Raw</strong> to capture your <strong>payload</strong> and note your tag's <strong>MAC Address</strong>. Immediately remove the tag's battery to prevent key/MAC rotation.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The AirTag has now been cloned, if you put the battery back into the AirTag it will eventually rotate its keys with the Apple servers. This will invalidate the current keys on the Flipper. To prevent this you must keep the AirTag powered off / battery removed. You can always repeat these steps to return functionality to the Flipper. No need to get rid of the AirTag, you can always return to it if you desire, you just can't use both at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enter Data in FlipperZero App:</strong> Input the captured <strong>payload</strong> and <strong>MAC Address</strong> into the FlipperZero app.</li>

<p dir="auto">Move the '.Keys' file to your Flipper device by connecting it to your computer and using the Flipper's file management system.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For ease of use, drag your <code>.keys</code> file onto your FlipperZero's SD card in the apps_data-&gt;findmy folder. You can import it directly from the app!

<p dir="auto">Finally, run the <code>RequestReport&amp;Map.py</code> script to generate an interactive map of all location data in the past 24 hours. This script automates the process by requesting the location report using the hashed adv key in your <code>keys</code> folder, then decrypting that data from your private key located in the same <code>.keys</code> file. After the data is decrypted it will be displayed in the terminal. It then launches a mapping script that maps all the coordinates, connects them to show movement, displays a plethora of location metadata, and saves to an html file named by the date of the report.</p>
<p dir="auto">You're done!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use OpenHaystack or Macless instead, then you can follow the steps below. I don't recommend these methods due to reliability issues and setup complexity.
To use OpenHayStack for tracking, you must use MacOS lower than version 14 (Mail Plug-in Incompetiablity of MacOS 14+ <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="5910354" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/224" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/224/hovercard" href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/224">seemoo-lab/openhaystack#224</a>). If you do own a device, I believe a convertor script can be provided without much of effort. If you do not own a Mac device or the system has been upgraded to 14 and beyond. The alternative solutions includes,</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If using this solution, be sure to only use the <code>generate_keys.py</code> script from this repo in the AirTagGeneration folder. Not the ones included in that repo as the formatting of the key file changes. (Mine includes data that the FlipperZero needs for proper importing)</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Upon launching the app, open the config menu and either click <code>Import Tag From File</code> or <code>Register Tag Manually</code>. Put your generated .keys file onto the FlipperZero SD card inside the AppsData/FindMyFlipper folder to import from file. Or you can manually enter the tag information. When using the cloning method, you can export a .txt file from nrfConnect (click save button) amd place that in the same folder in order to import.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Customization</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Beacon Interval: Adjust how frequently your FlipperZero broadcasts its presence.</li>
<li>Transmit Power: Increase or decrease the signal strength to balance between tracking range and battery life.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Background Use</p>
<p dir="auto">The app is designed to have a negligible impact on battery life, even when running in the background. This allows for continuous tracking without the need for frequent recharging.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compatibility</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Apple devices for AirTag tracking via the FindMy network.</li>
<li>Any device that supports Samsung SmartTag tracking, including web browsers (previously FindMyMobile).</li>
<li>Tile Trackers via the Tile App</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-astro-cid-w6n32adp=""> <details><summary>Table Of Contents</summary><ol><li><a href="#what-is-a-markov-chain">What is a Markov chain</a></li><li><a href="#what-is-funny">What is funny</a></li><li><a href="#the-predictability-of-llms">The predictability of LLMs</a></li><li><a href="#why-this-is-interesting">Why this is interesting</a></li></ol></details><p>Before explaining any of these terms, let’s try to establish this anecdotally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12:2 And I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and our sins be upon us, because of our use of not and lisp-value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning was the lambda expression, and the lambda expression was with Scheme, and the lambda expression was Scheme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of these is the result of a Markov chain trained on the dataset of the King James Bible and a Computer Science textbook. The other is ChatGPT 3.5 given instructions to form a similar output.</p>
<p>These 2 examples are somewhat cherry-picked, but each was given a fair fight. I tried to choose the best candidate from both sides. Can you tell which one was which?</p>
<p>You have a good chance of guessing correctly. The sentence with funky semantics is the Markov chain. It almost makes sense, but makes a right turn into gibberish before you reach the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>The second sentence is Chat GPT.</p>
<p>My goal in this article is to convince you that humor is measurable and that Markov chains are funny. To do this, I will need to define both Markov chains and humor itself. Let’s start with the easier one.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-markov-chain">What is a Markov chain</h2>
<p>When LLMs first came on the scene, people would describe them as a very smart Markov chain. These days, people are more familiar with LLMs than Markov chains, so I’ll describe a Markov chain as a very dumb LLM.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t clear earlier, ChatGPT is a kind of LLM - a Large Language Model. We have LLMs that are very large (greater than 300GB) and ones that are much smaller (less than 10GB), but you wouldn’t call them a “small language model” - they’re just a small LLM.</p>
<p>You could call Markov chains a very very small, very simple, very naive LLM.</p>
<p>Like an LLM, it predicts the next word based off the current context. However, it doesn’t take into account semantics, dimensionality, and a whole bunch of other specialized vector math. It’s a really primitive statistical model.</p>
<p>Have you ever used those “next word suggestions” on the top of your phone’s keyboard? That’s generally built using a Markov chain. It’s cheap to run and can be easily updated with suggestions more common to your own texting style.</p>
<p>I could go into depth talking about how both LLMs and Markov chains work, but I only need you to know this - Markov chains are worse at doing the work that LLMs are used for. If you ask it to generate a sentence with a certain goal in mind, an LLM will often outperform the Markov chain.</p>
<p>But accuracy is not what makes something funny.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-funny">What is funny</h2>
<p>This is a weird obsession of mine. I’ve wrote at length about it several times, so just to summarize - humor is about unserious surprise.</p>
<p>The best jokes involve a pleasant and significant “snap”. I use “snap” instead of “punchline” to avoid the semantic baggage. A snap is the whiplash received from the surprise. The less surprise, the less funny.</p>
<p>This is why jokes you’ve heard many times become less funny. It’s why “random” humor feels humorless - although the exact words are unpredictable, the expectation of unpredictability is predictable. If you truly expect the unexpected, you probably won’t laugh.</p>
<p>You can strengthen the snap by reusing common patterns with predictable endings and violating the user’s expectation. As an example, the word coupling “banana, apple, orange, vehicular manslaughter” sets up a pattern of single-word fruit and violates the expectation with a crime.</p>
<p>Joke writing is mostly about violating a pattern.</p>
<p>The snap is also made stronger via the “realization of scene”. If you use more original or descriptive language, you can make the scene appear more real. Instead of “he was shot”, you might say “he was pierced by a 35mm”. Instead of “he fell”, perhaps “his face met the ground”.</p>
<p>You also might want to try starting from the middle of a scene. Imagining what happened before will also help with realization. For example “a urinal cake? I’m not falling for that one again” implies a scene we have to imagine, increasing its realization.</p>
<p>You’ll notice many parallels between good <em>joke</em> writing and good writing in general. Both sorts of authors have similar goals. Using cliche is just wasting words because you leave your scenes <em>unrealized</em>.</p>
<p>We call humor subjective because what qualifies as “unserious surprise” is not universal. Crass humor might not be funny because it is not unserious; it’s blasphemy! Or, it might not be funny because it’s not a surprise; it’s expected.</p>
<p>Anti-jokes are only funny if the joke structure itself is predictable. Absurdism has to be bought into. You can violate cultural norms, but the violation must be well understood unserious.</p>
<p>As a monolingual American, I still managed to make (successful) jokes in a very non-english environment by using the word “no” in ways that were culturally unexpected. I refused certain gifts in an unserious way.</p>
<p>Jokes are varied and humor is subject. Yet, at the end of the day, it is unserious surprise.</p>
<h2 id="the-predictability-of-llms">The predictability of LLMs</h2>
<p>To predict a sentence successfully, you need a lot of context. Large language models have a lot of context. They do tons of fancy math and find the most probable next token. A “better” LLM will necessarily be more predictable if its corpus is sensible speech.</p>
<p>This makes LLMs a really poor choice for creative writing. Without a ton of “prompt engineering”, it’s actually quite easy to spot if some paragraph was LLM generated. It sounds soulless. It’s the most average thing you could have possibly produced given the context.</p>
<p>Asking an LLM for an “original thought” is almost oxymoronic, if not just moronic. It was built with the express purpose of not doing that.</p>
<p>To generate a joke, an LLM would have to be surprising. It would need to take a common turn of phrase and shift its meaning in an unusual way. Good LLMs don’t do this.</p>
<p>I’ve heard people claim that comedy cannot be generated by an algorithm. If it wasn’t obvious, I disagree with this. I think comedy can be analyzed and measured. I think, given a large enough grant, we could probably generate comedy on demand. I think it’s doable - not that we should do it.</p>
<p>The LLMs we have today are just the wrong tool for this task.</p>
<p>LLMs were funniest at their earliest stages. Image generation was funniest here as well. Remember those “trail cam” images we got from <em>Dall-e mini</em>? As our systems got better, the humor was lost.</p>
<p>A really good predictability machine is not very helpful in artistic expression. There is still much use, sure, but it’s not the perfect tool for the job. An LLM will often miss interesting concepts that a child can readily offer.</p>
<p>I’m open to the idea that, given this framework, we can probably build a kind of language model which takes this task into account. It would just need to be categorically different than the kinds of LLMs we have today. It would be different enough that we probably wouldn’t call it an LLM.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-interesting">Why this is interesting</h2>
<p>This is a weird thing to get passionate about. It’s manifestly true, but I think it speaks to something deeper.</p>
<p>Again, I am not making the spiritual man versus machine argument. It’s simply a flaw you’ll see come up time and time again when interacting with these models, no matter how advanced they seem to be getting. It’s a leaky abstraction, baring its inner architecture when it meant to masquerade as an anthropomorphism.</p>
<p>This is why every message from ChatGPT reads like a high school essay. It has taken the most average kind of output and reproduced it. It has been stripped of personality and toughened with scholastic rigor. It is bland, corporate speak.</p>
<p>It’s easy to spot fake Amazon reviews these days by thinking “would I ever write something like this?“. Would you add an intro and conclusion to your experiences with Oxiclean dish wipes? Would you thank the manufacturers and acknowledge their dedication to customer service?</p>
<p>Our LLM detection models, like an on-screen captcha, must soon start screening for personality.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  	<p><br><strong>Industry gadfly and mate died yesterday</strong></p>
<p>One of the legends of the IT industry, tantric guru, and the inventor of the cynical red-top tech tabloid, Mike Magee, has died at the age of 74.</p>
	  </div><div>
	  	
<p>Magee started his career as a printer before working for VNU Business Publications on PC Dealer and then at their IT news venture, VNU Newswire. This was where I met him; his effective method proved a handful for his editors.</p>
<p>His technique was simple: He would disappear for most of the day and somehow write the lead story. If needed, he could be found in one of Soho’s nearby waterholes. If you were a good editor you learnt not to interfere.</p>
<p>He left the Newswire and co-founded The Register, the UK's first Internet-based IT tabloid, with John Lettice in 1994. Magee focused on computer chip reporting in the newsletter, and Lettice covered software.</p>
<p>"We realised the chip industry was worth about $200bn a year then, and we were down the pub one day and said, ‘Why don't we do a newsletter because we can and this is a big, big market, and nobody else seems to be doing much about&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090710051814/http:/www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=34330">it</a>," Magee said.</p>
<p>The Rodgister used the slogan "Biting the Hand That Feeds IT" to reflect its iconoclastic attitude, attracting a following among IT professionals and investors.</p>
<p>In December 2000, Magee suffered a heart attack and died on the operating table only to revive and being told that he would have to do the same operation in ten years (he didn’t). When he returned to work, he stated publicly that he disagreed with the editorial direction of The Register.</p>
<p>He left to found The Inquirer, which reflected the original editorial philosophy. Unlike The Register, which received a lot of investment, The Inquirer received little financing but managed to make a profit. Magee was the only full-time employee. The entire magazine was based on freelance submissions, and staff and advertising were outsourced. Many technology journalists who got their start at the INQ owe something to Mike.</p>
<p>In 2006, Magee met with VNU leaders over their alleged use of a web layout similar to that of The Inquirer. Later that year, Magee sold The Inquirer to VNU. He remained as editor of The Inquirer until February 2008, when he left to pursue other publishing ventures, including TechEye and ChannelEye. He joined Fudzilla as Editor-at-Large in July 2016.</p>
<p>In 2009 the Daily Telegraph placed Magee 35 in its list of Top 50 most influential Britons in technology.</p>
<p>Mike was a poster child for ignoring the doctor’s advice. Despite some severe illness in later life, he continued his life as always.</p>
<p>While most people know about his fame as a tech industry gadfly, fewer are aware of his interest in the esoteric and the occult. This began with his work with Alistair Crowley’s secretary, Kenneth Grant.</p>
<p>In 1971, he started an occult fanzine called Azoth, and in 1973, in conjunction with David Hall and his then girlfriend Janet Bailey, he started a more ambitious six-monthly magazine called SOTHiS.</p>
<p>This brought him into contact with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. Despite his fame, his accountant did not allow Page to have much money, so he approached Magee for a loan to buy an esoteric bookstore. The loan was never repaid. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1973, while on holiday, he had a lucid dream about the Indian goddess Kali, which left him keen to learn more about Indian traditions. After various mystical experiences, he became interested in the tantric tradition.</p>
<p>In 1977, he went to India and met with an English tantrik guru called HH Shri Gurudev Mahendranath (1911-1992) who was a guru (some say the last guru) of the Uttarakaula Tantric Order of northern India. Mahendranath gave him the title of a guru and a charter to form a group of students.</p>
<p>Later, this was to become a nucleus for the "Arcane Magical Order of the Knights of Shambhala" (AMOOKOS). This group was highly influential, particularly in bringing Tantrik teachings to the&nbsp;West.&nbsp;In the UK, it had about 500 members.</p>
<p>In 1980, Mahendranath claimed, despite some evidence, that he had never given Magee the right to form AMOOKOS and the group fragmented. Magee went on to do his own thing, concentrating more on&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090710051814/http:/www.shivashakti.com/PersonalStatement.htm">Tantra.</a>&nbsp;He has also provided translations for Tantra website&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090710051814/http:/www.religiousworlds.com/mandalam/index.html%20">Shiva Shakti Mandalam</a>.</p>
<p>He formed his own publishing company producing translations of Indian tantric texts.</p>
<p>He married Jan Bailey in a civil ceremony at Edgware Registry Office in 1978. Two witnesses were present, one of whom was pulled in from the Street. They had a son, Tamlin, who was an occasion Techeye writer.</p>
<p>Writing a mate’s obit is an arse. Whatever you want to write about, cannot do justice to a bloke who lived life to the full and made a difference to many. &nbsp;You want to write something like “I am sure he is in the heavenly Star and Garter with Dave Evans and others he worked with.” &nbsp;But that would dumb down someone who was incredibly complex and multifaceted. How can you be sad that someone who literally walked through Indian cemeteries to find a death goddess finally found what he was searching for?</p>
<p>Still it is an arse for the rest of the planet.</p>	  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>With no consensus on the safety of the Starliner crew capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday they need another week or two before deciding whether to bring two astronauts back to Earth on Boeing's spacecraft or extend their stay on the International Space Station until next year.</p>
<p>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, stricken by suspect thrusters and helium leaks, is taking up a valuable parking spot at the space station. It needs to depart the orbiting research complex, with or without its two-person crew, before the launch of SpaceX's next Dragon crew mission to the station, scheduled for September 24.</p>
<p>"We can juggle things and make things work if we need to extend, but it’s getting a lot harder," said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of NASA's spaceflight operations directorate. "With the consumables we’re using, with the need for the use of the ports for cargo missions, those types of things, we’re reaching a point where that last week in August, we really should be making a call, if not sooner.”</p>
<p>Last week, NASA officials said they expected to make a decision in mid-August—presumably this week—but Bowersox said Wednesday NASA probably won't make the final call on what to do with the Starliner spacecraft until the end of next week, or the beginning of the week of August 26.</p>
<p>“We’ve got time available before we bring Starliner home and we want to use that time wisely," Bowersox said.</p>
<p>NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched inside Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5. Their mission is the first crew test flight on Boeing's capsule before NASA clears Starliner for regular crew rotation flights to the space station. But after software setbacks, parachute concerns, and previous problems with its propulsion system, Boeing's Starliner program is running more than four years behind SpaceX's Dragon crew spacecraft, which flew astronauts to the station for the first time in 2020.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>And now, there's a significant chance the Starliner crew won't come home in the spacecraft they launched in. Bowersox, a former astronaut, said NASA brought in propulsion experts from other programs to take a fresh look at the thruster issue.</p>
<p>Engineers are still investigating the root cause of why five of Starliner's 28 reaction control system thrusters, supplied by Aerojet Rocketdyne, failed during approach to the space station the day after launch. The thrusters overheated as they pulsed over and over again to fine-tune the ship's rendezvous with the station. Tests of a similar control jet on the ground suggested a Teflon seal in an internal valve could swell at higher temperatures, restricting the flow of propellant to the thruster.</p>
<p>Four of the five thrusters that failed before Starliner docked at the station have recovered and generated near-normal thrust levels during test-firings last month. But many engineers at NASA aren't convinced the thrusters will work normally on Starliner's journey from the space station back to Earth. These control jets are needed to keep the spacecraft pointed in the right direction when four larger rocket engines fire for the deorbit burn to steer the capsule on a trajectory back into the atmosphere for landing.</p>
<p>Rapid pulses of the thrusters, coupled with a long firing of the four larger engines, could raise temperatures inside four doghouse-shaped propulsion pods around the perimeter of Starliner's service module. Once the deorbit burn is complete, Starliner will jettison the service module to burn up in the atmosphere, and its crew module will use a different set of thrusters to guide its reentry. Then, it will deploy parachutes to slow for landing, likely at White Sands, New Mexico.</p>

During REM sleep, the brain's internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal?  Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.</p></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-3">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p></div>
