<p>I’ve done a lot in my career. From working on business support software to big backend systems and even robotics. If there’s been a consistent through-line to my career, it’s the Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>In recent years, Ruby has fallen out of favor with the tech industry, but I still love it. It’s a great language with so many strengths that it hurts when I see people trash Ruby or say its time is over. Thankfully, I’m not alone. There are so many Ruby devs still out here. The community is niche, but thriving. People are puzzled by this sometimes. Once, a colleague once said “rubyists really love ruby,” with an air of surprise. I’ve heard others trash ruby for not having types. One person laughed at me when I said Ruby was an “expressive language” and said, “it doesn’t express anything about the implementation.”</p>

<p>So why do myself and others love Ruby so much? I thought I’d explore this a bit.</p>

<h2 id="fostering-programmer-happiness">Fostering Programmer Happiness</h2>
<p>First and foremost, Ruby is a language that strives to make programmers happy. This is an underrated value and one that often gets our community mocked by our peers within other communities. The language is meant be joyful to use. This is a value and an ethos that permeates the language, the ecosystem of gems, and the community. Everything else that Ruby is stems from this value.</p>

<p>When I write Ruby, I take so much joy out of the process. Even the bad parts. In the middle of a high stress incident, Ruby still sparks joy. In fact, the only time I don’t enjoy Ruby is when I’m working on a piece of code that doesn’t follow Ruby practices, patterns, and idioms. Which brings me to the next topic</p>

<h2 id="expressiveness-encouraged">Expressiveness Encouraged</h2>
<p>Ruby is probably the most expressive programming language on Earth. Between its metaprogramming features and cultural idioms, Ruby allows programmers to write code that clearly expresses its intent. Well written ruby code can often read like natural language. Features like predicate methods even give up punctuation. So you can easily write something like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>@subscription</span><span>.</span><span>supports_feature?</span><span>(</span><span>:feature_a</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>else</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is often why ruby programmers don’t like comments. In most cases, the language makes comments unnecessary. And when you do need them, it’s often when you’re doing a very specific  or obscure thing that requires context to understand. It’s clear from the code why you need a comment in that case.</p>

<p>Tied into this is the ecosystems embrace of domain specific languages(DSLs), which give us the power to write incredibly expressive code that reads like what it’s doing. For example, RSpec’s DSL reads exactly like how a person might talk about what they want to test:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>RSpec</span><span>.</span><span>describe</span> <span>Ticket</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>context</span> <span>'when the ticket is closed'</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>it</span> <span>'emails the requestor with a confirmation'</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>...</span>
	<span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><del>Methods</del>, sorry “approaches,” like this have made Ruby so joyful to use.</p>

<h2 id="a-language-made-just-for-me">A Language Made Just For Me</h2>
<p>Many rubyists, myself included, recount stories of how Ruby and Rails just fit their brain. I recently told this story on <a href="https://www.remoteruby.com/2260490/14003706-unlocking-the-power-of-state-machines-in-code-development-with-elise-schaefer">Remote Ruby</a> about learning ruby. I said that when I was learning Ruby it felt like it was made just for me. I could guess method names and signatures and I would be right most of the time. When I was wrong, I could switch the order of arguments. This was so true that quickly I learned to just try something based on intuition before reading the docs. I know so many rubyists who have similar stories.</p>

<p>Feeling recognition in the language you’re programming is so powerful.</p>

<h2 id="community-and-values">Community And Values</h2>
<p>It’s so hard to talk about Ruby without talking about how the community shapes what Ruby is and how it feels to use the language. Ruby is a great language with so many benefits. There’s lots of features and values built into its core that make it a joy to use.</p>

<p>But as Kent Beck said at RailsConf in 2020, “Software design is an exercise in human relationships.” He was talking about how we think about designing software. But I think this quote applies to our community and our values as well. If you’ve followed this blog or listened to The Ruby on Rails Podcast since I took over, you know that community is a big part of my value system. That value is shared by other rubyists.</p>

<p>I attended RubyConf in San Diego this year. These conferences are always a blast. It feels like I’m coming home to see old friends. The community building that happens at these conferences makes lifelong colleagues and friends. There a spirit of learning, and cooperation. We want to help each other, teach each other, learn from each other. The Ruby community is an incredible group of people of welcoming, kind, and supportive peers. Without the community, Ruby couldn’t be what it is.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of reasons to like ruby. And there’s so many things that rubyists love. I haven’t covered everything. But Ruby’s primary features are joy and community. That’s hard to beat.</p>

<p>This how-to shows a way to return HTML content and use the <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx library</a> to handle the AJAX requests.
Htmx expects an HTML response and uses it to replace an element inside the DOM (see the <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/#introduction">htmx introduction</a> in the docs).</p>

<p>To simplify things, we won’t be using authentication, so grant all permissions on the <code><span>todos</span></code> table to the <code><span>web_anon</span></code> user.</p>

<p>Next, add the <code><span>text/html</span></code> as a <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/media_type_handlers.html#custom-media"><span>Media Type Handlers</span></a>. With this, PostgREST can identify the request made by your web browser (with the <code><span>Accept:</span> <span>text/html</span></code> header)
and return a raw HTML document file.</p>

<p>These two functions are used to build the to-do list template. We won’t use them as PostgREST endpoints.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code><span>api.html_todo</span></code> function uses the table <code><span>api.todos</span></code> as a parameter and formats each item into a list element <code><span>&lt;li&gt;</span></code>.
The PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html#FUNCTIONS-STRING-FORMAT">format</a> is useful to that end.
It replaces the values according to the position in the template, e.g. <code><span>%1$s</span></code> will be replaced with the value of <code><span>$1.id</span></code> (the first parameter).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>api.html_all_todos</span></code> function returns the <code><span>&lt;ul&gt;</span></code> wrapper for all the list elements.
It uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html">string_arg</a> to concatenate all the to-dos in a single text value.
It also returns an alternative message, instead of a list, when the <code><span>api.todos</span></code> table is empty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s add an endpoint to register a to-do in the database and modify the <code><span>/rpc/index</span></code> page accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code><span>/rpc/add_todo</span></code> endpoint allows us to add a new to-do using the <code><span>_task</span></code> parameter and returns an <code><span>html</span></code> with all the to-dos in the database.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>/rpc/index</span></code> now adds the <code><span>hx-headers='{"Accept":</span> <span>"text/html"}'</span></code> tag to the <code><span>&lt;body&gt;</span></code>.
This will make sure that all htmx elements inside the body send this header, otherwise PostgREST won’t recognize it as HTML.</p>
<p>There is also a <code><span>&lt;form&gt;</span></code> element that uses the htmx library. Let’s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code><span>hx-post="/rpc/add_todo"</span></code>: sends an AJAX POST request to the <code><span>/rpc/add_todo</span></code> endpoint, with the value of the <code><span>_task</span></code> from the <code><span>&lt;input&gt;</span></code> element.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-target="#todo-list-area"</span></code>: the HTML content returned from the request will go inside <code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>id="todo-list-area"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></code> (which is the list of to-dos).</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-trigger="submit"</span></code>: htmx will do this request when submitting the form (by pressing enter while inside the <code><span>&lt;input&gt;</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-on="htmx:afterRequest:</span> <span>this.reset()"&gt;</span></code>: this is a Javascript command that clears the form <a href="https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:afterRequest">after the request is done</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, the <code><span>http://localhost:3000/rpc/index</span></code> page lists all the todos and adds new ones by submitting tasks in the input element.

</pre></div>
<p>Let’s deconstruct the new htmx features added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code><span>&lt;form&gt;</span></code> element is configured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code><span>hx-post="/rpc/change_todo_state"</span></code>: does an AJAX POST request to that endpoint. It will toggle the <code><span>done</span></code> state of the to-do.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-vals='{"_id":</span> <span>%1$s,</span> <span>"_done":</span> <span>%4$s}'</span></code>: adds the parameters to the request.
This is an alternative to using hidden inputs inside the <code><span>&lt;form&gt;</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-trigger="click"</span></code>: htmx does the request after clicking on the element.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the first <code><span>&lt;button&gt;</span></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code><span>hx-get="/rpc/html_editable_task"</span></code>: it does an AJAX GET request to that endpoint.
It returns an HTML with an input that will allow us to edit the task.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-target="#todo-edit-area"</span></code>: the returned HTML will replace the element with this id.
In this case, this replaces an individual task, not the whole list.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>hx-vals='{"id":</span> <span>"eq.%1$s"}'</span></code>: adds the query parameters to the GET request.
Note that this needs the <code><span>eq.</span></code> operator because it represents a table column not a function parameter.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the second <code><span>&lt;button&gt;</span></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code><span>hx-post="/rpc/delete_todo"</span></code>: this post request will delete the corresponding to-do.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking on the first button will enable the task editing.
That’s why we create the <code><span>api.html_editable_task</span></code> function as an endpoint:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>replace</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>html_editable_task</span><span>(</span><span>_id</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>"text/html"</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>$$</span>
<span>select</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>html</span><span>$</span>
<span>&lt;form id="edit-task-%1$s"</span>
<span>      hx-post="/rpc/change_todo_task"</span>
<span>      hx-headers='{"Accept": "text/html"}'</span>
<span>      hx-vals='{"_id": %1$s}'</span>
<span>      hx-target="#todo-list-area"</span>
<span>      hx-trigger="submit,focusout"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;input class="bg-gray-50 border text-sm rounded-lg block w-full p-2.5 bg-gray-700 border-gray-600 text-white focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500"</span>
<span>         id="task-%1$s" type="text" name="_task" value="%2$s" autofocus&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span>$</span><span>html</span><span>$</span><span>,</span>
<span>  </span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
<span>  </span><span>task</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>where</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_id</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span> </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this example, this will return an input field that allows us to edit the corresponding to-do task.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s add the endpoints that will modify and delete the to-dos in the database.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>or</span><span> </span><span>replace</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>change_todo_state</span><span>(</span><span>_id</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_done</span><span> </span><span>boolean</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>"text/html"</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>$$</span>

<span>$$</span><span> </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>All of those functions return an HTML list of to-dos that will replace the outdated one:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code><span>api.change_todo_state</span></code> function updates the <code><span>done</span></code> column using the <code><span>_id</span></code> and the <code><span>_done</span></code> values from the request.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>api.delete_todo</span></code> function deletes a to-do using the <code><span>_id</span></code> value from the request.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>api.change_todo_task</span></code> function modifies the <code><span>task</span></code> column  using the <code><span>_id</span></code> and the <code><span>_task</span></code> value from the request.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After refreshing the <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/schema_cache.html#schema-reloading"><span>schema cache</span></a>, the page at <code><span>http://localhost:3000/rpc/index</span></code> will allow us to edit, delete and complete any to-do.</p>
<p><img alt="../_images/htmx-edit-delete.gif" src="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/_images/htmx-edit-delete.gif"></p><p>With that, we completed the to-do list functionality.</p>

<div>
<p><em>Edit: Thank you to the 100k people who have read this piece. It looks like many people are struggling with the concept of "greatness". Let's continue to support one another on the journey there. </em></p><p>Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what <em>greatness</em> truly means. I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable. </strong></em></blockquote><h2 id="consider-this">Consider This</h2><p>Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:</p><ul><li>Greatness is not instantaneous</li><li>Greatness is earned</li></ul><p>The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck. </p><p>Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. </p><p>Many people, in theory, want to be “great”. In fact, each month 1000 people search “how to be great”, 260 people search “how to become perfect”, and 2400 people search “how to be the best”, looking for discrete answers on how to get from 0 to 1. Yet, many people in life realistically do not want to put in the effort over a sustained period of time to actually get to 1. They are looking for the “secrets to success” that in many ways, do not exist. You know what brings success? Hard work brings success. </p><p>So before proceeding forward in this article, I implore each of you to consider that if greatness truly is a reflection of non-instantaneous, earned effort, ask yourself if that’s the life you’d like to live. Ask yourself whether you’d like to spend your days, weeks, months, and years in a constant uphill battle. </p><p>If you ultimately find that you don’t want to do that, that’s fine! It doesn’t make you less of a person. At least you’ve broken from the holding pattern of thinking you want to do X but not understanding why you haven’t gotten there yet. And if that’s the case, go enjoy your Netflix and chill completely guilt-free.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into what truly makes someone “great’. </p><h2 id="it-s-hard-to-be-consistent">It’s Hard to be Consistent</h2><p>There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the <em>best</em> way to “success” is through consistency.</p><blockquote><em>“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”</em> - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></blockquote><p>To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:</p><ol><li>Inputs are consistent over time</li><li>Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs</li></ol><h3 id="consistency">Consistency<br></h3><blockquote><em>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich”</em> - <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fcnn4K">Outliers</a></blockquote><p>There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”</em>. I would actually argue the quote should be, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.</em></p><p>If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful. </p><p>There’s glimmer and hoopla around unpredictability, but in reality, it’s much more difficult and therefore impressive, to be predictably good. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to wake up whenever you “feel like it”. </li><li>It’s hard to stick to a routine of getting up at 6AM.</li><li>It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.</li><li>It’s hard to stick with a side project for years, many of which may not be profitable for a long while. </li><li>It’s easy to give up on someone when you hit a roadblock or the next potential partner becomes available. </li><li>It’s hard to be faithful and invest in a relationship for decades.</li></ul><p>We normally set out in life with good intentions. We <em>intend</em> to set a morning routine or work on a business until it's profitable or to “love someone forever”. We imagine that as we invest in something, we will naturally continue to move in the right direction. If anything, things will get easier, right?</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NQV_7RXfM2ZYDJsT4E4JAaAW2i9KphrB7-fE8XveJlrW-Msf1aIot9ayls-wSCWIroq155Fzdz6vE3d8br71E6Tc5sTQRyhnT0Zb6EJCUoV41B5EoZSczjtWcHo9KV-T9c6s16Cb"></figure><p>The described trajectory is what we perceive on the left. Predictable, linear, and a direct reflection of effort put in. </p><p><strong>Rarely does success in anything look like that.</strong> Life is a series of tiny nodes that tend to look more like the right hand side. There two key elements worth calling out in the more realistic graph on the right:</p><ul><li>Compounding is always present. The earlier steps in any process will be more strenuous, yet it’s difficult to imagine the potential compounding that comes later on. </li><li>With the ups, there are always downs. This seems obvious, but we often forget this when we are in periods of down. We quit at these local minimums (the highlighted sections in red above), because we cannot see the next peak right around the corner. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>a friend just emailed me this note in response to my 'burn out' video. wanted to share;</p><p>'the addiction to having success is what makes you feel unsuccessful at the times when you're not feeling the immediate dopamine hit of your work 'succeeding' at that precise moment.'</p></div>— Casey Neistat (@Casey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1093520669286064133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have lost our ability to appreciate delayed gratification and, some of us who struggle with perfectionism, can either create repeatedly until we ‘get it right’ never truly feeling fulfilled with our work, or, we avoid creating all together in fear of failing.</p>— Marcio Novelli (@MarcioNovelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcioNovelli/status/1093522120536150017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The local minima are especially psychologically taxing due to something called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a> or hedonic adaptation. Essentially, as someone achieves new successes in various aspects of their lives, their baseline shifts to reflect that new level and therefore, their expectations and desires are re-established as well. There is no net gain in happiness and thus, it becomes even more difficult to stay “level-headed” during these down moments. </p><p>That is exactly why a specific search for success can be problematic and instead of looking for unsustainable shortcuts in life, it’s much more effective (and healthy) to aim for continuous habits that bring you success as a byproduct, not as the end goal.</p><blockquote><em>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear</em></blockquote><p>On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’.</p><h3 id="inputs-outputs">Inputs → Outputs</h3><p>The second important aspect of achieving greatness is acting with intention. Your actions and results will not always reflect your intentions, but as you move towards “greatness”, you should have a better idea of what inputs actually deliver output. You’ll still make mistakes﹣as we all do﹣but you’ll have a better grasp on what is more likely to work out. For example, your success rate may be 30%, versus someone flying blind with a 5% success rate. </p><p>Let’s look at a simple example:</p><p>Imagine company X has two sales people. Salesperson A happens to land a $1M deal in his first week. However, he struggles to land anything substantial for the next 6 months. Meanwhile, salesperson B manages to develop a process over the first month, bringing in only $100k which he’s able to scale up and double month over month.</p><p>After six months, this will be the revenue generated by each party.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png"></figure><p>You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding." </p><p>Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements. If you invest time into solving for what leads to success continuously, you will reap those benefits for years to come. <em>So even in the least quantifiable situations, reflect back on what could’ve made a previous loss a future win. </em></p><p>Consider the best companies over time. None of them emerged overnight, nor was there a single inflection point that determined the success or notoriety of these companies. The line of separation between the “great” companies of all time and the “not so great”, is their ability to stand the test of time. </p><p>Would you rather be Juicero that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juicero">raised $100M</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/rip-juicero-the-400-venture-backed-juice-machine/">went bankrupt</a> within a year of its Series C, or Zoom, which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list#section-funding-rounds">took almost 8 years to take on more funding than $30M</a> and is now one of the most profitable and highly sought after “unicorns” in the valley?</p><p>On top of consistency, greatness comes from asking the right questions and iterating to learn what inputs drive favourable outputs, and ideally <strong>why</strong>. “Greatness” comes from an identified or researched process that when followed, has some degree of certainty in the outcome. </p><p>“Moving fast and breaking things” is not a strategy, unless you are clearly defining a process of learning so that in the future, you can “move fast and break less of the same things”.</p>


<h2 id="a-habit-of-progression">A Habit of Progression</h2><blockquote><em>“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.” </em>- Albert Einstein</blockquote><p>Understand that in order to achieve the things you want in life, you’ll need to establish a <strong>habit of progression</strong>. You literally need to become good at being decent. </p><p>There is one thing to clarify: this habit of progression must come with the right inputs. Being consistent with something leading you in the wrong direction, will <em>unsurprisingly</em> lead you in the wrong direction. So if this is the way you are constantly moving (excluding short periods of local minima), pivot until you determine what the right inputs are. I recently stumbled upon a concept of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200908160755/jdreyespaez.site/zero-acceleration/">zero acceleration, but non-zero velocity</a>, which encapsulates this idea well. </p><p>Before you find the path that you want to double down on, this habit of progression takes the form of iteration. I see many people who are stuck in this stage and feel like they’re moving nowhere. Perhaps they go take a degree for a year and find that wasn’t right. Maybe they go and work for a company for two more and realize that wasn’t right either. </p><p>If you’re struggling to identify the right path, create more nodes of optimization. For example: if you’re making changes every year, you only have maybe 80 in your entire life to make. Instead, try testing things intentionally every month or even every week. Pilot a lot and then double down when you have found your path towards “good”. </p><p>You may ask, “what makes good, good?”. Ask yourself the question: “If I were to continue this every day for the next year, would I be in a better place?” If the answer is yes, you have a path towards “good”. </p><p>Once you have found your inputs, then you’re in a good place to turn those inputs into the right habits through deliberate practice. Ie: you’ll be in a place to shift from good to great. </p><p>This process of shifting between iteration and consistency is all part of developing a habit of progression. Once you make this habit your north star, you are no longer dependent on that &nbsp;“one big break” or that one company to “finally give you a chance”. </p><p>And finally, if you’re reading this advice and think, “I’ve heard this before”, then ask yourself whether you’ve truly acted on this advice. When is the last time you truly iterated and tried new things? When is the last time you found something <em>good</em> and then truly stuck to it for years?</p><h2 id="two-steps-out">Two Steps Out </h2><p>While you’re moving towards “greatness”, keep in mind that it will likely happen slowly and that’s okay.</p><p>When I think about the growth trajectory of my life and similarly, anyone that I’ve been close with, changes have always happened slowly. Whether it was a close family member falling into deep mental illness or friends building businesses to near-unicorn valuations, nothing ever happened overnight. Even more notably, no one would have ever expected those outcomes years prior. </p><p>In the grand scheme of things, I think it’s because you can only ever see two steps out. What do I mean by that?</p><p>Say that in life there are 100 tiers of happiness. Of course, life is more complicated and dynamic than this view, but bear with me for a minute. Let’s say that you’re on “Tier 57”. &nbsp;You may be able to see Tier 58 and 59, but I think it’s nearly impossible to fully empathize or even comprehend level 21 and similarly 89, unless of course you’ve been there before. Even if you have, it becomes a distant memory that’s difficult to fully internalize. Remember, the Hedonic treadmill is almost always at play. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/06/image-3.png"></figure><p>Why is this important? Everyone wishes to elevate their life and in association, their happiness. For us to reach these top tiers, we cannot hope for this to <em>just happen</em>. We must expose ourselves to various inputs that may lead to better outputs, and train ourselves to recognize what’s working. </p><p>And that’s exactly the point of continuous improvement. Since I believe that we can only ever see “two levels out”, we can’t discover these new inputs without slow, but repeatable change. We must explore 58 and then 59 and then all of a sudden, 61 will appear as this new array of opportunity we had never considered before. </p><p>As a more tangible example, when I started working in an office, I simply couldn’t fully visualize remote work. I knew it existed, but I couldn’t truly imagine this new way of living. And even once I started working remotely, it took years of iteration and pivoting to expand into the lifestyle that I now call my own. And of course, there’s probably many more tiers to explore that I simply haven’t visualized yet. </p><blockquote><em>“To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.” - Henri Bergson</em></blockquote><p>That’s precisely why it’s good to continuously surround yourself with new environments and people, and to focus on slow, but steady compounding. I think this tweet from Michael Nielson captures what I’m trying to communicate. </p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since reading this 6 months ago, I've come to think it's half a dozen of the best paragraphs I've ever read on how to get much, much better at anything: (by @autotrnslucence ) <a href="https://t.co/dMoEwHtjfU">pic.twitter.com/dMoEwHtjfU</a></p>— michael_nielsen (@michael_nielsen) <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1074150124169773056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2018</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="stop-speculating">Stop Speculating</h2><blockquote><em>“I have seen impractical and improbable things accomplished. All it took to achieve improbable things was an optimistic attitude and a refusal to give up.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/2XwrlzI">The Woman Who Smashed Codes</a></em></blockquote><p>James Clear, from <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, mentions a study in which students in Jerrey Uelsmann’s University of Florida photography class were divided into two groups. The first group would be the “quantity” group, while the second would be the “quality” group. The former would be judged solely on the number of photographs they submitted, while the latter would be graded on the excellence of a single image.</p><p>The interesting outcome of the experiment was that the best photos were produced not by the quality group, but by the quantity group. Why? While the quality group spent their time speculating what perfection may have been, the quantity group took action in testing what was truly great. </p><blockquote><em>“It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action” - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></em></blockquote><p>In other words, the “search” for greatness is often misguided, perhaps because what we imagine to be great, is in fact not that great at all. Instead of speculating what may make you great, get out there and start <strong>doing</strong>. Do not look for perfection or even greatness, but instead signs of “good” and start making tangible progress. </p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Building products, writing, and painting are not mental excercises, they are physical ones.</p><p>Reading to improve is like watching someone else workout – it does almost nothing for you. </p><p>To run better, run. <br>To paint better, paint. <br>To write better, write.<br>To build better, build.</p></div>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1118224158020685824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2019</a></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This year, the YJIT team has been working hard to improve and optimize YJIT. We’re proud
to say that the version of YJIT to be included with Ruby 3.3 is leaps and bounds ahead
of Ruby 3.2’s. It provides better performance across the board, while also warming up faster
and using less memory. The 3.3 release is also more robust, including a number of
bug fixes along with an improved test suite. In this blog post, we share some early
numbers.</p>

<h2 id="yjit-33s-optimizations">YJIT 3.3’s Optimizations</h2>

<p>YJIT 3.3 includes several optimizations not present in 3.2. One of the main
differences, performance-wise, is that we have much better JIT coverage. That
is, there are much fewer situations where YJIT needs to fall back to the
interpreter. In particular, YJIT is now able to better handle calls with
splats as well as optional parameters, it’s able to compile exception
handlers, and it can handle megamorphic call sites and instance variable
accesses without falling back to the interpreter.</p>

<p>We’ve also implemented specialized inlined primitives for certain core
method calls such as <code>Integer#!=</code>, <code>String#!=</code>, <code>Kernel#block_given?</code>,
<code>Kernel#is_a?</code>, <code>Kernel#instance_of?</code>, <code>Module#===</code>, and more. It also inlines
trivial Ruby methods that only return a constant value such as <code>#blank?</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49909">specialized <code>#present?</code></a> from Rails.
These can now be used without needing to perform expensive method calls in
most cases.
Lastly, YJIT has a new register allocator which results in slightly
more efficient machine code.</p>

<p>In terms of reducing YJIT’s memory usage, this may be surprising to
some, but the bulk of the memory used by YJIT is not taken by generated
machine code, but rather by metadata YJIT uses to keep track of various
pieces of information associated with said generated code. As such, we’ve
spent a good amount of effort making multiple incremental improvements
to cut down the size of the metadata that we keep.</p>

<p>Another key piece in terms of memory usage has been the introduction of
a “cold threshold” heuristic. With this new heuristic, YJIT tries to cut
down on the amount of “cold”, rarely used method that get compiled. This
doesn’t make any difference on benchmarks, but it’s important for real-world
production scenarios, because there is often a long tail of rarely used
methods that get compiled, which keeps gradually increasing the size of
the generated machine code, sometimes even multiple days after code has
been deployed to production. With this heuristic, we’ve been able to cut
down the size of the generated machine code and its associated metadata
by about 20%. The key takeaway is, we’ve reduced memory usage not just by
using less memory per piece of compiled code, but also by compiling less
code in the first place.</p>

<p>Finally, this may or may not count as an optimization, but we’ve also
made some changes to try and ship YJIT with better defaults out of the
box. Following the 3.2 release, we’ve received feedback from multiple
production deployments that it was necessary to adjust the YJIT
configuration to change the memory size and call threshold values to
get better performance. With YJIT 3.3, we’ve set default values that
should work better for most production deployments. YJIT should now
automatically increase the call threshold for any deployments that
load more than a trivial amount of code, which should result in
a smoother warm-up.</p>

<h2 id="new-features-in-yjit-33">New Features in YJIT 3.3</h2>

<p>YJIT 3.3 doesn’t just include performance improvements. We’ve also added some
new features to make your life easier. One such feature is that it’s now possible
to enable YJIT at run-time from Ruby code by calling <code>RubyVM::YJIT.enable</code>. This
makes it possible to selectively enable YJIT on some forked processes without
enabling it on all processes. It also makes it
possible to only enable YJIT after your app is done booting, so that you can
completely avoid compiling initialization code. The next Rails release will
take advantage of this to
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49947">automatically enable YJIT</a> in an initializer.</p>

<p>We’ve also improved the way we collect run-time stats.
Prior to this, in order to collect performance statistics, you needed to
rebuild Ruby from source to produce a special stats build. Most end users found
this inconvenient, particularly in a production environment. Most of the stats
provided by <code>--yjit-stats</code> are now available in release builds. This will make
troubleshooting performance issues easier.
Please note here that we are talking about statistics for you to consult about
your programs. For security and privacy reasons, YJIT does not “phone home”.</p>

<p>Another recent addition is a new <code>--yjit-perf</code> command-line option which
enables profiling with Linux perf by setting up frame pointers for YJIT
frames and producing a perf map.
More details about new additions to YJIT and Ruby 3.3 are provided in
the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/12/11/ruby-3-3-0-rc1-released/">release notes</a> for Ruby 3.3.0-rc1.</p>

<h2 id="performance-on-benchmarks">Performance on benchmarks</h2>

<p>We’ve benchmarked YJIT using the headline benchmarks from the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench">yjit-bench</a> suite.
These are benchmarks based on real-world gems which aim to be representative of real-world use cases,
with a bias towards things that we believe represent typical web workloads.
The graph below shows a comparison of the performance of the Ruby 3.2 interpreter, Ruby 3.3 interpreter,
Ruby 3.2 + YJIT, and Ruby 3.3 + YJIT. The benchmarks were run on a Ryzen 7 3700X machine running Ubuntu Linux 22.04.
Higher is better, with bars being normalized to 1.0 for the performance
of the Ruby 3.2 interpreter. For these experiments, we used a bleeding edge commit directly from the Ruby/master
branch of the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">git repository</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/bars_speedup.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>As you can see, YJIT 3.3 delivers a performance boost over YJIT 3.2 on every benchmark,
and the difference is usually quite significant.
Notably, rendering liquid templates is now over 2.5x faster with YJIT enabled than it is using only the
Ruby 3.2 interpreter. Railsbench is about 65% faster with YJIT. We’ve turned the
<a href="https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-25-we-turned-lobsters-into-a-rails-benchmark-for-yjit/">lobste.rs</a> website
into a benchmark, which we can render over 50% faster with YJIT as well, and if you’re using the Ruby LSP
language server in your code editor, YJIT also provides a 50%+ performance boost there too.</p>

<h2 id="memory-usage-on-benchmarks">Memory usage on benchmarks</h2>

<p>JIT compilers typically come with a tradeoff, which is that to some extent, they’re trading slightly
increased memory usage for better performance. As outlined previously, we’ve done a lot to reduce
the amount of memory overhead YJIT incurs. The overhead is still nonzero, but it has been
much improved, to the extent that it’s no longer an issue for our production deployments
at Shopify.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/bars_memory.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>The graph above shows the memory usage on each of our benchmarks running with and without YJIT enabled for
both Ruby 3.2.2 and 3.3.0. The great news is that the memory usage for YJIT 3.3 is below that
of YJIT 3.2 on almost every benchmark. Part of this reduction in memory usage is due to the work the YJIT team put in to
use memory more effectively. YJIT executes a higher percentage of total YARV instructions than before,
it generates more machine code per Ruby method compiled, and manages to do this with less total overhead.</p>

<p>However, much of the credit for the reduced total memory usage goes to my colleagues
Peter Zhu and Matthew Valentine-House. They’ve done some great work on the Ruby Garbage Collector (GC)
to <a href="https://railsatscale.com/2023-08-08-two-garbage-collection-improvements-made-our-storefronts-8-faster/">improve its performance</a>
and reduce CRuby’s memory usage. You can see this in the above graphs too. It’s not just YJIT’s memory usage
that went down. The memory usage of the CRuby 3.3.0 interpreter is below that of the 3.2.2
interpreter for most benchmarks.</p>

<p>In the spirit of transparency, we note that in the graph above, there is an anomaly, which is that YJIT’s
memory overhead on the <code>hexapdf</code> benchmark is much higher than on other benchmarks. This is something
we’ve discovered as we were producing graphs for this blog post, and are currently investigating. As far
as we can tell so far, it seems to be an issue caused by glibc’s malloc not releasing memory to the
operating system often enough in the presence of <code>mmap</code> calls. Manually calling <code>malloc_trim(3)</code> or
using <code>jemalloc</code> seems to fix the issue.</p>

<h2 id="sfr-production-deployment">SFR Production Deployment</h2>

<p>YJIT has been deployed to all of Shopify’s StoreFront Renderer (SFR) infrastructure for all of 2023.
For context, SFR renders all Shopify storefronts, which is the first thing buyers see when they navigate
to a store hosted by Shopify. It is mostly written in Ruby, depends on over 220 Ruby gems, renders millions of
Shopify stores in over 175 countries, and is served by multiple clusters distributed worldwide.
We’ve deployed Ruby 3.2.2 and 3.3.0 (Ruby master) to experimental clusters (a subset of SFR servers) so
we could gather experimental data for this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="performance-yjit-33-vs-the-cruby-33-interpreter">Performance: YJIT 3.3 vs the CRuby 3.3 Interpreter</h3>

<p>The following graph is a snapshot from our dashboard comparing the performance of the Ruby 3.3.0 interpreter vs YJIT 3.3.0
over the last 12 hours. The speedup figures that we see tend to change over time depending on web traffic, but we believe
it’s representative of the kinds of speedups you can hope to get from YJIT 3.3.
The Y-axis shows the speedup YJIT provides compared to the interpreter. This is computed based on the
total end-to-end time needed to generate a response, including time the SFR servers spend doing I/O, waiting on
databases, and other operations YJIT cannot optimize.
As we can see, the amount of speed boost that YJIT provides over the interpreter changes depending on time of
day and web traffic, but YJIT is consistently faster than the interpreter on average, even on the p99 slowest
requests. This is great, because speeding up the slowest requests makes the most difference to user experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/sfr_interp_33_vs_yjit.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>YJIT 3.3 is generally quite a bit faster than YJIT 3.2 on average. The difference is especially marked on the p99
slowest requests. This is likely because of targeted optimizations made to reduce the time YJIT takes to generate
code, as well as the addition of a “cold threshold” heuristic to reduce the
long tail of code that YJIT compiles. That is, YJIT 3.3 is more selective about which Ruby code it optimizes.</p>

<h3 id="memory-usage-yjit-33-vs-the-cruby-33-interpreter">Memory usage: YJIT 3.3 vs the CRuby 3.3 Interpreter</h3>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/sfr_mem_yjit33_interp.png" alt="" width="75%"></p>

<p>The graph above shows the RSS (Resident Set Size) and PSS (Proportional Set Size) of processes running YJIT
3.3 vs the CRuby 3.3 interpreter over the last 12 hours. When looking at the PSS, which takes into consideration
memory shared between multiple server processes with Unicorn, the memory overhead of enabling YJIT is
currently below 8% for our SFR deployment, which we deem to be a good memory vs performance tradeoff.</p>

<h2 id="optcarrot-and-ruby3x3">Optcarrot and Ruby3x3</h2>

<p>At RubyConf 2015, Yukihiro Matsumoto (aka Matz), chief designer of the Ruby programming language,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE0g2TUsJ4U&amp;t=3248s">announced Ruby3x3</a>, the goal of making Ruby 3
three times faster than Ruby 2. He compared this objective to John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing
humans on the moon within the decade. Despite the lack of concrete plans to achieve this, Matz
stated that a JIT compiler may be useful in achieving his inspiring objective.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mame/optcarrot">optcarrot benchmark</a> is not one that we look at often at Shopify, because
we don’t consider it to be representative of web workloads, or the workloads that the majority of Ruby users
typically run. This benchmark is a NES emulator. It implements its own interpreter loop, and contains multiple
large methods that perform a lot of bitwise arithmetic, which is something that is almost nonexistent in web
software. However, NES emulators will always be cool, and as self-respecting programmers, we have a moral
duty to ensure that Ruby can make them run fast, akin to the hippocratic oath sworn by doctors.</p>

<p>In December of 2020, Takashi Kokubun’s MJIT achieved <a href="https://k0kubun.medium.com/ruby-3-0-jit-and-beyond-4d9404ce33c">a significant milestone</a> by showing that it could run <code>optcarrot</code>
more than 3 times faster than Ruby 2.0, thereby achieving the Ruby3x3 goal (as long as you accept
performance on <code>optcarrot</code> to be a representative metric of Ruby’s performance).
Today, with the imminent release of YJIT 3.3, we can proudly say that Ruby 3.3 is over 3.3 times
faster than the CRuby 3.3 interpreter on this benchmark, thereby hitting a new major milestone, which
we have coined post-hoc as Ruby3.3x3.3.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/images/bars_optcarrot.png" alt="" width="95%"></p>

<p>As can be seen in the graph above, performance on <code>optcarrot</code> has gone up markedly with every new
YJIT release. According to stats produced by <code>--yjit-stats</code>, YJIT now executes more
than 99.1% of the instructions in this benchmark, and is also able to inline 79.9% of C function calls,
most of which are calls to Ruby runtime functions which YJIT is able to optimize. We hope to be able
to deliver even better performance for Ruby NES emulators next year.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Ruby 3.3.0 release will be available for you to download <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">on ruby-lang.org</a>
on December 25th. In the mean time, if you’re feeling really impatient to play with Ruby 3.3, you can find the latest
release candidate along with its release notes on the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/">Ruby releases page</a>.
With this release comes a much more capable version of YJIT, with multiple major improvements. The bottom line is that YJIT
performs better, while using memory more efficiently and warming up faster.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning more about YJIT, we’ve published a paper at the MPLR 2023 conference, which is now freely available
through <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3617651.3622982">ACM open access</a>. A video recording of our presentation at MPLR is also
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMGuQXNqlaE&amp;t=9900s">available on YouTube</a>.
There are also multiple presentations about YJIT available on YouTube, ranging from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0JRhh8w_4I">very approachable</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMchdR9C8XM">deeply technical</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’d like to give a big thanks to Shopify, Ruby &amp; Rails Infrastructure and the YJIT team for making this project possible.
Thank you Aaron Patterson for helping me put together this blog post.
A special shout out goes to Alan Wu and Takashi Kokubun. Two incredibly talented programmers that I have the privilege to work
with on the YJIT project. They’ve worked tirelessly to make the Ruby 3.3 release as performant and stable as possible.
If you’re using YJIT in production, please give us a shout out on Twitter/X. It’s always very rewarding for us to hear about
YJIT being deployed in the wild!</p>

In the next few months, everyone using Flipboard will be able to discover and follow a whole new group of writers, vloggers, artists, scientists, explorers, political leaders and millions of others who are posting content and conversing in the Fediverse. If you curate on Flipboard, not only will you have a lot more content to curate from, there will be millions more people to enjoy the Magazines and Storyboards you are curating. If you’re a publisher, creator or brand on Flipboard, you’ll start to see new visitors and engagement as people discover and share your content across the growing Fediverse.</p><p id="3493">If you’re already using the Fediverse, you’ll be able to discover more articles, videos and podcasts thoughtfully curated by Flipboard’s many publishers and curators around the world. You’ll also be able to follow and converse with them directly from Mastodon, Threads and other ActivityPub apps.</p><p id="b5de">What do you need to do to take advantage of all this? Nothing. Everyone using Flipboard will soon start seeing more content from more interesting people in the same familiar Flipboard experience. And everyone in the Fediverse will start seeing curated content from Flipboard in whatever app or experience they are already using today.</p><p id="2831"><strong>Federation in Three Phases</strong></p><p id="b4d1">When and how is this going to happen? The process of opening Flipboard to the Fediverse is called “federation” and it will happen in three distinct phases between now and April:</p><ul><li id="8ba0">Phase 1 (Today): We are federating 25 publishers and creators so that we can test and gather feedback</li><li id="35dd">Phase 2 (January): We will enable anyone in the Fediverse to follow and engage with any public curator on Flipboard</li><li id="b3fb">Phase 3 (April): We will enable anyone on Flipboard to follow and engage with any public account in the Fediverse</li></ul><p id="3918"><strong>The First 25 to Federate</strong></p><p id="93fa">In this first phase we are partnering with 25 publishers and creators to help them federate their Flipboard accounts and gather feedback from people across the Fediverse. This includes a range of publishers covering global news, tech, music, gaming, travel and science as well as a few content creators like <a href="https://flipboard.com/@ErinBrockovich" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Erin Brockovich</a> and <a href="https://flipboard.com/@Photowalks" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Jefferson Graham</a>. We are also federating several non-profits dedicated to advancing non-partisan journalism and combating misinformation. These include <a href="https://flipboard.com/@NewsLitProject" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The News Literacy Project</a>, <a href="https://flipboard.com/@The74" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The 74</a> and <a href="https://flipboard.com/@ConversationUS" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Conversation</a>. Finally, we are federating <a href="https://flipboard.com/@Medium" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Medium’s</a> account on Flipboard where they regularly feature great stories from their best writers.</p><p id="ac6a">Here’s the full list:</p><figure><figcaption>The first Flipboard profiles to join the Fediverse.</figcaption></figure><p id="b19f"><strong>Our Approach</strong></p><p id="44b3">As we federate Flipboard we will be guided by the first principles that formed the Fediverse as well as feedback from the many communities there today. Choice, privacy, openness and transparency will be critical to ensure we successfully federate the Flipboard community with the Fediverse. We recognize that we are helping to set a precedent for how other services will federate in the future so we will proceed thoughtfully and collaboratively.</p><p id="c06b">We are taking a number of important steps along these lines:</p><ul><li id="f25e">We have established <a href="http://flipboard.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">flipboard.com</a> as a new instance in the Fediverse where you will find all federated Flipboard accounts. We will also continue to operate our <a href="http://flipboard.social/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">flipboard.social</a> instance as a way for anyone to create a new Mastodon account and use the native Mastodon UI on a fast, safe and reliable server.</li><li id="6d76">We have signed on to the Mastodon server covenant for both Flipboard instances. This commits us to a standard of moderation, reliabilty and portability that is shared across other high quality instances in the Fediverse.</li><li id="fc44">We are extending our global moderation capabilities to our presence in the Fediverse. We will also continue to innovate and expand upon our “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” approach to moderation. We acknowledge in advance that we won’t be perfect in dealing with every moderation issue but we commit to working expeditiously to resolve these as they arise.</li><li id="068a">Our recommendation algorithms on Flipboard will honor Mastodon privacy settings and will continue to only surface content from domains that we have vetted in advance. We will continue to block content from domains that we have identified as toxic. We will also continue to grow our “Red/Green” domain list and we will share this with other instance owners in the Fediverse as soon as is practically possible.</li><li id="e5fa">We will collaborate with other instance owners to ensure we are efficiently relaying activity from Flipboard without overwhelming smaller instances. We will also help innovate ways for larger instances to shoulder the burden of expensive tasks like image storage and video streaming.</li><li id="27d3">We think it’s important to respect the spirit of what the follower count and “joined date” means to users on Mastodon today. While the accounts we are federating have tens of thousands or even millions of followers on Flipboard, we think this could be confusing to people in the Fediverse. Accordingly, follower counts will start at zero in the Fediverse and increment as each account accrues new ActivityPub followers. We are also setting the “Joined” date to the day each account is federated instead of when they joined Flipboard. We’ll continue to gather feedback on this as we gear up for phase 2.</li><li id="a51a">In January we will release a new version of Flipboard that will show follows, favorites and boosts from the Fediverse. It will also enable replies to and from the Fediverse as well as blocking, muting and reporting. We will encourage people to use these moderation tools liberally for the health of the overall Fediverse. We believe in the power of decentralized moderation and will continue to innovate new ways to utilize signals from the community to help stop bad actors and prevent toxic content from spreading.</li></ul><p id="1411"><strong>The Future is Federated</strong></p><p id="d5a4">This is the single largest expansion of the Flipboard ecosystem since we launched as a social magazine in 2010. I’m incredibly excited about how federation will benefit everyone on Flipboard and in the Fediverse. More importantly, I hope we can serve as inspiration for other apps and services contemplating the Fediverse. As more services federate the value of the Fediverse will increase exponentially and we will usher in a more vibrant and interoperable era for the people who make great content and everyone who enjoys it.</p><p id="17e5"><em>Note: If you’re interested in learning more about the Fediverse, ActivityPub and the future of the open social Web, check out </em><a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/dot-social-mike-mccue-hosts-podcast-about-the-future-of-social-media/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dot Social</em></a><em>, my new podcast which features in-depth interviews with many of the pioneers and leaders of this exciting new movement.</em></p><p id="117d">By Mike McCue, Flipboard CEO</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><em>The “forever chemicals” found in the Cape Fear River were detected through a non-targeted testing method developed at UNC-Chapel Hill that broadens researchers’ abilities to identify the hazardous compounds.</em></p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/comptox-chemicals-dashboard">keeps a list</a> of more than 14,000 known or potential per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Called “forever chemicals” for how long the molecules take to break down, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained">PFAS can be found</a> just about everywhere, and have been <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html">linked to health issues</a> like cancer and infertility.</p>
<p>PFAS are potentially hazardous to people and animals, so detecting them is vital. That’s why <a href="https://chem.unc.edu/faculty/baker-erin/">Erin Baker</a>, associate professor of chemistry within the UNC College of Arts and Sciences, and her lab are expanding testing methods to find them — efforts that were recently published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adj7048"><em>Science Advances</em></a>.</p>
<p>Researchers collaborating with Baker’s lab collected samples from North Carolina’s Cape Fear River in 2016. Using this new detection method, they tested the samples and found 47 different PFAS. Of those, 11 had not been previously detected in the river, and eight had not been detected anywhere outside of a lab.</p>
<p>“Eight of them weren’t on the EPA’s list of PFAS, which makes us think there are many more PFAS than we previously thought,” Baker says.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding the search</strong></p>
<p>For years, PFAS contaminants like GenX have been found in drinking water originating from the Cape Fear River, making it an ideal testing site for Baker and her team. Some of <a href="https://capefearriverwatch.org/genx/">this pollution has been directly linked</a> to production at the Chemours Fayetteville Works site, where chemicals are manufactured. Surrounding residents rely on testing conducted by scientists to understand what types of compounds they are being exposed to.</p>
<p>“Current testing methods used by the EPA can only find the PFAS that we already know exist,” Baker says. “That means we have to rely on chemical companies to provide a list of what they manufacture and hope those samples are comprehensive.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_127078"><a href="https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000.jpg" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1703905077" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="127075"><img decoding="async" src="https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-296x300.jpg" alt="The structures of 11 different molecules." width="296" height="300" srcset="https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-296x300.jpg 296w, https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-768x780.jpg 768w, https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000-64x64.jpg 64w, https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/12/Figure3-1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px"></a><figcaption>Researchers mapped out the structures of the 11 new molecules they found in the Cape Fear River. The underlined compounds represent the eight PFAS that were unknown to the EPA.</figcaption></figure>
<p>PFAS are commonly detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, a method that looks at the mass, charge, and polarity of ions — positively or negatively charged molecules. The EPA uses targeted mass spectrometry, which requires matching PFAS found in people or the environment with “standards” — PFAS chemicals created in a lab for testing purposes. It’s like combing through a word search puzzle and only being able to search for a specific set of words. Baker’s lab has developed a non-targeted approach, which allows them to search for any word in a puzzle.</p>
<p>“There are so many known PFAS that standards don’t exist for many of them,” says Kaylie Kirkwood-Donelson, who led the study when she was an NC State University PhD student in Baker’s lab. “Having a non-targeted approach lets us have an open-ended search for known and unknown compounds.”</p>
<p>The non-targeted approach uses <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832852/">ion mobility spectrometry</a> (IMS) to look at how ions move. To do this, ions are placed in gas and an electric field is added. The electric field causes the ions to move differently based on their individual charges. An ion’s size and shape affect the speed at which it moves through the gas, with larger ions moving slower than smaller ones. Information on an ion’s size and shape provides more insight into the structure of the molecule. And in this case, can help researchers determine if a molecule could be considered PFAS.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing the results</strong></p>
<p>As researchers investigate PFAS in the Cape Fear River, the number of known chemicals present in the water continues to grow. More testing is needed to understand the quantities and how toxic they are to people and animals.</p>
<p>“It’s also very important to expand non-targeted testing for PFAS,” says Kirkwood-Donelson, who is now a chemist for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “Even in this study, there were still some molecules that we could not figure out the chemical structures for, so we believe there are more PFAS in the Cape Fear River to be discovered.”</p>
<p>Baker’s lab is working to streamline their non-targeted testing process to make it more efficient. The technology and equipment needed to conduct ion mobility spectrometry is expensive, but more PFAS-focused labs are getting the special tools needed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Baker’s lab will keep testing samples from the Cape Fear River. They are currently comparing some collected before and after environmental regulations were <a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/key-issues/genx-investigation/chemours-consent-order">enacted by the state in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Their work is getting attention from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/27/chemours-forever-chemicals-pfas-north-carolina-water-pollution">news</a> and <a href="https://popsci.com/environment/news-pfas-chemours-north-carolina/">science</a> outlets, and <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article282184358.html">the United Nations has even weighed in</a> on the issue, issuing letters to Chemours, the U.S. government, and other involved parties stating “serious concern regarding human rights and environmental impacts.” Baker hopes this attention will inspire more investigation by scientists and regulation from government agencies.</p>
<p>“If industries create molecules that they don’t tell the public about, and we only test for the molecules they do tell us about, we could be missing things,” says Baker. “We need to use non-targeted testing to have more information on what our communities are being exposed to.”</p>

          <p>We’re Fly.io, and if you’ve been following us awhile you probably just did a double-take. We’re building a new public cloud that runs containerized applications with virtual machine isolation on our own hardware around the world. And we’ve been doing it without any K8s. Until now!</p>
<p>We’ll own it: we’ve been snarky about Kubernetes. We are, at heart, old-school Unix nerds. We’re still scandalized by <code>systemd</code>.</p>

<p>To make matters more complicated, the problems we’re working on <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/">have a lot of overlap with K8s</a>, but <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/#numad">just enough impedance mismatch</a> that it (<a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">or anything that looks like it</a>) is a bad fit for our own platform.</p>

<p>But, come on: you never took us too seriously about K8s, right? K8s is hard for us to use, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great fit for what you’re building. We’ve been clear about that all along, right? Sure we have!</p>

<p>Well, good news, everybody! If K8s is important for your project, and that’s all that’s been holding you back from <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">trying out Fly.io</a>, we’ve spent the past several months building something for you.</p>
<h2 id="fly-io-for-kubernetians"><a href="#fly-io-for-kubernetians" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Fly.io For Kubernetians</h2>
<p>Fly.io works by transmogrifying Docker containers into filesystems for <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">lightweight hypervisors</a>, and running them on servers we rack in dozens of regions around the world.</p>

<p>You can build something like Fly.io with “standard” orchestration tools like K8s. In fact, that’s what we did to start, too. To keep things simple, we used Nomad, and instead of K8s CNIs, we built our own Rust-based TLS-terminating Anycast proxy (and designed a WireGuard/IPv6-based private network system <a href="https://fly.io/blog/bpf-xdp-packet-filters-and-udp/">based on eBPF</a>). But the ideas are the same.</p>

<p>The way we look at it, the signature feature of a “standard” orchestrator is the global scheduler: the global eye in the sky that keeps track of vacancies on servers and optimized placement of new workloads. That’s the problem we ran into. We’re running over 200,000 applications, and we’re doing so on every continent except Antarctica. The speed of light (and a globally distributed network of backhoes) has something to say about keeping a perfectly consistent global picture of hundreds of thousands of applications, and it’s not pleasant.</p>

<p>The other problem we ran into is that our Nomad scheduler kept trying to outsmart us, and, worse, our customers. It turns out that our users have pretty firm ideas of where they’d like their apps to run. If they ask for São Paulo, they want São Paulo, not Rio. But global schedulers have other priorities, like optimally bin-packing resources, and sometimes <code>GIG</code> looks just as good as <code>GRU</code> to them.</p>

<p>To escape the scaling and DX problems we were hitting, we rethought orchestration. Where orchestrators like K8s tend to work through distributed consensus, we keep state local to workers. Each racked server in our fleet is a source of truth about the apps running on it, and provide an API to a market-style “scheduler” that bids on resources in regions. <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/#numad">You can read more about here, if you’re interested.</a> We call this system the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines API.</a></p>

<p>An important detail to grok about how this all works –&nbsp;a reason we haven’t, like, beaten the CAP theorem by doing this – is that Fly Machines API calls can fail. If Nomad or K8s tries to place a workload on some server, only to find out that it’s filled up or thrown a rod, it will go hunt around for some other place to put it, like a good little robot. The Machines API won’t do this. It’ll just fail the request. In fact, it goes out of its way to fail the request quickly, to deliver feedback; if we can’t schedule work in <code>JNB</code> right now, you might want instead to quickly deploy to <code>BOM</code>.</p>
<h2 id="pluggable-orchestration-and-fks"><a href="#pluggable-orchestration-and-fks" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Pluggable Orchestration and FKS</h2>
<p>In a real sense what we’ve done here is extract a chunk of the scheduling problem out of our orchestrator, and handed it off to other components. For most of our users, that component is <a href="https://github.com/superfly/flyctl"><code>flyctl</code>, our intrepid CLI</a>.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/working-with-machines/">Fly Machines is an API</a>, and anything can drive it. A lot of our users want quick answers to requests to schedule apps in specific regions, and <code>flyctl</code> does a fine job of that. But it’s totally reasonable to want something that works more like the good little robots inside of K8s.</p>

<p>You can build your own orchestrator with our API, but if what you’re looking for is literally Kubernetes, we’ve saved you the trouble. It’s called Fly Kubernetes, or FKS for short.</p>

<p>FKS is an implementation of Kubernetes that runs on top of Fly.io. You start it up using <code>flyctl</code>, by running <code>flyctl ext k8s create</code>.</p>

<p>Under the hood, FKS is a straightforward combination of two well-known Kubernetes projects: <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s, the lightweight CNCF-certified K8s distro</a>, and <a href="https://virtual-kubelet.io/">Virtual Kubelet</a>.</p>

<p>Virtual Kubelet is interesting. In K8s-land, a <code>kubelet</code> is a host agent; it’s the thing that runs on every server in your fleet that knows how to run a K8s Pod. Virtual Kubelet isn’t a host agent; it’s a software component that pretends to be a host, registering itself with K8s as if it was one, but then sneakily proxying the Kubelet API elsewhere.</p>

<p>In FKS, “elsewhere” is <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines</a>. All we have to do is satisfy various APIs that virtual kubelet exposes. For example, the API for the lifecycle of a pod:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>type PodLifecycleHandler interface {
    CreatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error
    UpdatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error
    DeletePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error
    GetPod(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.Pod, error)
    GetPodStatus(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.PodStatus, error)
    GetPods(context.Context) ([]*corev1.Pod, error)
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This interface is easy to map to the Fly Machines API. For example:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>CreatePod -&gt; POST /apps/{app_name}/machines
UpdatePod -&gt; POST /apps/{app_name}/machines/{machine_id}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>K3s, meanwhile, is a stripped-down implementation of all of K8s that fits into a single binary. K3s does a bunch of clever things to be as streamlined as it is, but the most notable of them is <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/kine">kine, an API shim that switches <code>etcd</code> out with databases like SQLite</a>. Because of <code>kine</code>, K3s can manage multiple servers, but also gracefully runs on a single server, without distributed state.</p>

<p>So that’s what we do. When you create a cluster, we run K3s and the Virtual Kubelet on a single Fly Machine. We compile a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/">kubeconfig</a>, with which you can talk to your K3s via <code>kubectl</code>. We set the whole thing up to run Pods on individual Fly Machines, so your cluster scales out directly using our platform, but with K8s tooling.</p>

<p>One thing we like about this design is how much of the lifting is already done for us by the underlying platform. If you’re a K8s person, take a second to think of all the different components you’re dealing with: <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>, specifically provisioned nodes, the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/">kube-proxy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel">a CNI </a>binary and configuration and its integration with the host network, containerd, registries. But Fly.io already does most of those things. So this project was mostly chipping away components until we found the bare minumum: CoreDNS, SQLite persistence, and Virtual Kubelet.</p>

<p>We ended up with something significantly simpler than K3s, which is saying something.</p>

<p>Fly Kubernetes has some advantages over plain <code>flyctl</code> and <code>fly.toml</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your deployment is more declarative than it is with the <code>fly.toml</code> file. You declare the exact state of everything down to replica counts, autoscaling rules, volume definitions, and more.
</li><li>When you deploy with Fly Kubernetes, Kubernetes will automatically make your definitions match the state of the world. Machines go down? Kubernetes will whack them back online.
</li></ul>

<p>This is a different way to do orchestration and scheduling on Fly.io. It’s not what everyone is going to want. But if you want it, you really want it, and we’re psyched to give it to you: Fly.io’s platform features, with Kubernetes handling configuration and driving your system to its desired state.</p>

<p>We’ve kept things simple to start with. There are K8s use cases we’re a strong fit for today, and others we’ll get better at in the near future, as K8s users drive the underlying platform (and particularly our proxy) forward.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-all-means"><a href="#what-it-all-means" aria-label="Anchor"></a>What It All Means</h2>
<p>One obvious thing it means is that you’ve got an investment in Kubernetes tooling, you can keep it while running things on top of Fly.io. So that’s pretty neat. Buy our cereal!</p>

<p>But the computer science story is interesting, too. We placed a bet on an idiosyncratic strategy for doing global orchestration. We replaced global consensus, which is how Borg, Kubernetes, and Nomad all work, with a market-based system. That system was faster and, importantly, dumber than the consensus system it replaced.</p>

<p>This had costs! Nomad’s global consensus would do truly heroic amounts of work to make sure Fly Apps got scheduled somewhere, anywhere. Like a good capitalist, Fly Machines will tell you in no uncertain terms how much work it’s willing to do for you (“less than a Nomad”).</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with the answers Fly Machines gives by itself. Because Fly Machines is so simple, and tries so hard to be predictable, we hoped you’d be able to build more sophisticated scheduling and orchestration schemes on top of it. And here you go: Kubernetes scheduling, as a plugin to the platform.</p>

<p>More to come! We’re itching to see just how many different ways this bet might pay off. Or: we’ll perish in flames! Either way, it’ll be fun to watch.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Transactions are a key part to many modern databases, relational and non-relational systems alike.
At a basic level, transactions allow us to treat a series of operations as a single unit. The reason transactions are so important is because they provide guarantees that developers can then use as assumptions when writing code. This means that there are entire set of concerns that you, the developer, don't need to worry about because the DB guarantees certain behaviors. This greatly simplifies the code and drastically improves its reliability.</p>
<p>What are these guarantees? You may already be familiar with the term <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/289.291">ACID</a> - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability. From these sets of guarantees, “isolation” tends to be the most confusing, which is a shame because it is also the one where a deeper understanding directly translates to making better design decisions, and <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/acidrain-sigmod2017.pdf">more secure SaaS</a>.</p>
<p>I'm going to start by explaining what problem transaction isolation is even trying to solve. Then I'll explain the standard isolation levels as they appear in the SQL92 standard and are still mostly used today. Then we'll talk about the problems with SQL92 levels and how Postgres handles isolation and these problems today.
Grab some tea and we'll start.</p>
<h2 id="why-transaction-isolation">Why Transaction Isolation?</h2>
<p>Let's take the classic transactional scenario, moving money from one bank account to another:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span>;
<span>UPDATE</span> accounts <span>SET</span> balance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>100.00</span> <span>WHERE</span> acctnum <span>=</span> <span>12345</span>;
<span>UPDATE</span> accounts <span>SET</span> balance <span>=</span> balance <span>-</span> <span>100.00</span> <span>WHERE</span> acctnum <span>=</span> <span>789</span>;
<span>COMMIT</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>For reasons that should be obvious to anyone with a bank account, you really really want both updates to happen, or neither. This is what atomicity guarantees - that the entire transaction will either succeed or fail as a single unit.</p>
<p>While Atomicity provides important guarantees for a single transaction, Isolation guarantees some into play when you have multiple transactions running concurrently.
Suppose we have a scenario where one user ran the transaction above that moves money between accounts, and while that transaction was processing, but before it was committed, someone else ran <code>select balance from accounts where acctnum=12345</code> . What will this query return? Does it matter if it executed before or after the first update?
This is what isolation levels address - how do concurrent transactions and queries affect each other. You can see why isolation can be more complex than atomicity - there are more ways concurrent transactions can interact. So let's look at how the database community approached isolation.</p>
<h2 id="transaction-isolation-in-sql-92-standard">Transaction Isolation in SQL 92 Standard</h2>
<p>Transaction Isolation levels were officially standardized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92">ANSI SQL 92</a>.
The ANSI committee started by defining the logical ideal of isolation. The ideal isolation as they defined it, is that when you have multiple transactions happening at the same time, the resulting state of the DB is one that is possible to achieve by running this set of transactions not concurrently, but sequentially. It doesn't state or mandate any particular order, just that one must exist. <strong>This level of isolation is called “Serializable” because it guarantees that a serial ordering of the transactions with the same results exists</strong>. It lets you think of the database in terms of atomic transactions happening one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Serializable isolation is considered the gold standard in terms of correctness, but why is serializable isolation so great?</strong> Because this guarantee greatly simplifies the way you reason about your application and the way you will test it. You have invariants that you need your system to maintain, for example, an account balance can't go below zero. You can then check that each transaction individually maintains these invariants and serializable isolation guarantees that you don't need to worry about all the ways these transactions will interleave when they run in parallel. You can take transactions as entire units (as we did with atomicity) and only reason about the state of the system before and after each transaction.</p>
<p>Back in 92, the consensus was that serializability is a great ideal, but not something that can be implemented while still delivering adequate performance (spoiler: they were wrong). Since the ideal was not practical, they settled on suggesting multiple levels of isolation and explaining what can happen in each.
The committee came up with a list of weird results you may encounter if you don't have serializability and called these “anomalies”. Then they defined the isolation levels in terms of “which anomalies can happen at each level”:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Isolation Level</th><th>Dirty Reads</th><th>Non-repeatable Reads</th><th>Phantom Reads</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Read Uncommitted</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Read Committed</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Repeatable Reads</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Serializable</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This is a practical approach and is useful for developers because it lets us say “I'm okay with some anomalies and I want more speed. Let me go with read committed”. So, as a responsible engineer writing an application with transactions, you should understand the anomalies and make informed decisions. Let's do that!</p>
<h2 id="isolation-levels-and-their-anomalies">Isolation levels and their anomalies</h2>
<h3 id="dirty-reads">Dirty Reads</h3>
<p>"The lowest level of isolation is read uncommitted. Read uncommitted allows a whole slew of anomalies, including the dreaded 'dirty read'. Dirty reads means reading data that has not yet been committed. Remember that if a transaction is not committed yet, it may never get committed. The user may change their mind, there may be an error, the DB can crash. Here's a simple example, lets say that we have two users who connected to the same database and each doing their work around the same time. <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/13698/what-is-the-difference-between-a-connection-and-a-session">In database terminology, the state of each connection is called a session</a>, so we are looking at two concurrent sessions:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Session A</th><th>Session B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre><p>INSERT INTO accounts (acctnum, balance)
values (12345, 100);</p></pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where acctnum = 12345;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>ABORT;</pre></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In isolation level “read uncommitted”, if both these sessions execute concurrently, session B will see an account that does not exist with a balance that does not exist. It looked like it existed, but the transaction was rolled back - which means it never officially existed. If this query is part of a report about the total assets under management for the bank, the report will be incorrect and include non-existing assets.</p>
<p>It sounds so obviously terrible that you'd say who in their right minds would ever do dirty reads?</p>
<p>It is mostly useful in write heavy workloads where you want to support very high write throughput and don't care a ton if reports are not 100% accurate. For example for metrics. Because this level breaks the most basic expectations from transactions. many DBs, including Postgres chose not to support this at all.</p>
<h2 id="non-repeatable-reads">Non-repeatable Reads</h2>
<p>Non-repeatable reads means that the same query within one transaction can return different results if a parallel session committed in between.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Session A</th><th>Session B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where acctnum = 12345;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>UPDATE accounts set balance = 500
where acctnum = 12345;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><pre>COMMIT;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where acctnum = 12345;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In isolation level “read committed”, the first query in the transaction in session B will return a different result than the second query, because the transaction in session A committed in between. Both results are “correct” in the sense that they reflect a durable state of the database, but they are different.
You may think “why is this even a problem?”</p>
<p>The main problem with non repeatable reads is a classic anti-pattern known as “write after read”. For example, lets say that we want to give 10% bonus to accounts with balance above 1000, and we use the following code:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Session A</th><th>Session B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre><p>IF (
SELECT balance FROM accounts
WHERE acctnum = 12345 &gt; 1000) THEN</p></pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>UPDATE accounts set balance = 500
where acctnum = 12345;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><pre>COMMIT;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre><p>UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance * 1.1
where acctnum = 12345;</p></pre></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>END IF; COMMIT;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The condition in session B was evaluated to true, and therefore we decided to update the balance in account 12345. But before we had a chance to update the balance, it was updated and committed by session A. The condition is no longer true, but due to the way the code is written, session B will still update the balance. The result will be a state that could not have happened if these sessions ran serially, and account 12345 will have extra 10% bonus in their account that they shouldn't have gotten based on the desired logic.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get around this problem without changing the isolation level. For example, since the problem occurs when data changes between statements, you may choose to do the entire update in a single statement:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>UPDATE</span> accounts
<span>SET</span> balance <span>=</span> balance <span>*</span> <span>1.1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> acctnum <span>=</span> <span>12345</span> <span>AND</span> balance <span>&gt;</span> <span>1000</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will behave atomically, as one would expect in a transaction. However, this is not always the case! Consider the following statement:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>UPDATE</span> accounts
<span>SET</span> balance <span>=</span> balance <span>*</span> <span>1.1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> acctnum <span>in</span> (
    <span>SELECT</span> acctnum <span>from</span> accounts <span>where</span> balance <span>&gt;</span> <span>1000</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here the <code>SELECT</code> will run first and return all rows with balance over 1000. Then the updates run, a row at a time. Suppose that while it is iterating, another session updates account 12345 and commits:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>UPDATE</span> accounts <span>set</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>500</span> <span>where</span> acctnum <span>=</span> <span>12345</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>When the first UPDATE gets to account 12345, it will see the new value, and again - account 12345 will get 10% bonus on an account with a balance of 500, which is not what we wanted.</p>
<p>To prevent changes on rows you just read without going to a higher isolation level, you may need to lock the rows while selecting:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>UPDATE</span> accounts
<span>SET</span> balance <span>=</span> balance <span>*</span> <span>1.1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> acctnum <span>in</span> (
    <span>SELECT</span> acctnum <span>from</span> accounts <span>where</span> balance <span>&gt;</span> <span>1000</span> <span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>SELECT…. FOR UPDATE</code> locks the rows that it selects. In this example, other sessions won't be able to update the balance in any account while the update is in progress, preventing the inconsistency.</p>
<p>A classic pattern for implementing job queues with Postgres uses <code>FOR UPDATE</code> locks to prevent multiple workers from picking the same job:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span>;
	<span>SELECT</span> job <span>FROM</span> job_queue <span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SKIP</span> LOCKED LIMIT <span>1</span>
    <span>-- do stuff for the job</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> job <span>from</span> job_queue
<span>COMMIT</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, you pick a job from the queue and lock it for the duration of the transaction. When you are done performing the job, you delete it from the queue and commit. Other processes can use the same logic to pick jobs, while skipping ones that are already in progress. If you run this code in a loop, each <code>SELECT</code> will see which jobs when the select executes - since <code>read committed</code> isolation level allows you to see changes that were committed before the start of the transaction. But the <code>FOR UPDATE</code> lock will prevent other processes from picking the same job.</p>
<p>Read committed is the default isolation level in postgres and as a result it is the most commonly used one. It is quite acceptable to use it, as long as you understand the “write-after-read” anti-pattern and handle it with well-placed locks.</p>
<h2 id="phantom-reads">Phantom Reads</h2>
<p>With the non-repeatable reads anomaly, you can see changes to rows that existed when your transaction began. In contrast, with the phantom reads anomaly, new rows which did not exist earlier suddenly appear in the middle of a transaction.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Session A</th><th>Session B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>UPDATE accounts set balance = 500
where acctnum = 789;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where balance &gt; 0;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre><p>INSERT INTO accounts (acctnum, balance)
values (12345, 100);</p></pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><pre>COMMIT;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where balance &gt; 0;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In isolation level “repeatable reads” both queries in session B will show the same balance for account 789. Because the <code>update</code> that was done in session A will not be visible to session B. However, the second query will also include account 12345 that was created by session A. This is a new row suddenly appeared in the middle of a transaction. This means that session B will produce an inconsistent report - both because it has two queries that returned different results, and because the second query shows the data that session A inserted, but not the data it updated.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-the-sql92-isolation-levels">Problems with the SQL92 isolation levels</h2>
<p>The SQL92 isolation levels have a lot going for them - they are standard, they are not too challenging to understand, and they give developers practical tools to make good decisions in their design. No wonder they are still in use today. But they are also 30 years old and in some aspects, they show their age.</p>
<h3 id="some-isolation-levels-became-obsolete">Some isolation levels became obsolete</h3>
<p>Lets think about “Repeatable Reads” level for a second. Doesn't it look a bit weird? Transactions see a consistent view of the data that already exists, but new data just sort of shows up there. Why have a separate level just for this situation? The reason it exists is because when transaction isolation levels were introduced to SQL 92 standard, “repeatable reads” was the best level of isolation that many DBs could practically support.</p>
<p>These DBs implemented transaction isolation via shared locks. So when we did <code>select * from accounts</code> for the first time in a transaction, it took a lock on the rows we read. This doesn't block readers, but it blocked writers and delayed all updates until the transaction committed. This guaranteed that the data won't change while my transaction executes and the second time the same query ran, it will get the same values. Of course, you can't lock rows that don't exist yet. Therefore new rows will still show up. Leading to phantom reads.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, 30 years later, databases got better. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">Multi-version concurrency control, MVCC</a>, became widespread and the most common implementation of transaction isolation in relational databases. Including Postgres. MVCC doesn't lock rows. What it does instead is keep multiple versions of each row (hence the name), and use those versions to isolate transactions. We'll discuss Postgres's MVCC implementation and how it impacted the isolation levels in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="new-anomalies-were-discovered">New anomalies were discovered</h3>
<p>OK, so some of the isolation levels don't make sense any more, but at least we have Serializable which is defined as a logical ideal, and not based on implementation concerns. And if we run our DB in Serializable level, anomalies can't happen. Right?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/2023-12-18-transaction-isolation/anomalies-right.png" alt="Meme with dialog. &quot;We use transaction isolation serializable, so anomalies won't happen, right? right?”"></p>
<p>It turned out that defining a perfect state and then defining some states where certain anomalies can happen has this fundamental problem: There may be anomalies you didn't think of. So, only three years after the SQL92 standard came out, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701157.pdf">Microsoft published a paper with a whole list of new anomalies</a>. And because they weren't specified in the standard as something that is prevented in Serializable level, they did in fact happen.</p>
<p>The result of the paper is an extension of the SQL92 isolation levels and anomalies with a lot more anomalies: Lost updates, dirty writes, write skews, read skews, fuzzy reads. And new isolation levels that handle these scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/2023-12-18-transaction-isolation/isolation.png" alt="Table with isolation levels and anomalies from Microsoft's 1995 paper"></p>
<p>This paper, coming out after many relational databases implemented SQL92 isolation levels, lead to the rather confusing state of things that we have to this day. Different databases support different isolation levels, and the same isolation level can mean different things in different databases.</p>
<h2 id="isolation-levels-in-postgres">Isolation levels in Postgres</h2>
<p>Postgres handles the new anomalies without adding additional levels. It documented its behavior using the standard table with few notes:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Isolation Level</th><th>Dirty Reads</th><th>Non-repeatable Reads</th><th>Phantom Reads</th><th>Serialization Anomalies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Read Uncommitted</td><td>Allowed, but not in Postgres</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Read Committed</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td><td>Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Repeatable Reads</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Allowed, but not in Postgres</td><td>Possible</td></tr><tr><td>Serializable</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td><td>Not Possible</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As you can see, Postgres “repeatable reads” is equivalent to the SQL92 “serializable”. In fact, the current “repeatable reads” behavior was the behavior of “serializable” in Postgres 9.1 and earlier. This level is also called Snapshot Isolation (SI) or even “serializable” in other databases.</p>
<p>Postgres's serializable (also known as Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)) guarantees the “ideal” which is the emulation of serial execution of all committed transactions. It should be resilient to all known anomalies.</p>
<h3 id="mvcc-and-isolation-in-postgres">MVCC and isolation in Postgres</h3>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, Postgres, like most modern databases, implements MVCC. In Postgres's MVCC implementation, when a transaction first writes to the database, it is assigned a sequence number called transaction ID or XID. When the transaction modifies rows, the original version of the row is preserved and a new version is added with this sequence number (you can see the current sequence if you run <code>select txid_current();</code>). Each transaction only sees the newest version of each row that is earlier than its transaction ID.</p>
<p>Let's take another look at one of our examples, and consider which transactions are visible to each session (note: I'm making some assumptions and removing some details for simplicity, see references for more detailed explanations):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Session A</th><th>Session B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>UPDATE accounts set balance = 500
where acctnum = 789;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where balance &gt; 0;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre><p>INSERT INTO accounts (acctnum, balance)
values (12345, 100);</p></pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><pre>COMMIT;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre>SELECT * from accounts where balance &gt; 0;</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>When session A and session B start their transactions, they both “take a snapshot” - record the highest and lowest IDs of currently active transactions (you can try this yourself with <code>select * from pg_current_snapshot();</code>). Let's say that they both see 190 as the lowest active XID. This means that transactions with higher XID did not commit yet.</p>
<p>In “repeatable read” and “serializable” isolation levels, both select statements in Session B will only show the data as it was committed when the transaction began - version 190 or lower. If you peeked at the Postgres buffer cache when both transactions started, but before any changes were made, you'd see something like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>t_xmin</th><th>t_xmax</th><th>acctnum</th><th>balance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>125</td><td>0</td><td>789</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><code>t_xmin</code> represents the xid of the transaction that created this row. And this row will be visible to both transactions since <code>t_xmin</code> is 125 and lower than 190.
When Session A performs its first update, it will be assigned its own XID - lets say 201. Both the new version of account 789 and the new account 12345 will have 201 as their new version. So if you peeked in Postgres memory after session A commits, you'd see something like:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>t_xmin</th><th>t_xmax</th><th>acctnum</th><th>balance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>125</td><td>0</td><td>789</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>201</td><td>0</td><td>789</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>201</td><td>0</td><td>12345</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>You can see both the new version of account 789, and the newly inserted account 12345. Since they both have t_xmin 201, which is higher than 190, session B is not going to see either of the new versions. Its snapshot only shows the original version of account 789.</p>
<p>As you can see, using MVCC snapshots for transaction isolations means that the same mechanism that hides new versions of existing rows also hides new rows. Neither will show up in snapshots that were taken before those changes were made.
A transaction with “read committed” isolation level will simply take a new snapshot at the start of each query and when conflicts are encountered - which means that each query will be able to see data from transactions that were already committed. Even if they did not commit at the start of the session.</p>
<p>Postgres' infamous vacuum process is responsible for regular maintenance and cleanup of all the different copies of each row: Getting rid of deleted rows that are no longer used and also performing a process known as “freezing”. Freezing process take rows that were last modified by the oldest transactions and indicating that they should always be visible. This process frees up these transaction IDs for reuse - very important since Postgres transaction IDs are limited to 32bit and you can't use more transaction IDs at the same time. This is why long running transactions and very frequent updates/inserts/deletes can cause issues with the vacuum process.</p>
<h3 id="performance-implication-of-serializable-in-postgres">Performance implication of serializable in Postgres</h3>
<p>In Postgres, “repeatable reads” level and “serializable” levels don't require additional locking since they are based on MVCC (implicit and explicit locks held by transaction in progress still exist, just like in "read committed"). Note that Postgres still has to track the rows that are modified by each transaction, as we'll see below, and it describes this tracking as “locks” but those are non-blocking and used for tracking and conflict detection.</p>
<p>Even without locks, serializable (and even repeatable reads) isolation can have performance implications for highly concurrent workloads. This is because transactions in both repeatable reads and serializable levels are more likely to fail and roll back due to serialization errors.</p>
<p>What are serialization errors? They look something like this: <code>ERROR: could not serialize access due to concurrent update</code> and they happen in a scenario like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Session A</th><th>Session B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td><td><pre>BEGIN;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>UPDATE accounts set balance = 500
where acctnum = 789;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><pre>COMMIT;</pre></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><pre><p>UPDATE accounts set balance = balance+200
where acctnum = 789;</p></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The transaction in session B is attempting to modify a value that session A modified and committed after session B started. Which means that session B is trying to update a value without being able to see its latest version. Which can lead to a state that would never have happened if the transactions ran serially (this anomaly is called a lost write). Therefore Session B will get an error, the transaction will roll back, and Session B can try again.</p>
<p>Worth noting that in this simple scenario, "read committed" will actually work correctly. Session A will lock the row and session B will wait until the lock is released, then see the new value and update it. And as we've seen, "read committed" will require explicit locks for correctness in more complex situations.</p>
<p>In a system with high concurrency and a lot of updates, the serialization errors in "repeatable reads" and "serializable" levels can lead to a lot of retries, which obviously have a negative effect on performance and require dealing with retry logic in the application. This is performance overhead that exists in addition to the extra checks and monitoring that PG needs to run in order to catch these issues, especially in serializable isolation.</p>
<p>The performance tradeoffs between “read committed”, where in order to maintain consistency you rely on locks - both explicit and implicit, and “repeatable reads” where you rely on failing conflicting transactions and retrying, are specific to each application workload. The advantage of “read committed” is that you can reduce the level of consistency in favor of better performance - the disadvantage is that you may reduce the level of consistency unintentionally and lead to incorrect results.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-isolation-testing-in-postgres">Transaction Isolation Testing in Postgres</h3>
<p>As you already noticed, the Postgres developer community takes transaction isolation very seriously and hold themselves to a very high bar. Part of it is their isolation testing suite. It uses a method that IMO should be a lot more common in systems testing.
You can find the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/master/src/test/isolation">code for the test suite in github</a> and the README explains it well.</p>
<p>The core idea is simple and brilliant, like many things in Postgres:
The testers define different scenarios, just like the ones we demonstrated above. Session A does <code>update</code> and then <code>commit</code>, Session B does <code>select</code> and then <code>update</code>. You also specify the result you'd expect after all sessions and all transactions committed. The test framework then takes all the sessions and runs all possible ways these could interleave. One such run can be “A updates, then B selects, then A commits, then B updates”. Another can be “B selects, then A updates, then B updates, then A commits”. It then checks that the key invariants like “account 1234 has a balance of 500” are preserved in all permutations.</p>
<p>While PG isn't single threaded and there are other background processes that run, it is very close to deterministic simulation testing because the scenarios themselves with all the different combinations are serialized.</p>
<p>This kind of test framework means that when concurrency bugs are discovered and fixed, it is very easy to add a test with the exact scenario that uncovered them and to be sure it will be covered in the test.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-things-up">To sum things up</h2>
<p>Hopefully this post didn't leave you more confused than you were at the beginning.
There is a lot of complexity when it comes to the behavior of concurrent transactions in different isolation levels. Serializable guarantees relatively easy reasoning - just imagine that all queries run serially, one after another. But as you saw, the main drawback is the possibility of rollbacks due to conflicts.
Other levels require deeper understanding of all the anomalies. This understanding allows you to know whether the behavior provided in these isolation levels matches the business logic that you are trying to implement. It will also allow you to make good performance tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Since it is still a bit complex to reason about the isolation level, one way to simplify your system is to try and avoid complex multi-step transactions where possible. Normalized data structures help, as do database constraints. Using SQL to try and implement atomic units of business logic in single statements can also help in avoiding complex transactional behaviors. And of course, using techniques such as deterministic simulation testing can help catch and detect cases where concurrent transactions lead to incorrect results.</p>

Sometimes the man looks Latino, other times he looks white; clearly, it is a different man, and a different dog, in most of the images.&nbsp;</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png" width="1212" height="1598" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.02-PM.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png" width="1258" height="1592" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.04.09-PM.png 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png" width="1198" height="1572" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.46-PM.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png" width="1212" height="1602" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.06.55-PM.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png" width="1204" height="1602" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.07-PM.png 1204w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png" width="1210" height="1602" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.07.14-PM.png 1210w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png" width="1512" height="1588" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.08.08-PM.png 1512w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption><p><span>All of these images are AI-generated, and stolen from an artist named Michael Jones.</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/w3sJofxBvHvAutTY7HpJM3-cplRD7pW70YmFrtRaAyZRHxKHjmmksQLwqoKi5QpvJvxCAP83N6CouI8BBIEx6eptOd79LvA-qAsLuY6yMlMHqzCA_KLvZcMWcote_Hhkj-32YVy8hDAHI7YSj6M8SLg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="359"><figcaption><span>One of the images has more than a million likes.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Depending on the image, it is obvious, to me, that the man and the dog are not real. The dog often looks weirdly polygonal, or like some wood carving filter has been applied to an image of a real dog. Sometimes the dog’s ear has obvious artifacts associated with AI-generated images. Other times, it’s the man who looks fake. Variations of this picture are being posted all over Facebook by a series of gigantic meme pages with names like “Go Story,” “Amazing World,” “Did you know?” “Follow me,” “Avokaddo,” and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Universally, the comment sections of these pages feature hundreds of people who have no idea that these are AI-generated and are truly inspired by the dog carving. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1035803147752348&amp;set=pb.100039680180374.-2207520000&amp;type=3" rel="noreferrer">A version of this image posted on Dogs 4 life has 1 million likes</a>, 39,000 comments, and 17,000 shares. The Dogs 4 life account has spammed links to buy cheap, dog-branded stuff to the top of the comments section.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, this is a tale as old as time: people lie and steal content online in exchange for likes, influence and money all the time. But the spread of this type of content on Facebook over the last several months has shown that the once-prophesized future where cheap, AI-generated trash content floods out the hard work of real humans is already here, and is already taking over Facebook. It also shows Facebook is doing essentially nothing to help its users decipher real content from AI-generated content masquerading as real content, and that huge masses of Facebook users are completely unprepared for our AI-generated future.&nbsp;</p><p>The dog and the carving were real, at one point. The real German Shepherd carving was made by a UK-based <a href="https://www.michaeljonescs.com/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">professional chainsaw sculptor</a> named Michael Jones, who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1011303903567784&amp;set=pb.100040645523359.-2207520000"><u>detailed his work</u></a> in a series of videos and photos posted over the course of the summer. Jones’ work has since been stolen and turned into endless variations. Those images are then turned into endless inspiration bait by spammy Facebook pages that are presumably looking to monetize the stolen work of artists like Jones.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/70hfTrA3I1ZBGEmSzOB7lStDrWzj86fgC564mNmbkMInm0zCFdZmG3MDJ85HvoSNFJimt_W3adI2rLUDnDLcT7DPo-cCuD09WOwbBi4PzpEsm602vHWm0MlLN2BzcV7-e84CvoU-VuEf36QboOfskLo" alt="" loading="lazy" width="624" height="345"><figcaption><span>Jones' real carving</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1056" height="1344" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.12.29-PM.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Another of Jones' real carvings</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1326" height="1344" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-16-at-7.13.34-PM.png 1326w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Another of Jones' real carvings</span></figcaption></figure><p>“This is something that is a huge issue for us and other carvers all over the world who are sadly missing out on the rightful credit exposure to their work,” Jones told me, “as well as setting unrealistic expectations when it comes to creating chainsaw carving art or any art for that matter!”</p><p>The strategy relies on “image-to-image” generative AI, which takes an input image and generates a new one based on that input. “Every time you generate an image, you get something completely different because it’s randomly seeded, and [the model] is looking for semantic consistency,” Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in AI disinformation and deepfakes, told me.

These are not far-fetched ideas, that's literally the extreme side where this is headed. My point is these people are not ready for the world that is coming.”</p><p>Um, isn’t that AI? grew out of Facebook groups dedicated to Midjourney and other AI image generators. Penny and others in that group, including Um, isn’t that AI? founder Molly Huxley began to notice that images originally posted as AI-generated art were being posted elsewhere on Facebook as though they were real images.</p><p>“People would take the AI images and post them elsewhere as if they were real, and commenters thought they were real,” Penny told me. “Molly started the group and it was originally people from the AI art community who thought it was funny and weird that people were believing this shit, and it grew from there.”&nbsp;</p><p>The group has noticed that many of the “remixes” are posted by the same set of 10 or 15 engagement bait Facebook pages. They often repost the same images or versions of the same images and themes over and over again. There’s “Bread House Man,” “Victoria’s Art,” “Jesus in a Nut Tree, “Sand Castle Kid,” and dozens of other variations of images that get posted over and over again. Penny said his own involvement in the group started as a curiosity but eventually he became alarmed when his family members began commenting on AI fakes on Facebook as though they were real.</p><p>“My own dad shared one of these things, and I thought ‘You cannot think this is real,’” Penny said. “Then I saw my aunts and my dad’s friends share it—it gave me this whole existential crisis.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In Search of Victoria and The Bread House Man&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-6.18.12-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1222" height="1228" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-6.18.12-PM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-6.18.12-PM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-6.18.12-PM.png 1222w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The MVP of Um, isn’t That AI? is Catherine Hall, a woman from New Zealand who has been systematically trying to trace the different versions of AI-generated duplicates all over Facebook, and has painstakingly searched for the original works that they were based off of.&nbsp;</p><p>I was amazed by Hall’s Google Sheets spreadsheets that trace every version of an image she can find. Originally, I saw her spreadsheet for “Victoria’s Art,” an image in which Victoria stands on a dirt path, proudly holding a self-portrait she painted. “I am a young artist Victoria. Please appreciate :).” Hall has identified 116 different variations of Victoria. In some she’s young, in others she’s a grandma. Sometimes, Victoria is Asian, Black, or mixed.

I discovered the majority of them were created from an actual artist’s original work, rather than a text based prompt so I became interested in finding the originals. It is frustrating me that so many mindless ‘wows!’ get spewed out over a fake copy of a real artist’s work,” Hall said. “Basically I will choose an image to research. Then hit up my list of fb pages and search through their back catalog to find all the renditions, I paste the information into a Google Sheet as I go then I can sort by date to see how the image has developed and morphed. Often they will have used a stolen original back at the start of things which can be searched back to find the source.

No one operating any of the Facebook pages responded to messages for comment. Hall’s theory, a common one in the Um, isn’t That AI? Group is that some of these larger groups will sell their accounts once they’ve amassed large numbers of followers, pivot to political disinformation, or try to monetize what they’re doing. A few of them have begun posting links to sites outside of Facebook, while others add links to online stores in the comment sections of their posts once an image has gone viral. The fact that all of these pages are stealing the work of artists upsets Hall: “Often I feel like I am just shouting my observations into a raging storm and no one hears,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="artificial-realities"><strong>ARTIFICIAL REALITIES</strong></h3><p>Of all of the awful things <a href="https://www.404media.co/a16z-funded-ai-platform-generated-images-that-could-be-categorized-as-child-pornography-leaked-documents-show/"><u>we’ve seen artificial intelligence used for</u></a>, engagement baiting with stolen content on Facebook is relatively tame. And yet, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of wonder and dread while reporting this story. Every time I started researching the origins of a new stolen image, I would click through dozens and dozens of stolen versions of it.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no polite way to say this, but the comments sections of each of these images are filled with unaware people posting inane encouragement about artwork stolen by robots, a completely constructed reality where thousands of talented AI woodcarvers constantly turn pixels into fucked up German Shepherds for their likes and faves. I tried to determine if the commenters, too, were bots. The vast majority of them clearly are not. Most commenters I looked into are people who have been judiciously posting family photos, political arguments, and status updates on Facebook for decades.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.17.48-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="918" height="1424" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.17.48-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-7.17.48-AM.png 918w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Both Penny and Farid made the same observation I did. Farid said that, currently, “when I look at the harms being perpetrated from generative AI from nonconsensual imagery, child sexual abuse, fraud, and disinformation, this isn’t even on the bottom of the list. Somebody’s posting a photo, real people like it—it’s Facebook, who cares, right?”&nbsp;</p><p>But he added that this AI dreck isn’t <em>good </em>and that in the long term we could see some bad consequences grow out of the rapid spamming of AI-generated crap. Farid published a study on “nepotistic” AI, where generative AI tools are trained on <em>other</em> AI-generated outputs, creating highly-distorted images: “Once poisoned, the models struggle to fully heal even after retraining on only real images,” his study found. “The slightly less kind word is inbreeding, which we didn’t feel we could use in a scientific paper,” Farid said.&nbsp;</p><p>The other big problem is that, while more digitally literate people can tell that these are AI-generated images <em>now</em>, the technology is advancing so quickly that the typical artifacting and deformities seen in AI-generated images today could be gone tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>“The images [being generated] are more and more photorealistic,” Farid said. “So we really are entering this era where you can just type and get a hyper photorealistic image. And if it's not true today will eventually be true that it will be devoid of obvious visual artifacts that the average person looking at would be able to discriminate.”</p><p>“There’s something to be said for the fact that our ability to discriminate reality from fiction is important for a functioning society and democracy,” he added. “If every time you see a photo, you think it’s real because it’s a photo, that has consequences beyond the silliness we’re seeing here.”</p><p>Penny said he thinks that studying these images might eventually give him the opposite problem: “20 years from now, I don’t know what it’s going to be like then, but I’m not going to believe a single thing anyone shows me on the internet ever again.”</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/">gccrs</a> project is an ambitious
effort started in 2014 to implement a Rust compiler within The GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC).  Even though the task is far from complete, progress has
been made since LWN's <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/909887/">previous coverage</a>,
according to reports from the project.  Meanwhile, another hybrid and more
mature approach to GCC Rust code generation is available in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc"><tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt></a>.

</p><p>
In 2022, the goal of gccrs was to be included in the GCC 13 release,
but <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/04/24/gccrs-and-gcc13-release.html">this expectation has not been met</a>.
The team is currently aiming for inclusion in GCC&nbsp;14 (likely to be
released by mid-2024), judging from its
<a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/12/05/2023-11-monthly-report.html">November
2023 monthly report</a>.

</p><p>
On October 13, Arthur Cohen gave a talk titled "The road to compiling the
standard library with gccrs" (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgqGahDl-sY">video</a> is available)
at EuroRust 2023.  In his talk, Cohen gave a little bit of general
background on gccrs but mainly focused on what work has recently gone into
compiling the Rust standard library, and why gccrs cannot do it yet.

</p><p>
Gccrs targets a specific Rust version, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/31/Rust-1.49.0.html">1.49,
released at the end of 2020</a>, rather than trying to keep up with the
rapidly developing Rust language.  This version was chosen because it is
the latest version predating support for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/generics.html#const-generics">const
generics</a>, which were introduced in 1.50.  However, Cohen expressed
regret in his talk that the project has not been able to ignore const
generics after all, because they are in use in the standard library, even in
1.49.  They were "stabilized" for general availability in 1.50, but there
is internal standard library usage in earlier versions as well.  Const
generics have since been fully implemented, however, and this issue is no
longer a hindrance.

</p><p>
A lot of care is being put into gccrs not becoming a "superset" of Rust, as
Cohen put it.  The project wants to make sure that it does not create a
special "GNU Rust" language, but is trying instead to replicate the output of
rustc — bugs, quirks, and all.  Both the Rust and GCC test suites
are being used to accomplish this.

</p><p>
The Rust standard library consists of a number of "crates", which is what
software packages are called in Rust lingo.  Cohen explained that gccrs is
working on supporting compilation of the two most important ones: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/"><tt>core</tt></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/"><tt>alloc</tt></a>.  The
<tt>core</tt> crate is the foundation of the standard library, implementing
features such as primitive types and macros; <tt>alloc</tt> deals with
heap-memory allocation and various container types.

</p><p>
Currently gccrs is not able to compile these crates because of various
shortcomings, such as incorrect behavior in macro-name resolution and
incomplete support for decorator macros.  The lack of a borrow checker
(discussed more below), while not blocking compilation, means that the
compiler cannot properly check the safety of the code.  An additional
hurdle is formed by missing compiler intrinsics in GCC. Rustc uses some
intrinsics provided by LLVM that are not supported by GCC, which means the
gccrs team needs to spend time implementing them in GCC.

</p><p>
Another talk (<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2023talks?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=GCC+Rust+Update.pdf">slides
available</a>) was given by Pierre-Emmanuel Patry at the GNU Tools Cauldron
in September 2023.  He mainly focused on progress toward inclusion in GCC
14 as well as macros, which seem to be an interrelated issue because the
approach to implement procedural macros necessitates changes to the GCC
build system.  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">Procedural
macros</a> are function-like macros that emit token streams rather than
plain source code text like C or C++ macros.  They are implemented in a
built-in crate called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/"><tt>proc_macro</tt></a>.  Such
macros are notoriously tricky to implement but also powerful; they form the
core of features such as <tt>#[attribute]</tt> and <tt>#[derive()]</tt>
decorators, and can be used to create compile-time evaluated,
domain-specific languages.

</p><p>
In the GNU Cauldron talk, Patry also mentioned that gccrs had more than 800
commits waiting to be upstreamed to GCC.

</p><h4>Taking advantage of the GCC ecosystem</h4>

<p>
Cohen's EuroRust talk highlighted that one of the major reasons gccrs is
being developed is to be able to take advantage of GCC's security plugins.
There is a wide range of existing GCC plugins that can aid in debugging,
static analysis, or hardening; these work on the GCC intermediate
representation.  Gccrs intends to support workflows where developers could
reuse these plugins with Rust code.  As an example, Cohen mentioned that "C
programmers have been forgetting to close their file descriptors for 40
years, [so] there are a lot of plugins to catch that".  Gccrs intends to
enable Rust programmers to use existing GCC plugins and static analyzers to
catch bugs in <tt>unsafe</tt> code.

</p><p>
Cohen listed a few things that gccrs is already useful for.
According to him, the Sega Dreamcast homebrew community uses gccrs to
create new games for the Dreamcast gaming console, and GCC
plugins can already be used to perform static analysis on unsafe Rust code.
The Dreamcast community's interest stems from the fact that rustc's LLVM
backend does not support the Hitachi SH-4 architecture of the console,
whereas GCC does; even in its incomplete state, gccrs is helpful for this
embedded use case.


</p><p>
Additionally, he mentioned that the gccrs effort has revealed some
unspecified language features, such as <tt>Deref</tt> and macro name
resolution; in response, the project has been able to contribute additions
to the Rust specification.  Currently Rust does not have a formal
specification, but work is underway to create one, as proposed in <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3355-rust-spec.html">RFC 3355</a>.
"The gccrs people want to be a part" of that effort, Cohen
said.

</p><p>
One more reason for gccrs to exist is <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust for Linux</a>, the initiative to
add Rust support to the Linux kernel.  Cohen said the
Linux kernel is a key motivator for the project because there are a lot of
kernel people who would prefer the kernel to be compiled only by the GNU
toolchain.

</p><h4>Things under development</h4>

<p>
Gccrs is still missing a lot of core functionality.  Cohen listed several
important features, such as <tt>async</tt>/<tt>await</tt>, LLVM intrinsics
that are absent in GCC, and the <tt>format_args!()</tt> macro used by
output macros such as <tt>println!()</tt>.  The borrow checker, which is a
compiler subsystem that enforces the reference rules of the language, is a
key Rust feature that gccrs will need to provide.  Cohen briefly mentioned
that the likely solution is a separate borrow-checker project called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius">Polonius</a>, and said Gccrs
will most likely have it integrated a few months down the line.
Contributor Jakub Dupak has <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/11/06/2023-10-monthly-report.html">made
progress</a> on this in the past few months.

</p><p>
Polonius is a library that implements a borrow checker that is semantically
equivalent to the (not quite flawlessly implemented) checker in rustc today,
by approaching the computation of reference lifetimes with <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/">a
radically different algorithm</a>.  Polonius aims to one day resolve the
shortcomings and corner cases of rustc's current borrow checker.  Once it
has matured, rustc itself will likely also adopt it in the future.

</p><p>
According to the gccrs monthly report for November 2023, work has begun on
the <tt>format_args!()</tt> macro.  This helper macro is responsible for
constructing parameters for other string-formatting macros.  It involves
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html"><tt>Display</tt></a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html"><tt>Debug</tt></a>
traits, and is a necessity for preparing arguments that are later passed to
other macros such as <tt>format!()</tt> and <tt>println!()</tt>.  Without
<tt>format_args!()</tt>, a Rust program cannot create formatted output;
this feature is thus necessary before gccrs can compile a "Hello, World"
program.

</p><p>
For a deep dive on <tt>format_args!()</tt>, see Mara Bos's recent <a href="https://blog.m-ou.se/format-args/">blog post</a>.

</p><h4><tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt></h4>

<p>
There is another GCC-based Rust project, called <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt>,
that is more mature and more limited in scope compared to gccrs.  It is not
a full implementation of a Rust compiler from the ground up; instead, it
uses the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/JIT">libgccjit</a> library to
hook into an API of the LLVM backend used by rustc.  This approach performs
much of the compilation with rustc and turns to GCC at a later stage.
Despite the "JIT" (just in time) in the name of the library,
<tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt> is intended for ahead-of-time compilation.  Its
stated primary goal is to enable Rust code generation on platforms
unsupported by LLVM.

</p><p>
<a href="https://blog.antoyo.xyz/rustc_codegen_gcc-progress-report-26">As
of October 2023</a>, <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt> can now compile Rust for
Linux without any additional patches.  Over the past year, the project
seems to have made good progress on many fronts; for example, it has added
support for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) operations and
link-time optimization, both of which were earlier identified as causes for
test failures.  Cohen deferred to <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt> at several
points in his EuroRust talk, encouraging attendees to use it instead of
gccrs for now.  It is, in fact, already upstreamed into the Rust language
repository.

</p><h4>Rust for Linux</h4>

<p>
Currently, the Rust for Linux project provides documentation for using
either <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/rust/quick-start.html">rustc</a> or
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/rustc_codegen_gcc"><tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt></a>
to build Rust code for the kernel.  The kernel also contains <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/process/changes.html">documentation</a> for
the minimal supported versions of various build tools, including compilers.
For rustc, the version is considered an exact match, rather than a minimum.
The currently stated supported rustc version is 1.73.0 (released in October
2023), much more recent than the 1.49 targeted by gccrs.  Rust for Linux
support is also a stated goal for gccrs, but because of this significant
discrepancy, it seems to be quite far off.

</p><p>
Gccrs has progressed nicely in the year since we last looked at it: the
repository has well over 3,000 commits since January&nbsp;1, 2023.
However, it is not yet in a usable state for almost any practical purpose,
since as a complete implementation from the ground up, gccrs is much more
ambitious in scope than <tt>rustc_codegen_gcc</tt>.  The latter is already
merged to the upstream Rust repository and sees real-world use with Rust
for Linux.  We are not yet in a world with multiple implementations of a
compiler for the Rust language, but it is getting closer.<br clear="all"></p><table>

The only valid reason for using a C pointer is in auto-generated code from translating C code.</p><p>When importing C header files, it is ambiguous whether pointers should be translated as single-item pointers (*T) or many-item pointers ([*]T). C pointers are a compromise so that Zig code can utilize translated header files directly.</p><p><a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/#C-Pointers">https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/#C-Pointers</a></p></blockquote><p>I didn’t understand the documentation, as it seemed to be warning against using C pointers rather than explaining what they are.</p><p>More <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>‘ing led me to this explanation on reddit, which I found more accessible:</p><blockquote><p><code>[*c]T</code> is just a C pointer to type T, it says that it doesn’t know whether there are multiple elements in that pointer or not. There could be, there could not be. We also don’t know the length of it (it’s not a slice which has pointer+length, it’s just a pointer). And if there are multiple elements, we don’t know if it is say null-terminated or not.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/11uqo84/comment/jcplxiz/">-/u/slimsag on reddit</a></p></blockquote><p>Okay, that makes more sense.</p><p>In C, a pointer is just a memory address and a data type. A C type of <code>char*</code> could point to a single character like <code>'A'</code>, or it could point to the first character in a sequence like <code>"ABCD"</code>.</p><p>In Zig, a pointer to an array is a different type than a pointer to a single element. When Zig has to infer a data type from C code, Zig can’t tell whether the C code is referring to a single element or an array, so the C pointer type (<code>[*c]T</code>) is Zig’s way of saying, “I don’t know. I got this from C.”</p><p>Through trial and error, I figured out that Zig wanted me to get a pointer to <code>input</code> by referencing <code>input.ptr</code> rather than using the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code>.</p><p>This Zig snippet shows the difference between the <code>.ptr</code> and <code>&amp;</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="zig"><span><span><span>const</span><span> </span>input<span> </span>=<span> </span><span>"hello, world!"</span>;<span>

      Earlier this summer the United Steelworkers union vowed to only support a proposed offer by another unionized American steel company, Cleveland Cliffs, to buy US Steel, in a cash and stock deal then valued at $32.53 a share, or 40% less than Nippon’s all cash offer. The US Steel board <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/investing/us-steel-cleveland-cliffs/index.html">rejected that offer</a> and started considering other bids.

      “To say we’re disappointed in the announced deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon is an understatement, as it demonstrates the same greedy, shortsighted attitude that has guided U.S. Steel for far too long,” said USW President David McCall. “We remained open throughout this process to working with U.S. Steel to keep this iconic American company domestically owned and operated, but instead it chose to push aside the concerns of its dedicated workforce and sell to a foreign-owned company.”

      US Steel was created in 1901 through a merger when a group led by J.P. Morgan and Charles Schwab, two of the world’s leading financiers of the time, bought the steel company owned by Andrew Carnegie and combined it with their holdings in its rival Federal Steel company.

      US Steel was so dominant, in fact, that its competitive prowess helped lead to the creation of the nation’s antitrust laws, passed in an attempt to keep the company’s strategic and financial might, and that of the Standard Oil’s, in check.

In “The Godfather Part II,” mobster Hyman Roth, explaining the growing reach of the mob, tells Michael Corleone, “Michael, we’re bigger than US Steel.” When the Yankees were winning an unprecedented five straight World Series, those baseball fans who hated the team would say that “cheering for the Yankees is like cheering for US Steel.”

      “That company peaked out in 1916,” longtime steel industry analyst Charles Bradford told CNN in August when the bidding started for US Steel. “It’s been downhill ever sense. Peak output was in the 1970s. It’s done nothing for decades.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqay6v7a00023b6hdcsyndsz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      According to a story in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on its 100th anniversary in 2001, the company’s peak employment of 340,000 came in 1943, during World War II, when it played a critical role in the Allied forces’ war efforts.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqayerq7000b3b6h3nicgpn1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The same article said peak steel output came in 1953, when the company&nbsp;produced 35.8 million tons of steel while steelmakers in Europe and Japan were still struggling to recover from the war. Last year, US Steel shipped only 11.2 million tons of steel from its US operations and had just under 15,000 US employees.

      From its peak, the company began to fall behind upstart competitors — both foreign and domestic. First, it fell behind competitors in Japan and Germany, which were forced to rebuild from scratch after World War II and used new technologies that required far less labor and energy.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clqay6w5e00053b6hinpahdb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">

      US Steel and other steelmakers eventually followed those foreign competitors to upgrade factories and equipment, but they still largely used the older methods to make steel by melting raw materials such as iron ore in giant blast furnaces.

      Those “integrated” steelmakers soon lagged behind&nbsp;so-called “mini-mills,” nonunion competitors that use more efficient electric arc furnaces to&nbsp;turn old steel scrap from discarded cars and other products into new steel products.

      Nucor is also the largest steelmaker in America by output, making an estimated 20.6 million metric tons of steel per year, ranking 16th largest in the world. That compares to 14.49 million metric tons from US Steel, including its operations in Europe, which rank 27th in the world for 2022, according to the World Steel Association.

      Bradford said all along the way, US Steel and other US integrated steelmaking rivals with storied names such as Bethlehem Steel, Inland Steel and LTV Steel underestimated the competitive challenge that they faced from overseas and mini-mills at home. In more recent years, steelmakers from China, India and Korea have expanded capacity far beyond US Steel. Those three other integrated steelmakers have already been swallowed up in earlier mergers and are today part of US Steel rival Cleveland Cliffs.

      By 1991, after 90 years in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, US Steel&nbsp;was bounced out of that benchmark of the nation’s 30 most important companies. At the same time, Walt Disney and JPMorgan &amp; Co., a Wall Street firm ironically named for US Steel’s founder, joined the index. It was a further sign that the nation’s economy was now focused more on information and finance, not manufacturing.

<p>In a statement to <em>9to5Mac</em>, Apple has announced that it will soon halt sales of its flagship Apple Watch models in the United States.</p>



<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will no longer be available to purchase from Apple starting later this week.</p>



<p>The move comes <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/26/itc-order-ban-apple-watch-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following an ITC ruling</a> as part of a long-running patent dispute between Apple and medical technology company Masimo around the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor technology.</p>



<p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 will no longer be available to order from Apple’s website in the U.S. after 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, December 21. In-store inventory will no longer be available from Apple retail locations after December 24.</p>



<p>The International Trade Commission <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/26/itc-order-ban-apple-watch-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its ruling in October, upholding a judge’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/11/apple-watch-patent-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decision from January</a>. This sent the case to the Biden administration for a 60-day Presidential Review Period.</p>



<p>During this process, President Biden could veto the ruling, although this has not yet occurred. The Presidential Review Period expires on December 25, and Apple is making this announcement today to “preemptively” take steps to comply with the ITC’s decision.</p>



<p>Apple says that the ITC’s ban only impacts sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 because those devices offer blood oxygen monitoring capabilities. The lower-end <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbNfum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Watch SE</a>, which lacks this sensor, is unaffected and will remain available for sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ITC’s decision only prohibits Apple from selling the affected Apple models. For now, this means the devices will remain <a href="https://amzn.to/3TvKVZj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available for purchase</a> from other outlets including <a href="https://amzn.to/4ajZBB3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon and Best Buy</a>. Our friends over at <em>9to5Toys</em> also have details on some <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2023/12/18/apple-watch-series-9-ban-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-the-while-can Apple Watch deals</a>. </p>



<p>However, the order does block all Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 imports to the United States after December 25. At this point, Apple would also be prohibited from selling those devices to resellers, as well. So if the ruling is upheld, it could subsequently impact Apple Watch availability for other retailers as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, any Apple Watch with a blood oxygen sensor that has already been sold is unaffected by today’s news. The blood oxygen sensor first debuted with the Apple Watch Series 6 in 2020. Existing Apple Watch models with blood oxygen monitoring will continue to function without change. The ITC ban only applies to new sales of affected Apple Watch models.</p>



<p>The ITC order also makes an exception for the service, repair, or warranty period of units sold prior to December 25. </p>



<p>Here is Apple’s full statement to <em>9to5Mac</em>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A Presidential Review Period is in progress regarding an order from the U.S. International Trade Commission on a technical intellectual property dispute pertaining to Apple Watch devices containing the Blood Oxygen feature. While the review period will not end until December 25, Apple is preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand. This includes pausing sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from Apple.com starting December 21, and from Apple retail locations after December 24.</p>



<p>Apple’s teams work tirelessly to create products and services that empower users with industry-leading health, wellness, and safety features. Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.</p>



<p>Should the order stand, Apple will continue to take all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Masimo, a medical technology company, has been embroiled in multiple legal disputes with Apple for years. The disagreements center around accusations from Masimo that Apple Watch blood oxygen sensor technology infringes on several Masimo patents.</p>



<p>There are two parts to this situation. First, there’s a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/09/apple-masimo-apple-watch-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit filed by Masimo</a> against Apple in the US District Court in the Central District of California in early 2020.</p>



<p>Second, there’s a case filed by Masimo with the International Trade Commission <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/30/apple-watch-series-6-import-ban-masimo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in June 2021</a>.</p>



<p>Masimo started its campaign with the ITC because it was frustrated by the slow pace of the initial district court case. The ITC complaint is what is pressuring Apple to preemptively halt Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 sales in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-itc-case-and-apple-watch-ban"><strong>The ITC case and Apple Watch ban</strong></h2>



<p>In its initial filing with the ITC, Masimo accused Apple of 103 instances of patent infringement across five different patents. However, the ITC found that Apple infringed on only two patents, covering five different instances of patent infringements –&nbsp;each related to the Apple Watch’s pulse oximeter feature. </p>



<p>The ITC handed down <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/26/itc-order-ban-apple-watch-us/">this order in October</a>, starting the clock on a 60-day Presidential Review Period, now set to expire on December 25. The Biden administration can step in and veto the ITC ban, but so far the White House has chosen not to act. </p>



<p>Apple emphasizes that today’s announcement and upcoming suspension of Apple Watch sales is the company “preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand.”</p>



<p>It is rare for a president to veto a decision from the ITC, although Apple is no stranger to the process. The last time such a veto occurred was in 2013 when <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2013/08/03/president-obama-vetos-apple-iphone-4-3g-ipad-2-product-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Obama vetoed</a> a ban on the iPhone as part of Apple’s extended legal dispute with Samsung. Prior to that, the previous presidential veto involved Samsung when the Reagan administration vetoed an ITC ban on all products using Samsung semiconductor memory chip imports in 1987.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-impact-of-an-apple-watch-ban">The impact of an Apple Watch ban</h2>



<p>Barring a last-minute veto, why might the Apple Watch ban occur despite the iPhone ban being avoided? Experts <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/dear-santa-will-us-trade-ban-on-apple-watch-ruin-christmas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have argued</a> that the Apple Watch doesn’t have the same economic impact as the iPhone, making a Biden veto of the ITC ruling unlikely.</p>

<p>Apple sees things differently, arguing that the ITC’s finding was unfounded and should be reversed. The company has outlined multiple reasons why it believes the Biden administration should step in and veto the ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple believes that the ITC’s decision will harm Apple suppliers as well as consumers, potentially leading to a greater impact on the overall economy.</p>



<p>Apple’s wearables business generated $13.48 billion in revenue during the Q1 2023 holiday quarter. This number underscores the impact of the Apple Watch for both Apple and its broader supply chain economy. </p>



<p>The company also emphasizes the Apple Watch’s life-saving ability to help users discover potential issues with their health. In its lobbying with the United States Trade Representation, Apple has enlisted the American Heart Association and other leading health organizations and physicians to tout the health benefits of the Apple Watch hardware.</p>



<p>Another factor Apple believes the ITC should consider is the impact this could have on ongoing and future clinical health studies that rely on the Apple Watch. </p>



<p>Apple says Masimo has attempted to use this litigation against Apple as a way to boost the launch of its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/24/apple-watch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own smartwatch product</a>. Apple filed two patent infringement lawsuits against Masimo in October 2022, accusing the company of copying patented features of the Apple Watch.</p>



<p>If the ITC decision is upheld, Apple says that Masimo would see no real benefit itself because the Masimo smartwatch is not a substitute for the Apple Watch. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-next"><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2>



<p>As of right now, there is no timeline on how long the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 will be unavailable for purchase. The Biden administration could still step in and veto the ITC exclusion. If the ITC’s decision is upheld, there are a few ways forward. </p>



<p>Apple can appeal the ITC’s final decision with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit once the Presidential Review Period has expired. As such, the company tells <em>9to5Mac</em> that it plans to file an appeal on December 26. Appealing the decision, however, will not delay the ban on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 sales and imports.</p>



<p>The two Masimo patents that the ITC says Apple Watch infringes aren’t set to expire until August 2028.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1047" src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="apple watch blood oxygen study" srcset="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg 2000w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=155,81 155w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=655,343 655w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=1024,536 1024w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=350,183 350w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=140,73 140w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=1600,838 1600w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/apple-watch-blood-oxygen.jpg?resize=150,79 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></figure>



<p>There are other paths Apple can pursue, including a potential settlement and licensing agreement with Masimo. It can also attempt to design around those two Masimo patents, such as with firmware changes to the Apple Watch software.</p>



<p>But at this point, Apple has not shared any future plans. The company says additional information will be available at the conclusion of the Presidential Review Period on December 25.</p>



<p>Ultimately, there are still a lot of unknowns about what happens next considering this unprecedented development. Apple says that it will “continue to take all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>In a previous statement, Masimo said that the ITC’s ban “sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-separate-district-court-case"><strong>A separate district court case</strong></h2>



<p>Separately, Masimo filed a lawsuit <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/09/apple-masimo-apple-watch-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against Apple in early 2020</a>, accusing Apple of patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Apple challenged the patents in that case with the United States Patent Office, asking the agency to re-review the patents that were initially granted to Masimo.</p>




	<p>The Patent Trial and Appeal Board reviewed 17 different Masimo patents as part of this process and found that 15 of them were invalid. Masimo is appealing those decisions.</p>



<p>As for Masimo’s accusations of trade secret misappropriation, that case went to trial back in May. The judge rejected five out of 10 of Masimo’s claims, saying there was not enough evidence to send those claims to the jury.</p>



<p>The remaining claims were put in front of the jury, where six of the seven jurors found in favor of Apple. The remaining juror disagreed, and the jury eventually concluded that it would not be possible to reach a unanimous verdict. The judge in the case declared a mistrial, and it will be retried at a yet-to-be-determined date.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why use a "slow interpreter" versus a "fast JIT"?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In many situations, speed is not the main concern. Runtime executable size, memory usage, startup latency can be improved with the interpreter approach. Portability and security are much easier to achieve and maintain. Additionally, development impedance is much lower. A simple library like Wasm3 is easy to compile and integrate into an existing project. (Wasm3 builds in a just few seconds). Finally, on some platforms (i.e. iOS and WebAssembly itself) you can't generate executable code pages in runtime, so JIT is unavailable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why would you want to run WASM on embedded devices?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Wasm3 started as a research project and remains so by any means. Evaluating the engine in different environments is part of the research. Given that we have <code>Lua</code>, <code>JS</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Lisp</code>, <code>...</code> running on MCUs, <code>WebAssembly</code> is a promising alternative. It provides toolchain decoupling as well as a completely sandboxed, well-defined, predictable environment. Among practical use cases we can list <code>edge computing</code>, <code>scripting</code>, <code>plugin systems</code>, running <code>IoT rules</code>, <code>smart contracts</code>, etc.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><time datetime="2023-12-08T17:00:00.000Z">Last updated: 5pm on Friday, 8 December 2023.</time></p><div>
	<p>We're experiencing a major technology outage following a cyber-attack affecting our website, online systems and services, and some onsite services. However, our buildings are still open as usual. We anticipate restoring more services in the next few weeks, but disruption to certain services is now expected to persist for several months.</p>

	<p>Last week the attackers released some of our data onto the dark web including some personal user information. We've contacted our users to alert them to this incident and to offer advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on how to protect themselves, including updating their passwords on other systems.</p>

	<p>Because our systems are still unavailable, you can't change the password for our services. However, if you use the same password for non-British Library services, we recommend that you change it as a precaution.</p>
	
	<p>NCSC provides <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/information-for/individuals-families" target="_blank">guidance on staying secure online</a>, including how to create a strong password, and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/data-breaches" target="_blank">specific guidance for individuals who may have been impacted by a data breach</a>.</p>

	<p>Analysing the data is likely to take several months. Should we find specific information has been compromised, we will alert anyone affected as soon as we can. We are continuing to collaborate with the Metropolitan Police and professional cybersecurity advisors, and are receiving support from the NCSC.</p>

	<p>We're really sorry for the ongoing disruption to our systems and services and we'll provide further updates when we can.</p>
	
	<h3>What is currently available?</h3>
	
	<p>The Library's buildings are open, but some services are limited, including access to collection items. We're regularly updating <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2023/11/cyber-incident.html" target="_blank">our blog</a> with the latest information on what's currently available online and onsite so please check this before you visit.</p>
	
	<p>If you have purchased tickets for our exhibition, <strong>Fantasy: Realms of Imagination</strong>, you can still use them. Exhibition tickets can also be booked via <a href="https://fantasy.seetickets.com/timeslots/filter/fantasy-realms-of-imagination" target="_blank">See Tickets</a>. Our free exhibition, <strong>Malorie Blackman: The Power of Stories</strong>, is open and no booking is required.</p>
	
	<p>All upcoming <strong>public events</strong> are going ahead as planned and you can find more information on our <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2023/11/british-library-events-.html" target="_blank"> events blog
			update</a>. We're continuing to welcome <strong>schools</strong> and <strong>families</strong> too, as well as
		adult learners to our <strong>courses</strong>. </p>
	
	<p><strong>Business &amp; IP Centre</strong> (BIPC) in St Pancras is open to support businesses as usual but digital
		services onsite are unavailable. You can also join <strong>BIPC events and webinars</strong> and access one-to-one
		support. Read our <a href="https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2023/11/british-library-business-ip-centre-bipc-services.html" target="_blank">BIPC blog update</a> to find out what help and advice we can offer during this time.</p>
	
	<h3>Contacting us</h3>
	<p>While our systems are offline, you can contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:customer@bl.uk" target="_blank">customer@bl.uk</a> We'll do our best to answer your queries but please bear with us. This inbox is reviewed between 08.30 to 16.30 Monday to Friday. We're experiencing a high volume of enquiries so it may take us some time to respond. We'll get back to you as quickly as we can.</p>
	
	<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>2023-12-18</span> Reflections on Servo’s progress in 2023: contributor stats, new features, layout improvements, WPT pass rates, and plans for next year.</p><div>
  <p>Servo is well and truly back.</p>
<figure><a href="https://servo.org/img/blog/recap-2023-contributors.png"><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/recap-2023-contributors.png" alt="Bar chart: 453 (44%) by Igalia, 195 (19%) by non-Igalia, 389 (37%) by bots"></a>
<figcaption>Contributors to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">servo/servo</a> in 2023.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span></span>
This year, to date, we’ve had <strong>53 unique contributors</strong> (+140% over 22 last year), landing <strong>1037 pull requests</strong> (+382% over 215) and 2485 commits (+375% over 523), and that’s just in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">our main repo</a>!</p>
<p>Individual contributors are especially important for the health of the project, and of the pull requests made by humans (rather than our <a href="https://github.com/servo-wpt-sync">friendly</a> <a href="https://github.com/dependabot">bots</a>), 30% were by people outside Igalia, and 18% were by non-reviewers.</p>
<p>Servo has been featured in <a href="https://servo.org/about/">six conference talks</a> this year, including at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHvHoAO5oo">RustNL</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfk8s5OD99A">Web Engines Hackfest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qedc-0pjs&amp;t=2356s">LF Europe Member Summit</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lkIX5ryZZ4">Open Source Summit Europe</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/RugzThWcjn4">GOSIM Workshop</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx70W83Bxtc">GOSIM Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Servo now has a usable “minibrowser” UI, now supports offscreen rendering, its experimental WebGPU support (<code>--pref dom.webgpu.enabled</code>) has been updated, and Servo is now listed on <a href="https://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a> again (click <span>Edit</span> to add Servo).</p>
<p><a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/04/13/layout-2013-vs-2020/">Our new layout engine</a> is now proving its strengths, with support for iframes, floats, stacking context improvements, inline layout improvements, margin collapsing, ‘position: sticky’, ‘min-width’ and ‘min-height’, ‘max-width’ and ‘max-height’, ‘align-content’, ‘justify-content’, ‘white-space’, ‘text-indent’, ‘text-align: justify’, <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/05/31/adding-support-for-outline-properties/">‘outline’ and ‘outline-offset’</a>, and ‘filter: drop-shadow()’.</p>
<figure><a href="https://servo.org/img/blog/recap-2023-wpt.png"><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/recap-2023-wpt.png" alt="Bar chart: 17% + 64pp in floats, 18% + 55pp in floats-clear, 63% + 15pp in key CSS2 tests, 80% + 14pp in abspos, 34% + 14pp in CSS position module, 67% + 13pp in margin-padding-clear, 49% + 13pp in CSSOM, 51% + 10pp in all CSS tests, 49% + 6pp in all WPT tests"></a>
<figcaption>Pass rates in parts of the <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a> with our new layout engine, showing the improvement we’ve made since the <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/07/20/servo-web-platform-tests/">start of our data</a> in April 2023.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span></span>
<a href="https://github.com/dbaron/inlines-and-floats">Floats are notoriously tricky</a>, to the point we found them <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Servo-Layout-Engines-Report">impossible to implement correctly</a> in our legacy layout engine, but thanks to the move from eager to opportunistic parallelism, they are now supported fairly well.
Whereas legacy layout was only ever able to reach 53.9% in the floats tests and 68.2% in floats-clear, we’re now at <strong>82.2% in floats</strong> (+28.3pp over legacy) and <strong>73.3% in floats-clear</strong> (+5.1pp over legacy).</p>
<p><a href="http://acid1.acidtests.org/">Acid1</a> now passes in the new layout engine, and we’ve also surpassed legacy layout in the <strong>CSS2 abspos (by 50.0pp)</strong>, CSS2 positioning (by 6.5pp), and CSS Position (by 4.4pp) test suites, while making big strides in others, like the <strong>CSSOM tests (+13.1pp)</strong> and key parts of the <strong>CSS2 test suite (+15.8pp)</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap/106e95887c3d9768f791a4e0501ba5c89abe9636">Next year</a>, our funding will go towards maintaining Servo, releasing nightlies on Android, finishing our integration with Tauri (thanks to NLNet), and implementing tables and better support for floats and non-Latin text (thanks to NLNet).</p>
<p>Servo will also be at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM 2024</a>, with Rakhi Sharma speaking about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects/">embedding Servo in Rust projects</a> on <strong>3 February</strong> at <strong>16:45 local time</strong> (15:45 UTC).
See you there!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more we would like to do, so if you or a company you know are interested in sponsoring the development of an embeddable, independent, memory-safe, modular, parallel web rendering engine, we want to hear from you!
Head over to <a href="https://servo.org/sponsorship/">our sponsorship page</a>, or email <a href="https://servo.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4923262027093a2c3b3f2667263b2e"><span data-cfemail="543e3b3d3a14273126223b7a3b2633">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> for enquiries.</p>
<p>In a decade that many people feared would become the nadir of browser engine diversity, we hope we can help change that with Servo.</p>

          <h2>cheap ≠ free</h2>
          <p>Making nice things is difficult and time-consuming.</p>
          <p>
            If we want people to make nice things for us, we have to pay for
            their rent and grocery bills and raw materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are spending less than
            <a href="https://taylor.town/dollar-per-hour">$1 per hour</a> on
            your entertainment (podcasts, videos, articles, games, books, etc.),
            consider finding ways to support creators and the infrastructure
            that supports them.

                I want [the Mac] to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s
                inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood
                for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.
              </em>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, the HTML source for
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a> is not so "beautiful
            on the inside", but Apple engineers shouldn't be faulted for ugly
            HTML. Their only option was to wrap a sleek skin around shoddy
            materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML/CSS should evoke feelings of sculpting with digital concrete,
            but it feels more like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_bridge">building bridges with uncooked pasta</a>. The whole digital design landscape is begging for simple markup
            languages that can participate in honest architecture.
            <em>[I hope to finish one such language in 2024-2025!
              <a href="https://potato.cheap/hello@taylor.town=splat">Email me</a>
              if you'd like to help.]</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Until we adopt simple and stable building materials,
            <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90501691/science-confirms-it-web-sites-really-do-all-look-the-same">all websites will continue to look the same</a>. Software has become too complicated to stay honest. Corporations
            can't expose their brick-and-wood architecture because it's actually
            Megablocks and sawdust underneath all that paint.
          </p>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">Wirth's Law</a>
            threatens to make things even worse. As software rots,
            multinationals may become the only players capable of making
            websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            But people like Bartosz Ciechanowski are forging paths to elegant
            futures. The
            <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/js/watch.js">source code</a> for his
            <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch">mechanical watch demo</a>
            is proof that honest software is viable. Each guide is erected as a
            giant wall of WebGL. It's beautiful, but definitely not sleek.
          </p>
          <p>
            The World Wide Web needn't be all 3D WebGL wizardry. The websites of
            <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/about">Patrick Colison</a>,
            <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>, and

            examples of cozy HTML cabins.
          </p>
          <p>

            and impersonal place. They feed our FOMO to keep us clicking. They

            Sturgeon's Law states that
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">"90% of everything is crap"</a>.
          </p>

          <p>The non-crap 10% of the World Wide Web may be unreachable.</p>

          <p>
            The

            to be confused with the <a href="#dark">dark web</a>) is hard to
            find because it's hard to find.
          </p>

          <p>
            Computers are really good at finding and storing things, so why is
            much of the internet broken and/or missing?
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Spam:</strong> Corporations and computers manufacture crap
              at scale, then
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">exploit</a>
              (and often pay) Google to overwhelm independent search results.
              Our public library shelves are flooded with junk mail and coupons.
              Consider supporting alternative search engines like
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> and
              <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Javascript:</strong> Modern websites are built with more
              JS (dynamic) than HTML (static), and dynamic content is difficult
              for computers to read. Imagine ordering <em>The Hobbit</em> and
              unexpectedly receiving a N64 cartridge with an e-book on it. A
              book is simple and unchanging. A N64 cartridge requires (1) a
              working N64, (2) a compatible television, (3) knowledge of how to
              use/repair the equipment, (4) knowledge of how to use the
              cartridge, and (5) time/energy to load the cartridge and navigate
              menus. Hodgepodge cartridges do not scale. To keep HTML
              competitive with JS, we need better tooling. Some HTML resources
              are listed on the side of this webpage. To supplant JS, the HTML
              development experience must become 10x easier/faster/cheaper/etc
              than the current JS experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Images:</strong> HTML is more sustainable than JS, but
              HTML remains hostile to beginners. Without an easy markup
              language, people use Powerpoint/Photoshop to share documents. It's
              hard for computers to decipher/archive images, and it only becomes
              harder as fewer photocopies-of-photocopies survive. We need
              something powerful like HTML/CSS, yet simple like Markdown.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> HTML is generally unkind to people
              of limited hearing, vision, etc. By default, stuff on the cheap
              web should work flexibly with many interfaces.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect">Everybody benefits from curb cuts.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payments:</strong> Browsers could have implemented digital
              wallets to manage subscriptions and one-click payments, but
              consumers had to wait for Amazon and Apple to launch proprietary
              solutions to public platform problems. Payments were difficult, so
              nobody paid for things. Advertising became the default way to
              sustainably make money; piracy became the default way to guard
              one's attention/privacy. To escape from this advertising
              hellscape, we must make online payments better for developers and
              consumers, especially for digital goods.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arbitrary Addresses:</strong> The modern internet works
              much like Amazon's delivery network. Amazon can deliver stuff in
              its warehouses quickly, but one must wait longer to get products
              directly from suppliers. But digital goods needn't come from a
              supplier nor the closest distribution center. All internet data
              can be sent and received faster by copying data from neighbors!
              Cryptographers
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">invented magic</a>
              to do exactly this, but it's not being used at all layers of our
              digital infrastructure. To get mainstream adoption at the www.*
              level, we need
              <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">more browser support</a>
              and killer apps (an
              <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a> alternative seems like a
              good candidate).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platforms:</strong> Nobody owns email or podcasts (RSS),
              and everybody benefits tremendously from that freedom and
              flexibility. Corporations like Slack, Twitter, Visa, Zoom, Google,
              Amazon, Instagram, Unity, YouTube, and GoDaddy retain control over
              infrastructure that needn't be controlled at all. To escape
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>
              cycles, we need open protocols and designers to make nice
              interfaces for those protocols. Federated services like Mastadon
              are promising.

              <strong>Ad-Hoc Archival:</strong> If the internet were built on
              something like BitTorrent, archiving and indexing everything would
              be trivial and automatic. Instead,
              <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> remains perpetually
              underfunded in its futile battle against

            The maintainers of the global financial system have repeatedly
            failed us. All the games seem rigged and global inequality seems
            inescapable. Governments and corporations continue to trample our
            privacy. Banks are slow; credit card fees feel like theft. And so
            on.

            It remains unclear what role blockchains will play in a sustainable

            to obtain the convenience we desire and the privacy we deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if we receive privacy, let's use it responsibly -- let's leave

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><header></header><p>What would you say if Jupyter Notebooks could ➀ support any programming language, ➁ have no hidden state, and ➂ have a native look and feel for any article or blog post?</p><p>Well, I've just shipped something like that! With the latest <a href="https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi-js">codapi-js</a> feature called <em>code cells</em>, you can create a series of interactive code snippets that depend on each other and execute them without leaving your browser.</p><p>Let's look at an example.</p><h2 id="code-cells">Code cells</h2><p>Suppose we are writing an SQL tutorial using PostgreSQL. First, let's create an <code>employees</code> table:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>employees</span> (
</span></span><span><span>  <span>id</span> <span>integer</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>name</span> <span>varchar</span>(<span>50</span>),
</span></span><span><span>  <span>department</span> <span>varchar</span>(<span>10</span>),

</span></span><span><span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><codapi-snippet id="create.sql" sandbox="postgres" editor="basic" template="#status.tpl"></codapi-snippet><p>Then insert some employee data:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>employees</span>
</span></span><span><span>(<span>id</span>, <span>name</span>, <span>department</span>, <span>salary</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>values</span>
</span></span><span><span>(<span>11</span>, <span>'Diane'</span>, <span>'hr'</span>, <span>70</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>12</span>, <span>'Bob'</span>, <span>'hr'</span>, <span>78</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>21</span>, <span>'Emma'</span>, <span>'it'</span>, <span>84</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>22</span>, <span>'Grace'</span>, <span>'it'</span>, <span>90</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>23</span>, <span>'Henry'</span>, <span>'it'</span>, <span>104</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>31</span>, <span>'Cindy'</span>, <span>'sales'</span>, <span>96</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>32</span>, <span>'Dave'</span>, <span>'sales'</span>, <span>96</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>33</span>, <span>'Alice'</span>, <span>'sales'</span>, <span>100</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><codapi-snippet id="insert.sql" sandbox="postgres" editor="basic" template="#status.tpl" depends-on="create.sql"></codapi-snippet><p>Finally, rank the employees according to their salaries in each department:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>select</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>department</span> <span>as</span> <span>dep</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>dense_rank</span>() <span>over</span> <span>w</span> <span>as</span> <span>rank</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>name</span>, <span>salary</span>

</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>order</span> <span>by</span> <span>department</span>, <span>rank</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><codapi-snippet sandbox="postgres" editor="basic" template="#select.tpl" depends-on="insert.sql"></codapi-snippet><p>As you can probably see, the <code>insert</code> snippet depends on the <code>create</code> snippet, while the <code>select</code> snippet depends on both <code>create</code> and <code>insert</code>, forming a dependency chain:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>create ← insert ← select
</code></pre><p>This is how the snippets work:</p><ul><li>When you run the <code>insert</code> snippet, it automatically creates the table before inserting the data.</li><li>When you run the <code>select</code> snippet, it automatically creates the table and inserts the records before selecting the data.</li></ul><p>The dependencies do not have to be linear, they can form an (acyclic) graph. Suppose we want to <code>describe</code> the table schema:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>\d employees;
</code></pre><codapi-snippet sandbox="postgres" editor="basic" template="#select.tpl" depends-on="create.sql"></codapi-snippet><p>The <code>describe</code> snippet does not need table data, so it can depend directly on the <code>create</code> snippet:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>create ← insert ← select
   ↖
  describe
</code></pre><p>More complex dependency graphs are also possible, as long as there are no cycles:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>create ← insert-1 ← select
       ↖ insert-2 ↙
</code></pre><p>You probably get the idea.</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>Back to our example. Suppose we started with two static code examples — <code>create</code> and <code>insert</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>employees</span> (
</span></span><span><span>  <span>id</span> <span>integer</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span>,
</span></span><span><span>  <span>name</span> <span>varchar</span>(<span>50</span>),
</span></span><span><span>  <span>department</span> <span>varchar</span>(<span>10</span>),
</span></span><span><span>  <span>salary</span> <span>integer</span>
</span></span><span><span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>employees</span>
</span></span><span><span>(<span>id</span>, <span>name</span>, <span>department</span>, <span>salary</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>values</span>
</span></span><span><span>(<span>11</span>, <span>'Diane'</span>, <span>'hr'</span>, <span>70</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>12</span>, <span>'Bob'</span>, <span>'hr'</span>, <span>78</span>),
</span></span><span><span>(<span>21</span>, <span>'Emma'</span>, <span>'it'</span>, <span>84</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, we make them interactive by adding <code>codapi-snippet</code>s.</p><p>➀ Create:</p><pre><code>```sql
create table employees (
  id integer primary key,
  name varchar(50),
  department varchar(10),
  salary integer
);
```

&lt;codapi-snippet id="create.sql" sandbox="postgres" editor="basic"&gt;
&lt;/codapi-snippet&gt;
</code></pre><p>➁ Insert:</p><pre><code>```sql
insert into employees
(id, name, department, salary)
values
(11, 'Diane', 'hr', 70),
(12, 'Bob', 'hr', 78),
(21, 'Emma', 'it', 84);
```

&lt;codapi-snippet id="insert.sql" sandbox="postgres" editor="basic"&gt;
&lt;/codapi-snippet&gt;
</code></pre><p>Then we make <code>insert</code> dependent on <code>create</code> by adding a <code>depends-on</code> attribute:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>codapi-snippet</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"insert.sql"</span> <span>sandbox</span><span>=</span><span>"postgres"</span> <span>editor</span><span>=</span><span>"basic"</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>depends-on</span><span>=</span><span>"create.sql"</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>codapi-snippet</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The rest is automatic!</p><p>Behind the scenes, <code>codapi-snippet</code> calls a <a href="https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi">codapi</a> server (either a cloud or self-hosted instance) so it can run any programming language, database or software you've configured.</p><p>As you know, Jupyter notebooks are stateful — that is, they store the state of variables between cell invocations. This can be a good thing for prototyping, but not for documentation or explanation.</p><p>The last thing I want as a reader is code examples that fail or behave oddly because they were run out of order. Or because I didn't run some cells. Or because I changed a cell and didn't re-run it.</p><p>Codapi code cells, unlike Jupyter's, have no hidden state. Instead, they execute the whole chain of dependencies as needed to ensure that the reader gets a consistent result.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Codapi provides an easy way to create interactive examples in technical documentation. It gets even easier with code cells, which allow declarative dependencies between snippets of code.</p><p>Give it a try!</p><p><a href="https://codapi.org/">About Codapi</a> •

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does it work?</h3>
<p dir="auto">This experiment explores self-evolving agents that automatically generate and improve themselves. No specific agent design or prompting is required from the user. Simply pose a question, and the system initiates and evolves agents tailored to provide answers. The process starts with a user query, activating a basic "bootstrap" agent, which doesn't execute Python code but plans and delegates to specialized agents capable of running Python for broader functions. An Agent Manager oversees them, selecting or creating agents via vector similarity for specific tasks. Agents have evolving system prompts that improve through learning. For coding tasks, agents include Python in prompts, refining their approach through an "evolution step" if unsuccessful. Upon completing a task, an agent's status updates, and the bootstrap agent evaluates the result, engaging other agents for further steps in larger processes.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current Challenges and Potential Improvements</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Path Optimization</strong>: The system sometimes fails to effectively discard non-functional agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Performance and Parallelization</strong>: Currently, parallel processing is not implemented. Enabling the testing of multiple prompt evolutions simultaneously could significantly enhance performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Strategy for Prompt Evolution</strong>: The approach to prompt evolution is quite basic at the moment. Developing a method to quantify the success ratio would refine this strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Persistent Agent Prompts</strong>: There is significant potential in integrating persistent agent prompts with vector databases. Additionally, sharing successful agents across various runtime environments could improve overall efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hierarchical Agent Structure</strong>: Most requests are presently processed directly by an agent designated by the bootstrap agent. Implementing a more intricate hierarchical structure for managing requests could lead to major improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Context Size Limitation</strong>: Not yet considered.</p>
</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Neither AMD nor Nvidia intends to back out of this argument involving the performance difference between the Instinct MI300X and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-hopper-h100-gpu-revealed-gtc-2022" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-hopper-h100-gpu-revealed-gtc-2022">H100</a> (Hopper) GPUs. But AMD does make some strong points while comparing FP16 using vLLM, which is a more popular choice against FP8, which works only with TensorRT-LLM.&nbsp;</p><p>The red team announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-unveils-instinct-mi300x-gpu-and-mi300a-apu-claims-up-to-16x-lead-over-nvidias-competing-gpus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-unveils-instinct-mi300x-gpu-and-mi300a-apu-claims-up-to-16x-lead-over-nvidias-competing-gpus">MI300X graphics accelerator</a> early this December, claiming up to 1.6X lead over Nvidia's H100. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-h100-is-2x-faster-than-amd-m1300x" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-h100-is-2x-faster-than-amd-m1300x">Two days ago</a>, Nvidia fired back by saying AMD did not use its optimizations when comparing the H100 with TensorRT-LLM. The reply reached a single H100 against eight-way H100 GPUs while running the Llama 2 70B chat model.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="the-continued-war-of-benchmark-results-and-test-scenarios-3">The Continued War of Benchmark Results and Test Scenarios</h2><p>In this latest response, AMD said that Nvidia used a selective set of inferencing workloads. It further identified that Nvidia benchmarked these using its in-house TensorRT-LLM on H100 rather than vLLM, an open-source and widely used method. Furthermore, Nvidia used the vLLM FP16 performance datatype on AMD while comparing its results with DGX-H100, which used the TensorRT-LLM with FP8 datatype to display these alleged misconstrued results. AMD stressed that in its test, it used vLLM with the FP16 dataset due to its widespread use, and vLLM does not support FP8.</p><p>There's also the point that servers will have latency, but instead of accounting for that, Nvidia showed its throughput performance, not emulating the real-world situation, according to AMD.</p><h2 id="amd-apos-s-updated-test-results-with-more-optimizations-and-accounting-for-latency-with-nvidia-apos-s-testing-method-3">AMD's Updated Test Results with More Optimizations and Accounting for Latency with Nvidia's Testing Method</h2><p>AMD made three performance runs using Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM, the last notable one having measured latency results between MI300X and vLLM using the FP16 dataset against H100 with TensorRT-LLM. But the first test involved a comparison between the two using vLLM on both, hence FP16, and for the second test, it compared its MI300X's performance with vLLM while comparing TensorRT-LLM.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="AMD's second Inference Performance bench on Llama 2 70B using three test scenarios" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="AMD's second Inference Performance bench on Llama 2 70B using three test scenarios" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg" alt="AMD's second Inference Performance bench on Llama 2 70B using three test scenarios" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ocGERk5ybqFhgHFv6ic6Pc-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AMD )</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, AMD used the same selected testing scenario Nvidia did with its second and third test scenarios, showing higher performance and reduced latency.

<p><img alt="Image of Steamboat Willie Entering the Public Domain by Doo Lee" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Steamboat-WIllie-Enters-Public-Domain.jpeg"></p>
<p>On January 1, 2024, after almost a century of copyright protection, Mickey Mouse, or at least a <em>version</em> of Mickey Mouse, will enter the public domain. The first movies in which the iconic mouse appeared – most famously, <em>Steamboat Willie­</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> – were made in 1928 and works from that year go into the public domain in the United States on New Year’s Day 2024.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
<p>The public domain has had some famous recent arrivals, but this is the most anticipated entry yet. Why? It is not simply that Mickey is a famous copyrighted character. So are Sherlock Holmes and Winnie the Pooh, and while they entered the public domain with some fanfare, it paled in comparison to this event. I’d like to offer a tentative answer. The reason that this event gathers so much attention is that it is the story of a 95-year-old love triangle, a tangled drama that rivals any Disney movie for twists and turns. The protagonists are Mickey, Disney and the Public Domain, and their relationship positively exemplifies the social media weasel-words “it’s complicated.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, Disney pushed for the law that extended the copyright term to 95 years, which became referred to derisively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act.”&nbsp; This extension has been criticized by scholars as being economically regressive and having a devastating effect on our ability to digitize, archive, and gain access to our cultural heritage. It locked up not just famous works, but a vast swath of our culture, including material that is commercially unavailable. Even though calling it the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” may overstate Disney’s actual role in the legislative process – the measure passed because of a much broader lobbying effort – Disney was certainly a prominent supporter, and the Mouse was sometimes a figurehead.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Disney itself is a talented and successful practitioner of <em>building upon</em> the public domain. In fact, the public domain is Disney’s bread and butter. <em>Frozen</em> was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s <em>The Snow Queen</em>. <em>The Lion King </em>draws from Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em>, Biblical stories, and possibly an epic poem about the founder of the Mali Empire.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> <em>Fantasia </em>showcases public domain classical music, and “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” segment comes from a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, <em>Snow White</em>, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pinocchio</em> came from stories by Lewis Carroll, The Brothers Grimm, Victor Hugo, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Anderson, and Carlo Collodi.</p>
<p>The public domain includes not only works over which copyright has expired or never existed, but also uncopyrightable aspects of contemporary works—such as ideas, stock elements, and unoriginal material. The Mickey character itself is based on such public domain fodder. His personality and antics drew from silent film stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks. Walt Disney told <em>The American Magazine</em>: “I think we were rather indebted to Charlie Chaplin …We wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin…a little fellow trying to do the best he could.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Ub Iwerks, who animated most of <em>Steamboat Willie</em>, wrote that Douglas Fairbanks “was the super-hero of his day, always winning, gallant and swashbuckling. Mickey’s action was in that vein…I thought of him in that respect, and I had him do naturally the sort of thing Doug Fairbanks would do.” Titles are also not copyrightable, and the name “Steamboat Willie” was a nod to the title of Buster Keaton’s film from earlier the same year, <em>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</em><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
<p>Hence the triangle. Disney is both an emblem of term extension and its erosion of the public domain, and one of the strongest use-cases in <em>favor</em> of the maintenance of a rich public domain. Mickey is the symbol of both tendencies. Ironies abound. It may not be <em>exactly </em>the same as an oil company relying on solar power to run its rigs, but it is definitely in the same “massive irony” zip code. All of this makes the year when copyright finally expires over Mickey Mouse highly symbolic. The love triangle between Mickey, Disney, and the public domain is about to evolve, and perhaps even <em>resolve</em>, in real time.</p>
<p>But what does public domain status actually <em>mean</em> for the <em>Steamboat Willie</em> version of Mickey?<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> There is a vast amount of misinformation about these issues online. In what follows, I will try to offer a straightforward explainer. What <em>can </em>and <em>can’t </em>you do with the Mickey Mouse character as of January 1, 2024? How will Disney be affected? Does Disney still hold copyrights over later versions of Mickey? Does trademark law play a role? Keep reading for details.</p>

	<em>What can I do with Mickey Mouse as of January 1, 2024? </em></h3>

<p>The answer, ironically, is distinctly mouse-shaped! Here is a diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="A green circle with black text and words" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Mickey_Mouse_Trademark_and_Copyright_Do_and_Dont_v4.png"></p>
<p>As explained by <a href="https://youtu.be/nAp7fhUd7u0?t=607" target="_blank">Karyn A. Temple</a>, former United States Register of Copyrights, the public domain “is part of copyright’s lifecycle, the next stage of life for that creative work. The public domain is an inherent and integral part of the copyright system…It provides authors the inspiration and raw material to create something new.”</p>
<p><em>Steamboat Willie </em>and the characters it depicts – which include both Mickey and Minnie Mouse – will be in the public domain. As indicated in the green circle, this means that anyone can share, adapt, or remix that material. You can start your creative engines too—<em>full steam ahead</em>! You could take a page out of the <a href="https://winniethepooh.whogivesacrap.org/" target="_blank"><em>Winnie-the-Pooh: the Deforested Edition</em></a> playbook and create “Steamboat Willie: the Climate Change Edition,” in which Mickey’s boat is grounded in a dry riverbed. You could create a feminist remake with Minnie Mouse as the central figure. You could reimagine Mickey and Minnie dedicating themselves to animal welfare. (The animals in <em>Steamboat Willie </em>are contorted rather uncomfortably into musical instruments. PETA would not approve.)</p>
<p>You can do all of this and more, <em>so long as </em>you steer clear of the subsisting rights indicated by the orange circles, namely:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Use the original versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from 1928, without copyrightable elements of later iterations (though not every later iteration will be copyrightable, as I explain below) and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Do not confuse consumers into thinking that your creation is produced or sponsored by Disney as a matter of trademark law. One way to help ensure that your audience is not confused is to make the actual source of the work – you or your company – clear on the title screen or cover, along with a prominent disclaimer indicating that your work was not produced, endorsed, licensed, or approved by Disney.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>So, is January 1, 2024 doomsday for Disney? No. Disney still retains copyright over newer iterations of Mickey such as the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” Mickey from <em>Fantasia</em> (1940) as well as trademarks over Mickey as a brand identifier. People will still go to its theme parks, pay to see its movies, buy its merchandise. Its brand identity will remain intact.</p>
<p>In sum, yes, you can use Mickey in new creative works. There are some more complex peripheral legal issues, but here is your guide through them.</p>
<p id="spacer"><a href="#toc">(back to contents)</a></p>

<h3 id="green">
	<em>What about more recent versions of Mickey?</em></h3>

<div>
	<p><img alt="Mickey Glove Pointing for directional sign to the clubhouse ..." src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Pointing-glove-copy.jpg"></p>
	<div>
		<p><strong>Copyright expiration allows you to use the original Mickey and Minnie Mouse in new creative works, even though those characters also appear in more recent works that are still under copyright.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>With newer iterations of those characters, Disney only owns <em>original, creative expression</em> that qualifies for copyright, not mere ideas, unoriginal or stock character features, or “merely trivial” variations to the original characters.</strong></p>
	</div>
</div>
<p>In 2024 Mickey Mouse joins a host of other familiar public domain characters—Winnie the Pooh, Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, Robin Hood, Snow White, Cinderella, and Alice in Wonderland. You can use Mickey and Minnie 1.0, as they appeared in <em>Steamboat Willie </em>and<em> Plane Crazy</em>, even though these characters also appear in later, still-copyrighted works. Under copyright law, Disney only owns the <em>newly added</em> material in subsequent works, not underlying material from 1928—that content remains freely available.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
<p>“It is a bedrock principle of copyright that once work enters the public domain it cannot be appropriated as private (intellectual) property, and even the most creative of legal theories cannot trump this tenet.” –<em>Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate</em> (N.D. Ill. 2013) aff’d (7th Cir. 2014)</p>
<p>This point was illustrated by the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd.’s unsuccessful attempts to artificially extend the expired copyright over the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2023/#sherlockholmes" target="_blank">covered</a> on last year’s Public Domain Day site. A court <a href="https://freesherlock.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/klinger-order-on-motion-for-summary-judgment-c.pdf" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that all of the story elements in public domain works are “free for public use”: “Where an author has used the same character in a series of works, some of which are in the public domain, the public is free to copy story elements from the public domain works.”</p>
<p>Mickey’s appearance has changed over time, going from a vaguely rat-like to a more neotenous appearance. He eyes varied over time and began as large white ovals with pupils in <em>Plane Crazy</em> and smaller black dots in <em>Steamboat Willie</em> – both of those versions of Mickey are public domain in 2024. In 1929 he quickly donned gloves (apparently so that his hands were more visible against his body) and later he was colorized.”. The overall appearance of <em>Fantasia </em>Mickey and other later Mickeys is still under copyright.</p>
<p><img alt="A cartoon of a mouse" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/mickey_timeline_v2.jpg" width="85%"></p>
<p>That said, not every feature of Mickey’s later iterations is individually copyrightable. Copyright only extends to “original, creative expression.” Mere ideas are not eligible, nor are unoriginal features or stock elements. When copyright is claimed over additions to preexisting content – such as changes to the 1928 Mickey character – those changes have to be more than a “merely trivial” or “miniscule” variation on what came before.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> It is not enough for the new material just to be <em>different</em>; it has to meet copyright’s threshold requirements for protectability.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the safest approach may be to stick to Mickey circa 1928 in new creations, copyright law also lets you use later material that does not qualify for copyright. Your mouse can speak intelligibly in a high voice even though Mickey 1.0 does not do so; giving a talking mouse a squeaky voice is not copyrightable. Generic character traits such as being adorable and having less jaunty dance moves are fair game. What’s more, anything you “independently create” – or come up with yourself – is legal. Choosing your own color scheme is fine; you do not have to stick to black and white.</p>
<p>Can Disney claim copyright over the color red – standing alone – for Mickey’s shorts? On the one hand, when talking about copyright’s “originality” requirement, the Supreme Court said that “the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, ‘no matter how crude, humble or obvious’ it might be.” But the law is also clear that adding something to a prior work must be more than a “merely trivial” variation. To us, the argument seems stronger that choosing a single, bright, primary color for an article of clothing does not meet the copyrightability threshold. That said, you may be more comfortable selecting your own color scheme.</p>

<h3 id="green">
	<em>What about Disney’s trademark over Mickey?</em></h3>

<p>The plot thickens when you add Disney’s <em>trademark</em> rights to the picture. Many sources claim that even though Mickey is copyright-free in 2024, you still cannot use the character because it is trademarked by Disney. But this is not what the law actually says. Trademark law only prohibits the use of a trademarked character if doing so “is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive” consumers about the source or sponsorship of the new product.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></p>

<div>
	<p><img alt="Mickey Glove Pointing for directional sign" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Pointing-glove-copy.jpg"></p>
	<p><strong>Trademark law does not prevent you from using the 1928 Mickey character unless consumers will be misled into thinking your work is produced or sponsored by Disney.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>First, some background. <strong>Copyrights and trademarks are different.</strong> <strong><em>Copyrights</em></strong> cover creative works and prevent people from copying and adapting them without permission, with the goal of providing economic incentives to create and distribute cultural material. The US Constitution requires that these rights expire after a “limited time,” so that the public and future creators can have unfettered access to creative works.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trademarks</em></strong> cover words, logos, images, and other signifiers that serve as <em>brands</em> identifying the source of a product. The goal is to minimize consumer confusion in the marketplace. Nike can prevent other producers of athletic apparel from putting “Nike” or a swoosh on their merchandise so that when purchasers see those indicators, they know they are getting a Nike product. But it does not own the word “Nike” outright; there are lots of uses of “Nike” that do not violate trademark, whether referring to the Greek goddess of victory or to the brand in a non-confusing way.</p>
<p>Unlike copyrights, trademarks do not automatically expire. They can last as long as a mark is still being “used in commerce.” If Amazon goes on using the “Amazon” brand for 500 years, the trademark stays alive. While trademarks can outlast copyrights, however, the rights themselves are more circumscribed. For most marks, trademark law only prevents the use of a mark on similar products when it is likely to create consumer confusion about the product’s origin or sponsorship.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> Non-confusing uses are not prohibited, and there are a variety of legal safeguards for uses of trademarks in connection with expressive works such as films, books, and songs.</p>
<p>Sometimes copyrights and trademarks overlap.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> A character such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh might be covered both by copyright law (as a creative work) and trademark law (as a logo if, when people see the character on a backpack or pajamas, they think it must be official Disney merchandise). While the copyright is active, Disney can keep people from making unauthorized uses of Mickey in new works (unless those uses qualify for “fair use” protection, as with a parody). While the trademark is in effect, Disney can keep people from slapping Mickey on luggage or apparel.</p>
<p>“We have been careful to caution against misuse or overextension of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by . . . copyright.” <em>Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox</em> (Supreme Court 2003)</p>
<p>But what happens when the copyright <em>expires</em> and the trademark is ongoing? In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court made clear that trademarks cannot be used to make an end run around copyright law because this would “create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public’s federal right to copy and to use expired copyrights.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> In other words, <strong>trademark rights cannot be used to block the freedoms that the expiration of copyright allows</strong>, such as using a public domain character in a new creative work. Along the same lines, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained that when a work enters the public domain “[w]e all own it now” and trademark law “cannot be used to circumvent copyright law. If material covered by copyright law has passed into the public domain, it cannot then be protected by the Lanham Act [the federal trademark statute] without rendering the Copyright Act a nullity.”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> Those who tell you otherwise are mistaken.</p>
<p>This brings us to Mickey Mouse. The <em>Steamboat Willie </em>copyright expires in 2024. But Disney still retains trademark rights to use images of Mickey as well as the words “Mickey Mouse” in connection with a variety of products. Here are some of its federally registered Mickey images for merchandise such as clothing, backpacks, watches, linens, toys, blankets, lunch boxes, and water bottles.</p>
<p><img alt="Trademark image" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Mickey-logos1.png" width="45%"></p>
<p>Disney has also started using this logo before some of its films.</p>
<p><img alt="A logo for a movie" src="https://web.law.duke.edu/sites/default/files/images/centers/cspd/pdd2024/mickey/Mickey-logo2.jpg" width="45%"></p>
<p>If you make your own Mickey cartoon, can Disney use trademark law to interfere? Trademark law is all about preventing consumer confusion – and not about getting in the way of creativity – so it depends on whether people are likely to be misled about the source of your cartoon. As long as no one thinks it is a Disney joint, there should not be a trademark problem.</p>
<p>When might consumers think you are offering a Disney-sponsored product? Here it is important to distinguish between different uses of the Mickey character. Certainly, there might be a risk of confusion if you use Mickey as a brand identifier on the kind of <em>merchandise</em> Disney sells. Trademark law does protect Disney against that risk. Consumers may also be confused if Mickey is used in an artistic work in a way that suggests it is a Disney production, for example by appearing as a logo at the beginning of an animation.</p>
<p>Contrast these uses with putting the Mickey character in a new cartoon or book. The latter is not the kind of use that misleads as to the <em>source</em> of a product. It is exactly what copyright expiration is intended to allow.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> Were trademark law to prevent this, then trademark rights would be leveraged to obtain the effective equivalent of a perpetual copyright—precisely what the Supreme Court said we cannot do. As mentioned earlier, one way to dispel potential confusion is to make it clear that you – and not Disney – are responsible for the new work, and to add a disclaimer making it clear that your work is <em>not</em> produced or sponsored by Disney.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the Mickey character, what about Disney’s trademark over the “Mickey Mouse” name? &nbsp;Here too putting the words “Mickey Mouse” on toys or onesies is different from using “Mickey Mouse” to describe the content of a new creative work. With the latter, a disclaimer is also helpful. One court explained: “When a public domain work is copied, along with its title, there is little likelihood of confusion when even the most minimal steps are taken to distinguish the publisher of the original from that of the copy. The public is receiving just what it believes it is receiving—the work with which the title has become associated. The public is not only unharmed, it is unconfused.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a></p>
<p>With artistic uses of trademarked material, the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of expression also comes into play. Trademark law has a number of speech-protecting limitations that safeguard expressive uses. This is why when Mattel sues people for using “Barbie” in the titles of songs and photographs, they lose in court. Mattel also lost when it objected to the use of the doll’s trademarked <em>appearance </em>in a series of photographs criticizing its role in our culture.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></p>
<p>One defense allows “nominative use” of a trademark as a point of reference – for example, using “Mickey Mouse” accurately to refer to the public domain character in your work. Another comes from a case called <em>Rogers v. Grimaldi</em>, which privileged the use of trademarks in titles of expressive works as long as the term has some artistic relevance to the new work and does not explicitly mislead as to the source of the work.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> The policy underlying this rule is that trademark law should only apply to artistic works when the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression. While a disclaimer is not required to benefit from these limitations, it can nevertheless be useful to make abundantly clear that you are not providing an official Disney production.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a small subset of extremely “famous” marks – essentially, superbrands – that receive extra “anti-dilution” protection against unauthorized uses that impair the distinctiveness or harm the reputation of the famous mark, even when there is no consumer confusion. While the mouse-ears silhouette or current iteration of the Mickey logo <em>might</em> fall into this category of famous marks, the Mickey character from <em>Steamboat Willie</em> does not.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> (Just because a brand is “famous” for trademark purposes does not mean that all of its trademarks are considered famous; “Nike” is famous but many of its product names are not.) And even if Mickey 1.0 does eventually qualify, anti-dilution protection is subject to important First-Amendment exceptions that allow for the kinds of expressive uses discussed earlier.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></p>
<p>Bottom line: trademark law has a number of rules designed to safeguard expressive uses and prevent trademark law from overriding copyright law. Nonetheless, people sometimes still try to use trademark law to interfere with legal reuses of public domain material, leading to unnecessary litigation and chilling effects. Zorro Productions, Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. did this with the Zorro works and the Tarzan and John Carter works. Zorro lost in court—because the Zorro story was in the public domain, a new “Queen of Swords” TV series about Zorro’s sword-wielding daughter could proceed.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> Burroughs was able to extract a joint licensing deal from the publisher of new “Lord of the Jungle” and “Warlord of Mars” comic books; even the threat of lawsuits can chill creative reuse. Going forward, will Disney’s legal actions reflect the relevant law, enforcing only the rights it still owns, or will it try to stop what copyright expiration allows?</p>

	<em>The Public Domain: A Wellspring of Creativity</em></h3>

<p>Think of all of the works spawned by public domain stories and characters, whether it is Shakespeare’s plays, Jane Austen’s novels, Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, or Bram Stoker’s <em>Dracula</em>. Shakespeare alone has inspired hundreds of new creations. <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> and <em>Kiss Me Kate</em>&nbsp;come from <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em>, <em>West Side Story</em> from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Forbidden Planet</em> from <em>The Tempest. </em>Shakespeare himself drew on his public domain predecessors. As a federal judge observed, if the underlying works were copyrighted, “<em>Measure for Measure</em> would infringe <em>Promos and Cassandra</em>, <em>Ragtime</em> would infringe <em>Michael Kohlhaas</em>, and <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> itself would have infringed Arthur Brooke’s <em>The Tragicall Historye of Romeo and Juliet</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which in turn would have infringed several earlier <em>Romeo and Juliets</em>, all of which probably would have infringed Ovid’s story of <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em>.”</p>
<p>Disney and Mickey are part of this rich tradition, and in the end, Disney can continue to enjoy a plentiful intellectual property portfolio while also enriching the public domain. As mentioned earlier, Disney’s wonderful works exemplify just how valuable the public domain is. It has borrowed prolifically and brilliantly from the public domain, Disney-fying older works to make its beloved films: <em>The Three Muskateers</em> came from Alexandre Dumas, <em>A Christmas Carol</em> from Charles Dickens, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> from Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve, <em>Around the World in 80 Days</em> from Jules Verne, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> from Lewis Carroll, <em>Snow White</em> from The Brothers Grimm, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> from Victor Hugo, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> and <em>Cinderella</em> from Charles Perrault, <em>The Little Mermaid</em> from Hans Christian Anderson, <em>Pinocchio</em> from Carlo Collodi, <em>Huck Finn</em> from Mark Twain, <em>Robin Hood</em> from English folklore, and <em>Aladdin</em> from <em>The Book of One Thousand and One Nights</em>.</p>
<p>Let us hope that Disney remembers its own debt to the public domain as Mickey Mouse enters the realm from which it has drawn so heavily!</p>

	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> <em>Steamboat Willie</em> was a technological marvel – one of the first cartoons featuring fully synchronized sound. After seeing the 1927 film <em>The Jazz Singer</em> (the first feature-length film with synchronized dialogue, <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2023/"> highlighted</a> on last year’s Public Domain Day page) Walt Disney realized that sound films were “here to stay.” See Dave Smith, Chief Archivist Emeritus, The Walt Disney Company, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/steamboat_willie.pdf"><em>Steamboat Willie</em></a>. With animator Ub Iwerks, he created <em>Steamboat Willie</em>. Disney himself performed the (mostly unintelligible) dialogue. The cartoon was a hit with audiences and lauded by critics for its ingenuity. It was initially set to enter the public domain in 1984, after a 56-year term. An expansion in 1978 pushed the date forward to 2004. Then in 1998 it was delayed until 2024 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (this is what some people call the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”). There is even a possibility that <em>Steamboat Willie</em> might technically have gone into the public domain on release because of defects in its original copyright notice, cite, but in 2024 we know for sure that it is free of copyright.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Mickey’s first appearances were actually in earlier cartoons from 1928, <em>Plane Crazy</em> and <em>The Gallopin’ Gaucho</em>. Both were silent films and neither attracted a distributor. It was Steamboat Willie – which had synchronized sound – that put Mickey on the map. The silent version of <em>Plane Crazy</em> is also entering the public domain 2024, with the sound version going into the public domain in 2025. We could not find a 1928 registration or timely renewal for <em>The Gallopin’ Gaucho</em>, but the copyright notice on the sound version says 1929, putting it in the public domain in 2025.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Many have observed that “The Lion King” tracks an epic poem about Sundiata Keitam – whose name means “Lion Prince” – the founder of the Mali Empire. <em>See </em>Kellie Carter Jackson, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/17/true-story-behind-lion-king/" target="_blank">The true story behind “The Lion King.”</a> This article also tells the story of the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” which originated with South African Zulu singer Solomon Ntsele Linda; it is the subject of the Netflix documentary “ReMastered: The Lion’s Share.”</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> As described by Alva Johnston, Mickey and Chaplin “have the same blend of hero and coward, nit-wit and genius, mug and gentleman.” Walt Disney also studied other great silent film actors whose films we have celebrated on this site, including Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Laurel and Hardy.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> <em>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</em> went into the public domain decades ago because its copyright was not renewed. The earlier Mickey cartoon from 1928, <em>The Gallopin’ Gaucho</em>, drew on the silent film <em>The Gaucho</em>, with Mickey echoing some of the titular character’s actions.</p>
	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> We actually had a dress rehearsal on these questions in 2022 with Winnie-the-Pooh – who was then another newly public domain Disney character that reappeared in later, copyrighted works and was also covered by trademark rights – went into the public domain.

	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12" title="">[12]</a> <em>Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox</em>, 539 U.S. 23 (2003) dealt with an attempt to make an attribution-like claim under the federal trademark statute over public domain works, but the larger policy underlying the decision is that trademark law cannot be used to circumvent copyright expiration. Dastar had repackaged parts of a public domain documentary, removing the original credits and presenting it as a Dastar production. Twentieth Century Fox owned the copyrights to the documentary before they expired and claimed that Dastar violated trademark law by passing off Fox’s work as its own and failing to attribute it to Fox. The Supreme Court rejected this claim.</p>

	<p id="ftn"><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" title="">[14]</a> The McCarthy trademark treatise explains: “The expiration of copyright on a copyrighted work, such as a motion picture containing a cartoon character, should place limits on the scope of trademark rights in the character. Under the view that upon expiration of copyright the public should have free use of the work, copyright policy requires that anyone should be able to reproduce, display and perform the out-of-copyright motion picture so long as there is no confusion as to the source, sponsorship or affiliation of the seller of the reproduced film,” and “a court should not permit trademark in an image to serve the same function as did the lapsed copyright to exclude others from reproducing and distributing the out-of-copyright work, such as a film .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a balancing of the rights of trademark and of the 'public domain' status of out-of-copyright works is needed. A similar balancing is made when constitutional free speech policies are balanced against the prevention of consumer confusion.” J.
