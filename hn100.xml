<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-wrapper">
    <p>Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2023</p>

    
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 3.3.0. Ruby 3.3 adds a new parser named Prism, uses Lrama as a parser generator, adds a new pure-Ruby JIT compiler named RJIT, and many performance improvements especially YJIT.</p>

<h2>Prism</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Introduced <a href="https://github.com/ruby/prism">the Prism parser</a> as a default gem
    <ul>
      <li>Prism is a portable, error tolerant, and maintainable recursive descent parser for the Ruby language</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prism is production ready and actively maintained, you can use it in place of Ripper
    <ul>
      <li>There is <a href="https://ruby.github.io/prism/">extensive documentation</a> on how to use Prism</li>
      <li>Prism is both a C library that will be used internally by CRuby and a Ruby gem that can be used by any tooling which needs to parse Ruby code</li>
      <li>Notable methods in the Prism API are:
        <ul>
          <li><code>Prism.parse(source)</code> which returns the AST as part of a parse result object</li>
          <li><code>Prism.parse_comments(source)</code> which returns the comments</li>
          <li><code>Prism.parse_success?(source)</code> which returns true if there are no errors</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can make pull requests or issues directly on <a href="https://github.com/ruby/prism">the Prism repository</a> if you are interested in contributing</li>
  <li>You can now use <code>ruby --parser=prism</code> or <code>RUBYOPT="--parser=prism"</code> to experiment with the Prism compiler. Please note that this flag is for debugging only.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Lrama instead of Bison</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Replace Bison with <a href="https://github.com/ruby/lrama">Lrama LALR parser generator</a> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19637">[Feature #19637]</a>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have interest, please see <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2023/presentations/spikeolaf.html">The future vision of Ruby Parser</a></li>
      <li>Lrama internal parser is replaced with LR parser generated by Racc for maintainability</li>
      <li>Parameterizing Rules <code>(?, *, +)</code> are supported, it will be used in Ruby parse.y</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>YJIT</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Major performance improvements over Ruby 3.2
    <ul>
      <li>Support for splat and rest arguments has been improved.</li>
      <li>Registers are allocated for stack operations of the virtual machine.</li>
      <li>More calls with optional arguments are compiled. Exception handlers are also compiled.</li>
      <li>Unsupported call types and megamorphic call sites no longer exit to the interpreter.</li>
      <li>Basic methods like Rails <code>#blank?</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49909">specialized <code>#present?</code></a> are inlined.</li>
      <li><code>Integer#*</code>, <code>Integer#!=</code>, <code>String#!=</code>, <code>String#getbyte</code>,
<code>Kernel#block_given?</code>, <code>Kernel#is_a?</code>, <code>Kernel#instance_of?</code>, and <code>Module#===</code>
are specially optimized.</li>
      <li>Compilation speed is now slightly faster than Ruby 3.2.</li>
      <li>Now more than 3x faster than the interpreter on Optcarrot!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Significantly improved memory usage over Ruby 3.2
    <ul>
      <li>Metadata for compiled code uses a lot less memory.</li>
      <li><code>--yjit-call-threshold</code> is automatically raised from 30 to 120
when the application has more than 40,000 ISEQs.</li>
      <li><code>--yjit-cold-threshold</code> is added to skip compiling cold ISEQs.</li>
      <li>More compact code is generated on Arm64.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Code GC is now disabled by default
    <ul>
      <li><code>--yjit-exec-mem-size</code> is treated as a hard limit where compilation of new code stops.</li>
      <li>No sudden drops in performance due to code GC.
Better copy-on-write behavior on servers reforking with
<a href="https://github.com/shopify/pitchfork">Pitchfork</a>.</li>
      <li>You can still enable code GC if desired with <code>--yjit-code-gc</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add <code>RubyVM::YJIT.enable</code> that can enable YJIT at run-time
    <ul>
      <li>You can start YJIT without modifying command-line arguments or environment variables.
Rails 7.2 will <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49947">enable YJIT by default</a>
using this method.</li>
      <li>This can also be used to enable YJIT only once your application is
done booting. <code>--yjit-disable</code> can be used if you want to use other
YJIT options while disabling YJIT at boot.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More YJIT stats are available by default
    <ul>
      <li><code>yjit_alloc_size</code> and several more metadata-related stats are now available by default.</li>
      <li><code>ratio_in_yjit</code> stat produced by <code>--yjit-stats</code> is now available in release builds,
a special stats or dev build is no longer required to access most stats.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add more profiling capabilities
    <ul>
      <li><code>--yjit-perf</code> is added to facilitate profiling with Linux perf.</li>
      <li><code>--yjit-trace-exits</code> now supports sampling with <code>--yjit-trace-exits-sample-rate=N</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>More thorough testing and multiple bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h2>RJIT</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Introduced a pure-Ruby JIT compiler RJIT and replaced MJIT.
    <ul>
      <li>RJIT supports only x86-64 architecture on Unix platforms.</li>
      <li>Unlike MJIT, it doesn’t require a C compiler at runtime.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>RJIT exists only for experimental purposes.
    <ul>
      <li>You should keep using YJIT in production.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you are interested in developing JIT for Ruby, please check out <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2023/presentations/k0kubun.html#day3">k0kubun’s presentation on Day 3 of RubyKaigi</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>M:N thread scheduler</h2>

<ul>
  <li>M:N thread scheduler was introduced. <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19842">[Feature #19842]</a>
    <ul>
      <li>M Ruby threads are managed by N native threads (OS threads) so the thread creation and management cost are reduced.</li>
      <li>It can break C-extension compatibility so that M:N thread scheduler is disabled on the main Ractor by default.
        <ul>
          <li><code>RUBY_MN_THREADS=1</code> environment variable enables M:N threads on the main Ractor.</li>
          <li>M:N threads are always enabled on non-main Ractors.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><code>RUBY_MAX_CPU=n</code> environment variable sets maximum number of <code>N</code> (maximum number of native threads). The default value is 8.
        <ul>
          <li>Since only one Ruby thread per Ractor can run at the same time, the number of native threads will be used, which is the smaller of the number specified in <code>RUBY_MAX_CPU</code> and the number of running Ractors. So that single Ractor applications (most of applications) will only use 1 native thread.</li>
          <li>To support blocking operations, more than <code>N</code> native threads can be used.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>defined?(@ivar)</code> is optimized with Object Shapes.</li>
  <li>Name resolution such as <code>Socket.getaddrinfo</code> can now be interrupted (in environments where pthreads are available). <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19965">[Feature #19965]</a></li>
  <li>Several performance improvements to the Garbage Collector
    <ul>
      <li>Young objects referenced by old objects are no longer immediately
  promoted to the old generation. This significantly reduces the frequency of
  major GC collections. <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19678">[Feature #19678]</a></li>
      <li>A new <code>REMEMBERED_WB_UNPROTECTED_OBJECTS_LIMIT_RATIO</code> tuning variable was
  introduced to control the number of unprotected objects cause a major GC
  collection to trigger. The default is set to <code>0.01</code> (1%). This significantly
  reduces the frequency of major GC collection. <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19571">[Feature #19571]</a></li>
      <li>Write Barriers were implemented for many core types that were missing them,
  notably <code>Time</code>, <code>Enumerator</code>, <code>MatchData</code>, <code>Method</code>, <code>File::Stat</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code>
  and several others. This significantly reduces minor GC collection time and major
  GC collection frequency.</li>
      <li>Most core classes are now using Variable Width Allocation, notably <code>Hash</code>, <code>Time</code>,
  <code>Thread::Backtrace</code>, <code>Thread::Backtrace::Location</code>, <code>File::Stat</code>, <code>Method</code>.
  This makes these classes faster to allocate and free, use less memory and reduce
  heap fragmentation.</li>
      <li>Support for weak references has been added to the garbage collector. <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19783">[Feature #19783]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Other notable changes since 3.2</h2>

<h3>IRB</h3>

<p>IRB has received several enhancements, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced <code>irb:rdbg</code> integration that provides an equivalent debugging experience to <code>pry-byebug</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ruby/irb#debugging-with-irb">doc</a>).</li>
  <li>Pager support for <code>ls</code>, <code>show_source</code> and <code>show_cmds</code> commands.</li>
  <li>More accurate and helpful information provided by the <code>ls</code> and <code>show_source</code> commands.</li>
  <li>Experimental autocompletion using type analysis (<a href="https://github.com/ruby/irb#type-based-completion">doc</a>).</li>
  <li>It is now possible to change the font color and font style in the completion dialog by a newly introduced class Reline::Face (<a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/reline/face.md">doc</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, IRB has also undergone extensive refactoring and received dozens of bug fixes to facilitate easier future enhancements.</p>

<h2>Compatibility issues</h2>

<p>Note: Excluding feature bug fixes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>it</code> calls without arguments in a block with no ordinary parameters are
deprecated. <code>it</code> will be a reference to the first block parameter in Ruby 3.4.
<a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18980">[Feature #18980]</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Removed environment variables</h3>

<p>The following deprecated methods are removed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environment variable <code>RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS</code> has been deprecated and is a no-op. Please use environment variables <code>RUBY_GC_HEAP_{0,1,2,3,4}_INIT_SLOTS</code> instead. <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19785">[Feature #19785]</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stdlib compatibility issues</h2>

<h3><code>ext/readline</code> is retired</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We have <code>reline</code> that is pure Ruby implementation compatible with <code>ext/readline</code> API. We rely on <code>reline</code> in the future. If you need to use <code>ext/readline</code>, you can install <code>ext/readline</code> via rubygems.org with <code>gem install readline-ext</code>.</li>
  <li>We no longer need to install libraries like <code>libreadline</code> or <code>libedit</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Standard library updates</h2>

<p>RubyGems and Bundler warn if users do <code>require</code> the following gems without adding them to Gemfile or gemspec. This is because they will become the bundled gems in the future version of Ruby.</p>

<p>This warning is suppressed if you use bootsnap gem. We recoomend to run your application with <code>DISABLE_BOOTSNAP=1</code> environmental variable at least once. This is limitation of this version.</p>

<ul>
  <li>abbrev</li>
  <li>base64</li>

The leak also revealed data related to Bully 2 and the next Grand Theft Auto title codenamed Project Americas.</p><p>As can be seen in the aforementioned post, @SKizzleAXE even shared a screenshot of the leaked GTA 5 source code, confirming the legitimacy of the report.

TL;DR:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Much of my time for the past year has been spent navigating the medical maze on behalf of my mother, who has dementia.</li>
<li>I observe that American health care organizations can no longer operate systematically, so participants are forced to act in the communal mode, as if in the pre-modern world.</li>
<li>Health care is one leading edge of a general breakdown in systematicity—while, at the same time, employing sophisticated systematic technologies.</li>
<li>Communal-mode interpersonal skills may become increasingly important to life success—not less, as techies hope.</li>
<li>For complex health care problems, I recommend hiring a consultant to provide administrative (not medical!) guidance.</li>

<h2 id="system">No system</h2>
<p>My mother’s mild dementia began accelerating rapidly a year ago. I’ve been picking up pieces of her life as she drops them. That has grown from a part-time job to a full-time job. In the past month, as she’s developed unrelated serious medical issues, it’s become a way-more-than-full-time job.</p>
<p>The most time-consuming aspect has been coordinating the dozens of different institutions involved in her care. I had read that the biggest failing of the American health care system is its fragmentation; I’ve now spent hundreds of hours observing that first-hand.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, no system. There are systems, but mostly they don’t talk to each other. I have to do that.</p>
<p>It’s been fascinating watching people working in hospitals and medical offices trying and failing to communicate with each other. I’ll tell one story, and then explain a pattern. This is the most dramatic instance I’ve encountered so far, but is typical in form.</p>
<p>The short version is that at least seven experts spent roughly ten full-time days trying to find out a basic fact about my mother’s insurance, and finally failed. Meanwhile, many thousands of dollars were wasted on unnecessary hospitalization.</p>
<p>This is a stark example of <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/">medical cost disease</a>, but the post is not about that. It’s about how institutions fail to talk to each other—and what that implies about our future.</p>
<p>(If the story gets boring, you can <a href="#interface">skip ahead</a> to my interpretation of the pattern.)</p>
<p>My mother went into the hospital a month ago with severe pain in her hip. (It’s still undiagnosed.) After two days, she was medically ready for discharge from the hospital: whatever the pain was, it wasn’t one they could help with. Instead, she should be sent to a “skilled nursing facility” (SNF) where she’d get “physical therapy,” i.e.&nbsp;leg exercises.</p>
<p>For a SNF to agree to take her, they had to get confirmation from an insurance company that insurance would cover her stay. She has two kinds of health insurance, Medicare plus coverage through a private insurer (Anthem). Which would cover her? Or both, or neither?</p>
<p>SNFs have admissions officers, whose full-time job is to answer this question. Two different SNFs started working on the problem. I talked with the admissions people every day. Both claimed to be working on it more-or-less full-time. The hospital wanted to free up my mother’s bed, so their insurance person was also working on it.</p>
<p>Days passed. The hospital doctor on rounds said “Well, this is typical, especially with Anthem. It’s costing them several thousand dollars a day to keep her here, versus a few hundred dollars a day in a SNF, but it might take a week for them to figure out which local SNF they cover. Don’t worry, they’ll sort it out eventually.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I learned that Anthem and Medicare were confused about their relationship. (As far as I can tell, this was a coincidence and not the underlying problem, although I’m still not sure.) Medicare believed that my mother (who retired in 1997) is employed and therefore ineligible. Her Anthem coverage is through her former employer.</p>
<p>I talked with her ex-employer’s benefits person (whose full-time job is understanding insurance, pretty much). She looked into it and said she couldn’t understand what was going on. She called the company’s outside insurance consultant. He couldn’t understand what was going on. He called people he knew at Medicare and Anthem. He said that they couldn’t understand it either, but that multiple people in both organizations were working on straightening it out.</p>
<p>A week later, I called Medicare to verify that it worked. The surprisingly competent customer service person looked up my mother’s info and said: “This is really weird… I don’t know what’s going on… there was a record that said Anthem is primary. And then on November 16th, there’s a note that said it’s deleted, and Medicare is primary. But then there’s an update on the 18th that says Anthem is primary. But obviously since your mother is 84 she’s not employed, so Medicare should be primary… I’ll delete the record again…”</p>
<p>After three days of trying, one of the SNFs gave up. I talked to the admissions dude there. I’ll call him Paul. He was smart and friendly, and he was willing to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My full-time job for ten years has been understanding how to get insurance to pay us, and I have no idea how the system works. Even if I somehow learned how it works, it changes completely every year, and I would have to start over. But at most of the insurance companies I know people who can sometimes make things happen, so I call them up, and then they try to figure out how it works. But Anthem… I spent hours and hours on hold, and in phone trees, getting transferred from one department to another, and eventually back to where I started. The most clueful-sounding person I could find sent me to a web site that just says ‘This program is not implemented yet.’ Does ‘program’ mean software, or does it mean some project they haven’t got going?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hospitals are bad places that make you ill; you don’t want to spend any more time there than you have to. On day six, I said “if she doesn’t go to a SNF today, I’m taking her home—the risk of her dying there seems less now than the risk of her dying here.” That got results: the other SNF agreed to take her “on spec.” Their admissions person was reasonably confident that either Anthem or Medicare would pay, even though neither was willing to say either yes or no ahead of time.</p>
<p>The SNF called me to tell me they needed my mother’s records from the hospital. Well, what do you want <em>me</em> to do about that? We need you to call the hospital and ask them to fax us the records. “Fax”? Why not send clay tablets in wicker baskets on the back of a donkey?</p>
<h2 id="interface">No interface</h2>
<p>To ship a package by FedEx, you don’t need to call someone who knows someone who knows someone. You go to a web site, put in some numbers, it gives you back some numbers, you put them on the envelope, drop it in a box, and it appears at a farmhouse on an island in Lapland the next day.</p>
<p>If Amazon sends you the wrong type of cable adapter, you don’t have to call them up and try to act pathetic and virtuous in order to convince someone that you need and deserve a refund because your poor mother is so ill. You go to a web site and push a button.</p>
<p>FedEx and Amazon have <em>systematic interfaces</em>. They are transparent on the outside, and black boxes on the inside. You don’t have to know anything about how they operate in order to use them.</p>
<p>Health care organizations are—at best—the opposite. They may run on systems internally, but the interface is opaque. There’s no defined way to get them to do something.</p>
<p>This is not their fault.</p>
<h2 id="fault">No fault</h2>
<p>I was trying to get my mother into a SNF—but all I could do was talk to Paul, who couldn’t say yes or no. It wasn’t his fault. He was trying to talk to people at Anthem, who couldn’t say yes or no. Was that their fault?</p>
<p>Just speculating, I imagine they are supposed to apply 1600 pages of rules for what’s covered in what situation. And the rules are vague and conflicting and change constantly, and who can read 1600 pages of rules anyway? So eventually someone has to make up a yes-or-no answer on the basis of what seems more-or-less reasonable. Whoever it is could get blamed if someone higher up later decides that was “wrong” based on their interpretation of the rules, so it’s better to pass the buck.</p>
<p>Are the confused rules Anthem’s fault? I imagine that the 1600 pages try to reconcile federal, state, and local legislation, plus the rules of three federal regulatory agencies, nine state agencies, and fifteen local agencies. All those are vague and conflicting and constantly changing, but Anthem’s rule-writing department does their best. They call the agencies to try to find out what the regulations are supposed to mean, and they spend hours on hold, are transferred from one official to another and back, and eventually get directed to a .gov web site that says “program not implemented yet.” Then they make something up, and hope that when the government sues Anthem, they don’t get blamed for it personally.</p>
<p>I imagine people working in legislative offices and regulatory agencies find themselves in a similar position.</p>
<p>In this maze, even competent people with good intentions cannot act systematically. Their work depends on coordinating with other institutions that have no systematic interface.</p>
<h2 id="ruins">Traditional life in the ruins of systematicity</h2>
<p>It’s like one those post-apocalyptic science fiction novels whose characters hunt wild boars with spears in the ruins of a modern city. Surrounded by machines no one understands any longer, they have reverted to primitive technology.</p>
<p>Except it’s in reverse. Hospitals can still operate modern material technologies (like an MRI) just fine. It’s social technologies that have broken down and reverted to a medieval level.</p>
<p><a href="https://vividness.live/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence#systematic">Systematic social relationships</a> involve formally-defined roles and responsibilities. That is, “professionalism.” But across medical organizations, there are none. Who do you call at Anthem to find out if they’ll cover an out-of-state SNF stay? No one knows.</p>
<p>What do you do when systematicity breaks down? You revert to what I’ve described as the “<a href="https://vividness.live/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence#communal">communal mode</a>” or “<a href="https://meaningness.com/choiceless-mode">choiceless mode</a>.” That is, “pre-modern,” or “traditional” ways of being.</p>
<p>Working in a medical office is like living in a pre-modern town. It’s all about knowing someone who knows someone who knows someone who can get something done. Several times, I’ve taken my mother to a doctor who said something like: “She needs lymphedema treatment, and the only lymphedema clinic around here is booked months in advance, but I know someone there, and I think I can get her in next week.” Or, “The pathology report on this biopsy is only one sentence, and it’s unsigned. The hospital that faxed it to me doesn’t know who did it. I need details, so I called all the pathologists I know, and none of them admit to writing it, so we are going to need to do a new biopsy.”</p>
<p>But at the same time, each clinic <em>does</em> have an electronic patient records management system, which does work some of the time. And there <em>are</em> professional relationships with defined roles that operate effectively within the building.</p>
<p>I suspect increasing “patchiness” of systems may be typical of our post-systematic <a href="https://meaningness.com/atomized-mode">atomized era</a>. Understanding the medical case may help predict the texture of cultural and social life as atomization proceeds.</p>
<p>A central research topic in ethnomethodology is the relationship between formal rationality (such as an insurance company’s 1600 pages of unworkable rules) and “mere reasonableness,” which is what people mostly use to get a job done. The disjunction between electronic patient records and calling around town to try to find out who wrote a biopsy report that arrived by fax seems sufficiently extreme that it may produce a qualitatively new way of being.</p>
<p>I would like to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does health care continue to function <em>at all</em>?</li>
<li>Can it <em>continue</em> to function at all?</li>
<li>How do people within the ex-system navigate a world that mashes up high-tech infrastructure that only sometimes works with pre-modern social relationships across organizations?</li>
<li>How do they understand this contrast? How do they cope personally?<sup id="fn_mark_1"><a href="#fn_1" title="I imagine for many it’s awful. “Communal” sounds “nice,” but most are in medicine because they want to help others, and they can’t get their jobs done when the system breaks down.">1</a></sup></li>
<li>What can we do about it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe an ethnomethodological understanding of how health care organizations operate in practice could make the systems work incrementally better. Maybe an enlightened COO could incorporate the view that the systems and reality are only vaguely related. But… it may be impossible to improve individual organizations.</p>
<h2 id="fix">No local fix</h2>
<p>It’s obvious how to fix health care. Just make everything run systematically, like FedEx or Amazon. There are no technical or business obstacles to this. Anyone who understands IT and/or business can see how to do it.<sup id="fn_mark_2"><a href="#fn_2" title="Step 1: Throw away the ubiquitous fax machines. Sink or swim. Hire donkeys if necessary.">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Back-of-envelope calculations say a working health care system would deliver dramatically better quality at 10-20% of the current cost.</p>
<p>Health care is notionally a profit-driven free market. This looks like an easy opportunity to make trillions of dollars by making the world better for everyone. Why doesn’t someone do that?</p>
<p>It appears that 73% of the labor cost of a health care organization is spent on trying to communicate with other health care organizations that have no defined interface.<sup id="fn_mark_3"><a href="#fn_3" title="The number 73% is my dazed estimate based on informal observation and analysis conducted in doctors’ examination rooms.">3</a></sup> Patrick Collison <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/937514552308113408">has suggested</a> calling this pattern “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-inefficiency">Leibenstein’s Inefficiency</a> Disease,” by analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol’s Cost Disease</a>. An organization can’t improve the 73% by much on its own; that inefficiency is forced on it by the environment it operates in.</p>
<p>Instead, organizations in sectors afflicted with inefficiency disease try to push their own administrative work outside. Both out into other organizations, and—more visibly—they force it onto you, the customer. It’s <em>your</em> job to fill out forms they could have done more efficiently themselves. When they screw up, <em>you</em> have to try to fix it. This negative externality could be called “paperwork pollution,” by analogy with negative externalities of smokestack industries.</p>
<p>Standardizing an interface between health care providers and insurance companies would be a huge win. No matter how badly designed, it would be better than the current mess, and save several percent of US GDP. That would need cooperation from most of the major players in the industry. Other industries manage that routinely: machine screws and futures contracts come in standard sizes, without which manufacturing and finance would be as inefficient as health care. The need for a standard insurer/provider interface is obvious. Since it’s lacking, I imagine some powerful group extracts enormous rents from the inefficiency. I know nothing about that, so I won’t speculate.</p>
<h2 id="village">You will need village life skills</h2>
<p>Perhaps American health care is a bellwether model for the future of other aspects of life in the post-systemic world? A pattern that occurs in many other sectors: as systems fail, people fall back on innate communal logic. Politics and the media are obvious current examples.</p>
<p>The hope of the tech industry is that “<a href="https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software is eating the world</a>,” as Marc Andreessen put it in 2011. That is, we’re FedEx-izing every aspect of the economy: making it radically more efficient and reliable, using well-designed IT-supported systematic business processes.</p>
<p>In that world, systematic-mode skills (especially programming and finance) will be ever more valuable. Hooray! We will create a utopia for all, in which (for once) those of us with high-functioning autism get properly rewarded.</p>
<p>In 2017, software is conspicuously not eating the cost-disease economic sectors: health care, education, housing, government. They are being eaten—by communal mode tribalism.</p>
<p>In 2017, tribalists are threatening to eat the tech industry.</p>
<p>There’s a possible future in which all systems fall to tribalism. Then everyone dies, because <a href="https://meaningness.com/counterculture-war">tribal signaling</a> does not deliver electric power. In another possible future, we create a meta-systematic society that addresses the inherent defects of both tribalism and systematicity. (I discussed both these possibilities tangentially in “<a href="https://metarationality.com/stem-fluidity-bridge">A bridge to meta-rationality vs.&nbsp;civilizational collapse</a>.” I hope to write more soon.)</p>
<p>In the short run, more likely, current trends will continue. Additional aspects of life will increasingly revert to the communal mode, but some critical systems will fend off the barbarians and limp along well enough to keep us alive.</p>
<p>In that world, people skills will be ever more valuable. Surviving and thriving in 2037 may depend mainly on who you can charm, who you know, and whether they owe you favors.</p>
<p>Techies take note.</p>
<p>You might consider working in a medical office, to get some practice.</p>
<h2 id="consultant">Hire a consultant</h2>
<p>Some more-serious, practical advice:</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation like mine, hire an independent health care administration consultant. Their job is to know administrative people inside organizations who can get stuff done. They also know what <em>can</em> be gotten done, which is unknowable to the public. They can also deal with inscrutable paperwork and organizational screw-ups.</p>
<p>Hiring someone became imperative for me when coordinating my mother’s care got to be a way-more-than-full-time job. (In retrospect, I wish I had done that months earlier.)</p>
<p>It could also be worthwhile in less critical cases, if no one in the family can take enough time off from work, or in which you’d simply rather pay someone else to clean up after a hospital’s paperwork pollution.</p>
<p>This role has developed only recently, as systems have broken down. There’s not yet a standardized term; “health care advocate” is one among several.</p>
<p>Mine specializes in gerontology and dementia. Others specialize in other disease areas; or in other aspects of the administrative nightmare, such as sorting out bogus hospital bills, which frequently include fraudulent additions.</p>
<p>They are not inexpensive (mine charges $150/hour), so not an option for everyone.</p>
<p>There are good and not-so-good advocates. I spoke with several before hiring one. Some were clearly clueless; the one I hired last month has seemed consistently competent.</p>
<p>Since they recommend particular providers, there is an inherent principal-agent problem. Ask if they get any compensation from services they recommend. Take their recommendations with a grain of salt in any case.</p>

   <h3><br>Summary</h3>
   <p>This report is mainly based on the comprehensive benchmark used to verify performance of the first Cray 1. This comprises the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory  program kernels (aka Livermore Loops), that provides a range of Millions of Floating Point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS) measurements. In this case, results from my 1990s conversion to all C code are used. 
   </p><p>To support these performance ratings, results are also considered from two similar vintage benchmarks. These are the Linpack and Whetstone benchmarks. The first is linpack-pc.c, my accepted conversion for PCs, available at Netlib. For the second, I took over design responsibility from Harold Curnow, the original author, 
   and developed enhanced variations, including one with 100% vectorisation, the initial target being the first Cray 1 system delivered to the UK. 
   </p><p>A selection of available results is provided to demonstrate performance variations and comparisons over the years. Other important issues can be considered, based on the information provided in my first Raspberry Pi report.  
   </p><p>"In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1"
   </p><p><b>Background Activities</b> - This provides details of my involvement in evaluating, acceptance testing and benchmarking mainframe and supercomputer systems for UK Government and University projects, including hands-on Cray 1 program development of benchmarks and stress tests..
   </p><p><b>Results Provided</b> -  Livermore Loops MFLOPS minimum, geometric mean (official average) and maximum, Linpack MFLOPS, Whetstone overall MWIPS and average MFLOPS of appropriate tests. These are all single core benchmarks. 
   </p><p><b>Raspberry Pi ARM CPUs</b> - The comment above was for the 2012 Pi 1. In 2020, the Pi 400 average Livermore Loops, Linpack and Whetstone MFLOPS reached <b>78.8, 49.5 and 95.5 times</b> faster than the Cray 1.
   </p><p><b>Android ARM CPUs</b> - 2012 Android tablet results  identified Cray 1 gains  with a range from barely there up to 10 times. My 2021 mid priced phone produced MFLOPS gains of <b>123, 74 and 151 times</b>.
   </p><p><b>Windows and Linux PCs Intel CPUs</b> - The first PC to reach the average Cray 1 Livermore Loops score is indicated as a 1994 100 MHz Pentium. Best results for the original benchmarks are for a medium range laptop with a 2021 11th generation 4150 MHz Core i5 CPU. The the three MFLOPS gains were <b>117,  131 and 134 times</b>.  
   </p><p><b>Advanced SIMD</b> compilations lead to i5 gains of <b>359, 337 and 226 times</b>.
   </p><p><b>Multiprogramming Livermore Loops</b> - Four copies of the Advanced SIMD Livermore Loops Benchmark were run at the same time. This resulted in a MFLOPS throughput gain of <b>1134 times</b>.
   </p><p><b>Vector Whetstones</b> - This single core benchmark uses large data arrays that produce 100% vectorisation for all test functions and was produced to benchmark the first UK Cray 1. Results are included for thirteen 1978 to 1991 supercomputers. For this benchmark, Single and Double Precision (SP and DP) versions are available, the latter could be appropriate for comparison with supercomputer longer words. Top SP and DP MFLOPS measurements for the <b>Core i5</b> were <b>602 and 433 times</b> faster than Cray 1.
   </p><p><b>Multithreading MP Whetstones</b> - Results are provided essentially from running multiple copies of the mainly scalar version of the Whetstone benchmark, using 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads, via a single program. It highlights complications  due to varying CPU MHz, according to the number of threads, and benefits of PC Hyperthreading. Single and double precision versions were run, in this case obtaining similar performance. Eight thread throughput gains over the Cray 1  were <b>Raspberry Pi 400 times</b>, <b>Android phone 757 times</b> and <b>Core i5 laptop 1521 times</b>.
   </p><div><p><b>MP MFLOPS</b> - This executes combinations of floating point multiplications and additions handling SP or DP variables, intended to demonstrate near maximum performance, again from a single program. For Intel, assembly code listings are provided for the normally fastest test. Based on the mix of floating point operations, an estimate of Cray 1 maximum speed, running these, is reduced from 160 MFLOPS to 122. The <b>Core i5 laptop</b> gains, over the revised Cray 1 maximum rating, were <b>SP 2671 and DP 1317 times</b> via <b>326 and 161 GFLOPS</b>.

   Gains on the other devices were <b>Android phone SP 293 times</b> and <b>Raspberry Pi SP 247 times</b>, both at greater than <b>30 GFLOPS</b>. 
   This benchmark has a run time parameter to use up to 64 threads that should demonstrate far superior performance of more advanced CPUs.

   <h3><br>Background Activities</h3>
   <b>Reliability Studies</b> - I worked for the UK Government  Central Computer Agency from 1960, initially analysing fault returns that were contractually required for all new systems.  These provided the first detailed statistics included in my book �Computer System Reliability� published in 1980. I also provided assistance in running acceptance tests, gathering similar information, over the years, for inclusion in my book. 
   <p> 
 
   <a name="anchor2"></a>
 <b><br>Acceptance Trials and First Supercomputer Involvement</b> - During the late 1960s, with 20 staff, I became  in charge of all acceptance trials, taking personal responsibility for top of the range computers. This included organising and supervising trials the UK Atlas 2 for Cambridge University Mathematical Laboratory, the 1962 earlier version said to be the most powerful supercomputer in the world.
  </p><p>

   <a name="anchor2a"></a>
  <b><br>Scientific Systems Evaluation and Acceptance Trials</b> - In the 1970s and early 1980s, with up to 15 staff,  I covered evaluating and acceptance testing of scientific systems, with continuing  responsibility for design and acceptance trial supervision of the larger systems. Between 1972 and 1973 these included an IBM 360/195 for UK Met Office  and a CDC 7600 for ULCC (University of London), again said to be the current fastest supercomputers. 
   </p><p>

  <a name="anchor3"></a>
  <b><br>Stress Testing Programs</b> - In order to stress test all computers, during acceptance tests and under Operating Systems, I produced a range of Fortran programs, a few for testing CPUs, with others covering everything from paper tape punches to disk drives. These had parameters to run for extended periods and were used during hundreds of acceptance tests from 1972 up until the 1990s. The tests included the Whetstone benchmark, produced by my CCTA colleague Harold Curnow and the first accepted general purpose computer benchmark. I collected running times of most programs for use in performance evaluation. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor4"></a>
  <b><br>Met Seymour Cray</b> - It must have been 1969, when I was visiting Control Data manufacturing facility in Minnesota, that I was asked to visit Chippewa Falls in Wisconsin to witness a UK Met Office benchmark run on the CDC 7600. Then, I had a brief encounter with Seymour Cray, who appeared to run the benchmark. After setting it up, it was all over in a flash, with Seymour reported that it took not a lot of milliseconds. This influenced my later development of general purpose benchmarks to have have noticeable running times with ongoing displays of progress. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor5"></a>
  <b><br>External Consultancy</b> -  CCTA had contractual responsibility for handling procurement of centrally funded university computers, leading to me becoming an advisor to the Computer Board for Universities and Research Councils, and later a member of the Technical Sub-Group for Advanced Research Computers. In 1976,  I was appointed, as an expert from a Member State, to join a European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Committee, involving procurement of a new supercomputer, where a Cray 1 became the obvious choice. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor6"></a>
  <b><br>Hands-on Cray 1</b> - My detailed involvement in real supercomputers started in in 1978, including a second visit to Chippewa Falls to evaluate the Cray 1. This was followed by a pre-delivery factory trial, in 1979, for the new AWRE Aldermaston system.. Meanwhile, Cray 1 serial 1 was at the UK Rutherford Laboratory, where I converted all my appropriate test programs, and Whetstone benchmark, to use the new vector instructions. The on-site acceptance trials were carried out later in 1979, where the Cray 1 passed with flying colours. This was followed by the same factory and on-site testing procedures on serial 1 CDC Cyber 205 for UK Met Office, in 1981. That one failed its first factory trial due to my I/O stress testing program identifying a design fault. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor7"></a>
  <b><br>Collecting Performance Data</b> - Next, until my early retirement in 1993, I was mainly involved in performance consultancy of data processing systems, personally covering more than 60 projects. I also took over design responsibility for the Whetstone benchmark and continued consultancy on university procurements.  Starting during this period, I collected published details of computers, amounting to  more than 2000 mainframes, minicomputers, supercomputers and workstations, from around 120 suppliers.  I also continued  collecting Whetstone results, ending with more than 700  from 53 computer manufacturers, covering minicomputers, through mainframes, to supercomputers. 
  These provided the beginning for my ResearchGate reports, starting with

  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor8"></a>
  <b><br>Met Key Supercomputer Benchmark Authors</b> - As part of a university benchmark investigation team, I visited the USA in 1987, including to the creator of the Linpack range of benchmarks, Jack Dongarra in Tennessee, and to the Lawrence  Livermore Research Laboratory, who produced the Livermore Loops (Livermore Fortran Kernels) benchmark. This became the key supercomputer benchmark for a number of years. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor9"></a>
  <b><br>Influencing Supercomputer Choice</b> - In 1988, the Director of University of Manchester Regional Computer Centre requested my performance analysis of the two competing supercomputers, after being quoted by part of the evaluation team that I would support one of the proposals. I demonstrated the opposite choice, that was accepted, using results of my scalar and vector Whetstone benchmark results. This is based on a large number of users, where 90% of programs can be vectorised. Then, the one with the fastest maximum vector speed, but the lowest for scalar code, lost the battle.  
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor10"></a>
  <b><br>Benchmarking Supercomputers in Japan</b> - My last involvement in supercomputers was for a new one for University of London Computer Centre, over 1991 and 1992, when I became the independent observer of a benchmark, based on numerous real applications, at Fujitsu and NEC in Japan. My colleague dealt with Cray, in the USA, that won the contract with a Y-MP configuration. As confirmed with my simple scalar and vector Whetstone, that I ran then, it was really comparing multiple pipelines against multiple CPUs, each of the latter with scalar and vector processing capabilities.

 <a name="anchor12"></a>
 <h3><br>My PC Benchmarks</h3>
 <b>Classic Benchmarks</b> - Following retirement came part time consultancy and eventually creating my website (roylongbottom.org.uk) to house copies of performance data, collected during my CCTA days (with approval) and a range of benchmarks, initially concentrating on those for PCs, all for free with no adverts. The first, being detailed in my 
 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318987839_Classic_Computer_Benchmarks">Classic Benchmarks</a> 
 report, covering Whetstone, Dhrystone, Linpack 100 and Livermore Loops, using C/C++ compiled programs. Early PCs  had poor timer resolution, with benchmarks or functions requiring running times of 5 seconds for consistent performance. Other requirements included logging results in text files, checking output for consistent numeric results and, where possible, performance and results  displayed as the tests progressed.  
  Besides benchmark reports, identified below, I developed programs in assemly code, with reports now at ResearchGate in   
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319645485_PC_CPUID_1994_to_2013_plus_Measured_Maximum_Speeds_Via_Assembler_Code">PC CPUID 1994 to 2013, plus Measured Maximum Speeds via Assembler Code.pdf </a> and

  <p>

  <a name="anchor13"></a>
  <b><br>Netlib Involvement</b> - Other than for my Whetstone programs, the initial source code was obtained from Netlib, where my linpack-pc.c code, was later accepted and included, for use on PCs.   Livermore Loops conversion was time consuming, where C code was available for the calculations, but data generation, checking and other activities were in Fortran, that I converted to C. All these followed conversion routes from running under DOS, though variations of Windows, Linux, including Raspberry Pi, and Android, most at 32 bits and 64 bits. The majority of early results were collected through involvement  in Compuserve Benchmark and Standards Forum. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor14"></a>
  <b><br>Livermore Loops</b> - Results shown here are for the second version of this benchmark, comprising 24 loops. Besides MFLOPS measurements for each of these, summary minimum, maximum and various averages are produced, with geometric mean being the official average. During my visit to LLL, I was given a copy of the 1986 report �The Livermore Fortran Kernels: A Computer Test of the Numerical Performance Range�, with over 200 pages of results for minicomputers to supercomputers. The document appears to be available via Internet, but I never managed to obtain a free download. My ResearchGate report 
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319176194_Livermore_Loops_Benchmark_Results_On_PCs_and_Later_Devices_Roy_Longbottom"> Livermore Loops Benchmark Results On PCs and Later Devices.pdf</a>,   
  contains results  up to 2017. 
  As for the other Classic Benchmarks, later details are included in reports covering the different platforms.   
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor15"></a>
  <b><br>Linpack 100</b> - Performance of this original version of the benchmark is dependent on a function that simply calculates   dy[i] = dy[i] + da*dx[i]; but with too many overheads that prevent performance from approaching maximum possible. However, this can be compiled to use linked (fused) multiply and add instructions, such as available on the Cray 1 and later computers, particularly with SIMD vector capabilities. As for Livermore Loops, run on systems with smaller word sizes than Cray 1, it is compiled to use double precision arithmetic. Detailed results of this original version, and that for the later HPL variety for modern supercomputers, are available from Netlib in document

  is available from ResearchGate.
  </p><p>
  
  <a name="anchor16"></a>
  <b><br>Whetstone</b> - The current versions include the changes I made to produce performance ratings of each of the eight test functions, particularly to identify cases where some of the code was not being executed (deliberately by some, in the days of minicomputers). Here, the original overall MWIPS ratings are quoted, along with average MFLOPS for the three tests carrying out straightforward calculations.  Two other tests include functions such as SIN and LOG, where changes in maths libraries can significantly affect overall MWIPS.  This benchmark is based on simple code sequences used in the 1960s, where performance is more inclined to be proportional to CPU MHz until dramatic changed are made in hardware, like the introduction of additional instructions. 
  My ResearchGate report for this benchmark is

  </p><p>


  <a name="anchor17"></a> 
  <b><br>Vector Whetstone</b> - The vector version, converted for the Cray 1, executes the same functions as the scalar version, but covering a number of sequential memory locations, defined by a vector length parameter. Cray 1 performance achieved maximum performance at vector lengths of 64 words and above, with a sawtooth pattern . I have a previous unpublished C/C++ version that I ran on Raspberry Pi 400 and Windows and Linux based PCs, with results, at vector lengths of 256, being provided below. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor18"></a>
  <b><br>MP Whetstone</b> - None of the other benchmarks, covered here so far, exercise more than one CPU core. This MP benchmark currently executes 1, 2, 4 and 8 copies of the standard code via multithreading in a single program.   Some results are included to highlight  performance gains over the single CPU in the Cray 1. 
  </p><div><p><b><br>MP MFLOPS</b> - Results for this benchmark have been included for comparison with the maximum MFLOPS  possible on the Cray 1. The benchmark executes tests with 2, 8 and 32 floating point operations per data word, covering larger caches and RAM. Default operation uses 8 threads but can be changed, up to 64 threads, with a run time parameter. Description and earlier results are available in

  <h3><br>Detailed Results and Comparisons</h3>
  <b>Variations</b> - Results provided below, cover Livermore Loops, Linpack and Whetstone benchmarks. Note that the main Livermore report contains numerous results, covering different compilers and possibly hardware changes. As for the Whetstone benchmark, slow performance of single test functions can  severely impact overall ratings.  The chosen results represent my choice of typical performance. 
  <p>

  <a name="anchor21"></a> 
  <b><br>Cray 1</b> - The maximum possible hardware performance was said to be  160 MFLOPS for the 80 MHz Cray 1, comprising linked multiply and add, for two results per clock cycle. The LLL benchmark maximum shown is 82.1 MFLOPS with average 11.9 and minimum 1.2. Then Linpack and Whetstone are 27 and 6 MFLOPS, Linpack benefiting from  linked multiply and add. 
  </p><p>

  <a name="anchor22"></a> 
  <b><br>Raspberry Pi</b> - In 2013 I ran my benchmarks on the first version of Raspberry Pi. These were essentially the same as those used on PCs, under Linux. The programs included the Livermore Loops benchmark and that lead me including the following in a report. 
  </p><p>�In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1.� This refers to official average geometric mean results.
  </p><p>In 2019 (aged 84), I was invited to become a voluntary member of Raspberry Pi Foundation�s Alpha Testing Team, which I accepted. This lead to me running my benchmarks and stress tests on new top of the range systems before announcement. The supply of new hardware and software, so far, lead to me producing eight additional  PDF reports that are available from ResearchGate. See Project Log for 
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/project/Performance-of-Raspberry-Pi-and-Android-Devices">Performance of Raspberry Pi and Android Devices</a>. 
  Early results are included in the benchmark specific reports, identified above.

  </p><p>The following MFLOPS comparisons are in the order of Livermore Loops average. 
  </p><p><b>Comparison</b> - The three 700 MHz Pi 1 main measurements (Loops, Linpack and Whetstone) were 55, 42 and 94 MFLOPS, with the four gains over Cray 1 being  8.8 times for MHz and 4.6, 1.6, 15.7 times for MFLOPS.
  </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2">The 2020 1800 MHz Pi 400 provided  819, 1147 and 498 MFLOPS, with MHz speed gains of 23 times and 69, 42 and 83 times for MFLOPS. With more advanced SIMD options, the 64 bit compilation produced <b>Cray 1 MFLOPS gains of 78.8, 49.5 and 95.5 times</b>.

 <h3><br>Android</h3>
 In 2012, I converted my benchmarks to run via Android, in native ARM code, requiring Java front end programs. The latest versions identify the hardware, automatically running code for ARM or Intel CPUs,  under 32 bit or 64 bit Operating Systems. In the early days I obtained lots of results with similar performance, a sample of these being provided below. 
 <p><b>Comparison</b> - The first results were for tablets that did not have hardware or software to support fast floating point calculations. The earliest with appropriate facilities, from 2012, used the ARM Cortex-A9 processors, starting with 800 Mhz versions. This is indicated as having the three MFLOPS speeds of 20, 11 and 22, or at 10 times Cray 1 CPU MHz, with gains of 1.7, 0.4 and 3.7 in MFLOPS. 
 </p><p>A later 800 MHz V7-A9 obtained 115, 101 and 155 MFLOPS, or Cray 1 gains of  9.7,  3.7 and  25.8 times.

  </p><p>Fastest results provided are for a 2021 mid priced phone with a Kryo 570 CPU, said to be based on ARM Cortex-A77. At 2000 MHz, this  obtained an average LLL speed of 1468 MFLOPS, with Linpack at 1986 and 905 for Whetstone and <b>Cray 1 performance gains of 123, 74 and 151 times</b>, at 25 times CPU MHz.

  <h3><br>Windows Intel and AMD CPUs</h3>
  I developed my benchmarks for Intel CPUs in the 1990s, starting with DOS and OS/2. through varieties of Windows and Linux. The compiled benchmarks and source codes are all available for download via my PDF reports at ResearchGate. I received numerous results up to 2005. By 2013, my interests became ARM CPUs, with MHz of those from Intel not increasing sufficiently to show real improvements in performance of my single core benchmarks. Then, my 3.9 GHz CPU was close to maximum speed and, in 2021, this appears to have only reached 5.5 GHz, but now with 16 CPU cores.
  In order to obtain some up to date performance data, I bought a new laptop with a 11th  generation Core i5 CPU that runs at a maximum speed of 4.15 GHz.

  <p><b>Comparison</b> - Below are samples of results where details for the three benchmarks were available. The first PC to reach the average Cray 1 Livermore Loops score is indicated  as a 1994 100 MHz Pentium, shown as 12 MFLOPS, with Linpack and Whetstone at 12 and 16. This gives approximate Cray 1 comparisons of MHz and the three MFLOPS measurements  of  1.3, 1.0. 0.44 and 2.6 times.
  </p><p>PCs with faster Pentium processors  continued to produce performance proportional to CPU MHz, with improvements appearing with the 1995 Pentium Pro. At 200 MHz the three MFLOPS measurements were 34, 49 and 41 and four comparisons 2.5, 2.9, 1.8 and 6.8 times.
  </p><p>Next came various Pentium II and III models with improvements to these benchmarks mainly proportional to CPU MHz. Then the 2002 Pentium 4 is show to achieve 187	, 382 and 146 MFLOPS, but at 1700 MHz, producing the four Cray ` comparisons of  21, 16, 14 and 24 times, with decreases in MFLOPS per MHz, compared with earlier Pentiums. 
  </p><p>With alternative CPU technology, the per MHz ratio improved with a single core of a 1820 MHz 2007 Core 2 processor obtaining 413,	998 and 374 MFLOPS or Cray 1 improvements of 23, 35, 37 and 62 times.
  </p><p>The 2010 Core i7 range produced an improvement in MFLOPS per MHz, with the 3900 MHz 2013 model obtaining  1108, 2684 and 716 MFLOPS and comparisons 49, 93, 99 and 119 times. 
  </p><p>The 2021 laptop with a Core i5 1135G7 CPU provided further gains with a higher MFLOPS per MHz rating for Livermore Loops and Linpack but not much with Whetstone. MFLOPS identified were 1387, 3541 and 802, and <b>Cray 1 comparisons of 117, 131 and 134 times</b>.

  <h3><br>SIMD Windows and Linux PCs</h3>
  Following are results from running the benchmarks compiled with SSE, AVX and AVX-512 SIMD options.  These employ 128, 256  or 512 bit vector registers simultaneous operating on 4, 8 or 16 single precision (SP) and 2, 4 or 8 double precision (DP) numbers, historically stated as producing maximum SP performance of  4, 8 or 16 MFLOPS per MHz and half those for DP. With 100% fused multiply and add (FMA) type operations these maximum expectations would be doubled.  FMA was only available on the Core i5 laptop tested here.
  It should be noted that using fused operation can result in slightly different accuracy in computed results. The benchmarks report these as errors. See  <a href="#anchor28">Error Reports</a>.  Similar variations were encountered, in the past, using different versions of the compilers. 

  <p><b>Windows</b> benchmarks, used in this area, were lloops64.exe, linpack64.exe and whetsSSE.exe. These and source code files are included in 
 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roy-Longbottom/project/Cray-1-Supercomputer-Performance-Comparisons-With-Home-Computers-Phones-and-Tablets/attachment/620528acf5675b211b24214b/AS:1121950533455880@1644505260912/download/Windows-Benchmarks.zip?context=ProjectUpdatesLog">Windows-Benchmarks.zip </a>. 
 Compared with the earlier results, performance increased to achieve <b>Cray 1 MFLOPS gains of  238,  190  and  182 times</b>.  
 For this area, double precision Whetstone results are also shown to run at the same speed as the single precision version.

</p><p>I have had difficulties in using the latest C compilers for Windows, but a new bootable flash drive for Ubuntu 20.04 provided the compiler, enabling more advanced options to be used under Linux. The new  benchmarks were initially compiled on an older PC as it did not seem possible to boot the latest flash drive on my new Core i5 based laptop. For the latter, I installed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in order to compile and run the programs.  

 </p><p><b>Linux</b> - The first compilations under Linux were slightly faster than those from Windows. Those used here were compiled on the i5 laptop using the latest gcc 9.3.0 compiler, under Ubuntu. 
 Disassembly code was examined to show that SSE, AVX and AVX-512 instructions were being used, as appropriate. This cannot be guaranteed by relying on compile options.   These benchmarks can be downloaded in 
 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roy-Longbottom/project/Cray-1-Supercomputer-Performance-Comparisons-With-Home-Computers-Phones-and-Tablets/attachment/620640d6b3729f0f61a782fa/AS:1122251357335554@1644576982762/download/Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz?context=ProjectUpdatesLogProjectUpdatesLog">Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz</a>. 
 The first Linux results, using the AVX SIMD instructions, increased the three i5 Cray 1 gains to  300, 259 and 179 times.  AVX-512 hardware was only available on the Core i5 CPU, providing the three <b>MFLOPS gains of  359, 337 and 226 times</b>. 

 </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2">The table provides MFLOPS per MHz calculations for Livermore Loops average and maximum results. A major surprise is that the latter for SSE and AVX, of 3.56 and 4.77 were higher than recognised maximum double precision ratios,  without FMA, of 2.0 and 4.0. This also applied for SSE for the Core i7 at 3.05. The AVX-512 FMA 47692 MFLOPS ratio of 11.49 suggests significant FMA was being used.

 The following is a summary of the range of results on the 2021 Core i5, to show the impact of compilers that support newer technology. Note that trying to run the AVX-512 variety on earlier CPUs, without this option, results in an program failure report. 
 The No SSE results are from <a href="#anchor24">the earlier table</a>.

  <h3><br>Vector Whetstone Benchmark</h3>
  Below are details of supercomputer Whetstone Scalar and Vector benchmark results included in my ResearchGate 
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318755466_Whetstone_Benchmark_History_and_Results">Whetstone Benchmark History and Results</a>  
  report. Details of the vector program version are included 
  <a href="#anchor17">above</a>. 
  As far as I remember, all these results are from systems using a single scalar CPU, possibly with more than one vector pipeline. Cray was the first manufacturer to produce systems with multiple scalar CPUs but it is not clear if any of the others followed this line in the timescale considered. 
  From the details here, both Cray Y-MP MHz clock speed and scalar MFLOPS are indicated as around twice as fast as Cray 1, with vector MFLOPS four times faster, the system having two vector units.

 <h3><br>MP Whetstone Benchmark</h3>
 Previous results compared Cray 1 performance with single CPU cores on the later systems.  
 Here we consider possible implication of using multiple cores, using this benchmark that effectively represents 1, 2, 4 and 8 users concurrently executing the same application, but using different data. 

 Details shown are overall MWIPS ratings, the three MFLOPS measurements, overall harmonic mean MFLOPS, recorded running times, MFLOPS performance gains over the Cray 1 and MFLOPS per MHz ratios for single core activity. 
 Note nominal running time varies due to rough calibration of the number of passes to use.
 The benchmark is also included in

 <p><b>Phenom, Windows 7</b> - This demonstrates almost perfect speed gains using 1 to 2 and 2 to 4 cores, with no further increase using 8 threads.
 </p><p><b>Core i7 Desktop</b> - This can use 4 cores or 8 independent threads at the same time. This application appeared to demonstrate  near best case performance gains using 8 threads.
 </p><p><b>Core i5 Laptop</b> - Performance Monitor indicated that this ran at around 4150 MHz using 1 and 2 threads, but reduced to about 3800 MHz for 4 and 8 threads.
 </p><p><b>Windows vs Linux</b> - Average MFLOPS performance was quite similar, on both the i7 and i5 PCs,  at the lower level of optimisation shown here. 
 </p><p><b>Single vs Double Precision</b> - Results indicated similar performance, as expected from scalar operation. 
 </p><p><b>PC Performance Gains</b> - some of the Core i7 speeds were faster than on the i5. For the latter, eight thread  <b>Cray 1 MFLOPS gains were  1521 times</b>.

 </p><p><b>Android Phone</b> - The Kryo 570 CPU has out-of-order execution, maybe responsible for the highest MFLOPS per MHz ratio of 0.42. 
 But maximum performance of the big/LITTLE CPU arrangement, of 2 fast and 6 slow cores, lead to 8 core performance being only 5 times faster than than for 1 core. Still, the <b>Cray 1 gain was 757 times</b>.
 </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Raspberry Pi 400</b> - As might be expected, performance of this quad core system produced the same elapsed time using 1, 2 and 4 threads, and a little bit extra with 8 threads. <b>Maximum Cray 1 gain was 400 times</b>.

 <h3><br>MP MFLOPS Linux - Intel Single Precision Results</h3>
 The benchmark aims at producing maximum measured performance of floating point operation for comparison with the theoretically possible 160 MFLOPS on Cray 1.  Here, a Linux benchmark is used, running SSE and AVX Intel SIMD instructions 
 (in 
 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roy-Longbottom/project/Cray-1-Supercomputer-Performance-Comparisons-With-Home-Computers-Phones-and-Tablets/attachment/620640d6b3729f0f61a782fa/AS:1122251357335554@1644576982762/download/Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz?context=ProjectUpdatesLogProjectUpdatesLog">Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz</a>). 
 
 <p>Calculations are carried out  of the form x[i] = (x[i] + a) * b - (x[i] + c) * d + (x[i] + e) * f with 2, 8 or 32 operations per input data word. In each case, accessing 102400, 1024000 and 10240000 data words, covering caches and RAM. Up to 64 threads can be used, each using a dedicated segment of the data, default being 8 threads. Data is checked  for consistent values at the end.  
 </p><p>Below are measured MFLOPS using 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads for the Core i7 and i5 computers, executing SSE and AVX instructions, plus AVX-512 on the i5. As for MP Whetstones, performance improvements, from doubling the number of threads (MP Gains), are shown to be non-linear  for the Core i5 laptop. 
 </p><p>Single core MFLOPS per MHz ratios are also shown. Maximum single precision expectations, without FMA instructions, are  4 for SSE and 8 for AVX and 16 for AVX-512, then 32 for the latter, where FMA is used. Then double precision operation  expectations are half these values. 
 </p><p>It can be seen that, for both i7 and i5,  SSE and AVX MFLOPS/MHz ratios were higher than these. I have been unable to identify the reason for these  levels of performance, without FMA type instructions being used. 
 For further information see 
 <a href="#anchor29a">Faster Than Expected</a> 
 below.
 </p><p>AVX-512  MFLOPS per MHz  was less than 32, one reason being that all instructions were not of the FMA variety, as shown in code disassemblies, shown <a href="#anchor27c">below</a>. These  indicate that the highest expected speed achievable by the FMA code is just over 76% of maximum with complete FMA instructions, or 24.4 MFLOPS/MHz, close to that obtained.
 </p><p>The performance adjustment is also shown to produce a likely reduction in Cray 1 maximum speed to 122 MFLOPS, executing these functions. The maximum Core i5 <b>single precision</b> speed of  <b>325915 MFLOPS</b> indicates a <b>Cray 1 gain of 2671 times</b>. 
 Maximum <b>double precision</b> result, from the next page, was <b>160641 MFLOPS</b> with a <b>gain of 1317 times</b>. 
 </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2">Also <b>single precision results</b> on the next page indicate maximum 8 thread speed on <b>Raspberry Pi of  30150 MFLOPS</b> or <b>Cray 1 gain of 247 times</b> and <b>Android phone at 35686 MFLOPS</b> or <b>gain of 293 times</b>, both at Intel SSE SIMD level.

 <h3><br>MP MFLOPS 2 - Intel DP, Android and Raspberry Pi SP</h3>
 The first columns in this table, provide Core i7 and Core i5 double precision MP MFLOPS results, using. 1 and 8 threads. Calculations below show that performance at 32 operations per word, and other high performing areas, was effectively at half single precision speed, as expected with SIMD. The lower ratios probably reflect half speed double precision calculations and overheads dealing with 64 bit numbers. 
<p>
Single precision results are also included for the 2000 MHz Kryo 570 Android phone and 1800 MHz Raspberry Pi 400. 
For these, SIMD level used is equivalent to Intel SSE. 
 Worse than MP Whetstone, this time the Kryo 570, using 8 threads,  was only three times faster than during the single thread test. Then, a CPU monitoring app indicated that six cores were running at 1804 MHz, with two at 768  MHz.

 <h3>MP Livermore Loops</h3>
 Four copies of the Livermore Loops Benchmark were run at the same time on the i5 laptop, with a longer  parameter for seconds per loop, each program running for around 15 minutes. Using all cores lead to the usual reduction in CPU MHz, but there may have been more throttling to counteract heating effects.  Single thread (Geomean) official  average speed was  4273 MFLOPS, compared with a per thread  average of 3375 here. However, the total throughput of  13500 MFLOPS indicates an <b>increase over Cray 1 of  1134 times</b>.

 <h3>MP MFLOPS 4 to 64 Threads</h3>
 As indicated earlier, MP MFLOPS benchmark can handle up to 64 threads, with an execution command under LINUX  (such as ./MPmflops64AVX512 Threads 64). For correct operation, the specified number must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64. 
 Following are results on the i5 between 4 and 64 threds. These show that performance can be significantly improved using additional threads, the reason is due to data being allocated to a faster lower level cache.

 <h3><br>Performance Summary</h3>
 Following is a summary of most results, intended to show best case performance gains, over the Cray 1, for different classes of work.  
 Considering the Core i5 details, the first four are for programs that only use (or are intended to use) a single CPU core. The main one for Cray 1 comparison being Livermore Loops average. Linpack is the only one that provides a single measurement. Whetstones identify relative performance of scalar and vector processing. 
 As for MP benchmarks, vector single and double precision results are provided. The former can be used for comparison with those produced via the long word used by Cray, if the numeric accuracy is acceptable. 
 <p>The MP benchmark results can be used to represent multiple users running the same program or a single program executing multiple threads, each handling a dedicated segment of shared data. Again for the Core i5,  MP Whetstone MFLOPS were similar for double and single precision versions, with little opportunity for vectorisation.
 The simpler Whetstone calculations demonstrate the benefit of hyperthreading  with the 4 core, 8 thread throughput being nearly seven times faster than the standalone run. 
 On the other hand, MP MFLOPS suffered from the i5 running at a lower MHz  when four cores were being used, leading to 8 thread performance being less than four times faster than via 1 thread. This benchmark identified the highest Cray 1 performance gains of over 2600 times for single precision calculations, but half of this at double precision.
 </p><p>On cost/performance grounds, the Raspberry Pi 400 was better than the Core i5 laptop, in some of the early cases, but worse on others,   then  fell far behind on benchmarks that could benefit from compilation using Intel Advanced Vector instructions. Compared with the Cray 1, MP performance gains of up to 400 times  were recorded.  
 </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2">Just considering performance of the Android phone, the more advanced ARM CPU used provided some significant gains over the Raspberry Pi, but lost the advantage, due to the big/LITTLE architecture,  on running the MP MFLOPS 8 thread test. Still, best Cray 1 performance gain was 757 times through using multiple cores.

 <h3>More Advanced Hardware</h3>
 Here, relative Cray 1 performance calculations, for Android devices and PCs, have been for mid range hardware. It is useful to consider apparent more powerful processors. 
 <p><b>CPU MHz</b> - In a given processing architecture,  performance is usually proportional to CPU MHz. This was clear in earlier times, when Pentium, Celeron and Xeon  processors had the same core processor. The above benchmarks were run on a Core i5 with maximum turbo speed of 4150 MHz  and an ARM CPU at 2000 MHz.  The latest 2022 processors appear to be rated at up to 5500 MHz for PCs and 3000 MHz for ARM based phones. These would affect the single core benchmarks but not excessively.
 </p><p><b>Multiple Cores</b> - At least for the laptop and phone used here, full benefits of multiple cores were not apparent. The laptop switched to a lower MHz and the phone�s 8 core big/LITTLE  processor maximum performance became not much better than the 4 core Raspberry Pi. Performance appears to be becoming even more unpredictable. The latest (that I have seen)  - Intel 24 threads over 16 cores, 8 at up to 5.1 GHz  and  8 to  3.8 GHz.Then ARM  that has cores 1 at 3200 MHz, 3 at 2420 MHz and  4 at 1800 MHz. 
 </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2"><b>More Advanced CPU Options</b> - Some CPUs in the Core range have two 512-bit fused-multiply add (FMA) units that can, potentially, double SIMD performance of the right sort of application.  Judging by the improvement in adopting a higher level of SIMD here and consideration of heating effects, I would not bet on it.

 <h3><br>Disassembled Code</h3> 
 Disassembled code compiled to use AVX-512 and AVX instructions are listed below. The former includes vector fused multiply and add or subtract instructions. 
 With AVX-512 there are 21 arithmetic vector instructions and the expected 32  with AVX, the latter also applying for SSE code. Minimum instructions for full fused multiply and add type is 16, leading to  a  (16/21) 76.19% reduction in achievable speed.  This would lead the maximum Cray 1 MFLOPS for this code becoming 122, instead of 160.

 <b>Livermore Loops</b> benchmark displays details of results for each of the three times 24 sets of calculations. These include the final numeric results, whose values are included in the program and can vary slightly, depending on the hardware and compiler options.  The values under OK indicate  accuracy in terms of the number of decimal places, double precision numbers being said to be accurate up to 16 decimal places, but possibly subject to rounding errors. 
 </span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2">As indicated, there were differences in numeric results from the Core i5 laptop, with accuracy reducing from 15 or 16  decimal places to 12 or 13, using the AVX512 compile option.  Apparently, there is only one rounding for fused operations, as opposed to one for each separate instruction.

 <h3><br>Faster Than Expected</h3>
 The following is intended to show that it is not just my MP MFLOPS benchmark that provides performance levels higher than expected via compilations using SSE and AVX instructions, in this case dealing with  double precision variables.  The other benchmark considered is the naturally double precision Livermore Loops. In both cases, disassembled code was checked to ensure that there were no Fused Multiply and Add (FMA) type  instructions. Then, according to viewed documentation, maximum performance using SSE functions is 2.0 MFLOPS per MHz, using 128-bit xmm registers, and 4.0 using  256-bit AVX with ymm registers. 
 <p>Below, the Livermore Loops example shows the full displayed output for the kernel producing maximum MFLOPS, the source code with 16 floating point operations and compile commands used.
 The SSE example indicates 3.56 MFLOPS per MHz, thought to be impossible without FMA. The AVX results provide 4.86 MFLOPS per MHz 21.5% higher than expected maximum.
 </p><p>The same range of results, source code and compile options are provided for MP MFLOPS benchmark these combinations of instructions., running via a single thread. Looking at the first word size details, least likely to involve RAM data transfers, SSE 12437 to  16602 MFLOPS equates to 3.00 to 4.00 per MHz and AVX 14606 to 32420 MFLOPS at 3.53 to 7.81 per MHz. These ranges include Livermore Loops ratios,  but the larger ones are higher than might be expected using FMA, with the particular combination of instructions shown. 
 </p></span><p><span face="Verdana" size="2">Unexpected high  levels of performance were also produced on running the benchmarks on the much older Core i7 PC. Livermore Loops SSE maximum was 3.05 MFLOPS per MHz and 1 thread DP MP-MFLOPS with SSE 3.14 and AVX 5.87 MFLOPS per MHz.

<p>I’ve been buying a copy of <em>Maximum PC</em> magazine at the airport newsstand on every long-distance trip I’ve taken over the past two decades. I’m primarily a Mac user but <em>Maximum PC</em>, which started life as <em>boot</em>, bought at these intervals kept me comfortably up to date on the state of affairs in the PC hardware world. Thumbing through these issues a few times a year, I got an overall feel for what was the state of the art in PC CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM technology, and so on. I’ve got all of these issues over there on the shelf, handy to look back on when trying to assess this or that mildly-vintage system that might come my way. </p>



<p>But, when I flew to Boston this spring, I couldn’t find my copy of <em>Maximum PC</em> on the newsstand. It wasn’t at Washington National or at Logan, on either end of the week-long trip. A few days later when I was back in town, I checked the local Barnes and Noble for the current issue and wasn’t able to find it there, either. </p>



<p>It was then that I did a bit of searching on the web and was rather alarmed to find <em>Technologizer</em>‘s recent post, “<a href="https://technologizer.com/2023/04/15/the-end-of-computer-magazines-in-america/#:~:text=With%20Maximum%20PC%20and%20MacLife%27s,and%20was%20quite%20a%20run.">The End of Computer Magazines in America,</a>” subtitled “With <em>Maximum PC</em> and <em>MacLife</em>’s abandonment of print, the dead-tree era of computer journalism is officially over. It lasted almost half a century—and was quite a run.” I lament that the April 2023 issues of both of the aforementioned magazines’ were there last. Indeed, I do lament.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1201" height="567" src="https://bytecellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cc_mags.jpg" alt="Creative Computing magazines" srcset="https://bytecellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cc_mags.jpg 1201w, https://bytecellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cc_mags-300x142.jpg 300w, https://bytecellar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cc_mags-1024x483.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px"></figure>



<p>Ever since I got my first home computer on Christmas morning, 1982, I have been buying and reading computer magazines. Some general — <em>Creative Computing, BYTE, Compute!, Personal Computing, Computers &amp; Electronics, Pen Computing, Next Generation, </em>etc. — and some platform specific — <em>A+, InCider, ’99er, AmigaWorld, STart, INFO 64, NeXTWorld,</em> etc. — these magazines riveted me with the promises of upcoming software, hardware, new systems, and the like in a world before the internet when monthly magazines like these were how we knew what was coming. They were what got me excited about the Next Big Thing. </p>



<p>And now, basically all American computer print magazines have vanished. Some have gone online in various fashions…but it’s not the same. Coming to realize that this reality had crept slowly upon me was a sad moment.</p>

<p>It is the case that the British computer magazine business is still rolling along, to some degree. Indeed, I have been a subscriber of <em>Retro Gamer</em> magazine since it started up in 2004 and it has taught me most of what I know about the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, and other British machines of the sort. (<a href="https://bytecellar.com/2015/12/07/on-being-featured-in-retro-gamers-collectors-corner/">I was featured</a> in issue 148, in fact.) But, the systems that were in use here in the U.S. and those that were in use across the pond — especially early on in the home computer era — differed notably, and it is the American magazines that formed my notion of the computing industry relevant to me as a whole. </p>



<p>I am glad to have saved what magazines I did (though sadly most I let go, sold with various systems <a href="https://bytecellar.com/2019/05/08/computer-classifieds-dating-back-over-35-years-uncovered/">as I moved from one to the next</a>) and to have acquired some here and there since beginning my vintage computer collection. I still flip through those old magazines from time to time, which is a part of my vintage computing hobby that I quite enjoy. But, it seems my magazine shelves are unlikely to find themselves much more burdened, now that this era of computing history has drawn to a close. </p>

	<p><span><span>O</span></span>liver McGowan was 18 years old when he was hospitalized in England with recurrent seizures and pneumonia. He was autistic, and he and his parents had one specific request for the medical team: no antipsychotic medications. When he had taken them in the past, they made his seizures worse and had devastating effects on his mood. Despite the family’s vehement protests, doctors gave him an antipsychotic. A few days later, Oliver suffered a lethal neurological side effect. A week later, he was taken off life support. An inquest into his death found that the drug had led to the rapid deterioration.</p>
<p>After his death in 2016, his mother, Paula, launched a campaign to mandate training on intellectual disability and autism for health care workers. In 2022, <a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/learning-disability/current-projects/oliver-mcgowan-mandatory-training-learning-disability-autism/background" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.K. National Health Service listened</a>. Now, all health care workers in the NHS must complete both an <a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/the-oliver-mcgowan-mandatory-training-on-learning-disability-and-autism/#:~:text=a%20learning%20disability.-,The%20Oliver%20McGowan%20Mandatory%20Training%20on%20Learning%20Disability%20and%20Autism,tiers%20consist%20of%202%20parts." target="_blank" rel="noopener">online module and a live interactive session</a> covering communication and accommodations needed for this population. The U.S. needs to follow suit, starting with medical schools.</p>
<p>Though there are <a href="https://publications.ici.umn.edu/risp/infographics/people-with-idd-in-the-united-states-and-the-proportion-who-receive-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.4 million Americans</a> with intellectual and developmental disabilities, <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/neurodiversity/documents/Manuscripts/Clarke-2022---The-impact-of-autism-related-training-programs-on-physician-knowledge-self-efficacy-and-practice-behavior--A-systematic-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physicians are often uncomfortable</a> treating them. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8722582/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent survey</a> of 714 Massachusetts physicians across various specialties, only 40% reported being very confident treating physically or intellectually disabled patients, and just 56% strongly agreed that they’d welcome disabled patients into their practice. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26334872/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another study</a> found that 77% of physicians reported only poor or fair ability to care for autistic individuals, in particular. It is no wonder that families struggle to find disability-friendly practices, and that people with intellectual and developmental disorders are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35357055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four times more likely</a> than neurotypical people to have unmet health care needs.</p>
		
		
<p>I know firsthand what these barriers can look like because my twin brother is the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-07-13/nearly-1-in-10-u-s-children-has-a-developmental-disability-cdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in nearly 10 U.S. children</a> diagnosed with an intellectual and/or developmental disability. His profound autism and nonverbal status mean my family lives with anxiety about taking him to the hospital or even about finding physicians willing to treat him. This past summer, my mother had to call 12 oral surgery practices before finding a surgeon willing to extract my brother’s painful wisdom tooth. Now, as a new medical student, I’m starting to understand why the health care system is so unwelcoming to people with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDDs).</p>
<p>Many of the schools that offer education on these topics do so only in the form of an elective, which tends to attract a self-selecting group of students already interested in IDD health, particularly those pursuing residencies in neurology or psychiatry.</p>
<p>But anyone who wants to be a practicing doctor in any specialty needs to know how to work with patients with IDD. My brother sees a primary care provider, dentist, allergist, ophthalmologist, and gastroenterologist. Women and girls with IDDs also need routine care from a gynecologist. These patients require medical care from every discipline, which means that learning to care for them should be a mandatory part of medical school curricula.</p>
<p>Yet efforts to integrate more IDD education have been slow. In 2009, the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry created a funding source to eliminate financial barriers for all U.S. medical schools to integrate robust IDD education in their curricula. The <a href="https://www.aadmd.org/niche" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Curriculum Initiative in Developmental Medicine</a> program offers grants and resources to schools willing to undertake this curricular addition. As of 2023, only <a href="https://www.aadmd.org/medical-school-partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15% of U.S. medical schools</a> have taken advantage of these grants.</p>
<p>I’m very grateful to attend one of the few medical schools that did so, just four years ago. Though we still have much room for growth, our curriculum is beginning to represent the type of IDD education that every medical student in the country should receive.</p>
<p><strong>1. Providing longitudinal exposure: </strong>Most medical schools have three phases of training: preclinical classroom learning, clinical rotations, then post-clinical time. Ideally, IDD-related content should be integrated across all three of these phases. At Harvard, we receive our first exposure during our first-semester genetics course, when we meet adults with Down syndrome. To prepare for clinical rotations, students have sessions about working with caregivers and disabled patients. After rotations are over, electives such as “The Children with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities,” or “Developmental Pediatrics and Learning Disorders,” offer opportunities for more in-depth learning about these populations. By incorporating these throughout the four years of schooling, schools send a clear message: Those with IDD deserve physicians competent in serving them.</p>
<p><strong>2. Teaching what questions to ask:</strong> Physicians have the responsibility to ask questions that will garner relevant information — allergies, family medical history, substance use, etc. IDD patients require some additional questions. Are there certain stimuli that make the person upset or hyper-stimulated? How do they communicate? Do they have sensory differences? For instance, a physician asking us these questions would learn that my brother gets over-stimulated by loud voices and that he has an unusually high pain tolerance. As students at my school transition to clinical rotations, they begin receiving direct guidance on effectively interviewing disabled patients and how to balance caregiver participation. <a href="https://med.virginia.edu/faculty-affairs/wp-content/uploads/sites/458/2021/03/Interventions_to_Teach_Medical_Students_About.7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some other schools</a> have implemented an additional “standardized patient encounter,” a cornerstone of clinical training, where students must effectively communicate within a devised scenario where a patient actor has IDD.</p>
		
		
<p><strong>3. Teaching how to adapt to patient needs: </strong>Asking the right questions can help future doctors make visits smoother for people with IDD. This sort of practical training to help accommodate IDD patients is an area still under progress at my school. For example, knowing that a patient struggles with the concept of time could be a sign to use a visual timer or schedule to keep them motivated throughout an appointment. Knowing that bright lights overstimulate the patient is a sign to dim lights before they arrive. Our childhood dental hygienist always scheduled my appointment right before my brother’s so he could see what to expect and sometimes did his dental cleaning as he sat in a chair instead of laying down beneath the bright light. In preparation for dreaded vaccinations, our pediatrician set colorful lollipops on the counter so my brother had a tangible reward within view. We found these providers through word of mouth from other IDD families, knowing well that most providers aren’t as willing to accommodate. Medical students learn to adapt to various patient populations such as in pediatric and geriatric realms, and the IDD population should be no exception.</p>
<p>The last few years have seen many physicians and disability advocates calling for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to mandate IDD curricula for medical schools to be accredited — and these calls remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Luckily, medical education lives in a constant state of evolution, responding to its fundamental call to address shifting societal needs. In response to the growing opioid crisis, <a href="https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/curriculum-reports/data/curriculum-topics-required-and-elective-courses-medical-school-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95% of medical schools now train students on opioid addiction</a>, and in response to more social awareness, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/lgbtq-health-issues-how-to-choose-a-medical-school-at-the-forefront" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many schools are developing LGBTQ+ health curricula.</a> Disability education must follow suit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I created <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/">The low-tech guys</a>, a brand under which I develop macOS apps for a living.</p>
<p>I started this business with a good friend of mine, thinking I could help him stop working long hours at his consulting job and ease into more creative work.</p>
<p>However, getting to a state where you earn enough to live off the app sales takes time, and he did not have that time. So it's just one "low-tech guy" doing all this, and that is me.</p>
<p>So what are the largest costs of running such a business?</p>
<p>Well to be honest, that is <strong>time</strong>. Time I could have spent with my wife, my brother, my dog, instead of answering support emails from my first waking moment to right before sleeping. Time I could have walked outside, do some handy work in natural light, instead of sit on my butt and wreck my spine 6-12h a day.</p>
<p>But time is hard to quantify, so let's talk about money instead.</p>
<h2 id="app-store"><a href="#app-store">#</a> App Store</h2>
<p>I sell 3 apps on the App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd">rcmd - App switcher using the ⌘ Right Command key</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/grila/">Grila - Keyboard-centric calendar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/gammadimmer/">Gamma Dimmer - Basic screen brightness dimmer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>rcmd makes the bulk of the sales, but mostly because I didn't have time to further develop and act on feedback for the other two.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales (how much people paid in total): <code>$14.9k</code></li>
<li>Proceeds (how much I get from the sales): <code>$11.5k</code></li>
<li>Costs: <code>$3.4k</code>
<ul>
<li>App Store commission fee (small business 15%): <code>$2.3k</code></li>
<li>VAT, Sales Tax, foreign currency exchange fees: <code>$1.1k</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="paddle"><a href="#paddle">#</a> Paddle</h2>
<p>I publish apps independently as well because the App Store has some strict restrictions regarding what you can do in an app <em>(no private APIs allowed, no IOKit for talking to hardware directly etc.)</em>.</p>
<p>So the apps where I can use code to tickle my curiosity and experiment more are not on the App Store.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://paddle.com/">paddle.com</a> for selling these apps because they handle all tax work for me (calculate VAT and sales tax, send it to the relevant authority, handle reverse charge and chargebacks etc.). They also provide a useful Mac SDK for licensing and checkout.</p>
<p>For most year, I only sold <a href="https://lunar.fyi/">Lunar</a> there, an app for adaptive monitor brightness. Just recently I also started selling <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/clop">Clop</a> (an image, video and PDF optimizer), but most numbers will be relative to Lunar's price.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales (how much people paid in total): <code>$93.5k</code></li>
<li>Proceeds (how much I get from the sales): <code>$73.3k</code></li>
<li>Costs: <code>$20.2k</code>

<p>The disadvantage of using a Merchant of Record like Paddle is that I don't get to reclaim the VAT at the end of the year. That's because it's some kind of B2B relation: I sell them my app in gross with 0% VAT, and then they resell it and collect taxes themselves.</p>
<p>Oh well, the price of convenience and peace of mind...</p>
<h2 id="romanian-corporate-income-tax"><a href="#romanian-corporate-income-tax">#</a> Romanian corporate income tax</h2>
<p>So in 2023, people paid a total of <code>$108.4k</code> <em>(wow.. 108400 US dollars.. I’m amazed to see that number myself, thank you good people for helping me keep doing this)</em> and after paying fees to a bunch of states and platforms, I’m left with <code>$84.8k</code>.</p>
<p>Before taxes. Yep, it doesn’t stop here, you didn't think I'd get to spend eighty-five thousand dollars, did you?</p>
<p><strong>THE LOW-TECH GUYS S.R.L.</strong> is a business incorporated in Romania so it has to pay taxes on the income. Calculating that final tax needs applying such a chaotic and stupidly complex formula that I think I’ll spare you the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you really want to know, it’s something like: I have to pay myself a minimum salary of about $1k/month on which I pay half as taxes, then I pay 3% from the remaining sum as income tax, then I pay 8% as dividend tax, then I pay 10% of 24 minimum monthly salaries for mandatory health insurance, then I have to pay a mandatory accountant and a mandatory billing software, and a mandatory business bank account... I most surely forgot something and I'll also have to pay a mandatory fine next year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, another <code>$13k</code> flies out the window to Romanian corrupt politicians to line up their greasy pockets. A small amount of those might end up in healthcare and education, so that corrupt hospital managers and inspectors can get their part as well.</p>
<p>I'm left with <code>$71.8k</code>. Before expenses.</p>
<p>Thankfully, a macOS app business doesn't have many of those. Here's what I currently have to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bare metal Hetzner server: <code>$600</code>
<ul>
<li>This is where I host all my DMGs, websites, APIs, analytics, experiments etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An IPStack subscription as a fallback for Lunar's <a href="https://lunar.fyi/#location">Location Mode</a>: <code>$140</code></li>
<li>Apple Developer Membership: <code>$100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the app features, I might also need to buy the latest MacBook or iPhone to develop and test hardware-related features <em>(like <a href="https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/journey-to-ddc-on-m1-macs/">DDC support for M1</a> or <a href="https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/over-500nits-failed/">XDR Brightness for MacBook HDR screens</a>)</em>, or for example I needed to buy a bunch of varying light sensors and ESP32/ESP8266 boards to develop adaptive monitor brightness using <a href="https://lunar.fyi/sensor">wireless light sensors</a>.</p>
<p>These are not recurring so I can't count them in, just thought I'd note them here for whoever's interested.</p>
<p>I'm also a Romanian, living in Romania, earning USD but spending RON so I'll also lose a significant amount on foreign currency exchange. I calculated that to be at least <code>$1k</code></p>

</span></span></code></pre><p>In the end, I get the equivalent of a <code>$5800/month</code> net salary. Not bad, but very far from what I could earn as a consultant.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, this summer I took a <code>$120/hour</code> consulting gig for an MDM company because they said they need a few days worth of work for a macOS app and I said <em>why not, it's just a few days</em>. It turned out they needed a lot more and were happy to continue paying that amount because macOS skills are not easy to find.</p>
<p>But I could not fit into the same old <em>Slack chat + Zoom meetings + SCRUM + daily report + doing something that you feel it has no purpose in the real world for 8 hours a day</em> madness that consulting work needs. So I said "no, I'm sorry, I'd like to continue building my apps".</p>
<p>At <code>$120/hour</code>, one would get <code>$120 * 8 hours * 21 days - ~12% taxes</code> → <code>$18k/month</code> after taxes. Which is a mind boggling amount of money for a Romanian. And it's 3x more than my app revenue.</p>
<p>But I like to believe that with that difference of <code>$12k</code> I'm buying time.</p>
<p>Time that I can spend as late mornings, drinking coffee quietly while playing with my dog. Time that I can spend eating a quiet meal with my wife without being in a hurry for a meeting, and then taking time after to talk about our house projects. Time for taking weeks off from being in front of a laptop without having to ask someone for my own time back.</p>

<p><strong>Santa's data collection has always been compliant with GDPR, so he has no need to change his ways.</strong> The nature of his data collection is more transparent than most companies, and he is open to updating his records if you contact one of his representatives.</p>
<p>For example, he makes it clear that he is operating in your town:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You better watch out</p>
<p>You better not cry</p>
<p>Better not pout</p>
<p>I'm telling you why</p>
<p><strong>Santa Claus is coming to town</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legitimate business purpose of his data collection is to create a list of those who are naughty and nice this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He's making a list</strong></p>
<p>And checking it twice;</p>
<p><strong>Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice</strong></p>
<p>Santa Claus is coming to town</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He even gives some examples of what data he's collecting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sees you when you're sleeping</p>
<p><strong>He knows when you're awake</strong></p>
<p><strong>He knows if you've been bad or good</strong></p>
<p>So be good for goodness sake!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The GDPR has some other requirements to it, <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/30509/how-are-gdpr-fines-actually-enforced-for-us-companies-with-no-physical-presence/30513#30513">such as an EU-based representative</a> being necessary for operating in the EU, allowing users to request data updates, and getting consent for data collected.</p>
<p>Thankfully for Santa, he's been operating compliant representative systems for decades: Just go to any mall during the holiday season to meet with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MallSanta" rel="noreferrer">a representative</a>. To ensure open and accurate records, the representative will ask the child if they've been naughty or nice that year and what type of present they want.</p>
<p>As long as the child's parent/legal guardian is nearby to confirm the data change requests, Santa will be happy to update his database to ensure the naughty/nice data is accurate and that the requested presents are delivered.</p>
<p>As for consent, the children are obviously too young to provide consent and must rely on their parent/guardian to consent to Santa's data collection. <strong>I doubt there's a single house that is receiving presents from Santa without the parent's explicit consent</strong>, and I'm sure we've all been told by our parents at some point to "be good or Santa won't give you presents this year!".</p>

<p>Santa is Christian priest (bishop as far as I remember). As you can see <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/16-02-25_personal_data_protection_church_warsaw_en.pdf" rel="noreferrer">here</a> he is covered by exemption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new Regulation will maintain the existing exemption which allows churches and other bodies with a 'religious... aim' to process sensitive data:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>'in the course of its legitimate activities...';</li>
  <li>'...with appropriate safeguards';</li>
  <li>'...on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former

<p>As no one ever saw his lists, and we don't know about any other activities, we can safely assume above bullets are met.</p>

<p>Well you are making a fundamental misunderstanding about the GDPR (as many have), that consent is the only basis for holding and processing information.</p>

<p>There are actually <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/#ib3" rel="noreferrer">six legal bases</a> for holding data (you have to scroll down a little as the link doesn't work properly).<br>
Those six bases are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consent</li>
<li>Contract</li>
<li>Legal obligation</li>
<li>Vital interests</li>
<li>Public task</li>
<li>Legitimate interests</li>
</ol>

<p>So let's look at each of them and see if Santa has any basis for collecting our information.</p>

<p><strong>Consent</strong> - Actually this one may not even be as troublesome as it first seems. Presumably we're all writing letters to Santa asking for presents, this could potentially be seen as a form of consent for collecting our data, though I think that's a little iffy.</p>

<p><strong>Contract</strong> - The letter to Santa could also form the basis for a contract for the provision of services (present delivery), so I think this works.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Obligation</strong> - Unless you want to argue that Santa is legally obligated to perform his duties I don't think this one works.</p>

<p><strong>Vital Interests</strong> - No one is going to die if Santa doesn't do his job, probably doesn't work either.</p>

<p><strong>Public Task</strong> - I think this is a strong contender. From the website I linked above; "the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law." I would say the worldwide provision of joy and happiness is in the public interest, and the processing of our information is definitely required for Santa's official functions.</p>

<p><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> - This is a little of a grey area and many businesses have used it as the basis for continuing to hold and process information, I see no reason why Santa couldn't do the same.</p>

<p>So in short, there is no real issue at all and Santa can continue doing what he needs to do as long as he properly deals with our information and updates his privacy policies.</p>

<h3>Everyone gets the same present - a letter about sending your personal data</h3>
<p>This year we will all get a letter about the updated general terms and conditions and how you will be required to send a certain set of information to Santa so that he may send you your presents next year. Everyone will be required to send their address, name and age. You will also have to allow your parents to send Santa the data about you being nice or naughty. In case you don't want to disclose the naughty-or-nice information you will receive a generic probably-not-that-naughty present, which will most likely consist of old chocolate he found lying around in the elven workshops.</p>
<p>Be careful to send your data as fast as you can. It will be harder to get into contact with Santa after the timeframe he had allocated for everyone to send in their address, name and age. If you don't send that information you will receive nothing because Santa is not allowed to use your address any longer. If he still sends you something you can sue him - and thereby make sure that lots of children will cry because they won't get any presents after the EU is done with Santa. Good job, now it's clear on which list you are...</p>
<p>There is also talk about Santa cooperating with the Easter Bunny in 2019 for a late present delivery.</p>

<p>I'd like to take another route to answering your question:</p>

<p><strong>He simply doesn't care.</strong></p>

<p>For years, he has been punishing kids and breaking into houses; despite attempts from kids and governments, he has never been caught. He doesn't have an aviator's license or a landing permit for his sled, while flying very close to houses and otherwise endangering people.</p>

<p>Though, if you put him to a D&amp;D scale, he may be chaotic good, he is nonetheless chaotic:  he breaks the law to reach his goals.<br>
I'm certain he doesn't pay VAT on his gifts.  Also, the working conditions of his elves are questionable.</p>

<p>But it's the same with every other criminal:<br>
As long they can't catch him, he will continue.</p>

<p>Note: This answer pertains to Santa Claus, as distinct from St Nicholas, Sinterklaas, Krampus, etc. - as per the question.</p>

<p>He is not bound by GDPR.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an entity or more precisely an "enterprise" has to be engaged in "economic activity" to be covered by the GDPR</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation</a></p>

<p>What qualifies as "economic activity"? I'm glad you asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the Court determins that an activity is economic on the basis  of two criteria of agreement and renumeration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from 
<a href="https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789462651166-c2.pdf" rel="noreferrer">https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789462651166-c2.pdf</a> )</p>

<p>I do not agree with other posts that the recipients of the gifts agree (in the legal sense, nor in any sense that would stand up in court). I am not aware of any way a person can "agree" to be the recipient of gifts from Santa (there are obvious ways to object, of course).</p>

<p>Santa Clause also does not seem to meet the criteria for remuneration. He brings "gifts" or "presents" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus</a>); "A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or return" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift</a></p>

<p>In many cultures, something that may be considered payment is left for Santa (e.g. milk &amp; cookies in the US &amp; Canada; sherry or beer and mince pies in Britain &amp; Australia; rice porridge in Denmark, Norway &amp; Sweden); however, I can find no source that indicates that failing to leave these items will result in suspension of gifts. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus</a></p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'enterprise' means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, Santa Clause is neither a natural nor legal person. Human Beings "acquire legal personhood when they are born (or even before...", juridical persons "acquire legal personhood when they are incorporated" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person</a>). I am not aware of Santa Clause having been born, nor incorporated.</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p>There was a question if "being nice" qualifies as remuneration. I would argue against this for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>If an item is traded for remuneration, it is, by definition, not a present. The items are clearly declared as presents.</li>
<li>Santa is not the recipient of the "niceness" (in almost all cases). </li>
<li>Although it is clearly document in "Santa Claus is coming to town", (H. Gillespie et al.) that "he's going to find out who's been naughty or nice", "He knows when you've been bad or good" and "He's making a list", there is nothing in this thesis that claims that this list affects the presents. Wikipedia claims it does, but none of the sources it cites (that I checked) back this up. Does anybody know of a reasonable source for this, or is it just an urban myth? Does anybody know of a child that has not received a present, <em>because they were naughty</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>IANAL but here is my take of things.</p>

<p>In a nuthsell, GPDR requires any businesses/organizations/pineapples that have users in the European Union to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disclose what they do with the info they have on you, and why they need it;</li>
<li>Disclose with whom they share that information, and what those other businesses/organizations/pineapples do with it;</li>
<li>Allow you to order them to "forget" you. Once you give them the order, they (and their partners) have to delete all your data that <strong>can be used to identify you</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All within limits of reasonability, of course. You can't order the government or a bank to forget that you have not paid your credit card bill and your income tax in months, for example.</p>

<hr>

<p>Santa has to adhere to the GDPR only for some europeans. For starters, many european countries are not members of the EU, such as Norway and Serbia. Santa Claus also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befana" rel="noreferrer">does not operate in Italy</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>What would most probably happen is that the elves in charge of Santa's legal department will have sent every parent or legal guardian in the 28 (soon to be 27) member states a letter around May 25 stating that:</p>

<ul>
<li>They collect personal data from their children in order to assess a naughtiness score;</li>
<li>They are the keepers of the data. The processors of the data are Tencent and Alibaba, two chinese companies that specialize in social credit systems;</li>
<li>The legal guardian or parent may choose to opt-out of the system at any time, if they so wish. They may also request their children's personal data removed from the system at any moment, no questions asked;</li>
<li>However, opting out means their kids will never receive christmas presents again, at least until they join the program once more. Gifts not received due to non-participation will not be resent when they rejoin;</li>
<li>Participation does not imply in presents. Should a child receive a low reputation score due to naughty actions, they may instead receive a lump of coal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus" rel="noreferrer">a visit from Krampus</a>, or whatever punishment is seen as fit for the culture of the country where they live.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adults capable of having children will also receive a notice that in the future, they will have to manually input any future children's data in the system if they wish to receive christmas presents. Of course, people who have opted out of any social credit system will not receive such messages.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, Santa will not be the only one sending such letters. So will every imaginary folklore people who bring any joy to kids:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tooth fairy (and her rat affiliates in France) will promise that any data linking fallen teeth to their owners is anonymized;</li>
<li>Sandman will make sure that parents/legal guardians dream with his new EULA ASAP. Their children will not have sweet dreams until their parents agree to it. Should they opt out, their children will have neither dreams not nightmares.</li>
<li>When winter comes, rather than patterns on windows, people will see Jack Frost new service terms, and a couple of ice buttons for opt-in and opt-out;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Easter Bunny is the only one having an easy time. AFAIK in Europe he does not hide chocolate  eggs for kids to look for - rather, people paint actual eggs and give those as presents. He will provide an easy opt out for people who don't want to pay him his royalties.</p>

<p>A letter to Santa is considered to be implied consent for data storage, as the data is required for the requested delivery of presents. </p>

<p>This is similar to the implied consent between a patient and a healthcare provider. </p>

<p>Santa will use the data for the purposes of direct gift-giving, without breaching confidentiality.</p>

<p>If you would like to remove your data, or would like to access your data to see if you are considered naughty or nice, you will have to write another letter to Santa. </p>

<p>Santa will have 30 days to respond to your request. If this is in terms of working days, you should expect a reply by 2048.</p>

Besides, EU has no courts at the North Pole, and no extradition treaty.  So it will be hard to collect that penalty of €0.</p>

<p>Santa exists in a parallel world where this law doesn't apply. Children in our world who believe that Santa exists have identical copies in worlds where Santa does exist. If we give them a present and tell that it's from Santa and they believe that to be true, then what we have here is the exact copy of the child who really got that exact same present from Santa.</p>

<p>The moment the child finds out that Santa does not exist, the child diverges from his/her copies in the worlds where Santa does exist.  </p>

If you are under 13, then the GDPR allows your parents to consent on your behalf, so if they have done so, you likely will receive presents. Between 13 and 16 it depends on the jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>He would just remember everything himself.</h3>
<p>He's not a regular person, he's Santa, why shouldn't he simply know all he needs to know? In fact, even under GDPR, no one is obliged to call everyone whose number they have in their head. So personal memories are very clearly exempt from the "any collection of data" clause.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Santa is not in any way a commercial entity and doesn't act commercially. To project our usual human assumptions about our economic system onto a being like Santa is flawed reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>He doesn't have to</strong></p>

<p>I might point out that as he is based in the North pole, an area that doesn't fall within the EU's borders, arguably he doesn't have to <em>technically</em> comply with GDPR because the regulation only impacts European businesses, and Santa isn't in Europe.</p>

<p>How GDPR impacts countries outside of the EU is another question altogether, and is certainly a grey area legally because how would the EU enforce it's laws over that of another sovereign nation state or a company located in another country?</p>

<p>They could certain legislate some absurd law (sounds like great grounds for a story) but then how can they enforce against a man who travels faster than the speed of light and can disappear down small chimneys? I'd love to see some lawyers try to serve notice to the man in red in the North pole. A full arctic expedition just to serve some legal documents.</p>

<p>On a legal technicality, GDPR allows for data to be retained where it's needed to provide a service - in this case, knowing the address and whether they're children who meet the eligibility criteria (asleep, good) for present delivery is fundamental. Although, if he's bound to GDPR, then he's probably also bound to anti-discrimination laws regarding good and bad kids.</p>

<p>Santa did forsee this decades ago. Once he understood where our law-addicted society was headed, he instructed his huge apparatus of elven servants to foster the belief that he didn’t exist. This strategy has been so successful, that no member of the EU executive dares taking action against him, for they would be branded as crazy and sent to uncomfortable places. In fact last year around Christmas I saw something big and distinctly sledge-like in the sky. I was naive enough to point it out, but when I heard someone at the table mutter „97, hampf, dampf, retirement home“, I started giggling and pretending to be drunk... </p>

<p>In fact, the day after I was visited by a strapping young elf who made clear that Santa didn’t wish... Oh, let me get the dooooooor</p>

<p><strong>The elf's head loophole</strong></p>

<p>Santa could hire more elves and teach them memorization techniques for committing all the personal information to memory. The elves would self-organize into groups by cities and would then label themselves with their city region that they have memorized.</p>

<p>Santa can then have easy access to the data without violating any GDPR restrictions.</p>

<p>I'm not a GDPR expert but I can't imagine it prohibiting people (or elves) from remembering personal information. To stop Santa from using this loophole I guess the next move for GDPR is to prohibit systematic memorization of personal information.</p>

<p>But until then Santa is likely to be wanting an AI for predicting which presents that are going to be popular next year so that he can get his elves producing them already. We better stop him before he attempts to do this because it will require quite a few elves in some really ridiculous jobs. Although it would be a really impressive setup of elves!</p>

<p>Actually, somewhat contrary to the fine answer selected above, <strong><em>you</em></strong> was not originally the form that paired with the familiar singular <strong><em>thee</em></strong>. Rather, the nominative (and vocative) form was <strong><em>ye</em>.</strong> The now-common <strong><em>you</em></strong> was originally used in objective forms alone, so accusative or dative.</p>

<p>For example, Wordsworth draws the nominative–dative distinction when he writes in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> vii: “Yet <em>ye</em> are seven! — I pray <em>you</em> tell, Sweet Maid, how this may be.” A vocative example by Shakespeare can be found in <em>Richard II</em> III. ii. 84: “Looke not to the ground, <em>Ye</em> fauorites of a King.”</p>

<p>The <em>OED</em> explains of  ‘<em>ye</em>’ how:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the earliest periods of English <em>ye</em> was restricted to the nominative plural. In the 13th cent. it came to be used as a nominative singular = ‘thou’, first as a respectful form addressed to a superior. This use survives in modern dialects, especially (in the form <em>ee</em>) in interrog. and imperative formulæ (e.g. <em>Dee</em> = ‘do ye’), but also in objective uses = ‘thee’ (e.g. <em>Oi tell ee</em>). When <em>you</em> had usurped the place of <em>ye</em> as a nominative, <em>ye</em> came to be used (in the 15th cent.), vice versa, as an objective singular and plural (= ‘thee’ and ‘you’).</p>
  
  <p>Now (in all uses) only <em>dial</em>., <em>arch</em>., or <em>poet</em>.; in ordinary use replaced by <strong>you</strong> <em>pron</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Illustration of Forms:</p>
  
  <p><strong>a.</strong> OE <strong>ge</strong>, <strong>gie</strong>, <strong>gee</strong>, ME <strong>ȝie</strong>, (<strong>gie</strong>, <strong>ge</strong>), ME ( ME–17 <em>Sc.</em> printed <strong>ze</strong>) <strong>ȝe</strong>, ME <strong>ȝee</strong>, <em>north.</em> <strong>yhe</strong>, ME–15 north. <strong>ȝhe</strong>, ME–16 <strong>yee</strong> (ME <strong>jȝe</strong>, <strong>hye</strong>, ME <strong>iȝe</strong>, <strong>iye</strong>, (<strong>i)he</strong>, 16, 18 <em>dial.</em> <strong>yea</strong>), ME– <strong>ye</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>b.</strong> In combination, proclitically or enclitically, with other words, as: †<em>ȝet</em> = ye it, <em>yare</em> = ye are, y’have; <em>d’ee</em>, <em>dee</em> = do ye, <em>hark’ee</em>, <em>harkee</em>. Now <em>dial</em>.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1  a.</strong> The pronoun used (as the plural of 2nd singular <strong>thou</strong> <em>pron</em>.) in addressing a number of persons (or, rhetorically, of things), in the nominative (or vocative).</p>
    
    <p><strong>†2 b.</strong> In apposition to <em>self</em> (<strong>ye self</strong>, <strong>ye selven</strong> = yourselves): see <strong>self</strong> <em>pron</em>. 2. <em>Obs</em>.</p>

<p>In contrast, here’s its note about <em>you</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Originally the accusative and dative plural of the second personal pronoun: see <strong>thou</strong> <em>n</em>.  for the declension of the 2nd person pronoun in Old English and Middle English. Between 1300 and 1400 it began to be used also for the nominative <strong>ye</strong> <em>pron</em> which it had replaced in general use by about 1600. During the 14th century it also appears as a substitute for the singular obj. <strong>thee</strong> <em>n</em>.  and nominative <strong>thou</strong> <em>n</em>., being originally used in token of respect in addressing a superior, but later also to an equal, and ultimately generally: compare <strong>thou</strong> <em>pron</em>. 1. Thus <strong>you</strong> is now the general pronoun of the second person, nominative or objective, singular or plural.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The historical forms given for <em>you</em> are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forms:  OE–ME <strong>eow</strong>, (OE <strong>ieow, iow</strong> ME <strong>ȝeau, heou, heow, how, ȝehw</strong>) ME <strong>eou, ȝeu, ȝew,</strong> ME <strong>ou, hou, ȝu,</strong> ME <strong>iou, æu, ew, heu, eo, oeu, howe, ȝeow, ȝuw, ov,</strong> ME <strong>ow, owe, ȝiu,</strong> ME <strong>eu, yu,</strong> (15 <em>Sc</em>.) <strong>ȝou</strong>, ME <strong>iow, ȝue, ȝuu, ȝouȝ, yuu, youu, yhow,</strong> ME <strong>ȝowe, ȝhow, ȝo,</strong> (15–16 <em>Sc</em>.) <strong>ȝow</strong>, ME–16 <strong>yow</strong>, ME <strong>ȝoue, ȝewe, ȝhu, yowe, yoow, yw, yo, yewe,</strong> <em>Sc</em>. <strong>yhu, yhw,</strong> ME–15 <strong>youe</strong>, 15 <strong>iow</strong>, 16 <strong>yew</strong>, ME– <strong>you</strong>, (18 <em>dial</em>. and <em>vulgar</em> <strong>yah, yer</strong>, also <strong>yez</strong> <em>pron</em>.).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body"><p>The world of sound synthesis is multifaceted, abounding with possibilities to generate, recreate, and modify sonic content. We can make a comparison to visual artists: different kinds of paints create different aesthetic possibilities, right? So, we can think of various sound synthesis approaches similarly: they allow musicians and composers to explore novel types of sound. (Hopefully you've begun to understand some of the distinct flavors possible in our recent articles on <a href="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/what-is-subtractive-synthesis" target="newtab">Subtractive Synthesis</a> and <a href="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/what-is-additive-synthesis" target="newtab">Additive Synthesis</a>.)</p><p><strong>Frequency modulation synthesis</strong> (or FM for short) is undoubtedly one of the best-known and widely-used approaches. However, like many concepts related to the art and science of electronic sounds, FM synthesis is a bit of a tangled term that requires some unpacking. And this is precisely what we are attempting to do here.</p><p>In this article, we are going to discuss frequency modulation synthesis in depth, tracing its evolution from being used in some of the earliest electronic music inventions to comprehensive approaches developed over the years. We will emphasize nuances of the approach within analog and digital domains, indicating different methods of achieving the effect. Along the way, we will also explore a number of classic and modern instruments that incorporated frequency modulation in their designs.</p><h2 id="">What Is FM Synthesis?</h2><p>The basic principle of FM synthesis is quite simple. In essence, we need at minimum two oscillators. One of them acts as a <i>carrier</i>—it produces the sound that we hear. The second oscillator is called the <i>modulator</i>: it is used to modulate the frequency of the carrier. We don't listen to the modulator directly (not in this example, at least), but we hear its effect as a timbral change in the tone of the first oscillator. By running the modulator at a high frequency (in the audio range), we can create a wide variety of complex tones.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/editedDX7.jpg" onclick="openModal('m2')"></p><div id="m2">

</p>
</div><p>So in simple terms: <strong>What is FM Synthesis?</strong> FM synthesis is a specialized means of shaping sound by using multiple oscillators to modulate one another's frequencies.</p><p><span><div>

<p><span>A variety of classic FM tones: bells, and pad tones with increasing complexity.</span>
</p></div><p>The frequency modulation technique allows us to produce both tonal and discordant sounds. The resulting sound's quality is primarily defined by the harmonic relationship between the frequencies of the two oscillators (their frequency <i>ratio</i>). If the frequency ratio between the carrier and the modulator is a whole number integer value, then the resulting tone will be relatively stable/harmonic. If the ratio is more complex, the sound will be more inharmonic or dissonant.</p><p>Another important parameter to introduce is the <i>modulation index</i>. This refers to the amplitude level of the modulating oscillator—controlling the intensity or depth of the modulation effect applied to the frequency of the carrier. As you would expect, the higher the modulation index, the more pronounced the result.</p><p>While this effectively summarizes the core concepts of the FM technique, it is still far from what we now culturally define as "FM Synthesis." In the following sections, we will learn more about the distinction between the tone-altering technique, and the comprehensive approach to sound design.</p></span></p><h2 id="">The Origins Of Analog FM</h2><p>In some ways, we can think of the frequency modulation technique as having been discovered in 1933 by the engineer Edwin Armstrong—and since then it has been implemented for high-fidelity radio broadcasting worldwide.</p><p>However, its clearest integration into the world of "commercial" synthesizer design begins with Don Buchla's experimental modular synthesizer systems, which he started developing in mid-1960s. In particular, the FM technique first appeared in his oscillators in the 100 Series—most clearly with the 158 Dual Sine/Sawtooth Generator and 144 Dual Square Wave Generator. These modules were dual oscillators, each of which offered an input for frequency modulation...typically connected between the two oscillators in a single module.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/buchla-oscs.JPG" onclick="openModal('m3')"></p><div id="m3">

</p>
</div><p><i>[Above: 158 and 144 dual oscillators in the prototype Buchla 100 system, housed at Mills College in Oakland, CA.]</i></p><p>This technique became fundamental in the creation of the "complex oscillator" concept, manifesting in such famous designs as the 208 Stored Program Sound Source and 259 Programmable Complex Waveform Generator. A so-called "complex oscillator" typically features two oscillators (generally acting as a carrier and a modulator), promoting modulation between the two—an effect that results in a wide range of complex timbres and tonal shifts.</p><p>In the years following Buchla's first engineering expeditions, many other synthesizer manufacturers also explored analog frequency modulation techniques. Examples include Moog's Minimoog, ARP's Odyssey and 2600, and oscillator modules in Serge modular systems such as NTO and PCO. It is also important to mention that this style of frequency modulation technique is not exactly exclusive to oscillators. It can be applied essentially to any function that includes a frequency or a rate parameter, including LFOs, looping envelopes, and of course, audio filters.</p><p>While the term "frequency modulation" was applied to these types of techniques in the 1960s and '70s, the general meaning of the term eventually changed/expanded. While it's still accurate to describe these techniques as a form of frequency modulation, the fully story of FM Synthesis (with a capital "S") is a bit more complex. And as with many such stories in the history of electronic musical instruments, these changes were directly related to advancements in technology. </p><h2 id="">The Origins Of Digital FM</h2><p>Here is when things may get a little confusing. As you can see, frequency modulation as a method has been actively explored since the dawn of analog sound synthesis. However, what we today consider to be proper "FM Synthesis" isn't based on the timbre-altering effect discussed earlier—but instead, it is a comprehensive framework originally realized in the digital domain. And some of the core principles remain the same, FM Synthesis as a whole offers a much more nuanced set of ideas and techniques for realizing an immensely wide range of sounds that includes anything from harsh electronic noise to realistic emulations of acoustic instruments. </p><p><img alt="A diagram detailing FM synthesis variables, from Dr. John Chowning &amp; David Bristow's FM Theory and Applications: by Musicians for Musicians" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/variables.jpg" onclick="openModal('m4')"></p><div id="m4">

</p>
</div><p>So-called FM Synthesis is rooted in the experimental research of the composer John Chowning conducted in the 1960s at Stanford University—basically in parallel with analog sound synthesis explorations mentioned earlier. When Chowning began his graduate studies at Stanford, the school was not among those few institutions that invested in building highly costly electronic sound studios. Inspired by the electro-acoustic music that was being made at the time—works by the composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez—as well as his own musical experiments with electronic equipment during his earlier studies in Paris, Chowning, stripped of such opportunities at Stanford, began actively searching for an alternative to analog hardware.</p><p>Fortunately, he came across an article written by Max Mathews titled "The Digital Computer As An Electronic Musical Instrument". Thrilled by the possibilities, Chowning took a computer programming course at Stanford, and a year later he met with Max Mathews at Bell Labs, who then eagerly provided him with a set of punch cards for his groundbreaking <i>Music IV</i> program. Upon the composer's return to Stanford, AI pioneer John McCarthy granted Chowning weekend and evening access to the DEC and IBM mainframe computers at Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Lab. There, with the gained support from fellow researchers David W. Poole and James Anderson Moorer, Chowning began experimenting.</p><p>Chowning's work has always been driven more by his interest in musical composition than in electronics itself, and most of his earlier research in computer music was aimed toward sound spatialization. As such, the discovery of FM was driven not by rigorous calculations and engineering, but by the act of attentive listening—an "ear discovery," as the composer puts it. </p><p>One evening in the Fall of 1967, now an assistant professor of composition at Stanford, John Chowning was experimenting with extreme ranges of vibrato effects. He created two digital sine wave oscillators and used the output of one of them to alternate the frequency of the other. Increasing the rate and the depth of the modulation, Chowning suddenly realized that past a certain threshold, he no longer heard the vibrato effect, but instead, the sound gained a new timbral quality. The inquisitive composer then began to play around with the values corresponding to frequencies of both oscillators, as well as the modulation index...only to unfold a wide variety of complex, harmonically-rich tones. He then proceeded to add an envelope generator to shape the dynamic profile of the spectrum. In the next step, Chowning transposed the whole set maintaining the frequency ratios between the oscillators to confirm the reproducibility of the sonic effect in different ranges—and it stood the test.</p><p>Intrigued by the possibilities, the composer decided to attempt to recreate the sound of brass instruments electronically—something that was notoriously difficult to do with previously existing means of synthesizing sounds. He used a brass-like envelope applied to the modulation index, and with minor changes in different frequency ranges the composer managed to create believable brass tones. And contrary to the earlier research by Jean Claude Risset in using additive synthesis techniques to recreate acoustic sounds, Chowning's discovery did not require big stacks of oscillators—and extraordinary results could be achieved with minimal elements.</p><p><img alt="A diagram detailing Bessel functions, from Dr. John Chowning's " the="" synthesis="" of="" complex="" audio="" spectra="" by="" means="" frequency="" modulation""="" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/besselfunctions.jpg" onclick="openModal('m5')"></p><div id="m5">

</p>
</div><p><i>[A diagram detailing Bessel functions, from Dr. John Chowning's "The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency Modulation".]</i></p><p>Following his initial findings, the composer spent the next few years attempting to recreate many sounds of acoustic musical instruments using the FM method, and by the early 1970s, he championed a decent library of recipes. In 1973, Chowning published thoroughly outlined results of his research in the academic paper titled "The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency Modulation." The publication was also a part of Chowning's application to a tenured teaching position at Stanford, which unfortunately wasn't provided to him at the time. For a brief period, the composer relocated to France, following Boulez's timely invitation to play an advisory role in the creation of the state's national institution for experimental music research (what eventually will become IRCAM).</p><p>Chowning's position abroad, however was relatively short. Stanford attempted to lease the patent to many existing electric organ producers (including Hammond and Wurlitzer), yet the existing hardware technology wasn't capable at the time of taking advantage of Chowning's discovery. Fortunately, the potential of FM synthesis found significant interest at Yamaha, a Japanese musical instrument manufacturer who had already started researching digital technology for their keyboard instruments. Thus, in 1974 Yamaha purchased a license from Stanford, and for the next two decades, the company became the only (with a few exceptions) manufacturers of FM-focused synthesizers. Soon, Chowning returned to Stanford and founded the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), which is still active (and quite legendary) to this day.</p><h2 id="">FM Synthesis for the Masses</h2><p>Once Yamaha licensed the patent to Chowning's discovery, the company spent the next several years in close communication with Stanford while they were developing their new digital FM instruments. The theoretical basis of the concept now required Yamaha to develop dedicated hardware, and the company was up to the task. And so, after several years of active development, in 1981 Yamaha introduced to the market their first commercial digital FM synthesizer—the quite piano-like GS-1 (pictured below).</p><p><img alt="Yamaha GS-1 digital FM keyboard" data-amsrc="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/gs1.jpeg" onclick="openModal('m6')" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/gs1.jpeg"></p><div id="m6">

</p>
</div><p>The instrument featured a four-operator voice architecture, 16-note polyphony, and 2-part multitimbrality. While GS-1 was a significant breakthrough in digital synthesis technology, the instrument (and its successor, the GS-2) was prohibitively expensive, and only a handful of these instruments were actually produced. In the meantime, Yamaha also re-licensed the patent to other instrument manufacturers. Notably, New England Digital used it as the basis for the Synclavier.</p><p>The mass success of FM synthesis, however, arrived with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/yamaha-dx-series" target="newtab">DX series</a> by Yamaha, and in particular the iconic DX7. Upon its release, DX7 was an instrument unlike anything else. Like its predecessor GS-1, it offered a generous 16-note polyphony, while the number of FM operators was increased to 6. Moreover, it offered an attractive minimalist interface, was light and portable, and importantly it was affordable. To this day, it remains at the very top of all-time bestselling synthesizers. The architecture and the hardware of the instrument endowed it with an uncommonly wide sonic variety, and a particularly recognizable tone quality—which, along with its vast assortment of ready-to-use presets, further contributed to its distinct position in the synthesizer hall of fame.</p><p><img alt="Vintage advertisement for the Yamaha DX Series FM synthesizers" data-amsrc="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/dxfamily.jpg" onclick="openModal('m7')" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/dxfamily.jpg"></p><div id="m7">

</p>
</div><p><i>[Above: vintage advertisement for the Yamaha DX Series FM synthesizers]</i></p><p>The DX7, however, was notoriously difficult to program. Only a few brave souls were motivated enough to spend hours tediously creating new presets. This certainly played a role in the overall sound of '80s pop: the 32 default factory presets are all over countless radio hits from the era. </p><p>Yamaha undoubtedly played a defining role in realizing the potential of FM synthesis in hardware instruments. That said, even while the brand held an exclusive license to the technology, there were a few others who explored the possibilities of FM in some form or another, and in some cases pushed it much further. In the 1980s, Don Buchla was fully focusing on digital sound generation, and that decade in the inventor's career is highlighted by two mesmerizing, and now vanishingly rare instruments: the 400 and the 700.</p><p><span><p><img alt="The modosc designs ID700 application, inspired by Buchla's 700" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/id700.jpg" onclick="openModal('m8')">

</p>
</div><p>Both instruments took advantage the FM approach…but the 700 in particular was remarkably dense, offering 12-note polyphony with 4 oscillators per voice, intricate waveshaping options, a wide variety of FM algorithms, and 15 complex envelopes per voice (each envelope can have up to 96 breakpoints). As often was the case with Buchla's instruments, the 700 was remarkably advanced, and perhaps a bit ahead of their time. Only a small number of these instruments were sold—and you'd be hard pressed to find one today. <i>(Fortunately, you can have a taste of the 700 via the software emulation iD700 by Jon Schatz/modosc designs.)</i></p><p>Whether Buchla's design featured a computationally novel approach to FM, or simply flew under the radar during the era of Yamaha's FM monopoly isn't entirely clear. At the same time, larger companies like Casio were inspired to develop <i>their own technology</i> which was not based on frequency modulation <i>per se</i>, but provided similar timbral effects. They called it Phase Distortion Synthesis (PD), and it became the core technology in the affordable CZ-series synthesizers. </p></span></p><p>In 1995, Yamaha's patent expired, and FM synthesis now is openly used in a wide range of software, and hardware synthesizers including NI FM8, Ableton Operator, Elektron Digitone and Model:Cycles, Korg Volca FM, Kodamo Essence FM, and Yamaha Reface DX. There are also a few Eurorack modules that allow you to explicitly explore digital FM synthesis in the context of a modular synthesizer. These include the ALM Akemie's Castle and Akemie's Taiko, Industrial Music Electronics Hertz Donut MKIII, RYK Modular Vector Wave, and plenty of others.</p><h2 id="">FM Terminology Demystified</h2><p><span><div>

<p><span>A variety of percussive FM tones</span>
</p></div><p>As you may have noticed, we have already introduced a few terms, words like <b>operators</b> and <b>algorithms</b>, that are specifically related to FM Synthesis. This is an element that accompanies many new inventions, and so along with FM Synthesis arrived a new sonic vocabulary. In this section, we will identify all of the key terms associated with FM Synthesis, but before we go there we should more directly acknowledge a detail that we've conveniently avoided up until this point: Chowning's FM and analog FM are just not the same thing.</p><p>Conventional analog FM, as we said before, is truly about using one oscillator to control another oscillator's frequency. Typical analog FM is exponentially-scaled. Analog oscillators commonly adhere to the 1V/oct standard, which means that it always takes 1 volt to go from one octave to another. However, since the relationship between pitch and frequency is exponential, the distance to the upper octave is always twice longer as to the lower octave. If the center is 200Hz, the upper octave is 400Hz, while the lower is 100Hz. Thus, the center frequency drifts when we plug in a modulating wave that evenly oscillates up and down. Exponential FM is great for percussive sounds, as well as gnarly and unpredictable inflections. But it doesn't remain terribly stable at high indices—the oscillator pitch drifts upward and can be difficult to control.</p></span><img alt="" data-amsrc="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/phase.jpg" onclick="openModal('m9')" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/phase.jpg"></p><div id="m9">
<p><span>×</span></p><p><img data-amsrc="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/_IMG" data-src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/phase.jpg" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/phase.jpg">
</p>
</div><p>The method implemented by Chowning employed a linear frequency mapping system. This is the result of a particular quirk about his approach: it's not actually about modulating an oscillator's <i>frequency</i>, but instead, its <i>phase</i>...which, with an appropriate combination of modulation frequency and index can have an obvious audible effect on the frequency of the produced sound. So, in effect, it's not <i>wrong</i> to call this method <i>frequency</i> modulation, since it's still based on a method that modulates the apparent frequency of the sound—but on a technical level, the core oscillator frequency never actually changes, only its phase. Today, it's relatively common to refer to Chowning's approach to digital FM as <strong>Phase Modulation Synthesis</strong>.</p><p>Perceptually, the effect of linear FM on the timbre of a sound is quite similar to the traditional exponential approach. However, it is characterized by advantageous pitch stability that is essential for gaining precise harmonic ratios. </p><p>Over the years, instrument manufacturers managed to incorporate linear frequency modulation in analog oscillators too. These days, it is not uncommon to see exponential and linear FM inputs side by side on analog sound generators. You will also encounter occasionally something called <i>thru-zero FM</i>—a special kind of linear frequency modulation directly related to Chowning's phase modulation approach. TZFM allows a modulated oscillator to automatically reverse its phase upon reaching 0Hz (typically, an oscillator would stop at that point). The practical effect of this is superior pitch stability, and increased capacity for wild modulation without necessarily disturbing the sound's pitch stability.</p><p>Now that we've covered all of the different types of frequency modulation, let's demystify the remaining terms. So what is an FM <i>operator?</i> An operator is a set of rudimentary tools comprising an oscillator (traditionally a sine wave generator), VCA (for controlling loudness or modulation depth), and at least one envelope generator (most commonly used for altering the FM Index). Basic FM synthesis patches can be accomplished with a mere two operators, but dedicated FM synths often feature 4-, 6-, and even 8-operator voice architecture. An operator can serve as a carrier, a modulator, or both. The FM <strong>algorithm</strong> determines the function of a particular operator—essentially, a structure that defines how multiple operators are routed.</p><p><img alt="" data-amsrc="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/fm_algo.jpg" onclick="openModal('m10')" src="https://www.perfectcircuit.com/media/wysiwyg/articles/synthesis-types-fm/fm_algo.jpg"></p><div id="m10">

</p>
</div><p>Different FM synthesizers offer a varied number of available algorithms, many of which are variations on common shapes like <i>cascade</i> (operators modulating each other in series), <i>branch</i> (multiple modulators to a single carrier), and <i>root</i> (single modulator to multiple carriers). While the number of operators involved in an algorithm proportionally relates to the complexity of the tone, even more harmonically rich effects can be achieved through the FM <i>feedback</i> technique, where an operator is set to modulate its own frequency At extreme mod index settings, the result of this sort of feedback is a sort of a pitched noise. However, using feedback sparsely can be very effective for brightening up a sound. </p><p>All in all, in order to feel at home with FM Synthesis, it is necessary to pay careful attention to what effects frequency ratios, envelope shapes, and level differences between operators have on each other. Taking control of these parameters will grant you a key to an inexhaustible realm of sonic flavors.</p><h2 id="">FM Synthesis: Pros and Cons</h2><p>Frequency modulation synthesis is incredibly robust, as it allows you to create a wide variety of rich sounds with only a handful of elements—a lot can be done with a couple of oscillators, envelopes, and VCAs. Moreover, the inventors of current-day FM-based instruments learned how to design interfaces and workflows which are much more welcoming and creatively inspiring than what was offered by the classic FM synths. Devices such as the Elektron Digitone, for instance, make the process of sound design nearly as instantaneous and rewarding as the process of music-making itself.</p><p>So what is a possible downside of FM-synthesis then? Reportedly some consider sounds created via digital FM method to have a certain "cold" quality (of course, in comparison to the "warm" tone of analog synthesizers). While this definition is arguable, digital FM without a doubt has a unique character, which may be enjoyed by some, and not as much by others. Furthermore, at high-frequency settings of the modulator and carrier operators, sideband harmonics can escape the limits set by the sampling frequency of the system, causing aliasing effects. That said, it is possible to treat these sonic effects as something that adds charm to the sounds, and if you want to make FM sounds a bit "warmer", you can always process them through analog enhancers such as filters, compressors, and saturators.</p><p>But overall? We appreciate FM Synthesis for what it is: yet another distinct tool for creating and shaping sounds that would be impossible with other approaches.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>Hundreds of feet underground, in a long-dormant portion of Chiquita Canyon landfill, tons of garbage have been smoldering for months due to an enigmatic chemical reaction.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Although operators of the Castaic <a href="https://phys.org/tags/landfill/" rel="tag">landfill</a> say there's no full-blown fire, temperatures within the dump have climbed to more than 200 degrees, and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/area+residents/" rel="tag">area residents</a> have complained of a burned garbage odor wafting through the neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 12 miles to the southeast, Sunshine Canyon landfill has suffered water intrusion from torrential storms earlier this year. That seepage has fueled bacteria growth within the Sylmar landfill, giving rise to putrid odors that have nauseated students and staff at a local elementary school.</p>
<p>The highly unusual reactions at Los Angeles County's two largest landfills have raised serious questions about the region's long-standing approach to waste disposal and its aging dumps. These incidents have impaired pollution control systems, allowing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/toxic+gases/" rel="tag">toxic gases</a> and polluted water to migrate into unwanted areas.</p>
<p>They have also triggered thousands of odor complaints, dozens of environmental penalties and renewed calls to shutter the landfills.</p>
<p>Both facilities remain operational and each continues to accept more than 7,000 tons of trash a day. However, many residents who live nearby fear the potential of even greater problems and say that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/government+officials/" rel="tag">government officials</a> and landfill operators need to take the problems more seriously.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Trucks haul dirt that is used to cover the Sunshine Canyon landfill.</p>
<p>"If temperatures get to a certain point, there isn't going to be much that can be done," said Sarah Olaguez, a Val Verde resident whose family lives less than a mile from Chiquita Canyon. "I feel like we're on the precipice right now. It's a train wreck waiting to happen. It's scary and I feel trapped."</p>
<p>The scorching temperatures within Chiquita Canyon Landfill have caused pressure to build inside the 639-acre facility and forced contaminated water to burst onto the surface.</p>
<p>Analyses by CalRecycle, the state agency that oversees <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solid+waste/" rel="tag">solid waste</a> and recycling facilities, described the situation as a "heating/ smoldering" event that has expanded in all directions since the summer. By November, the reaction area had grown by 30 to 35 acres, according to the agency.</p>
<p>Already, the heat has melted or deformed the landfill's gas collection system, which consists mostly of polyvinyl chloride well casings. The damage has hindered the facility's efforts to collect toxic pollutants.</p>
<p>"When there are high temperatures in the landfill gas, that can melt or deform some of the landfill gas collection system components," said Angela Shibata, senior air quality engineering manager with the South Coast Air Quality Management District. "You can imagine when you have very hot temperatures and you have plastic materials as conveyance mechanisms for extracting and vacuuming out that gas, that can cause all kinds of issues."</p>

																																			<p>Abnormally pungent odors began drifting into neighboring communities last spring and intensified over the summer. In Val Verde, an unincorporated community of around 3,000 residents, some say they have suffered headaches, dizzy spells and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>"The odors were so bad that my wife and I were getting sick inside our house—with the doors and windows closed," said Steven Howse, a longtime Val Verde resident. "My kids can't go outside, and my son loves to go and jump on the trampoline or ride his bike. But he'll come in saying, "Oh, my stomach hurts, Dad. I don't feel good.'"</p>
<p>According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the odors are the result of a rare chemical reaction in a closed portion of the landfill that no longer receives trash.</p>
<p>The reaction may have started when oxygen entered the well system, which is designed to pump out landfill gases like methane.</p>
<p>"Think about if you've ever lit a campfire and then tried to blow on it to get it going," said Morton Barlaz, professor of civil engineering at North Carolina State University. "When you blow on it, you get more flame."</p>
<p>The landfill recorded elevated oxygen levels in hundreds of its gas wells over the past two years, according to CalRecycle. As temperatures rose to near-boiling heights this year, carbon monoxide levels climbed to more than 1,000 parts per million, which CalRecycle considers positive indication of an active underground landfill fire.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>CalRecyle declined to comment further on its report. Chiquita Canyon's website, however, claims there is no subsurface fire.</p>
<p>Waste Connections, the landfill operator, is trying to slow and eventually stop the reaction by removing excess gases and liquid, according to Steve Cassulo, Chiquita Canyon's district manager.</p>
<p>Work crews have drilled new gas wells and fitted them with steel pipes that can survive the heat. They've installed a new flare to burn off flammable landfill gases.</p>
<p>"Chiquita, along with its various regulatory oversight agencies, has been working cooperatively to rapidly address these issues," Cassulo said in a statement. "Chiquita takes very seriously its role in the safe operation of the landfill."</p>
<p>Still, county officials say the problem could persist for months.</p>
<p>As residents have stayed indoors more and run their air conditioners to filter out smells, L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger has tried to offer relief by setting aside funds to help with their electric bills. Around 900 households surrounding the landfill are eligible.</p>
<p>"The good news is, this is only happening at Chiquita," Barger said. "The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/bad+news/" rel="tag">bad news</a> is we've never seen anything like this, and if we don't understand what triggered it, it could happen at other landfills that are dormant. So it's important for us to get a handle on it."</p>
<p>Tons of buried garbage have been smoldering for months in a long-dormant portion of Chiquita Canyon landfill.</p>

																																			<p>The situation has been a nightmare for Olaguez, who lives in Val Verde with her husband, Christian, and three children.</p>
<p>The couple bought their home in 2017, attracted to the mountain views, tranquility and small-town life.</p>
<p>At the time, they were told the landfill was nearing its capacity and was poised to close when it reached 23 million tons of waste, or by November 2019.</p>
<p>Instead, Los Angeles County granted the operator permission to expand and continue operations until it reaches a capacity of 60 million tons, or by 2037.</p>
<p>"I've told my husband, we'll sell the house and live in a trailer if we have to. We'll probably lose money, but at least won't have to deal with this." Olaguez said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the northern San Fernando Valley, problems at Sunshine Canyon Landfill appear to be the result of extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>Protesters have complained for decades about noxious odors, diesel truck traffic and dust emanating from the 1,036-acre dump. Over the last year, however, odor complaints have increased drastically and are believed to be the result of heavy rains last fall and winter.</p>
<p>Between October 2022 and March 2023, Sunshine Canyon recorded more than 55 inches of rain, almost four times the amount the site typically sees in a year. Then in August the site was hit by tropical storm Hilary, which brought an additional 5½ inches.</p>
<p>Officials say this precipitation filtered into the landfill, drenched decomposing garbage and created an ideal environment for the breeding of bacteria that release methane and smelly hydrogen sulfide.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The downpours also eroded portions of the landfill's soil cover, leaving garbage exposed and strewn offsite, exacerbating the odor issues.</p>
<p>The air quality district has previously required the landfill to install pumps to remove rainfall and allow the gas collection system to continue to operate, according to Nicholas Sanchez, assistant chief deputy counsel.</p>
<p>"But what we've seen with these extreme weather events is so much liquid gets into the well that it completely inundates the system and then the pumps no longer function," he said.</p>
<p>Sour trash odors have plagued Van Gogh Charter School, which serves about 400 students, about a mile from the landfill. The Los Angeles Unified School District allowed an air monitor to be built on school grounds and encouraged staff to report odor issues to the air district, which automatically constitutes a violation.</p>
<p>This year, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, the landfill operator, has been the subject of 1,500 odor complaints and around 60 air district violations.</p>
<p>Granada Hills resident Erick Fefferman lives near the Sunshine Canyon landfill. He says odor and dust from the landfill are constant problems for the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A layer of dust coats an outdoor barbecue in Granada Hills. Residents complain of odor and dust from the nearby Sunshine Canyon landfill.</p>
<p>Granada Hills resident Erick Fefferman, whose 6-year-old son attends Van Gogh, said the school has canceled recess at least once this year in response to putrid smells and at times has refrained from having students line up outside the building in the morning.</p>

																																			<p>Fefferman, who used to walk his son to school, said the odors have deeply distressed his son.</p>
<p>"He had like a nightmare recently where he woke up crying because he said, "I had a nightmare that we lost our house and we have to live at the landfill,'" Fefferman said about his son. "It's such a common occurrence. Even at only 6 years old, he knows that there's this thing happening in proximity to his home and his school.</p>
<p>"That's like the boogeyman to him, this landfill."</p>
<p>The smells have also drifted to their neighborhood, a collection of Midcentury Modern homes at the base of the Santa Susana Mountains. Earlier in the year, when the stench was at its worst, Fefferman, who has asthma, said he had to use his inhaler every day.</p>
<p>In an effort to suppress odors, the landfill trucks in tons of soil to cover the mounds of garbage it receives. But Fefferman said this dirt sometimes blows onto his home, coating his solar panels and sullying his pool and koi pond.</p>
<p>The landfill operator has installed a new system that it says will handle more rainfall and better divert the water to allow operations to continue despite rainstorms.</p>
<p>"Without question, there have been ongoing challenges from Hurricane Hilary," said Jeremy Walters, a spokesperson for the landfill. "Excessive rain events like that can have lingering impacts, sometimes for weeks or months, on incoming wastes. In addition, seasonal wind patterns historically shift this time of year, which, combined with excessively wet wastes, can make the operating environment at the site quite dynamic."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>However, some residents say part of the problem is the landfill was never properly sited.</p>
<p>It began as an illegal dumping ground in the mid-1950s, when people discarded trash in the canyon without permits. In 1958, the city of Los Angeles permitted a 40-acre landfill, which later expanded into the county's largest dump site.</p>
<p>Due to its location, winds bluster through the Newhall mountain pass and disperse the odors onto Granada Hills and Sylmar.</p>
<p>Wayde Hunter, president of the North Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens, has been raising objections to these nuisances for decades. It's hard to get elected officials to pay attention, he said.</p>
<p>"We're being buried in trash up here and we're not getting any relief," Hunter said. "We certainly don't deserve to have this landfill in the place where it just impacts daily life."</p>
<p>Experts say that organic waste is at the root of the situation at Sunshine Canyon and Chiquita Canyon landfills.</p>
<p>Bacteria feed on food scraps, yard trimmings and paper products. In the process, they produce methane, a greenhouse gas that's at least 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over 20 years.</p>
<p>In 2016, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law calling for the reduction of organic waste in California landfills by 50% by 2020 and 75% by 2025.</p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2021, the state has cut its annual tonnage of organic waste from 21 million to 19 million, a 10% reduction, according to CalRecycle.</p>

																																			<p>But the agency noted the 2016 law only went into effect last year, including its requirement for every jurisdiction to provide organic waste collection services to all residents and businesses.</p>
<p>Mike Mohajer, a retired engineer with the L.A. County Department of Public Works, said the lack of substantial progress toward achieving these goals is due, in part, to inadequate state funding and limited infrastructure in place to divert such a vast amount of waste.</p>
<p>"Over the past 20 years, we have been arguing over ways to manage organic waste other than incineration," said Mohajer, who now serves on an L.A. County waste management task force. "You can use a portion of the organic waste as a compost. But we do not have the market to turn 11 million tons of waste into compost."</p>
<p>As policymakers wrestle with this dilemma, residents who live near the two landfills have asked sanitation agencies to explore diverting some tonnage elsewhere.</p>
<p>This includes a long-idled plan to transport Los Angeles' trash via railcar and bury it in a remote desert landfill more than 100 miles east of San Diego.</p>
<p>Representatives for the L.A. County Department of Public Works acknowledged there is capacity at other landfills. But there could be unintended consequences as a result, such as higher costs or more greenhouse gas emissions from trucking it a longer distance.</p>
<p>Granada Hills residents living nearby complain of dust and odors from Sunshine Canyon landfill.</p>
<p>Fefferman said he doesn't want to shift the burden to another community. But at the same time, he and his neighbors shouldn't shoulder the burden for the entire county, he said.</p>
<p>"We understand that we also put our black trash cans out on the curb once a week as well. So we're not saying, "Not in my backyard.'"</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is Sunshine Canyon and Chiquita Canyon each accept more than 2 million tons of garbage a year—70% of the county's solid waste.</p>
<p>"That seems like it's more than our fair share," he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>1. Validate idea first.
I wasted at least 5 years building stuff nobody needed.</p><p>2. Kill your EGO.
It's not about me, but the user. I must want what the user wants, not what I want.</p><p>3. Don't chaise investors, chase users, and then investors will be chasing you.</p><p>4. Never hire managers.
Only hire doers until PMF.</p><p>5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.</p><p>6. Hire only fullstack devs.
There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.</p><p>7. Chase global market from day 1.
You'll win or fail despite the market you target in most cases, so go for bigger upside.</p><p>8. Do SEO from day 2.
As early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It's my biggest regret.</p><p>9. Sell features, before building them.
Ask existing users if they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day, where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add.</p><p>10. Hire only people you would wanna hug.
My mentor said this to me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don't wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Even if I can't say why, but that's the fact. Sooner or later, we would have a conflict and eventually break up.</p><p>11. Invest all money into your startups and friends.
Not crypt0, not stockmarket, not properties.
I did some math, if I kept investing all my money into all my friends’ startups, that would be about 70 investments.
3 of them turned into unicorns eventually. Since 2022, I have invested all my money into my products, friends, and network.</p><p>12. Post on Twitter daily.
I started posting here in March this year. It's my primary source of new connections and traffic.</p><p>13. Don't work/partner with corporates.
Corporations always seem like an amazing opportunity. They're big and rich, they promise huge stuff, millions of users, etc. But every single time none of this happens. Because you talk to a regular employees there. They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities.</p><p>14. Don't get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0.
I lost 1.5 years of my life this way.
I met the worst people along the way. Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into thieves along the way, just because it was so common in that space.</p><p>15. Don't build consumer apps. Only b2b.
Consumer apps are so hard, like a lottery. It's just 0.00001% who make it big. The rest don't.
Even if I got many users, then there is a monetization challenge.</p><p>16. Don't hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year.
Some projects just don't work. In most cases, it's either the idea that's so wrong that you can't even pivot it or it's a team that is good one by one but can't make it as a team.</p><p>17. Tech conferences are a waste of time.
They cost money, take energy, and time and you never really meet anyone there. Most people there are the "good" employees of corporations who were sent there as a perk for being loyal to the corporation.</p><p>18. Scrum is a Scam.
If I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten, then things would eventually fail.
The only good stuff I managed to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on goals and plans.</p><p>19. Outsource nothing at all until PMF.
In a startup, almost everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing, the external members get no love and no case for the product. It's just yet another assignment in their boring job.</p><p>20. Bootstrap.
I spent way too much time raising money. I raised more than 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. But each time it was a 3-9 month project, meetings every week, and lots of destruction. I could afford to bootstrap, but I still went the VC-funded way, I don't know why. To be honest, I didn't know bootstrapping was a thing I could do or anyone does.</p><p>That's it.</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

A little more than a century ago, these woods brimmed with American chestnuts—stately Goliaths that could grow as high as 130 feet tall and more than 10 feet wide. Nicknamed “the redwoods of the East,” some 4 billion American chestnuts dotted the United States’ eastern flank, stretching from the misty coasts of Maine down into the thick humidity of Appalachia.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The American chestnut was, as the writer Susan Freinkel <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Chestnut-Death-Rebirth-Perfect/dp/0520259947">noted in her 2009 book</a>, “a perfect tree.” Its wood housed birds and mammals; its leaves infused the soil with minerals; its flowers sated honeybees that would ferry pollen out to nearby trees. In the autumn, its branches would bend under the weight of nubby grape-size nuts. When they dropped to the forest floor, they’d nourish raccoons, bears, turkey, and deer. For generations, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://indiananativeplants.org/images/resources/Gordon%20Mitchell%20Articles/GM_american_chestnut.pdf">Indigenous</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/2021/10/26/plantofthemonth-american-chestnut/">people</a> feasted on the nuts, split the wood for kindling, and laced the leaves into their medicine. Later on, European settlers, too, introduced the nuts into their recipes and orchards, and eventually learned to incorporate the trees’ sturdy, rot-resistant wood into fence posts, telephone poles, and railroad ties. The chestnut became a tree that could shepherd people “from cradle to grave,” Patrícia Fernandes, the assistant director of the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, told me. It made up the cribs that newborn babies were placed into; it shored up the coffins that bodies were laid to rest inside.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But in modern American life, chestnuts are almost entirely absent. In the first half of the 20th century, a fungal disease called blight, inadvertently imported from Asia on trade ships, wiped out nearly all of the trees. Chestnut wood disappeared from newly made furniture; people forgot the taste of the fruits, save those imported from abroad. Subsistence farmers lost their entire livelihoods. After reigning over forests for millennia, the species went functionally extinct—a loss that a biologist once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/chestnutty-180940693/">declared</a> “the greatest ecological disaster in North America since the Ice Age.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Most of the people who lived during the American chestnut heyday are gone. But the nutty world they lived in could yet make a comeback. For decades, a small cohort of volunteers and scientists—many of them the children and grandchildren of chestnut growers long gone—has been working to return the American chestnut to its native range. It’s a quest that’s partly about salvaging biodiversity and partly a mea culpa. “The hope is that you can fix something that we as humans broke,” says Kendra Collins, the American Chestnut Foundation’s director of regional programs in New England. If restoration is successful, it’ll bring back a tree unlike any other—versatile, practical, nourishing, uniquely American.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1874/12/old-trees/630598/">From the December 1874 issue: Old trees</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For all of its woes, the American chestnut isn’t technically rare: An estimated 430 million of the trees can still be found in the forests of the American East. But more than 80 percent of these trees never grow past an inch or so in diameter, Sara Fitzsimmons, the American Chestnut Foundation’s chief conservation officer, told me. Blight infiltrates cracks in the bark, essentially girdling the stem until it starves; the roots below can survive to resprout but seldom live long enough to reproduce. Locked into an endless cycle of adolescence, death, and rebirth, the plant can no longer sustain the ecological functions it once did. When the tree went into decline, at least a few animal species that depended on it did too—among them, the American chestnut moth and the Allegheny woodrat, both of which, under additional pressure from deforestation and human encroachment, were driven to near extinction.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Reinstating the American chestnut’s former glory won’t be easy. Blight is now entrenched in North America, impossible to eradicate; the best hope for the trees is to imbue them with pathogen tolerance. Decades ago, that plan seemed simple: All American breeders would need to do, the thinking went, was cross the American species with their naturally more blight-resistant Chinese cousins a few times over, making it possible to pull off “the biggest restoration in history” in as little as two decades, says Brian Clark, the vice president of orchard development for the American Chestnut Foundation’s Massachusetts/Rhode Island chapter. But in recent years, researchers have discovered that the blight resistance is scattered across “just about every chromosome” in the Chinese chestnut genome, Collins told me, making it difficult to reliably breed the trait into mixed-lineage trees. Forty years into its tenure, the foundation has successfully bred a relatively blight-resistant cultivar whose genome is roughly 5 percent Chinese. But the process of producing the trees is a lot more of a pain than researchers hoped.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/a-new-chestnut/302742/">Read: A new chestnut</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Other chestnut enthusiasts have instead hung their hopes on a transgenic tree known as Darling 58, developed by a team of scientists at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Its genome is entirely American chestnut, save for a single gene, borrowed from wheat, that can help the plant neutralize one of the blight’s most toxic weapons. But with only a single genetic shield against the fungus, “I suspect blight will eventually evolve around” the borrowed gene, says Yvonne Federowicz, the past president of the American Chestnut Foundation’s Massachusetts/Rhode Island chapter. The lineage’s resilience against blight <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tacf.org/tacf-discontinues-development-of-darling-58/">has already been spotty</a>—to the point that the American Chestnut Foundation recently withdrew its support for Darling 58. (The ESF team that designed the Darling trees, meanwhile, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/progress-report/2023.php">stands by</a> them.) And some Indigenous communities have expressed skepticism about introducing GMOs into the chestnut-restoration fight; in 2019, two members of the Foundation’s MA/RI chapter—one of them the chapter’s president—<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/south-west/2019/03/28/chestnut-champions-quit-to-protest-genetic-engineering/5579303007/">announced their resignation</a> in protest of the organization’s support for transgenic trees.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Regardless of which American-chestnut strains remain in contention, Fitzsimmons told me, restoration could take centuries. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://extension.unh.edu/sites/default/files/migrated_unmanaged_files/Resource004119_Rep5869.pdf">Some 100 million acres</a> of suitable chestnut habitat, she said, are waiting to be filled in the United States—no sole solution will likely be enough on its own. But maybe that’s fitting for a tree that refuses to relegate itself to a single purpose. “There are other trees that can produce bigger crops in a given year, or maybe grow taller, or can be more dense, or make more valuable lumber,” Andrew Newhouse, the director of ESF’s American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project, told me. “But not all in the same tree.” The American chestnut is, to our forests and our livelihoods, irreplaceable: “There aren’t really any modern equivalents.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/plants-for-the-planet/483132/">Read: The fading meaning of ‘GMO’</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Chestnuts of any variety are also absolutely delicious—phenomenal plain, roasted, or even raw, thanks to their sweet-savory flavor and starchy texture reminiscent of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/11/sweet-potato-thanksgiving/672174/">a baked sweet potato</a>. Japanese speakers often describe them as <em>hoku hoku</em>—hot, fluffy, and flaky, a sensation that’s like a cozy balm on chilly, wintry days, Namiko Hirasawa Chen, the chef behind the food blog <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/">Just One Cookbook</a>, told me. In Europe and Asia, where other species of the trees still thrive, days-long festivals have been dedicated to eating chestnuts. Here, though, chestnuts are largely forgotten, save for in nostalgic Christmas songs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But some people remember. Earlier this month, I drove to Central Massachusetts to attend the American Chestnut Foundation’s MA/RI chapter’s annual meeting, where board members and volunteers had prepared a stunning potluck. Among the tastiest dishes were a creamy chestnut stew, a turkey-chestnut chili, and a cabbage-and-sausage dish studded with chestnuts. Best of all were two desserts: flaky chestnut oat bars that melted like pie crust in my mouth and a luxurious chestnut ice cream that made me forget my lactose intolerance.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As far as I can tell, no one seemed to have bothered cooking with American chestnuts; they’re the smallest of the varieties—some as teeny as chickpeas—and not efficient to work with. But at the close of the meeting, a local grower, Mark Meehl, handed me a bag of Americans from his Massachusetts orchards. The next evening, I scored them, parboiled them, and roasted them next to some gargantuan Europeans, easily six times their size. It was, admittedly, a <em>lot </em>of work. But it made each nut precious, almost like a hard-won prize.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-3" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 4" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="4"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1897/08/the-american-forests/305017/">From the August 1897 issue: John Muir’s case for saving American forests</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I pried the Americans open, I found them to be consistently sweeter, crunchier, and, well, <em>nuttier </em>than their European counterparts. And although several of the European chestnuts—imported from Italy—appeared to have rotted during their long journey to my oven, every American nut was fresh. Not a single one of them had traveled more than 50 miles from its source. I scarfed all 10 of them down, and only wished I could have strolled into the woods near my house to gather up some more.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

        <p>There is an NFC chip inside of my toothbrush head, and it counts the time. After 360 minutes of work it will signal that it needs to be replaced, even if it doesn’t really. It’s possible to reset the counter, by sending a message from a phone to the toothbrush head. <a href="https://kuenzi.dev/toothbrush/">It’s all a little insane</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scan the toothbrush head with the NFC Tools app. Copy the serial number.</li>
<li>Find the part number written on the bottom of the brush head.</li>
<li>Enter the data <a href="https://nicjes.github.io/SonicareGenerator/">into the password generator</a> and copy the generated NFC command.</li>
<li>In NFC Tools, go to Other -&gt; Advanced NFC Commands. Paste the command into the input and send it to the toothbrush head.</li>
</ol>
