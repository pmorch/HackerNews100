  The European Union wants to force tech companies to scan your private messages &amp; images, even in your favorite encrypted apps.
</p>


<h2>Introduction 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#introduction" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>

<p>The 🇪🇺 European Union is advancing legislation that could fundamentally change how we communicate online. <strong>ChatControl</strong> would require <em>all</em> messaging platforms to automatically scan their users’ private messages and images.</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, even encrypted ones like <em>Signal</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em> and <em>Telegram</em>. <strong>No</strong>, you can’t opt out.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another privacy policy update you can ignore. If passed, this EU regulation (<em>strongest and most binding legal instrument in EU law</em>) would automatically apply to all member states without any wiggle room for national interpretation. It would even override constitutional protections for communication privacy and establish unprecedented mass surveillance of private communications.</p>
<p>The official justification? Fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material" target="_blank">child sexual abuse material</a> (CSAM). Protecting children is undeniably crucial, but the proposed methods would eliminate digital privacy for 450 million Europeans and set a global precedent for mass surveillance.</p>
<p>This surveillance trend extends beyond Europe: 🇨🇭 Switzerland is advancing metadata retention requirements, the 🇬🇧 UK is implementing comprehensive age verification systems and now the 🇪🇺 EU proposes to scan <em>every private message</em>. Each initiative is positioned as child protection policy, but the implications reach far beyond their stated goals.</p>

<h2>What is ChatControl 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#what-is-chatcontrol" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>ChatControl is what critics call the EU’s proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_to_Prevent_and_Combat_Child_Sexual_Abuse" target="_blank">Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse</a>, also known as CSAR (<em>Child Sexual Abuse Regulation</em>).</p>
<p>The proposal builds on surveillance techniques already deployed by major tech companies. Meta analyzes all Facebook Messenger conversations and unencrypted WhatsApp data (profile photos, group descriptions). Apple announced similar scanning for iCloud content in 2021, though they later suspended the program.</p>
<p>This turns voluntary corporate surveillance into mandatory government-ordered scanning. A temporary 2021 EU regulation allowed platforms to scan content voluntarily for three years. That authorization expired in 2024, which is why CSAR was proposed. The temporary regulation merely permitted scanning; CSAR would make detection obligatory under certain conditions.</p>
<p>There’s also the <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/internal-security/lawful-access-data_en" target="_blank">Roadmap for Lawful Access to Data</a> which has an even bigger goal: making all our digital data readable by authorities upon request. We’ll dive deeper into this broader surveillance agenda later.</p>

<h3>Scope and Coverage 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#scope-and-coverage" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>CSAR casts an extremely wide net. The regulation would apply to all <em>interpersonal communication service providers</em>, not just obvious targets like Signal, WhatsApp, or Telegram, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email providers</li>
<li>Dating apps</li>
<li>Gaming platforms with chat features</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>File hosting services (Google Drive, iCloud, DropBox…)</li>
<li>App stores</li>
<li>Even small community hosting services run by associations</li>
</ul>
<p>This means virtually any digital service that allows people to communicate or share content would fall under surveillance requirements. The scope extends far beyond what most people imagine when they hear <em>messaging apps</em>.</p>

<h2>How it Works 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>ChatControl relies on <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-client-side-scanning/" target="_blank">Client-Side Scanning</a>. Your device becomes a monitoring station that analyzes your content before encryption happens.</p>
<p>This represents a fundamental shift away from traditional surveillance that intercepts messages during transmission. With ChatControl, every message gets automatically checked, assuming everyone is guilty until proven innocent and effectively reversing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence" target="_blank">presumption of innocence</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>How does Chat Control work?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The system would automatically scan for three categories of content <strong>before</strong> encryption:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Known illegal content</strong>: Images or videos already catalogued by authorities as CSAM. Your device creates <em>hash fingerprints</em> of your content and compares them against databases of known illegal material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unknown potential content</strong>: Photos or videos that might constitute CSAM but haven’t been previously identified. AI algorithms analyze visual elements (like exposed skin) to flag potentially problematic content based on statistical models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grooming behavior</strong>: Text analysis using AI to identify communication patterns that match predefined indicators of adults soliciting children. This involves scanning the actual content of your private conversations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If something gets flagged, it automatically gets reported to authorities. No human checks it first, that would be impossible given the billions of daily messages. This would be mandatory for all messaging platforms in 🇪🇺 Europe.</p>

<h3>Why This Breaks Encryption 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#why-this-breaks-encryption" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>

  
  
  
  





<p>ChatControl <strong>doesn’t break encryption, it bypasses it entirely</strong>. While your messages still get encrypted during transmission, the system defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption by examining your content before it gets encrypted. True <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank">E2EE</a> means only you and your recipient can read messages: no government, no company, no algorithm should peek inside. This surveillance violates that principle by inserting monitoring at the source.</p>
<p>Privacy-focused companies like Proton <a href="https://proton.me/blog/fr/why-client-side-scanning-isnt-the-answer" target="_blank">point out</a> this approach might be <strong>worse than encryption backdoors</strong>. Backdoors give authorities access to communications you share with others. This system examines everything on your device, whether you share it or not.</p>
<p>Your encrypted messaging app becomes spyware. Supporters claim this protects privacy because scanning happens locally, but surveillance built into your device makes it <strong>impossible to escape</strong>.</p>

<h3>Governance Structure

</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes" target="_blank">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The proposal would create a centralized <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2976" target="_blank">EU Centre on Child Sexual Abuse</a> to receive all reports, but EU institutions wouldn’t control the scanning technology itself.</p>
<p>Service providers would face additional obligations beyond scanning. They would need to conduct <em>risk assessments</em> to evaluate and minimize the potential for illegal content sharing on their platforms. This requires collecting detailed information about their users (<em>age groups, content types</em>) that many privacy-focused services deliberately avoid gathering.</p>
<p>The regulation also pushes for mandatory age verification systems. No viable, privacy-respecting age verification technology currently exists. These systems would eliminate online anonymity, requiring users to prove their identity to access digital services.</p>

  </span>

  <span><strong>Rules for thee, but not for me</strong>: While ordinary Europeans would have all their messages scanned, the proposed legislation includes exemptions for government accounts used for “<em>national security purposes, maintaining law and order or military purposes</em>”. Convenient.</span>

<p>ChatControl fits into a broader political strategy. Since the 1990s <em>crypto wars</em>, certain states have argued that privacy-protecting technologies, especially encryption, obstruct police investigations. These technologies are designed to do exactly that, protect everyone’s ability to control their expression and communication.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-presents-roadmap-effective-and-lawful-access-data-law-enforcement-2025-06-24_en" target="_blank">Roadmap for Lawful Access to Data</a> wants to make all digital data accessible to authorities by 2030. This involves systematically weakening encryption rather than simply bypassing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a>’s revelations ten years ago led to widespread adoption of encryption and institutional consensus supporting the right to encrypted communication. But governments remain frustrated by their inability to access private communications. We’re seeing a return to authoritarian positions using terrorism, organized crime and child exploitation as justifications for undermining encryption.</p>
<p>🇩🇰 <strong>Danish Minister of Justice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hummelgaard" target="_blank">Peter Hummelgaard</a></strong>, chief architect of the current ChatControl proposal, <a href="https://www.ft.dk/samling/20231/almdel/REU/spm/1426/index.htm" target="_blank">recently stated</a>: <em>“We must break with the totally erroneous perception that it is everyone’s civil liberty to communicate on encrypted messaging services.”</em> Well, there you have it folks: <strong>encrypted communication</strong> isn’t a civil liberty anymore. You <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk" target="_blank">cypherpunks</a> were wrong all along. /s</p>
<p>Similarly in 🇫🇷 France, both Bernard Cazeneuve and Emmanuel Macron have explicitly stated their desire to control encrypted messaging, seeking to pierce the privacy of millions who use these services.</p>
<p>CSAR provides the perfect opportunity for member states to finally design and implement a generalized surveillance tool for monitoring population communications. Crossing this threshold means eliminating all confidentiality from communications using digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>These scanning systems get it wrong most of the time. <strong>Studies show approximately 80% of algorithmic reports are false positives</strong>: innocent content incorrectly flagged as illegal. 🇮🇪 Irish law enforcement <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/" target="_blank">confirms this</a>: only 20.3% of 4,192 automated reports actually contained illegal material.</p>

<p>Even with hypothetical 99% accuracy (<em>which current systems don’t achieve</em>), scanning billions of daily messages would generate millions of false accusations. Police resources would be overwhelmed investigating innocent families sharing vacation photos while real crimes go uninvestigated.</p>
<p>Innocent content regularly triggers these systems: family photos, teenage conversations, educational materials and medical communications. Consider this real case: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html" target="_blank">a father was automatically reported to police</a> after sending photos of his child’s medical condition to their doctor. Google’s algorithms flagged this legitimate medical consultation as potential abuse, permanently closed his account and refused all appeals. His digital life was destroyed by an algorithm that couldn’t distinguish between medical care and criminal activity.</p>

<h3>Scientific Opposition

<p>For the third time in three years, over 600 cryptographers, security researchers and scientists across 35 countries have <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/danger-to-democracy-500-top-scientists-urge-eu-governments-to-reject-technically-infeasible-chat-control/" target="_blank">co-signed an open letter</a> explaining why this mass scanning project is “<em>technically unfeasible</em>”, constitutes a “<em>danger to democracy</em>” and would “<em>completely compromise</em>” the security and privacy of all European citizens.</p>
<p>The letter emphasizes that client-side scanning cannot distinguish between legal and illegal content without fundamentally breaking encryption and creating vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Commission has provided no serious studies demonstrating the effectiveness, reliability or appropriateness of these intrusive measures for actually protecting children. Industry claims appear to have taken precedence over evidence-based policy-making.</p>
<p>Genuine security emerges through thoughtful design where security measures and civil liberties function as complementary forces, not opposing ones.</p>

<h3>Easily Defeated 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#easily-defeated" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>The fundamental flaw in ChatControl becomes clear when examining how easily determined actors can circumvent these scanning systems. Criminals don’t need sophisticated techniques to bypass client-side scanning; they use well-documented public knowledge already employed by malicious actors.</p>
<p><strong>Layered Encryption</strong><br>
Encrypt files with standard tools like <a href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_blank">GPG</a> before messaging. Hell, even a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank">Caesar cipher</a> would be sufficient to bypass detection. Since client-side scanning occurs after user encryption but before transport encryption, pre-encrypted content looks like random data to detection algorithms. Recipients decrypt locally with shared keys.</p>
<p><strong>External Platform Bypass</strong><br>
Upload content to any third-party platform (Dropbox, OneDrive, anonymous file hosts, or obscure hosting services) and share links instead of files. The scanner sees innocent text containing a URL while the actual content sits untouched on external servers.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Messaging Clients</strong><br>
Open-source protocols like <a href="https://xmpp.org/" target="_blank">XMPP</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank">Matrix</a> allow custom client development. Modified clients can automatically implement cloud storage and encryption workflows transparently. Users experience normal messaging while completely evading surveillance infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Steganography</strong><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" target="_blank">Steganographic techniques</a> embed data within innocent images. Family photos can carry hidden payloads invisible to both human operators and AI systems. Tools like <a href="https://www.openstego.com/" target="_blank">OpenStego</a> make this accessible to average users.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Migration</strong><br>
Criminal networks can shift to decentralized platforms, peer-to-peer networks or services outside EU jurisdiction. Tor-based messaging, blockchain communications or servers in non-compliant countries remain beyond ChatControl’s reach.</p>
<p>ChatControl catches only amateur criminals who directly attach problematic content to messages. Professional networks already employ these evasion techniques as standard practice. EU legislation won’t make them forget how computers work.</p>
<p>The system fails at protecting children while succeeding at mass civilian monitoring. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_a_bug,_it%27s_a_feature" target="_blank">It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.</a></p>

<p>The child protection narrative masks concerning business interests. The European Commission based its CSAR proposal primarily on claims from industry players rather than independent research.</p>
<p>Commercial surveillance companies would manage the technology with guaranteed access to the European market. Organizations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28organization%29" target="_blank">Thorn</a> (co-founded by actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Kutcher" target="_blank">Ashton Kutcher</a>), Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna" target="_blank">PhotoDNA</a> and other tech companies develop these detection systems while simultaneously lobbying for regulations that would require their adoption across Europe.</p>
<p>These companies develop the detection technologies and lobby for laws mandating their adoption, creating a profitable feedback loop. The proposal would secure privileged market positions for surveillance companies across hundreds of millions of European users. Pretty nice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>These systems would be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proprietary</strong>: Built on closed-source code with methods hidden from public view</li>
<li><strong>Unverifiable</strong>: Operating without meaningful external examination or accountability</li>
<li><strong>Legally powerful</strong>: Capable of starting criminal proceedings through algorithmic decisions</li>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children" target="_blank">Think of the children</a>” is a well-documented political rhetoric technique that appeals to emotion rather than evidence. While child protection is genuinely important, this approach frames any opposition as being against child welfare, making nuanced discussion more difficult.</p>
<p>This creates a false choice. Privacy isn’t a luxury for troublemakers, it’s a <strong>fundamental right</strong> that protects journalists, whistleblowers, activists and ordinary people from unwarranted intrusion.</p>
<p>Critics aren’t opposing child protection. We’re questioning whether undermining privacy rights for 450 million 🇪🇺 Europeans is the most effective approach when targeted alternatives exist that preserve rights.</p>

<ul>
<li>🇧🇪 <strong>Belgium</strong>: The N-VA party calls ChatControl a <em>“monster that invades your privacy and cannot be tamed”</em>. Despite this, Belgium backed Denmark’s compromise during September meetings. Mixed signals from Brussels.</li>
<li>🇩🇪 <strong>Germany</strong>: Won’t break encryption but wants to find middle ground. They’re trying to craft their own compromise instead of rejecting ChatControl outright. Germany’s fence-sitting could be decisive.</li>
<li>🇬🇷 <strong>Greece</strong>: Still figuring out the technical details. No clear stance yet.</li>
<li>🇮🇹 <strong>Italy</strong>: Has concerns about expanding the scope to cover new CSAM detection. Rome seems hesitant about how far this thing could reach.</li>
<li>🇱🇻 <strong>Latvia</strong>: The government likes what they see on paper but worries about political backlash after summer attention. Classic politicians hedging their bets.</li>
<li>🇸🇰 <strong>Slovakia</strong>: Playing the wait-and-see game. No commitment either way.</li>
<li>🇸🇮 <strong>Slovenia</strong>: Dealing with constitutional headaches around privacy. Another country wrestling with legal implications.</li>
<li>🇸🇪 <strong>Sweden</strong>: Stockholm is still reading the fine print. Taking their time to decide.</li>

<p><strong>Current situation</strong>: Country positions continue shifting regularly since September 12. With 12 countries supporting, 7 opposing, and 8 undecided, ChatControl supporters still fall short of the 65% EU population threshold needed for a qualified majority. The opposition maintains enough demographic weight to block the proposal for now, but the situation remains fluid as the interim regulation approaches expiration.</p>

<p>The effects of these proposals go beyond individual privacy concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity gets compromised</strong><br>
Adding deliberate vulnerabilities to encryption creates weaknesses that everyone can exploit. Any backdoor for authorized access becomes a potential entry point for criminals and foreign intelligence services. In February 2024, the 🇪🇺 European Court of Human Rights <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/european-court-of-human-rights-confirms-weakening-of-encryption-can-violate-the-human-right-to-privacy/" target="_blank">already determined</a> that mandating weakened encryption “<em>cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society</em>”.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation suffers</strong><br>
🇪🇺 European cybersecurity companies would face an impossible situation in global markets. How could they credibly sell security solutions when regulations require them to build in access mechanisms that undermine those very protections?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Buy our ultra-secure encrypted stuff!” (Terms and conditions apply, government backdoors included)."</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tech companies will leave Europe</strong><br>
Privacy-focused services that moved to 🇪🇺 Europe after the Snowden revelations are already signaling they might leave. Signal has explicitly said it would stop operating in 🇪🇺 Europe rather than compromise its security.</p>
<p>Even 🇨🇭 Switzerland, traditionally seen as a privacy haven, is facing severe legislative pressures that are forcing tech companies to relocate. Proton has confirmed it has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/is-proton-leaving-switzerland-legal-uncertainty-of-proposed-surveillance-laws-is-pushing-them-to-make-several-changes" target="_blank">begun moving some of its physical infrastructure out of Switzerland</a> due to “<em>legal uncertainty</em>” over the proposed surveillance law amendments. Lumo, their AI chatbot, became the first product <a href="https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai" target="_blank">to relocate</a>, moving to Germany instead of Switzerland specifically because of these legislative concerns.</p>
<p>The Swiss <strong>OSCPT</strong> (<em>Ordinance on the Surveillance of Correspondence by Post and Telecommunications</em>) revision would require VPNs and messaging apps to identify users and retain data for up to six months, plus decrypt communications upon authority request. As Proton’s CEO <strong>Andy Yen</strong> explained, these are proposals that “<em>have been outlawed in the EU</em>” but could soon become reality in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Other privacy-focused providers like Tuta have <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/switzerland-surveillance-plan" target="_blank">expressed</a> similar concerns and contingency plans to leave 🇨🇭 Switzerland if the surveillance laws pass.</p>
<p><strong>Europe might become dependent on US surveillance</strong><br>
I’m not so sure on this one, but by outsourcing surveillance technology to American companies, 🇪🇺 Europe may create dangerous dependencies. These companies operate under 🇺🇸 US jurisdiction and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act" target="_blank">CLOUD Act</a>, potentially allowing 🇺🇸 Washington to access data collected on 🇪🇺 European citizens. Under the pretense of child protection, the 🇪🇺 EU risks handing surveillance keys to foreign powers.</p>
<p><strong>Social behavior changes</strong><br>
When people know they’re being watched, they change how they communicate. People start self-censoring, avoiding certain topics and carefully choosing their words even in private conversations.</p>
<p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect" target="_blank">chilling effect</a>. Rights don’t disappear overnight: they erode gradually as people change their behavior to avoid potential problems.</p>

<p>The irony is kinda painful: the continent that built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank">GDPR</a> to protect digital privacy now designs ChatControl to dismantle it systematically. What was once a fundamental right could become mandatory surveillance.</p>
<p>ChatControl represents a historic choice for 🇪🇺 Europe. Either we become the first democracy to normalize mass surveillance of private communications or we defend the digital rights that made Europe a global privacy leader.</p>

Its initial findings have now led the company to cancel the unit’s access to some of its cloud storage and AI services.</p><p>Equipped with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity and computing power, Unit 8200 had built an indiscriminate new system allowing its intelligence officers to collect, play back and analyse the content of cellular calls of an entire population.</p><p>The project was so expansive that, according to sources from Unit 8200 – which is equivalent in its remit to the US National Security Agency – a mantra emerged internally that captured its scale and ambition: “A million calls an hour.”</p><p>According to several sources, the enormous repository of intercepted calls – which amounted to as much as 8,000 terabytes of data – was held in a Microsoft datacentre in the Netherlands.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-09-25</p><section><p>4 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1ekIsDppJhAU4ktpHPSC2v/9c94c6383d3e759cc9c0eb588191c39a/unnamed__31_.png" alt=""><div><p>If you are building an application, you rely on email to communicate with your users. You validate their signup, notify them about events, and send them invoices through email. The service continues to find new purpose with agentic workflows and other AI-powered tools that rely on a simple email as an input or output.</p><p>And it is a pain for developers to manage. It’s frequently the most annoying burden for most teams. Developers deserve a solution that is simple, reliable, and deeply integrated into their workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we're excited to announce just that: the private beta of Email Sending, a new capability that allows you to send transactional emails directly from Cloudflare Workers. Email Sending joins and expands our popular <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/"><u>Email Routing</u></a> product, and together they form the new Cloudflare Email Service — a single, unified developer experience for all your email needs.</p><p>With Cloudflare Email Service, we’re distilling our years of experience <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/"><u>securing</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/"><u>routing</u></a> emails, and combining it with the power of the developer platform. Now, sending an email is as easy as adding a binding to a Worker and calling <code>send</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="49212c252526092c31282439252c672a2624">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" }],
      from: { email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0362736a2e70666d676671437a6c76712e676c6e626a6d2d606c6e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>", name: "Your App" },
      subject: "Hello World",
      text: "Hello World!"
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  },
};</code></pre>
            <p><b>Email experience is user experience</b></p><p>Email is a core tenet of your user experience. It’s how you stay in touch with your users when they are outside your applications. Users rely on email to inform them when they need to take actions such as password resets, purchase receipts, magic login links, and onboarding flows. When they fail, your application fails.</p><p>That means it’s crucial that emails need to land in your users’ inboxes, both reliably and quickly. A magic link that arrives ten minutes late is a lost user. An email delivered to a spam folder breaks user flows and can erode trust in your product. That’s why we’re focusing on deliverability and time-to-inbox with Cloudflare Email Service.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, we’re tightly integrating with DNS to automatically configure the necessary DNS records — like SPF, DKIM and DMARC — such that email providers can verify your sending domain and trust your emails. Plus, in true Cloudflare fashion, Email Service is a global service. That means that we can deliver your emails with low latency anywhere in the world, without the complexity of managing servers across regions.</p><p><b>Simple and flexible for developers</b></p><p>Treating email as a core piece of your application also means building for every touchpoint in your development workflow. We’re building Email Service as part of the Cloudflare stack to make developing with email feels as natural as writing a Worker.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, that means solving for every part of the transactional email workflow:</p><ul><li><p>Starting with Email Service is easy. Instead of managing API keys and secrets, you can use the <code>Email</code> binding to your <code>wrangler.jsonc</code> and send emails securely and with no risk of leaked credentials.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You can use Workers to process incoming mail, store attachments in R2, and add tasks to Queues to get email sending off the hot path of your application. And you can use <code>wrangler</code> to emulate Email Sending locally, allowing you to test your user journeys without jumping between tools and environments.</p></li><li><p>In production, you have clear observability over your emails with bounce rates and delivery events. And, when a user reports a missing email, you can quickly dive into the delivery status to debug issues quickly and help get your user back on track.</p></li></ul><p>We’re also making sure Email Service seamlessly fits into your existing applications. If you’ve been leaning on existing email frameworks (like <a href="https://react.email/"><u>React Email</u></a>) to send rich, HTML-rendered emails to users, you can continue to use them with Email Service. Import the library, render your template, and pass it to the <code>send</code> method just as you would elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>import { render, pretty, toPlainText } from '@react-email/render';
import { SignupConfirmation } from './templates';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    // Convert React Email template to html
    const html = await pretty(await render(&lt;SignupConfirmation url="https://your-domain.com/confirmation-id"/&gt;));

    // Use the Email Sending binding to send emails
    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="58303d343437183d20393528343d763b3735">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" }],
      from: { email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f392839ade80969d979681b38a9c8681de979c9e929a9ddd909c9e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>", name: "Welcome" },
      subject: "Signup Confirmation",
      html,
      text: toPlainText(html)
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  }
};</code></pre>
            <p><b>Email Routing and Email Sending: Better together</b></p><p>Sending email is only half the story. Applications often need to receive and parse emails to create powerful workflows. By combining Email Sending with our existing <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing"><u>Email Routing</u></a> capabilities, we're providing a complete, end-to-end solution for all your application's email needs.</p><p>Email Routing allows you to create custom email addresses on your domain and handle incoming messages programmatically with a Worker, which can enable powerful application flows such as:</p><ul><li><p>Using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"><u>Workers AI</u></a> to parse, summarize and even label incoming emails: flagging security events from customers, early signs of a bug or incident, and/or generating automatic responses based on those incoming emails.</p></li><li><p>Creating support tickets in systems like JIRA or Linear from emails sent to <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7c0f090c0c130e083c0513090e511813111d1512521f1311">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p></li><li><p>Processing invoices sent to <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="442d2a322b2d272137043d2b313669202b29252d2a6a272b29">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> and storing attachments in R2.</p></li></ul><p>To use Email Routing, add the <code>email</code> handler to your Worker application and process it as needed:</p>
            <pre><code>export default {
  // Create an email handler to process emails delivered to your Worker
  async email(message, env, ctx) {

    // Classify incoming emails using Workers AI
    const { score, label } = env.AI.run("@cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8", { text: message.raw" })

    env.PROCESSED_EMAILS.send({score, label, message});
  },
};  </code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-15e178">After hospitals were acquired by private equity firms, patient death rates in the emergency departments rose by 13% compared with similar hospitals, according to research published this week in <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03471" target="_blank">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p><p id="anchor-7ffa60">The research, which compared outcomes at hospitals over a 10-year period, adds fresh evidence to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/patients-private-equity-hospitals-more-infections-falls-jama-study-rcna130956">previous studies </a>showing harmful patient outcomes and <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/private-equity-investments-health-care-may-increase-costs-degrade-quality">higher costs</a> among health care entities owned by profit-oriented financiers. </p><p id="anchor-989875">The increased deaths in emergency departments at private equity-owned hospitals are most likely the result of reduced staffing levels after the acquisitions, which the study also measured, said Dr. Zirui Song, a co-author and associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p><p id="anchor-544dcb">After hospitals were acquired by private equity, the number of full-time employees fell by an average 11.6% compared with non-private equity facilities, the research found, and salary expenditures in the emergency departments and intensive care units declined by 18% and 16%, respectively. </p><p id="anchor-22482c">“Most hospital care in the country remains a face-to-face, human, labor-intensive endeavor, especially in emergency departments and ICUs,” Song said in an interview. “When human labor is cut to this extent in staffing sensitive areas of the hospital, patient harm can plausibly ensue, including mortality.”</p><p id="anchor-e94edc"><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/deaths-rose-emergency-rooms-after-hospitals-were-acquired-private-equity-firms">The new study</a> analyzed 1 million emergency department visits by Medicare patients at 49 private equity-owned hospitals from 2009 through 2019. The researchers compared the outcomes of those visits with more than 6 million visits at 293 matched hospitals — those of similar size and location  — not acquired by private equity. </p><p id="anchor-16f972">The study’s co-authors, in addition to Song, are José R. Zubizarreta of Harvard University, Dr. Sneha Kannan of the University of Pittsburgh, Joseph Dov Bruch of the University of Chicago and Dr. Jennifer Stevens, director of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p id="anchor-b18fb7">Song said the new research differed from previous studies on private equity’s impact, which focused on patients who were admitted to the hospital.</p><p id="anchor-9c772e">“There are far more patients who come into the emergency department than patients who are actually admitted into the wards of the hospital,” Song said, “so this study looks at a patient population that had not been examined in great depth before.”</p><p id="anchor-2378ab">Private equity firms are sophisticated financial operators that buy companies, typically loading them with large amounts of debt to pay for the acquisitions. The firms hope to sell the companies for profit a few years later.</p><p id="anchor-1e4961">The private equity industry has <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care" target="_blank">poured over $1 trillion </a>into health care companies in recent years. Health care has been a focus of the financiers because it accounts for 18% of <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet">gross domestic product </a>in the United States.</p><p id="anchor-7320fe">Because their acquisitions add debt costs to the companies they buy, those operations must cut other expenses to offset the burden. Employees are <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-lawmakers-renew-legislative-push-to-stop-private-equity-looting" target="_blank">often the first to be fired</a>, and costs are often increased to generate higher profits. Some hospitals owned by private-equity firms sell the land under their buildings, enriching the owners but saddling the facilities with higher rent costs. </p><p id="anchor-d32c1f">Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine, said the new research confirms what doctors in the field have long complained about: being stretched too thin by private equity owners.</p><p id="anchor-88add3">“When private equity comes in, they try to jack up the revenues and then, when that reaches an end point, they start slashing expenses,” McNamara said in an interview. “Instead of people just losing their jobs, you have bad patient outcomes here. Less staff equals worse outcomes.”</p><p id="anchor-a48c4b">The new research on increased deaths in emergency departments at private equity-owned hospitals aligns with a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28474">2021 study</a> that found 11% higher mortality rates at nursing homes owned by private equity. That study, by academics at New York University, the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that lower nursing staffs and declines in compliance with care standards contributed to the increased deaths at financier-owned homes.</p><p id="anchor-24fa62">Some states are enacting laws to rein in private equity’s impact on health care. In June, Oregon <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/06/09/bill-enacting-nations-strictest-limits-on-corporate-health-care-influence-signed-by-gov-kotek/" target="_blank">enacted a law</a> limiting the control corporations and private equity can have over health care operations. And in Indiana, a new law <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/indianas-health-care-reporting-law-to-give-private-equity-pause" target="_blank">expands the attorney general’s powers</a> to investigate health care transactions and mandates reporting on ownership stakes in health care entities by private equity investors and other owners.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/gretchen-morgenson-ncpn1100071" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="focal" data-original-height="48" data-original-width="48"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2023_08/3595677/gretchen-morgenson-byline-jm-1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_08/3595677/gretchen-morgenson-byline-jm-1.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_08/3595677/gretchen-morgenson-byline-jm-1.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/gretchen-morgenson-ncpn1100071">Gretchen Morgenson</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/gmorgenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="https://facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:gretchen.morgenson@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Gretchen Morgenson is the senior financial reporter in the Investigations unit at NBC News.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Most tools can only diagnose abnormalities that are common in training data, and models often don’t work as well outside of their test conditions. Second, attempts to give models more tasks have run into legal hurdles: regulators and medical insurers so far are reluctant to approve or cover fully autonomous radiology models. Third, even when they do diagnose accurately, models replace only a small share of a radiologist’s job. Human radiologists spend a minority of their time on diagnostics and the majority on other activities, like talking to patients and fellow clinicians.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly spreading across the economy and society. But radiology shows us that it will not necessarily dominate every field in its first years of diffusion — at least until these common hurdles are overcome. Exploiting all of its benefits will involve adapting it to society, and society’s rules to it.</p><p><span>All AIs are functions or algorithms, called models, that take in inputs and spit out outputs. Radiology models are trained to detect a finding, which is a measurable piece of evidence that helps identify or rule out a disease or condition. </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12044510/" rel="">Most radiology models</a><span> detect a single finding or condition in one type of image. For example, a model might look at a chest CT and answer whether there are </span><a href="https://www.qure.ai/news_press_coverages/qure.ai-launches-FDA-cleared-AI-solution-for-advanced-lung-nodule-quantification-on-CT-scans-at-AABIP-2024" rel="">lung nodules</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.signifyresearch.net/insights/ai-in-medical-imaging-news-round-up-february-2025/" rel="">rib fractures</a><span>, or what the </span><a href="https://www.signifyresearch.net/insights/ai-in-medical-imaging-news-round-up-february-2025/" rel="">coronary arterial calcium score</a><span> is.</span></p><p>For every individual question, a new model is required. In order to cover even a modest slice of what they see in a day, a radiologist would need to switch between dozens of models and ask the right questions of each one. Several platforms manage, run, and interpret outputs from dozens or even hundreds of separate AI models across vendors, but each model operates independently, analyzing for one finding or disease at a time. The final output is a list of separate answers to specific questions, rather than a single description of an image.</p><p><span>Even with hundreds of imaging algorithms approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the market, the combined footprint of today’s radiology AI models still cover only a small fraction of real-world imaging tasks. Many cluster around a few use cases: stroke, breast cancer, and lung cancer together account for </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10546456/" rel="">about 60 percent</a><span> of models, but only a </span><a href="https://media.market.us/medical-imaging-statistics/" rel="">minority of the actual radiology imaging</a><span> volume that is carried out in the US. Other subspecialties, such as vascular, head and neck, spine, and thyroid imaging currently have </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11816879/#:~:text=subspecialties%20including%20vascular%2C%20head/neck%2C%20spine%2C%20thyroid%2C%20and%20FDG%20PET%2DCT%20imaging%20have%20relatively%20few%20AI%20products%20(between%201%20and%202)" rel="">relatively few AI products</a><span>. This is in part due to data availability: the scan needs to be common enough for there to be many annotated examples that can be used to train models. Some scans are also inherently more complicated than others. For example, ultrasounds are taken from multiple angles and do not have standard imaging planes, unlike X-rays.</span></p><p><span>Once deployed outside of the hospital where they were initially trained, models can struggle. In a standard clinical trial, samples are taken from multiple hospitals to ensure exposure to a broad range of patients and to avoid site-specific effects, such as a single doctor’s technique or how a hospital chooses to calibrate its diagnostic equipment.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-174517364" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists#footnote-1-174517364" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> But when an algorithm is undergoing regulatory approval in the US, its developers will normally test it on a relatively narrow dataset.

Public benchmarks tend to rely on multiple datasets from the same hospital.</span></p><p><span>The performance of a tool can </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1002683" rel="">drop</a><span> as much as 20 percentage points when it is tested out of sample, on data from other hospitals. </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002683" rel="">In one study</a><span>, a pneumonia detection model trained on chest X-rays from a single hospital performed substantially worse when tested at a different hospital. Some of </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01037-4" rel="">these challenges</a><span> stemmed from avoidable experimental issues like overfitting, but others are indicative of deeper problems like differences in how hospitals record and generate data, such as using slightly different imaging equipment. This means that individual hospitals or departments would need to retrain or revalidate today’s crop of tools before adopting them, even if they have been proven elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>The limitations of radiology models stem from deeper problems with building medical AI. Training datasets come with strict inclusion criteria, where the diagnosis must be unambiguous (typically </span><a href="https://blog.mozilla.ai/the-importance-of-ground-truth-data-in-ai-applications-an-overview/" rel="">confirmed</a><span> by a consensus of two to three experts or a pathology result) and without images that are shot at an odd angle, look too dark, or are blurry. This skews performance towards the easiest cases, which doctors are already best at diagnosing, and away from real-world images. In one 2022 </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9221818/" rel="">study</a><span>, an algorithm that was meant to spot pneumonia on chest X-rays faltered when the disease presented in subtle or mild forms, or when other lung conditions resembled pneumonia, such as pleural effusions, where fluid builds up in lungs, or in atelectasis (collapsed lung). Humans also benefit from context: one radiologist told me about a model they use that labels surgical staples as hemorrhages, because of the bright streaks they create in the image.</span></p><p><span>Medical imaging datasets used for training also tend to have fewer cases from </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.06.25328913v1" rel="">children</a><span>, women, and ethnic minorities, making their performance generally worse for these demographics.

The result is that radiology models often predict only a narrow slice of the world,</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-174517364" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists#footnote-2-174517364" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> though there are scenarios where AI models do perform well, including identifying common diseases like pneumonia or certain tumors.</span></p><p><span>The problems don’t stop there. Even a model for the precise question you need and in the hospital where it was trained is unlikely to perform as well in clinical practice as it did in the benchmark. In benchmark studies, researchers isolate a cohort of scans, define goals in quantitative metrics, such as the sensitivity (the percentage of people with the condition who are correctly identified by the test) and specificity (the percentage of people </span><em>without</em><span> the condition who are correctly identified as such), and compare the performance of a model to the score of another reviewer, typically a human doctor. Clinical studies, on the other hand, show how well the model performs in a real healthcare setting without controls.

The gap was largest when computer aids failed to recognize the malignancy itself; many doctors seemed to treat an absence of prompts as reassurance that a film was clean.

Without a doctor involved whose behavior might change we might expect real-world results to match benchmark scores. But regulatory requirements and insurance policies are slowing the adoption of fully autonomous radiology AI.</p><p><span>The FDA </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/160125/download?utm_" rel="">splits imaging software</a><span> into two regulatory lanes: assistive or triage tools, which require a licensed physician to read the scan and sign the chart, and autonomous tools, which do not. Makers of assistive tools simply have to show that their software can match the performance of tools that are already on the market. Autonomous tools have to clear a much higher bar: they must demonstrate that the AI tool will refuse to read any scan that is blurry, uses an unusual scanner, or is outside its competence. The bar is higher because, once the human disappears, a latent software defect could harm thousands before anyone notices.</span></p><p><span>Meeting that criteria is difficult. Even state-of-the-art vision networks falter with images that lack contrast, have unexpected angles, or lots of different artefacts. IDx-DR, a diabetic retinopathy screener and one of the few cleared to operate autonomously, comes with </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN180001.pdf?utm_" rel="">guardrails</a><span>: the patient must be an adult with no prior retinopathy diagnosis; there must be two macula-centred photographs of the fundus (the rear of the eye) with a resolution of at least 1,000 times 1,000 pixels; if glare, small pupils or poor focus degrade quality, the software must self-abort and refer the patient to an eye care professional.</span></p><p>Stronger evidence and improved performance could eventually clear both hurdles, but other requirements would still delay widespread use. For example, if you retrain a model, you are required to receive new approval even if the previous model was approved. This contributes to the market generally lagging behind frontier capabilities.</p><p><span>And when autonomous models are approved, malpractice insurers are not eager to cover them. Diagnostic error is the costliest mistake in American medicine, resulting in </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/armstrong-institute/documents/news/2013-4-23-diagnostic-errors-more-common.pdf" rel="">roughly a third</a><span> of all malpractice payouts, and radiologists are perennial defendants. Insurers believe that software makes catastrophic payments more likely than a human clinician, as a broken algorithm can harm many patients at once.

This has historical precedent in the field: in the early 2000s hospitals swapped film jackets for digital systems.

A </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3043948/" rel="">study</a><span> at Vancouver General found that the switch boosted radiologist productivity 27 percent for plain radiography and 98 percent for CT within a year of going filmless. This occurred alongside other advancements in imaging technology that made scans faster to execute. Yet, no radiologists were laid off.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the overall American utilization rate per 1,000 insured patients for all imaging </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21962785/" rel="">increased by 60 percent</a><span> from 2000 to 2008. This is </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-09-559.pdf" rel="">not explained</a><span> by a commensurate increase in physician visits. Instead, each visit was associated with more imaging on average. Before digitization, the nonmonetary price of imaging was high: the </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4586334/" rel="">median reporting turnaround time</a><span> for x-rays was 76 hours for patients discharged from emergency departments, and 84 hours for admitted patients. After departments digitized, these times dropped to 38 hours and 35 hours, respectively.</span></p><p><span>Faster scans give doctors more options. Until the early 2000s, only exceptional trauma cases would receive whole-body CT scans; the increased speed of CT turnaround times mean that they are now a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031348211061330?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.8" rel="">common</a><span> choice. This is a reflection of elastic demand, a concept in economics that describes when demand for a product or service is very sensitive to changes in price. In this case, when these scans got cheaper in terms of waiting time, demand for those scans increased.</span></p><p><span>Over the past decade, improvements in image interpretation have run far ahead of their diffusion. Hundreds of models can spot bleeds, nodules, and clots, yet AI is often limited to assistive use on a small subset of scans in any given practice. And despite </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HMPRXstSvQ" rel="">predictions</a><span> to the contrary, head counts and salaries have continued to rise. The promise of AI in radiology is overstated by benchmarks alone.</span></p><p>Multi‑task foundation models may widen coverage, and different training sets could blunt data gaps. But many hurdles cannot be removed with better models alone: the need to counsel the patient, shoulder malpractice risk, and receive accreditation from regulators. Each hurdle makes full substitution the expensive, risky option and human plus machine the default. Sharp increases in AI capabilities could certainly alter this dynamic, but it is a useful model for the first years of AI models that benchmark well at tasks associated with a particular career.</p><p><span>However, there are industries where conditions are different. Large platforms </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-artificial-intelligence-harmful-content-misinformation/" rel="">rely heavily</a><span> on AI systems to triage or remove harmful or policy-violating content.

But many of the more sophisticated knowledge jobs look more like radiology.</span></p><p>In many jobs, tasks are diverse, stakes are high, and demand is elastic. When this is the case, we should expect software to, at least initially, lead to more human work, not less. The lesson from a decade of radiology models is neither optimism about increased output nor dread about replacement. Models can lift productivity, but their implementation depends on behavior, institutions and incentives. For now, the paradox has held: the better the machines, the busier radiologists have become.</p><p><em>Deena Mousa</em><span> </span><em><span>is a lead researcher at Open Philanthropy.

    <p>
      I recently attended the
      <a href="https://goatmire.com/">Goatmire Elixir Conf</a>
      and one of the standout talks for me was
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sasajuric/">Saša Jurić's</a>
      <a href="https://goatmire.com/talk/tell-me-a-story">"Tell Me a Story"</a>.
      It was an incredible presentation that combined theatrical storytelling with practical technical advice. Saša performed parts of his talk in character, turning technical topics into a compelling narrative that was part comedy, part tragedy, and fully packed with useful insights I've started implementing myself. The recording will eventually be released online for viewing. I highly recommend that people watch it, and I'll endeavor to add a link to it here when it becomes available.

    </a></p><h2>The Code Review Challenge</h2>

    <p>
      The talk focused on Code Review and Pull Requests (PRs). Saša laid out common problems most software engineers face. Too often, engineers dread code reviews even though they're a significant part of team collaboration. We avoid them because PRs tend to be too large, too complex, too difficult to comprehend, and too painful to test. So we end up commenting "Looks Good To Me" and suggesting a few minor styling improvements to give the appearance of a thorough review.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is how security leaks happen and codebases become progressively unmaintainable. Since git blame only points to the original author, it's easy to think "if something goes wrong, it's not on me". But we're all responsible for the whole system, regardless of who wrote the individual lines of code.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes a PR Reviewable?</h2>

    <p>
      So how do we review something that feels unreviewable? Saša advocates for normalizing the practice of returning difficult-to-understand PRs to the author. This makes logical sense, but it's challenging to implement because it can feel like admitting we're not smart enough to understand the code. However, saying "I don't understand this enough to approve it" is far more valuable than pretending with an empty "LGTM".
    </p>

    <p>
      If we commit to only reviewing truly reviewable PRs, what does that look like? According to Saša, it should take the average reviewer 5-10 minutes. By 'average reviewer,' he means mid-to-senior developers who understand the domain, business, and tech stack well—not newcomers still learning the system or mythical 10x engineers.
    </p>

    <p>
      How do you create a PR that can be reviewed in 5-10 minutes? By reducing the scope. A full feature should often be multiple PRs. A good rule of thumb is 300 lines of code changes - once you get above 500 lines, you're entering unreviewable territory.
    </p>

    <h2>Telling a Story with Commits</h2>

    <p>
      A key part of having a reviewable PR is writing commits that tell a story. Present your changes incrementally and logically so reviewers can follow your thought process. Generic commit messages such as "add dependency," "implement file upload feature," and "address PR feedback" don’t tell much of a story and leave reviewers guessing. Why was the dependency added? What were the specific steps in creating the file uploader feature? What feedback is being addressed?
    </p>

    <h3>Story-Telling Commit Messages</h3>

    <p>
      After a toast to the demo gods, Saša demonstrated writing story-telling commits with a live coding example, creating a PR that was part of a larger feature. His
      <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/hamlet/pull/3">example PR</a>
      adds just 152 lines of code, removes 2 lines, but uses 13 thoughtful commits.
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/93ugurtvcfo9dp4njj8c.png" alt="image of commit messages"></p><p>
      While some developers might understand those 152 lines from the final diff alone, I couldn't confidently approve it without the commit story.
    </p>

    <h3>Breaking Down the Example</h3>

    <p>
      For instance, looking at the overall diff, I didn't understand why he added
      <code>:runtime_tools</code>
      to <code>applications</code>
      in <code>mix.exs</code>. Following the <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/hamlet/pull/3/commits/b94b851a4e8af5cd0905a70d6edc18a72d492df0">commit narrative</a>, it's clear this was needed for access to
      <code>:scheduler.get_sample()</code>
      to collect the samples. Now I can research that context or ask more pointed questions.
    </p>

    <h3>The Iterative Process</h3>

    <p>
      A huge benefit of seeing this live was witnessing the iterative process. In the <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/hamlet/pull/3/commits/299d745cb8bbaf6731098b74f3643b9472ede4b8">compute average utilization commit</a>, we initially saw an incorrect implementation that computed averages of all schedulers, including offline ones. When testing revealed unexpected results, Saša went back and updated both the code and the commit that originally implemented that function so the story remained coherent.
    </p>

    <p>
      A flow that I find to work well for keeping commit history clean is with fixup commits. A fixup is a small commit that’s explicitly marked to be folded into an earlier commit during an interactive rebase. When you run rebase with autosquash, Git automatically pairs each fixup with its target and tucks the changes into the right place, keeping the story coherent without manual reordering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I sometimes experience creating merge conflicts for myself during this process. Both Saša and I agree that if it becomes too much effort to resolve the conflict, then creating a new commit is ok. Taking the time to put in extra effort to keep the commit history clean and the story coherent makes the PR easier for reviewers to understand.
    </p>

    <h3>The Value of Clean History</h3>

    <p>
      Keeping the commit history clean connects to advice I've heard about ensuring every commit compiles and keeps the application runnable. I used to follow this loosely, but recent experiences with git bisect emphasized to me its importance. (If you are unfamiliar with
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git bisect</a>
      , it's worth checking out; it uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project's history introduced a bug.)
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a few factors that make narrowing down when and how a regression was introduced more challenging. If a commit doesn't compile, I can't isolate whether the bug first appeared there. If the bug appeared in a commit that had hundreds of lines of code changed, determining which part of the commit is the issue requires significantly more reasoning. A clean commit history with messages that tell a story makes these kinds of investigations easier.
    </p>

    <h2>Making Review a Collaborative Success</h2>

    <p>
      When we present focused PRs with commits that tell clear stories, we get feedback sooner and our development cycles speed up. When reviewers understand our changes, we're more likely to receive valuable feedback instead of blanket approvals, and we're more likely to ship quality code. When our commits make sense, we can travel back in time as needed to understand how our codebase evolved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to Saša's theatrical lesson, I will be more intentional about crafting commit stories. The next time you're preparing a PR, consider:
      <strong>Are you telling a story your reviewers can follow?</strong>
      Start small - maybe focus on just one aspect, like keeping PRs under that 300-line guideline or writing more descriptive commit messages. Your future reviewers (and your future debugging self) will thank you.
    </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>25 Sep 2025</p><p>I’ve spent 15 years of my life working on Bundler. When I introduce myself, people say “oh, the Bundler guy?”, and I am forced to agree.</p><p>I didn’t come up with the original idea for Bundler (that was Yehuda). I also didn’t work on the first six months worth of prototypes. That was all Carl and Yehuda together, back when “Carlhuda” was a super-prolific author of Ruby libraries, including most of the work to modularize Rails for version 3.</p><p>I joined the team at a pivotal moment, in February 2010, as the 0.9 prototype was starting to be re-written yet another time into the shape that would finally be released as 1.0. By the time Carl, Yehuda, and I released version 1.0 together in August 2010, we had fully established the structure and commands that Bundler 2.7.2 still uses today.</p><p>I gave my first conference talk about Bundler at Red Dirt Ruby in May 2010. Because they would be too busy with Rails 3 talks, Yehuda and Carl asked me to give the first RailsConf talk about Bundler, in June 2010.</p><p>As Carl and Yehuda drifted off to other projects, in 2011 and 2012 respectively, I took on a larger role, co-maintaining the project with Terence Lee, then on the Ruby platform team at Heroku. We shipped (and, embarrassingly, broke) many versions of Bundler on our way to the 1.1 release and its major speed improvements. We also gave several conference talks together, sharing what we had learned about Bundler, about gems, and about maintaining open source.</p><p>In 2013, I managed to convince the owner of <code>bundler.io</code> to sell me his domain, and rebuilt the website to host a separate copy of the documentation for every version of Bundler, ensuring even users on old versions could still access accurate documentation.</p><p>By the end of 2013, Terence had drifted away from the project as well, and I realized that everyone using Ruby was now one bus (or one lottery ticket) away from Bundler having no significant maintainers. During 2014, I made sure to settle any remaining ownership issues, including purchasing the rights to the Bundler logo, and began investigating various funding ideas. I tried specialized consulting, corporate sponsorships, and asking Ruby Central about sponsoring Bundler and RubyGems development work. Ruby Central declined, citing their desire to stay focused on conferences, but suggested that if I wanted to pursue something myself they would be happy to collaborate.</p><p>In 2015, I founded Ruby Together specifically to raise funds to pay the existing maintainers team of Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org. Over time, we were able to raise enough money to quietly but scrappily keep the entire RubyGems ecosystem maintained and functional. Ruby Together did not ever, at any point, demand any form of governance or control over the existing open source projects. Maintainers did their thing in the RubyGems and Bundler GitHub orgs, while Ruby Together staff and board members did their thing in the rubytogether GitHub org.</p><p>By 2021, when Ruby Central and Ruby Together were both interested in merging together, funds were harder to find. Ruby Together had a membership program. Ruby Central wanted a to have a membership program. The confusing split between “Ruby Central owns the AWS account, but Ruby Together pays all the devs” continued to be a problem.</p><p>We prepared <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/merger-agreement.pdf">a merger agreement</a> (which you can read in full at the link), stating that Ruby Central’s new goal after the merger would be “paying maintainers to do the programming”. The agreement also states that Ruby Central will follow Ruby Together’s <a href="https://github.com/rubycentral/board/blob/38904a634d5993e244911087efdaa54811d2d516/VISION_MISSON_VALUES.md">Vision, Mission, and Values</a>, a document that is hosted in the rubycentral GitHub organization today. That document includes a very specific list of goals, including:</p><ul><li>Project users and maintainers are empowered to decide what’s best for their projects</li><li>Ruby open source developers are paid for their work</li><li>Give control to the community</li><li>Be accountable and transparent to the community</li><li>Establish a collaborative, positive space for projects</li><li>Have a clear and transparent funding process</li></ul><p>You can read much more in both the merger agreement and in the Mission, Vision, and Values document, but the fundamental goal for both the non-profit and the open source projects is clear: this is all for the Ruby community.

<h3>Sep 25 2025</h3>


<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/rEpvdWFczQ" alt=""></p>

<p>These days the internet as a whole is mostly constructed out of point to point ethernet circuits, meaning an ethernet interface (mostly optical) attached directly from one routing device to another routing device.</p>

<p>However that is not always the case, as the humble “internet exchange” (IX) still exists, and while the relevancy of IXs are progressively being diminished by the internet increasingly being concentrated into a small handful of content networks and IXs not keeping up with the lowering price of transit or private fiber connections to the largest networks, there are still a large number of networks that’s attached to at least one IX fabric.</p>

<p>IXs are a little bit strange, as they are at their core practically identical to a simple ethernet switch you may find in your home or office (except your home switch is unlikely to be doing terabits per second of traffic). As IXs depend on the ethernet switches interest in only being the MAC addresses of traffic and not the Layer 3 IP addresses.</p>

<p>However home and small and medium business (SMB) routers often come with defaults that make life a lot easier for networks way of desktop computers and common office equipment on them, these same defaults are at the very least annoying and at the very worst actively exploitable if put on a IX LAN with many untrusted participants.</p>

<h2>bgp.tools “naughty packets” feature</h2>

<p>The company that I run and operate has a large number of ports at internet exchanges (at a rough estimate I am the top 13 of all networks on the internet in this metric!), and alongside the route collecting that bgp.tools does on these IX ports, it also listens in on the broadcast and multicast traffic that happens on these exchanges.</p>

<p>This isn’t that magical, at its core it works by running tcpdump on each IX port, and picking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast,_unknown-unicast_and_multicast_traffic">BUM traffic</a>, parsing what it is looking at (and throwing away the unknown unicast, since that is a separate common problem that I don’t want to get involved with), and reporting that data back up the chain to bgp.tools’s website.</p>

<p>This creates little warning icons (or alerts if they use the monitoring product) on their IX membership rows to let them and others know that something is not configured correctly</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/CNsNutZ5sl" alt=""></p>

<p>When I first started off developing this feature I was basically going off the top of my head on what the obvious mistakes that were likely to happen on misconfigured IX ports. However at the same time I developed a “miscellaneous packets” feed that collected packets that I didn’t have code to deal with.</p>

<h2>Here are all of the things that have found</h2>

<p>Checking that miscellaneous packet feed every week has been a lot of fun and deeply terrifying on what networks have been sending into exchanges. Here are some of the things that bgp.tools finds on a regular basis</p>

<h2>Router/Switch Identification</h2>

<p>With large deployments of routers and switches it is often very difficult to actually locate where each device is plugged into at either end. For this exact reason, many vendors ship protocols that emit various identifier packets that are designed to help operations teams identify the “far side” of each port</p>

<h3>LLDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Low</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Layer_Discovery_Protocol">Link Layer Discovery Protocol</a> is a pretty common cross vendor protocol for doing exactly this, it is also sometimes used to automatically configure capabilities like higher wattage power over ethernet.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a LLDP packet (and what information it discloses) from my own network:</p>

<pre><code>root@blah:~# lldpctl 
------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre>

<h3>CDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: High</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Discovery_Protocol">Cisco Discovery Protocol</a> is a older and proprietary to Cisco (although that does not stop many vendors from having copied it) version of LLDP</p>

<h3>MNDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: High</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p>The popular budget network equipment vendor Mikrotik ships by default with a feature called “<a href="https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/ROS/pages/24805517/Neighbor+discovery">Mikrotik Neighbor Discovery Protocol</a>” enabled by default.</p>

<p>Here is an example decoded MNDP packet from a network on FranceIX</p>

<pre><code>    Seq: 134398
    MAC Address: 08:55:31:1b:9c:aa
    Identity: DC2.A23.CCR02
    Version: 6.49.6 (stable)
    Platform: MikroTik
    Uptime: 2239h52m39s
    SoftwareID: HBWH-7QHV
    Board: CCR1009-7G-1C-1S+
    IPv6Address: 2001:7f8:54::1:85
    InterfaceName: FRANCE_IX
    IPv4Address: 37.49.237.85
</code></pre>

<p>We can see what they named the device , what type of device it is, the interface name (FRANCE_IX), and the device uptime.</p>

<h2>Automatic Addressing</h2>

<p>Most consumer devices when they come on the network do not know what IP address/gateway they are supposed to be using, This is because in most environments you do not want to have machines that have statically configured addresses.</p>

<p>However IX’s are not these kinds of environments, as they are environments where all participants have been assigned a very specific IP address to use on the LAN. This does not stop these automatic IP address assignment protocols from attempting to grab IP addresses with some configurations.</p>

<h3>DHCP / DHCPv6</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: High</p>

<p>Security Danger: Targeted traffic redirection</p>

<p>This is the exact same protocol that your mobile phone or laptop is using, just being blasted out to terabit/s per second switching fabrics. When a IX participant is asking for addresses with DHCP on the exchange, any one of the entities connected (some of which may be considered adversaries of your state) could reply to their request and assign them an IP address and default gateway, the latter possibly redirecting large amounts of traffic through them!</p>

<h3>IPv6 RA</h3>

<p>Commonness: High</p>

<p>Operational Danger: People using your network for free</p>

<p>Security Danger: Low</p>

<p>IPv6 Router Advertisement is a protocol where routers periodically announced onto the LAN but they are capable of acting as a gateway (and optionally include instructions for clients to generate IPv6 addresses automatically), this is useful for IPv6 deployment, but this behavior is absolutely not desirable on internet exchanges as you do not want to have people use you as a gateway for the entire internet over peering LANs, as effectively giving them free internet transit, which is typically bad for business.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this feature is enabled by default on Cisco and Arista, meaning it is so common that bgp.tools has a dedicated icon for it on the site.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/K0278APdn0" alt=""></p>

<h2>Non BGP Routing Protocols</h2>

<p>On exchanges there is generally only one accepted routing protocol that is allowed to be used between members and that is BGP. However that does not seem to stop other networks from accidentally enabling other protocols, some of which automatically “flood” messages to broadcast so they can look for peers to automatically establish relationships with.</p>

<h3>OSPF and IS-IS / ES-IS</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: You will import other peoples internal routes</p>

<p>Security Danger: People can insert routes into your network</p>

<p>OSPF and IS-IS are the classic internal routing protocols that a lot of networks use to manage their internal routing table. This internal routing table is where the more specific routes for individual customers or subscriber pools exist.</p>

<p>While OSPF and IS-IS offer an ability to restrict sessions that are automatically started without a given password in configuration, a decent number of networks do not use this feature.</p>

<p>The result of this is if these networks without a password configured meet each other on the internet exchange with OSPF/IS-IS configured they will automatically exchange internal routing tables of each other, the effects of this could range between a security risk because an attacker could inject routes into their internet routing table, all the way to a full blown outage as there would be overlap in internal network routes.</p>

<h3>RIP / RIPv2</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: You will import other peoples internal routes</p>

<p>Security Danger: People can insert routes into your network</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol">Routing Information Protocol</a> is a very old way of doing what OSPF and IS-IS does on most modern networks today.</p>

<p>RIP and RIPv2 have similar automatic peer configuration features, meaning that if two or more members on an internet exchange have this configured they will almost certainly automatically merge their internal routing tables.</p>

<h3>MPLS LDP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: People can manipulate MPLS labels</p>

<p>Security Danger: People can manipulate MPLS labels</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching">MultiProtocol Label Switching</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_Distribution_Protocol">Label Distribution Protocol</a> is a different type of internal routing protocol that rather than dealing with IP prefixes, handles the exchange of MPLS Labels. Given that a lot of networks deploy MPLS as the core way of moving data around in their network, exposing this to another untrusted party is pretty bad.</p>

<h3>Various vendors loop testing protocols</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p>Quite a lot of vendors have their own form of proprietary ethernet loop detection, which often involve sending out probing packets into the LAN and seeing if they arrive back on any other interface (which would indicate a loop)</p>

<p>For example, here is a loop testing packet from a Huawei device</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/JxgJqqOCjv" alt=""></p>

<h3>Spanning Tree (of various flavors)</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Local disruption</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol">Spanning Tree Protocol</a> is a very common default that is enabled across most ethernet switches to combat ethernet loops. However accepting STP packets and sending them to other members of the exchange could result in disruption to the peer, as both sides try to agree a hierarchy with each other.</p>

<h2>The problem with SONiC</h2>

<p>SONiC is an open source network operating system (NOS) developed mostly by Microsoft, this is notable because almost all network operating systems are proprietary with no source code available. There are many reasons for this but one of the primary ones is that while there are many networking equipment vendors out there, the actual fundamental ASIC/Chips suppliers that are used to build high end equipment are limited down to around 3, with the majority of the market share being Broadcom. SONiC has in recent years become the most well known by name open source NOS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately SONiC is also just not a very good pick for almost all users, and mortally let down by its software quality. An example of this is a script called <a href="https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/blob/0fa211d531766b953ce280d21c56075f7b2a85b4/files/scripts/arp_update#L71">arp_update</a> that transmits a “Ping all IPv6 devices” packet to all connected LANs so that it can work around a potential limitation in the hardware that it supports. This is a nuisance on internet exchanges because once there are more than a handful of these devices on the exchange, every one is spending a non zero amount of resources responding to pointless pings.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/xOEbXGIlJQ" alt=""></p>

<p>It’s hard for me to understate how crap of a workaround this is, and how much more crap this is for devices with internet exchange ports.</p>

<h2>Weird misc stuff that should not be on internet exchanges</h2>

<p>There is a final category for things that are kind of just bizarre to see. They are just things that should not actually appear at all on any internet exchange port, and suggest something strange has happened. Either with unexpected devices being connected into the exchange fabric entirely, or very inadvisable configurations being used for public “network edge” ports.</p>

<h3>Broadcast NTP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p>While Network Time Protocol is very common, most of the time it is configured in a unicast way (meaning that a device deliberately queries a NTP peer), however there is a lesser used broadcast mode where a server broadcasts the time into the LAN on regular intervals.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some networks have decided to enable this on their internet exchange ports, meaning that all members are receiving (but are unlikely using) these packets.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that almost every single time I have seen one of these situations, the time being broadcast itself is wrong by at least a few days implying that a device itself does not actually have a good source of time, and it’s just drifting from it’s original set up</p>

<h3>MikroTik Winbox / MAC-Telnet</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Exposure of a remote configuration interface to untrusted networks</p>

<p>Once again our friend MikroTik comes back with some interesting defaults, In this case the RoMON protocol that allows their GUI management interface (WinBox), and the ability to “telnet” into a neighboring device with just its MAC address.</p>

<p>The logic behind the telnet feature is that it is useful for when you need to go to recover a device that you may have accidentally set a bad firewall or IP address/routing configuration on. However that does also mean that bgp.tools has traces of people using this telnet feature (which often broadcasts keystrokes and outputs) to all members. Implying that some networks are using the IX LAN (presumably by borrowing another member’s router) as a recovery mechanism for their misconfigurations.</p>

<h3>DEC-MOP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Exposure of a legacy protocol to untrusted networks</p>

<p>The Digital Equipment Corporation (Yes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">PDP-11 company</a>) developed a series of network protocols called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECnet">DECnet</a>. While it is unlikely that you will ever encounter a device that needs DECNet support, Cisco by default enables this protocol on all interfaces (unless explicitly configured otherwise) on all enterprise software versions for IOS/IOS-XE.</p>

<h3>SSDP (UPNP)</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Allowing untrusted networks to configure your device</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol">Simple Service Discovery Protocol</a> and its’s most common implementation use case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">Universal Plug and Play</a> is a protocol normally only ever found in the home/residential networking space. It allows for simple configuration for things like port forwarding. Since no one should be connecting such hardware to IX LANs, this is generally a sign of a serious misconfiguration.</p>

<h3>LLMNR / MDNS</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information Disclosure</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS">Multicast DNS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution">Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution</a> are protocols used mostly by desktop computers to locate other things on the network (typically home or small biz networks) by name.</p>

<p>MDNS is also very common in the automatic discovery of network printers, it also happens to be what I discovered the most on various exchanges</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/tRNR9Q6zSi" alt=""></p>

<p>While this is obviously ridiculous that a printer would be attached to an IX, what is likely actually happening here is that linux distributions like Debian will/would offer a “print server” role enabled by default. Since Linux “software routers” based on Debian are common in some regions, it doesn’t necessarily surprise me that these routers were installed with the print server role left enabled by mistake when they the operating system was installed.</p>

<h3>NETBIOS</h3>

<p>Commonness: Rare</p>

<p>Operational Danger: None</p>

<p>Security Danger: The exposure of Windows or SMB to untrusted networks</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS">NETBIOS</a> is often used to power SMB/Samba, the Windows file and printer sharing protocol.</p>

<p>When I first encountered this packet I assumed that this was going to be a windows server configuration that had been let onto the exchanged by mistake, as encountering windows servers acting as edge routers is unheard of (although <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/flexing-windows-rras-bgp-stack-ipv6">windows does actually have a bgp implementation</a>, it is not designed for edge peering and so would make an extremely poor edge router)</p>

<p>Upon further inspection of the packets it appears that what has actually happened here (at least 6 different times) is desktops/laptops have been let into the exchange instead. I can tell this because windows will automatically generate host names like <code>SERVER-ABCD1234</code> for windows server installations, and <code>DESKTOP-ABCD1234</code> for desktop/laptop ones, and NETBIOS packets often include the hostname of the system that is querying.</p>

<p>I can only assume this has happened due to incorrect physical cable patching or VLAN translation.</p>

<h3>VRRP/HSRP</h3>

<p>Commonness: Low</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Untrusted networks could trigger failover of your routers</p>

<p>Security Danger: None</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Router_Redundancy_Protocol">Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Standby_Router_Protocol">Hot Standby Router Protocol</a> are protocols that are designed to allow two routers to automatically take over from another if they fail. To do this the protocol sends packets on a regular interval into the LAN that has the gateway ip address that is being protected from downtime.</p>

<p>While redundancy is obviously desired on exchanges, this is typically done by actually attaching two discrete routers to the exchange with different LAN IP addresses, so VRRP and similar protocols are not appreciated configurations.</p>

<h2>DNS-Broadcast</h2>

<p>Commonness: Medium</p>

<p>Operational Danger: Embarrassment</p>

<p>Security Danger: Information disclosure</p>

<p>When Cisco devices are unable to find a working DNS resolver, they resort to broadcasting the DNS query on all interfaces, Most of the time this just means that the Cisco licensing server (the “cslu-local”) is queried for, with an added bonus of the owners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_domain">DNS search domain</a> (if they have configured one)</p>

<p>So filtering for these packets is quite easy, and results in pretty much exactly what you would think.</p>

<pre><code>$ tcpdump -nr dns.pcap |&amp; pcregrep -o1 '\] A{1,4}\? ([^\)]+)' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 15
    875 cslu-local.{CORP-F}
    998 cslu-local.{CORP-F}
   1162 tools.cisco.com.{Military-A}.
   1648 cslu-local.{CORP-G}
   1659 cslu-local.{CORP-F}

   7675 tools.cisco.com.
   9934 cslu-local.{Military-A}
  10838 cslu-local.
</code></pre>

<p>Except Cisco also has another interesting default back from the days when Cisco sold dedicated terminal servers where you would dial into the device (over the phone), and then type the device name you were looking to connect to.</p>

<p>In practice everybody should be disabling this function in 2025, however by default it is enabled, so if you log into the Cisco CLI and make a typo (let’s say for this example you forgot the you’re on a cisco rather than a huawei), this happens:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/Ezr9GDVR1J" alt=""></p>

<p>The CLI just hangs, as it broadcasts your typo onto all interfaces…</p>

<p>Anyway with a little bit of careful processing we can see all of these typos and sometimes the search domain from where they came from:</p>

<pre><code>$ tcpdump -nr dns.pcap |&amp; pcregrep -o1 '\] A{1,4}\? ([^\)]+)' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | egrep -v  'cslu|tools.cisco.com'

</code></pre>

<p>I’ve collected favorite most common typos below:</p>

<pre><code>$ tcpdump -nr dns.pcap |&amp; pcregrep -o1 '\] A{1,4}\? ([^\)]+)' | awk '{print $1}' |&amp; pcregrep -o1 '^([^.]+)' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

<p>There is of course an added danger while having this enabled that you could actually answer these queries and then trick an operator into typing into a terminal that you control. But I suspect that almost all operators would notice something like that happening, making such a trick difficult to pull off.</p>

<h2>How can IXs prevent this?</h2>

<p>While pretty much all exchanges have rules that define the kind of traffic that you are allowed to be sent into the internet exchange fabric that would forbid almost all of these types of packets from being sent ( For example, here is <a href="https://www.ams-ix.net/ams/documentation/allowed-traffic">AMS-IX’s list of rules</a> ), enforcement of these rules is nonexistent in most exchanges.</p>

<p>Which is a shame really because a lot of this can be automatically done with simple access control lists (ACLs) that target just mac addresses alone.</p>

<p>DEC-MOP, RoMON, STP, CDP, IS-IS, ES-IS, LLDP, VRRP, OSPF, IPv6 RA are remarkably common, and yet they use specific MAC address destinations that could just be filtered out on all ports, preventing them from being seen by other IX participants.</p>

<p>While [LLMNR, NetBIOS, PIM, LDP, MDNS, DHCPv4 /DHCPv6, SSDP, DNS-Broadcast, Broadcast NTP, MikroTik Discovery] do require the IX device to be able to inspect Layer 3 headers like UDP port numbers in ACLs, this feature is very common among deployed hardware in the industry.</p>

<p>Even if exchanges are not able to automatically enforce policy using ACLs, there are open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/euro-ix/IXP-Watch">IXP-Watch</a> and systems like bgp.tools that will monitor this for you.</p>

<p>There shouldn’t really be an excuse for things to be this way!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A tech-savvy San Francisco resident has sparked conversation online after he shared a perplexing discovery about his LG washing machine's seemingly voracious appetite for data on X (formerly <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter">Twitter</a>).</p><p>In a post with more than 7 million views, Johnie Lee shared a screenshot of his machine's data usage, which showed around 3.6GB of daily data usage. For context, 3GB of data is the rough equivalent of streaming high-definition video for an hour on a device.</p><p>A spokesperson for LG told <em>Newsweek</em>: "LG has connected with the customer regarding the high-traffic data concern and is actively investigating to understand the root of this unusual occurrence.</p><p>"Following the spike, the washer has shown reduced traffic data. Despite this being an isolated incident, LG remains committed to investigating the underlying cause."</p><div><p><img id="8338685" clicktodisplay="false" showcredit="true" credit="RossHelen/Getty Images" alt="Washing machine" caption="A picture of a washing machine with a smartphone in the foreground.

The connection to a Wi-Fi network allows the user to operate functions from a smartphone, download additional wash programs, and receive alerts when a load is complete.</p><p>But Lee, a home automation and tech enthusiast, stumbled upon the anomaly while troubleshooting issues with his home network.</p><p>"I had noticed at the beginning of January that my Internet was running a little slow and my network was behaving a little weird," he told <em>Newsweek</em>. "On January 8, I was looking through the router logs to see what devices were using the most bandwidth. Besides the usual suspects, I noticed that my LG Washing Machine had the fourth-highest usage of data for the week. This was highly suspicious."</p><p>In September 2023, the U.K.-based consumer awareness publication Which? reported the results of a study into the data our smart devices use and collect. Results found that smart washing machines are collecting a significant amount of user data, including personal information such as date of birth, location, and even access to photos.</p><p>There is no evidence that the data is being sold to third parties, but the prolonged lifespan of washing machines has begun to raise questions about long-term data tracking.</p><div><p><img id="8338688" clicktodisplay="false" showcredit="true" credit="@Johnie/X" alt="Washing machine" caption="A screenshot of the washing machine data that shows around 3.6GB of data use a day." sourcealt="@Johnie/X" sources="[]" fetchpriority="auto" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2338688-washing-machine.png?w=1600&amp;quality=75&amp;webp=1 1x" src="https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2338688-washing-machine.png?w=1600&amp;quality=75&amp;webp=1"></p></div><p>The Which? article said that LG washing machines require users to provide their date of birth to use the associated app, while Samsung and Miele request access to photos and location data. They advised users to review the privacy policies and settings of smart devices, to ensure they fully understand and can potentially limit the data being collected in their home.</p><p>Lee is keen to embrace technological advances in everyday life but was baffled by the behavior of the washing machine and shared what he had found on X, hoping to prompt a laugh or two with his followers.</p><p>"When I discovered the data usage, it was such a surreal moment that I felt like sharing with my small network on X to share in the bafflement and have a collective laugh at my dirty laundry misfortunes," he said. "I never expected it to blow up the way it did."</p><p>The unexpected attention prompted a wave of reactions and jokes, touching on issues including AI, bitcoin, privacy, downloadable content (DLC), and the ever-growing impact of technology on our lives.</p><p>Alongside the jokes, the discovery prompted conversation around the trade-offs between privacy and convenience as our lives become increasingly connected with data and data collection.</p></article></div>]]></description>

A writer Dan Okrent taught his friends a new game: players picked a fantasy baseball team from the pool of real-life baseball players.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-1-174160086" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> You win by being the best at predicting what your handpicked baseball players will do in the actual game. This game was called fantasy baseball.</span></p><p>Fantasy play spread to other sports like basketball and football. People bet small amounts of money to participate in fantasy sports contests with their friends. Those who chose the best performing fantasy teams got to keep the pot.</p><p>It was primarily a fun social activity you’d do with your friends.</p><p><span>In 1992, New Jersey Senator and former basketball player </span><strong>Bill Bradley</strong><span> sponsored a Federal law called PASPA, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. This law banned most states from legalizing sports books: businesses that set odds, accepted wagers, and paid out winnings on sports games.</span></p><p>Bradley, a former NBA player and principled senator, believed that gambling corrupted the integrity of sports. It could lead to match fixing, point shaving, and unfair influence.</p><p>PASPA passed with broad, bipartisan support: 88-5 in the Senate and by a voice vote in the House. A voice vote is when lawmakers shout “aye” or “no”, reserved for uncontroversial proposals. The experts thought sports gambling was a problem, and the public didn’t care about it much.</p><p>The law was unusual in its wording: it didn't explicitly make sports betting a federal crime for individuals, but it stopped states from legalizing it. PASPA was crafted to avoid opposition from states where sports betting already existed, like Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana. It blocked other states from passing new laws that would legalize and regulate sports gambling. Twenty five years later, this wording is what led to the undoing of PASPA when New Jersey wanted to legalize sports betting.</p><p>In the meantime, fantasy sports continued to gain popularity through the 90s and 2000s. Fantasy sports expanded from small circles of die-hard sports fans to a national pastime, played in high schools and colleges, debated in office break rooms, and argued over at Thanksgiving dinners.</p><p><span>In 2009, a company in Scotland was created called FanDuel that introduced </span><strong>daily</strong><span> fantasy sports. Before FanDuel, players would draft a fantasy team just once before the season started and have points accumulate through the season. Daily fantasy sports introduced daily contests: players could draft a new team every day for the game that is being played that day. Instead of just competing with your friends, the prize pool was now a large global jackpot aggregated among millions of FanDuel users who you did not know. In 2012, DraftKings was founded to compete with FanDuel.</span></p><p>Fantasy sports extended from primarily a social activity to a money-making activity.</p><p><span>FanDuel and DraftKings began spending heavily on TV ads. In the 2015 NFL season, they </span><a href="https://archive.is/G8lPo" rel="">spent $27 million</a><span> on 8,000 television spots, outspending the entire beer industry. These were crude ads, most of them being testimonials about people who won big; the kind that bragged “I turned five bucks into fifty thousand”.</span></p><p>The ads caught the eyes of regulators. Isn’t this sports gambling? How was this on TV screens when sports gambling was illegal?</p><p>In 2015, the attorneys general of New York and Illinois ordered that FanDuel and DraftKings had to cease and desist fantasy sports contests since they were considered to be sports gambling.</p><p><span>In response to the crackdown, FanDuel and DraftKings hired </span><strong>Jeremy Kudon</strong><span>, a partner at </span><a href="https://www.orrick.com/" rel="">Orrick</a><span>, a New York law firm that lobbies legislatures on behalf of clients. Kudon had a challenging job. PASPA, which was passed in 1992, effectively banned sports betting.</span></p><p>Kodon viewed that the best path to influence national policy was working through state legislatures. By winning over several states, you can eventually shift national policy.</p><p><span>His strategy was to initially focus on smaller and male-dominated legislatures like Kansas because it would be easier to explain the issue:</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-2-174160086" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><blockquote><p>“A lot of women would say, ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about. That just sounds like gambling.’ The men would say, ‘I do fantasy sports. You’re telling me this is gambling? There’s no way this is gambling. I do this with my friends.’”</p></blockquote><p>His argument to state legislatures was that fantasy sports is a game of skill like a golf tournament, not a game of luck like a slot machine. To prove this, he worked with an economist to show that the best fantasy football players are better at building teams than any real NFL general manager.</p><p>Kansas was the first state to explicitly legalize daily fantasy sports. After Kansas, Kudon persuaded 22 more states to allow fantasy sports.</p><p><span>Sports betting was still illegal under PASPA, but it was prevalent in New Jersey. About </span><a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2023news/PrevalenceReport2023Final.pdf" rel="">half</a><span> of today’s sports bettors in New Jersey used to bet on sports when it was illegal. Minor bookies would pass out cards with spreads for sports fans to bet on. Illegal bookies operated quietly, taking bets in diners, corner stores, and high schools.</span></p><p><span>In 2007, Rudy Garcia, a New Jersey politician, went to do something that was common in Jersey: place a sports bet with a local bookie. However, this bookie was part of an FBI sting operation, so Garcia was </span><a href="https://observer.com/2007/03/ex-assemblyman-faces-arrest-on-money-laundering-charges/" rel="">indicted</a><span> for criminal activity and forced out of politics.</span></p><p>Ray Lesniak, a New Jersey senator, who was a close friend and ally of Garcia, was shocked at how unfair the case was. After all, sports betting was a harmless pastime in Jersey. He decided to take on the cause of legalizing sports betting in New Jersey.</p><p><span>To change New Jersey state law, Lesniak needed the help of the then governor </span><strong>Chris Christie.</strong><span> But the two didn’t get along, and Christie backed the sports betting ban at the time.</span></p><p>Blocked at the statehouse, Lesniak turned to the public. He proposed a referendum asking voters if sports betting should be legalized. When nearly a million residents cast their ballots, two-thirds voted for. The vote had no legislative effect and was largely a publicity stunt, but it worked. Christie, a big sports fan who occasionally bet on games in high school, was pragmatic and decided to change course.</p><p>When asked why he changed his position on sports betting, Christie said:²</p><blockquote><p>“When you look at the black market of sports betting, there are billions of dollars bet every year. Legitimizing that already ongoing activity would create economic activity for the state.” </p></blockquote><p>Christie thought that Senator Bill Bradley, who sponsored PASPA, was “extraordinarily naive” with his rationale for maintaining the ban on sports betting.</p><p>Two weeks after the referendum, Lesniak introduced the Sports Wagering Act (2012) which allowed sports betting in New Jersey, and Christie signed it into law.</p><p><span>Immediately after the 2012 Sports Wagering Act was signed, the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA sued New Jersey, arguing that this act violated federal law PASPA. To defend New Jersey’s case, Christie approached </span><strong>Ted Olson</strong><span>, a legendary constitutional lawyer.</span></p><p>By the time Olson was challenging PASPA, it was in force for 20 years without being challenged. At the time, he thought:²</p><blockquote><p>“The desire to pass this statute was perceived as doing good: to stop people from betting on sports, to stop the potential corruption of athletes and the temptation put before them. Why will the Supreme Court get involved now?”</p></blockquote><p><span>But the Supreme Court had been drifting in a new direction for a while and Ted Olson helped it drift. In the 1980s, Olson was a prominent member of the </span><a href="https://fedsoc.org/bio/theodore-olson" rel="">Federalist Society</a><span>, which believed that the constitution should be understood as it was originally written, rather than as a “living document” that evolves with modern values. Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett were all part of the Federalist Society at different periods, and groomed to be Supreme Court justices. Olson was an influential leader in the same club as the Supreme Court judges who would decide if PASPA should be repealed. Christie hired Olson because his presence showed that New Jersey’s case should be taken seriously.</span></p><p>Olson’s argument was that Congress had overstepped. PASPA told states that they cannot authorize sports gambling, but they would have to enforce the ban themselves. Under the anti-commandeering doctrine of the constitution, Congress cannot compel states to do something. Congress can legislate on people, not states. </p><p>Under PASPA, Congress didn’t ban individuals from betting on sports, which it could have done under the Interstate Commerce Clause. It also didn’t provide the federal regulatory muscle to enforce the sports betting ban. In contrast, for example, when Congress passed the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, it created a federal regulatory regime (the FAA) to enforce airline rules directly, rather than compel states to do it.</p><p><span>Olson, however, lost his first two cases in the lower courts and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The courts said that New Jersey’s 2012 Sports Wagering Act was exactly what PASPA prohibited: a state “authorizing” sports betting, and federal law supersedes state law under the </span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artVI-C2-1/ALDE_00013395/" rel="">Supremacy Clause</a><span> of the constitution. The NCAA lawyers effectively argued this:²</span></p><blockquote><p>“We aren’t saying you have to enforce the prohibition. We aren’t saying you need to do anything to prevent sports gambling. You just can’t legalize it.”</p></blockquote><p>While PASPA blocked states from legalizing sports betting, it didn’t force them to regulate it. A minor difference, but not commandeering.</p><p>Christie took this as an opportunity to do something clever. In 2014, New Jersey passed a new law that repealed the state’s own previous regulation on sports betting. They didn’t create licenses or regulate it; they just removed the prior ban. The state took the hands-off position: they weren’t going to formally legalize or regulate sports betting, but they weren’t going to prevent it. Now, if the leagues sued New Jersey, the state could argue that it hadn’t authorized sports betting at all; it had merely stepped aside.</p><p>As expected, the leagues sued. They argued that even this partial repeal authorized sports gambling. The commissioner of the NFL Roger Goodell told Chris Christie:²</p><blockquote><p>“You’ve got to drop the case because we’re going to embarrass you.” </p></blockquote><p>The early rounds went badly. Olson lost four more cases in the lower courts and Christie spent $6 million in public funds. But Olson knew that if they petition for the Supreme Court to hear their case, they had a good shot at getting accepted.</p><p>Olson was right. In June 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear New Jersey’s case. </p><p><span>On December 4th, 2017, Olson argued New Jersey’s case in the Supreme Court. Supreme Court cases aren’t like courtroom dramas you see on TV, but more like a press conference with nine hostile reporters who are constantly interrupting and questioning you. The full audio argument of </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2017/16-476" rel="">Murphy vs. NCAA</a><span> (formerly Christie vs. NCAA) is worth listening to; it is gripping from start to finish:</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-3-174160086" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><audio src="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/api/v1/audio/upload/464bf9e1-a0ad-4689-9ba8-2624a119c15a/src" preload="auto">Audio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.</audio></p><p>Olson starts with arguing against PASPA based on the anti-commandeering principle: Congress can regulate people, not states.</p><p>Almost immediately, Justice Ginsberg interrupts Olson:³ wasn’t PASPA just another example of federal preemption, where federal law supersedes state law?</p><p>Olson says that when federal law supersedes state law, the federal government should regulate individuals via the Interstate Commerce Clause. PASPA doesn’t regulate individuals, nor does it provide regulatory muscle for enforcing the ban on sports betting. It simply commandeers states to ban sports betting and do the work of enforcing the ban.</p><p>Justice Sotomayor challenges this. She says that states don’t have to enforce the ban:³</p><blockquote><p>“Mr. Olson, if every governor enforced every law on the book, the state would be more than bankrupt. It would have no way of surviving. There are countless laws, and even laws that are in force, that are not enforced totally. States make choices all the time. There is nothing [in PASPA] telling this state that it has to enforce this law.”</p></blockquote><p>But Olson had a stronger counterargument this time thanks to Christie’s clever 2014 maneuver. New Jersey’s sports wagering act of 2014 did not legalize sports betting, it simply removed their prior ban. If PASPA blocked that, it meant that Congress was dictating what state legislatures can and cannot do.</p><p>Olson’s logic resonated with Justice Alito, a New Jersey native who had been part of the Federalist Society. Alito said there is no difference between Congress ordering a state to pass a law and forbidding it from repealing one: both are unconstitutional intrusions.</p><p>With that framing, the issue became clear. This was no longer about sports betting in New Jersey; it was about the balance of power between Washington and the states. The court, now more open to states’ rights than in prior years, delivered a landmark judgment. In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled with a 6-3 vote that PASPA was unconstitutional, therefore removing the 26-year federal ban on sports betting and unleashing the modern sports betting industry.</p><p>Lobbyists like Jeremy Kudon saw this ruling as an opening to persuade state legislatures across the country to legalize sports betting. Kudon started with states that already legalized fantasy sports, a landscape he knew better than anyone else. Today, 38 states have legalized sports betting.</p><p>The widespread embrace of sports betting among everyday Americans wasn’t inevitable. Bill Bradley’s views on the harms of sports betting were the norm in America through the 90s and 2000s. It took a motivated state Governor in Chris Christie, an exceptional constitutional lawyer in Ted Olson, and a tactical lobbyist in Jeremy Kudon, to bring sports betting to nearly every American state and household.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apply now, do YC after you graduate. For students who want to finish school before doing YC. Get funded the moment you're accepted.</p><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/vite/assets/spur_founders_early_decision-CSkUvarM.jpg" alt="Early Decision for Students"></p><p>Sneha and Anushka, founders of<!-- --> <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/spur">Spur (S24)</a>, applied in Fall 2023 for the S24 batch using Early Decision. This allowed them to graduate in May 2024 and then do YC. They've since raised $4.5M from top investors for their AI-powered QA testing tools.</p></div><div><h2>How Early Decision Works</h2><p>Early Decision lets you apply to YC while you're still in school and reserve your spot in a future batch. For example, you apply in Fall of this year, for a spot in the summer batch of the following year. You submit the same YC application as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. If you're accepted, we'll fund you immediately and hold your place for after you graduate.</p><h3>Is It for You?</h3><p>This program is designed for students who want to finish their degree before starting a company. If you're considering working on your own startup after graduation, Early Decision makes it easy to lock in your spot.</p><p>Even if you're not completely sure yet if you want to do a startup, you should still apply. There is no downside.</p><p>Also, if you're not in your final year, you can still apply for Early Decision. You'll be able to finish the school year you're currently in, and then either join a later batch or decide to drop out and start sooner.</p><h3>The Timeline</h3><p>The most common path is students applying in the fall of their final year and joining the summer batch after graduating in Spring. But you can apply for any batch in the future within reason. The application and interview process is the same as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. Once you're accepted, YC funds you right away and confirms your future batch.</p><h3>How to Apply</h3><p>When you fill out your YC application, you'll see a question asking which batch you want to apply for. Simply select "A batch after Winter 2026" to indicate you're applying for Early Decision, and tell us which batch you'd like to be considered for.</p><div><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/vite/assets/early_decision_instructions-lZfrHNPm.png" alt="Early Decision batch selection in YC application"></p><p>The batch preference question in the YC application</p></div><h3>Why We Created Early Decision</h3><p>Many students want to finish their degree or complete more of their education before starting a company. Also we know that many students spend a lot of time in Fall or during their final year applying for jobs or internships. Early Decision gives students another option: apply to YC and bet on yourself.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">A Linux-only helper built on Sony’s official <strong>Camera Remote SDK</strong>.
It connects to a Sony A6700 camera over Wi-Fi/Ethernet, listens for new photos, downloads them automatically, and can optionally run a script on each downloaded file.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Auto-connect via <strong>enumeration</strong> or <strong>direct IP/MAC</strong>.</li>
<li>Watches for new capture events and fetches the newest files.</li>
<li>Saves into a chosen directory with <strong>unique filenames</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Post-download hook</strong>: run any executable/script with the saved file path as argument.</li>
<li><strong>Keepalive mode</strong>: auto-retry on startup failure or after disconnects.</li>
<li>Cleaned, Linux-only code (no Windows ifdefs, simpler logging).</li>

<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Connect</strong> to the camera (via IP or enumeration).
Stores/reuses SDK <strong>fingerprint</strong> under <code>~/.cache/sonshell/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for notifications</strong>: when the camera signals new contents,
spawn a download thread.</li>
<li><strong>Download</strong> newest files to <code>--dir</code>.
Safe naming ensures no overwrite (<code>file_1.jpg</code>, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Hook</strong>: if <code>--cmd</code> is set, fork/exec the script with the saved path.</li>
<li><strong>Reconnect</strong> on errors/disconnects if <code>--keepalive</code> is set.</li>
