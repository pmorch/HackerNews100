                                    Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.</p><p>People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PESP_Report_IDD_2025.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">report</a> from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.</p><p>“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”</p><p><span data-bsp-pv="4f8e492c-6f2f-390e-bc61-f176d3a37ab9"></span><span data-bsp-pv="00000196-d9df-d2f6-ab96-dddfa7e50000"></span><br>For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”</p><p>In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.</p><p>But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/grassley-wyden-probe-reports-of-abuse-at-group-homes-in-iowa-and-oregon" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">conducted a probe</a> into the company’s operations in <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020-12-03%20Investigative%20Report%20(REM%20Iowa).pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Iowa</a> and <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120220%20Life%20at%20Cypress%20House%20-%20An%20Examination%20of%20Care%20Provided%20by%20MENTOR%20Oregon.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Oregon</a> following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.</p><p>“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-issue-reports-on-developmental-disability-care-facilities-in-oregon-and-iowa" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">statement</a> in 2020 following his investigation.</p><p>In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.</p><p>“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.</p><p>The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.</p><p>In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.</p><p>From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PESP_Report_IDD_2025.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to the report</a> by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.</p><h3 id="cash-cow">Cash Cow</h3><p>Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.</p><p>Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.</p><p>Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.</p><p><a href="https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3320219#:~:text=Sevita%20generating%20approximately%2085%25%2D90%25%20of%20its%20revenues%20from%20Medicaid" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid</a>, according to a February 2025 report from S&amp;P Global.</p><p>Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.</p><p>“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.</p><p>In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/29/care-facility-is-fined-after-woman-left-unattended-in-liquor-store-consumes-vodka/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">left unattended in a liquor store</a> and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/neurorestorative-2022/download" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">report</a>.</p><p>The federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/details/nursing-home/465179?state=UT&amp;measure=nursing-home-penalties" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">four times since 2022</a>. A <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/inspections/pdf/nursing-home/465179/health/complaint-inspection?date=2024-02-20" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">February 2024 inspection report</a> by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.</p><p>Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.</p><p>Similar financial maneuvering <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/investigation-reveals-how-investors-made-millions-as-steward-health-care-system-collapsed" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care</a>, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.</p><p>“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.</p><p>“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”</p><h3 id="david-vs-goliath">David vs. Goliath</h3><p>After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.</p><p>AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.</p><p>But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.</p><p>“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.</p><p>“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”</p><p>A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.</p><p>“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.</p><p>Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.</p><p>When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.</p><p>“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.</p><p>Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.</p><p>There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.</p><h3 id="state-solutions">State Solutions</h3><p>Some states have moved to <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">address problems</a> with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.</p><p>In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/#:~:text=Rhode%20Island%20roadblock" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">threatened the future of local hospitals</a>, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.</p><p>More states are following suit.

        <p><em>The secrecy battle over the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 has followed <strong>Glasscock v. Sig Sauer</strong> to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open—and their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-new">What’s new</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Trace intervenes in the appeal.</strong> The newsroom moved to intervene <strong>for the limited purpose of opposing</strong> sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public’s right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA <strong>nine times</strong> when it certified the class.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-01.png" alt="Screenshot 1"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sig Sauer says “national security” and asks for deference to the Army.</strong> In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting “military secrets.”</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-02.png" alt="Screenshot 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-03.png" alt="Screenshot 3"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A second FMECA document emerges.</strong> Sig Sauer’s opposition confirms there are <strong>two</strong> FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a <strong>FMECA Spreadsheet</strong> and a <strong>FMECA Memorandum</strong>—the latter not previously described in public filings—raising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-04.png" alt="Screenshot 4"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PSI’s reporting is part of the record.</strong> The Trace’s filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‑obscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it “remains available”—and it recounts Sig Sauer’s own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-06.png" alt="Screenshot 6"></p>

<p>The FMECA document was previously published <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/the-document-sig-sauer-doesnt-want-you-to-see-about-the-p320/">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-traces-pitch-this-isnt-secret-anymore">The Trace’s pitch: This isn’t secret anymore</h2>

<p>The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed <strong>100,000 views</strong>. The filing quotes Sig Sauer’s VP of Consumer Affairs <strong>Phil Strader</strong> being asked on the <em>Behind the Lens</em> podcast why the FMECA shouldn’t be public and responding, <strong>“No, there’s not”</strong> (nothing to hide), while <strong>directing viewers to this website to see the document</strong> and describing its contents.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-07.png" alt="Screenshot 7"></p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-08.png" alt="Screenshot 8"></p>

<p>The reporting regarding Phil Strader’s interview was previously published <a href="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/sig-sauer-vp-consumer-affairs-discusses-the-document-they-didnt-want-you-to-see/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>How many times has the unredacted FMECA been “shared”?</strong> The filings don’t give a precise share count. What they <em>do</em> document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‑plus video and multiple re‑posts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.</p>

<p>The Trace also points to <strong>DoD Instruction 5230.24</strong>, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it <strong>does not authorize withholding unclassified information</strong> about <strong>evaluations of performance and reliability</strong> of military equipment—and that the PSI‑hosted FMECA <strong>bears no DoD distribution markings</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-09.png" alt="Screenshot 9"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="sig-sauers-response-let-the-army-decideand-keep-the-lid-on">Sig Sauer’s response: Let the Army decide—and keep the lid on</h2>

<p>Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace <strong>lacks standing</strong> and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on <strong>military‑secrets</strong> concerns, requests time for the <strong>Army to opine</strong> on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-10.png" alt="Screenshot 10"></p>

<p>Two details in Sig Sauer’s papers matter going forward:</p>

<p>1) <strong>The “FMECA Memorandum.”</strong> Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‑authored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally—an issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Ongoing Army communications.</strong> Sig Sauer’s litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA’s distribution status and that key Army decision‑makers were <strong>unavailable</strong> the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.</p>

<p><img src="https://practicalshootinginsights.com/assets/images/25-08-28-01-11.png" alt="Screenshot 11"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-transparency-question-distilled">The transparency question, distilled</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is the FMECA “national‑security” material?</strong> The Trace says <strong>no</strong>—and points to DoDI 5230.24’s carve‑out: it <strong>does not provide authority to withhold</strong> unclassified evaluations of <strong>performance and reliability</strong>—exactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Is secrecy even possible at this point?</strong> The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is <strong>online on this website</strong>, has been <strong>reposted broadly</strong>, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer’s own executive on air—who <strong>told listeners where to find it</strong>. One video discussing it has <strong>100,000+ views</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-to-the-class-actionand-to-owners">Why this matters to the class action—and to owners</h2>

<p>The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on <strong>notice</strong> and <strong>risk‑mitigation</strong> questions—the very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public’s ability to scrutinize a product‑safety fight with real‑world consequences.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="my-role-plainly">My role, plainly</h2>

<p>Practical Shooting Insights is an independent site covering the shooting‑sports and firearms industry. The Trace’s filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-to-watch-next">What to watch next</h2>

<p>1) <strong>Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention</strong> and applies the strong presumption of public access to <strong>class‑certification</strong> records.<br>
2) <strong>If the Army weighs in</strong>—and on what basis—regarding the FMECA’s distribution status.<br>
3) <strong>Disclosure of the FMECA Memorandum.</strong> If it’s Sig Sauer-authored, it could illuminate internal framing of hazards and fixes—material at the core of consumer‑protection claims.</p>

<p>After more than two years of development, the Debian Project has <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250809">released</a> its new stable version, Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie"). The release comes with the usual bounty of
upgraded packages and more than 14,000 new packages; it also debuts <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/">Advanced Package Tool
(APT)&nbsp;3.0</a> as the default package manager and makes 64-bit
<span>RISC-V</span> a supported architecture. There are few surprises with trixie,
which is exactly what many Linux users are hoping for—a free
operating system that just works as expected.</p>

<p>Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/">stable</a>
releases are aptly named; the project prioritizes stability over
shipping the latest software. The <a href="https://release.debian.org/trixie/freeze_policy.html">freeze
schedule for trixie</a> called for a soft freeze in April, which meant
that (for example) the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.4.0/">KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;6.4</a>
release in June was too late to make the cut—even though trixie
was not released until August. Users who prefer to live on the edge
will want to run another distribution or follow Debian development by
running the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/testing/">testing</a> release
that previews the next stable <span>version—<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianForky">Debian&nbsp;14&nbsp;("forky")</a></span>. Truly
adventurous users may take their chances with the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/">unstable ("sid")
release</a>.</p>

<p>That said, trixie is up-to-date enough for many folks; it includes
GNOME&nbsp;48, KDE&nbsp;Plasma&nbsp;6.3, Xfce&nbsp;4.20, GNU
Emacs&nbsp;30.1, GnuPG&nbsp;2.4.7, LibreOffice&nbsp;25.2, and
more. Under the hood, it includes the most recent Linux LTS kernel
(6.12.41), GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 14.2, GNU C Library (glibc)
2.41, LLVM/Clang 19, Python&nbsp;3.13, Rust&nbsp;1.85, and
systemd&nbsp;257. The release notes have a <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/whats-new.en.html#desktops-and-well-known-packages">section
for well-known software</a> that compares the version in Debian 12
against Debian 13. While some of the versions lag a bit behind the
upstream, they are not woefully outdated.</p>

<p>The project now <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/armhf/ch02s01.en.html">supports
six major hardware architectures</a>: x86-64/amd64, 32-bit Arm with a
hardware FPU (armhf), 64-bit Arm (arm64), IBM POWER8 or newer
(ppc64el), IBM S/390 (s390x), and 64-bit RISC-V. The i386 architecture
is not supported for trixie, though the project continues to
build some i386 packages to run on 64-bit systems; users with i386 systems cannot upgrade to
trixie. The <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#mips-architectures-removed">MIPS</a>
architectures (mipsel and mis64el) have also been removed in trixie.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">Arm EABI</a>
(armel) port that targets older 32-bit Arm devices prior to Arm v7 is
still supported with trixie, but this release is the end of the
line. There is no installation media for armel systems, but users who
have bookworm installed can upgrade to trixie if they have supported
hardware: the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi&nbsp;1, Zero, and Zero&nbsp;W are the
only devices mentioned <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#last-release-for-armel">in
the release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Upgrades from bookworm are supported, of course. The release
notes <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html#preparing-apt-sources-files">suggest</a> that users convert APT source files to the <a href="https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html">DEB822&nbsp;format</a>
before the upgrade. APT&nbsp;3.0
includes an "<tt>apt&nbsp;modernize-sources</tt>" command to convert APT data
source files to DEB822, but that is not available in bookworm. Users are
also expected to <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html#start-from-pure-debian">remove
all third-party packages</a> prior to running the upgrade. I tested
the upgrade on one of my servers, after taking a snapshot to roll back
to if needed, and all went smoothly. Users who are considering an
upgrade should read the release notes carefully before forging ahead;
in particular, users should be aware that it's possible (but not
certain) for <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#network-interface-names-may-change">network interface names to change</a> on upgrade.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>For users who want to start fresh, Debian offers <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/debian-installer/">a
variety of installer images</a> and download methods; users can choose
a 64MB minimal ISO image with the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Netboot">netboot</a>
installer, all the way up to a set of Blu-ray images. The project
recommends using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://www.einval.com/~steve/software/jigdo/">Jigsaw
Download</a> (jigdo) for the largest images. BitTorrent probably needs
no introduction, but jigdo is not as well-known. Jigdo is a method of
downloading all of the individual packages for an image from multiple
mirrors and then assembling them into an ISO image on the user's
machine. It was a bit fiddly to use jigdo to download an image, but
not overly so—and the speed of the whole process was comparable
to simply downloading an ISO of the same size.</p>

<p>Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">network
install</a> ("netinst") image is probably the best option for server
installations and for experienced Linux users; it includes the
packages required for a base install and then fetches the remaining
software from Debian mirrors. Unlike the tiny netboot image, it
includes the option of using either the graphical installer or the
text-based installer.</p>

<p>The installer is a bit of a throwback to an earlier era when users
were expected to know a lot more about the workings of a Linux system. 
Users who have only worked with distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu
will notice that installing Debian requires many more steps than other
popular distributions. For example, many desktop distributions have
eliminated the step of setting a password for the root
user—instead, it is generally assumed that the primary user will
also be the system administrator, so the default is to give the
primary user sudo privileges instead. Debian does not take that
approach; <del>in fact, there is no way to give a user sudo privileges
during installation. Setting up sudo has to be done manually after
the installation is completed</del> <strong>Update:</strong> Users can skip creation of a root account and the installer will then set up the regular user as an administrator with sudo permissions. Apologies for the error.</p>

<p>For some folks, installing Debian will be a bit of a chore and may
even be confusing for users who are new to Linux. For example, the
text-mode installer requires users to specify the device for GRUB boot
loader installation, without providing a default. If one chooses an
invalid partition, the installer tells the user that the operation has
failed and drops back to a menu listing all the installation
steps. Presumably if one picks the <em>wrong</em> partition it will
happily install GRUB to that and render the system unbootable. This is
not insurmountable for experienced Linux users, but it would no doubt
be a hurdle for many users.</p>

<p>More experienced Linux users are likely to appreciate the
amount of control offered by the installer. For example, Fedora's
recent web-based installer makes it difficult to even find the option to
perform custom partitioning. Debian has a guided partitioning option
for those who do not want to fuss with it, but the option to create
custom partitions is not hidden from the user.</p>

<p>Debian has a better installation option for newer Linux users,
though it is easy to miss: the <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/">live install images</a>, which
use the <a href="https://calamares.io/">Calamares</a> installer. Its
workflow is more akin to the installation process one finds with
Fedora and Ubuntu; it also sets up the primary user with sudo
privileges rather than creating a root password. Unfortunately,
the live images are not listed on the main page for installer
images—though they are mentioned, briefly, in the release
notes.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1034312/#id">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/calamares-sm.png" alt="[Debian Calamares installer]" title="Debian Calamares installer">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The Debian installer also has the option of using a Braille display
and/or speech synthesizer voice for the installation. I have not tried
these options, but they are available for users who need them.</p>

<h4>X.org</h4>

<p>Many distributions are in the process of phasing out X.org support
for GNOME and KDE as the upstream projects have started doing so.
For example, Fedora <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3408">will remove X.org session support
for GNOME in Fedora&nbsp;43</a>, and the plan is for <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1024758/">Ubuntu to do the same</a>
in its upcoming 25.10 release. GNOME will be completely removing X.org
support in GNOME&nbsp;49, which is planned for September.</p>

<p>Much has already been said about this, of course, and there is
likely little new left to be said or that <em>needs</em> to be
said. However, for users who still need or want X.org support,
Debian&nbsp;13 includes X.org sessions for GNOME and KDE. In testing
trixie, I've spent some time in the GNOME and KDE X.org sessions as
well as the Wayland sessions; if there are any gotchas or horrible
bugs, I haven't encountered them (yet). This might be a compelling
reason for some folks to switch to (or stick with) Debian.</p>

<h4>Trying trixie</h4>

<p>I use Debian for my personal web site and blogs, but it has been
quite some time since I used it as my primary desktop operating
system. Debian (and Ubuntu) derivatives, such as <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux&nbsp;Mint</a> and <a href="https://system76.com/pop/">Pop!_OS</a>, yes—but it's been
several years since I've used vanilla Debian on the desktop for
more than casual tinkering.</p>

<p>The Debian release announcement boasts about the number of packages
included in trixie: 64,419 packages total, with 14,100 added and more
than 6,000 removed as <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html#obsolete">obsolete</a>
since bookworm. That is quite a few packages, but falls short of some
other distributions. For example, "<tt>dnf repoquery --repo=fedora
--available</tt>" shows more than 76,000 packages available for
Fedora&nbsp;42.</p>

<p>After installing Debian, I went to install some of my preferred
software, such as <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/993498/">aerc</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1004377/">Ghostty</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1025866/">niri</a>, and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/987315/">Speech Note</a>. The aerc
packages in trixie are current, but Ghostty and niri are not packaged
for Debian at all. Ghostty is written in Zig, which is also not
available, so users who want to build it from source will need to
install Zig separately and then build Ghostty. Speech Note is packaged
as a Flatpak, but Debian does not enable Flatpaks or Flathub in the
GNOME Software Store by default. Users who want Flatpaks on Debian via
Flathub will need to install the <tt>flatpak</tt> package and manually
add the Flathub repo:</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
</pre>

<p>Users will need to add the <tt>gnome-software-plugin-flatpak</tt>
package for Flatpak support in GNOME&nbsp;Software, and
<tt>plasma-discover-backend-flatpak</tt> to add it to
KDE&nbsp;Discover.</p>

<p>Trixie ships with the Firefox extended-support release (ESR) by
default: <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/128.0esr/releasenotes/">Firefox
128</a>, which was released in July 2024. Happily,
Mozilla offers a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux">Debian
repository</a> for those who want to run more current versions. Even
better, there is a little-advertised utility called <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/extrepo">extrepo</a> that
has a curated list of external repositories users might want to enable
for Debian. To enable the Mozilla repository, for example, a user only
needs to install extrepo, run
"<tt>extrepo&nbsp;enable&nbsp;mozilla</tt>" as root (or with
sudo), update the package cache, and look for the regular
Firefox package. In all, extrepo includes more than 160 external
repositories for applications like <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker&nbsp;CE</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/download/">Signal</a>, and <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. Unfortunately, the
extrepo utility does not have a separate "list" command to show the
available repositories, though running "<tt>extrepo&nbsp;search</tt>"
with no search parameter will return all of its DEB822-formatted
repository entries. Some of the software is
in an external repository due to a non-free license, other software (like
Firefox) just has a development cycle that outpaces Debian's.</p>

<p>As one might expect, the Debian desktop experience is not
dramatically different from other distributions; GNOME&nbsp;48 on
Debian is little different than GNOME&nbsp;48 on Fedora, and the same
is true for KDE, Xfce, etc. The primary difference is that users can
expect more or less the same desktop experience running Debian stable
in two years that they have today, which is not necessarily true for
other distributions.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>One of the features in Debian&nbsp;13 is something that most users
won't notice or appreciate at all: a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/64bit-time">transition to
64-bit <tt>time_t</tt></a> on 32-bit architectures, to avoid the <a href="https://theyear2038problem.com/">Year 2038</a> problem. The
short version is that 32-bit integers cannot hold a Unix epoch
timestamp for dates after January&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2038. That <em>may</em> seem
like a distant concern, even irrelevant for Debian trixie; after all,
Debian&nbsp;13 is only supported by the project until 2030. However,
the project expects that some 32-bit embedded systems will still be running
trixie in 2038, so Debian developers did the heavy lifting to complete
the transition to 64-bit <tt>time_t</tt> now. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/938149/">covered</a> the early planning
for this in 2023.</p>

<p>By now, most users have retired their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a>
SSH keys; if not, now is the time to do so. DSA keys were disabled by
default with OpenSSH in 2015, and they are entirely disabled now with
the <tt>openssh-client</tt> and <tt>openssh-server</tt> packages in
trixie. If there is a device that can, for some reason, only be
connected to with DSA, users can install the
<tt>openssh-client-ssh1</tt> package and use <tt>ssh1</tt> to make the
connection.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/975565/">covered</a> in
June&nbsp;2024, Debian&nbsp;13 has switched to using a tmpfs
filesystem for the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory. By default, Debian
allocates up to 50% of memory to <tt>/tmp</tt>, but this can be
changed by following the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#the-temporary-files-directory-tmp-is-now-stored-in-a-tmpfs">instructions
in the release notes</a>. Note that this also applies to systems that
are upgraded to trixie from bookworm.</p>

<h4>Forward to forky</h4>

<p>Debian Project Leader (DPL) Andreas Tille <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/aKAHHO30ZhM7zz4v@an3as.eu/">recently
announced</a> "<q>Debian's 100000th birthday</q>", so clearly the project has a
bit of experience with putting out solid releases. Granted, he was
reporting the number in binary, but even when converted to decimal 
numbers (32 years), it's an impressive track record.</p>

<p>While testing, I installed trixie on a couple of systems, including
a new <a href="https://frame.work/laptop12">Framework&nbsp;12-inch laptop</a>. My original intent was to just see
whether Debian had any problems with the new hardware (it didn't), but
now I'm leaning toward sticking with Debian on this system for a while
to see if stability suits me.</p>

<p>With trixie out the door, the Debian Project has already turned its
attention to working on forky, which has no release date set. Debian has
stuck to a loose schedule of a new stable release roughly every two
years. Most likely we will see Debian&nbsp;14 sometime in 2027. After
the forky release, trixie will still receive updates from Debian's
security team through 2028, and then from its <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">LTS team</a> through 2030.</p>

<p>As of yet, there are no major new features or changes announced for
forky; it seems likely that those will be coming to light in the
coming months now that the project has trixie out the door. LWN will,
of course, be reporting on those developments as they happen.</p>

<p>Attendees at EuroPython had the chance to preview part of
<em>Python: The Documentary</em> during <a href="https://programme.europython.eu/europython-2025/talk/JKZDUY/">a
keynote panel</a>. The full film, created by <a href="https://www.cultrepo.com/">CultRepo</a>, is now available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfH4QL4VqJ0">on YouTube</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the story of the world's most beloved programming language:
Python. What began as a side project in Amsterdam during the 1990s
became the software powering artificial intelligence, data science and
some of the world's biggest companies. But Python's future wasn't
certain; at one point it almost disappeared.</p>

<p>This 90-minute documentary features Guido van Rossum, Travis
Oliphant, Barry Warsaw, and many more, and they tell the story of
Python's rise, its community-driven evolution, the conflicts that
almost tore it apart, and the language's impact on... well...
everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf2AqQ5a38Y">video</a>
of the keynote is also available.</p>

       is my latest most-used iPhone app. It is a simple, free RSS reader. 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      RSS is an old technology that it seems most people have forgotten about. Here's how it works: you enter a link to an RSS "feed", and your app pulls data from this feed every few minutes or so. When there is a new post from your feed, that post is pulled directly to your app. 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      RSS is really simple, so it is still very well supported. Notably, all substack publications automatically have an RSS feed included at 
    </span>
  <code>https://{{substack-domain}}/feed</code>
    <span>
      . 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      Blogs are great but I don't enjoy reading posts in my email, having to remember the websites each one is hosted at, or reading from each publications' different typesetting opinions with varying pop-ups and advertisements. An RSS reader centralizes all content from your blogs into a single place for reading. 
    </span>
  </p><p>
    <span>
      Since I started using this app I spend much more of my "mindless phone time" reading blog posts, which I think is somewhere between marginally good and good.

  <p>We’ve all sat in those presentations.  A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.</p><p>January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  </p><p>The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  </p><p>As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.  </p>

    </div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_17738">
  <p>It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  </p><p>NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:</p>
</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_26426">
  <p>NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.  At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating.  Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven.  The oldest crew member was 48.  </p><p>The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began.  The cause of the accident became clear: <em>a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated</em>.  </p><p>The questions to answer included a very simple one: <strong>Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry? </strong> </p><p>Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide.  His findings were tragically profound.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_66458">

<p> Firstly, the slide had a misleadingly reassuring title claiming that test data pointed to the tile being able to withstand the foam strike.  This was not the case but the presence of the title, centred in the largest font makes this seem the salient, summary point of this slide.  This helped Boeing’s message be lost almost immediately.</p>






















</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_70933">
  <p>Secondly, the slide contains four different bullet points with no explanation of what they mean.  This means that interpretation is left up to the reader.  Is number 1 the main bullet point?  Do the bullet points become less important or more?  It’s not helped that there’s a change in font sizes as well.  In all with bullet points and indents six levels of hierarchy were created.  This allowed NASA managers to imply a hierarchy of importance in their head: the writing lower down and in smaller font was ignored.  Actually, this had been where the contradictory (and most important) information was placed.  </p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_26463">

<p>Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen.   Two words, ‘SOFI’ and ‘ramp’ both mean the same thing: the foam.  Vague terms are used.  <em>Sufficient</em> is used once, <em>significant </em>or <em>significantly</em>, five times with little or no quantifiable data.  As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation.  How much is significant?  Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?  </p>






















</div><div data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555166931302_75625">

<p>Finally the single most important fact, that the foam strike had occurred at forces massively out of test conditions, is hidden at the very bottom.  Twelve little words which the audience would have had to wade through more than 100 to get to.  If they even managed to keep reading to that point.  In the middle it does say that it is possible for the foam to damage the tile.  This is in the smallest font, lost. </p>






















</div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1555332030872_55842">
  <p>NASA’s subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors.  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_full.pdf" target="_blank">Their report</a> mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint:</p><p><em> “The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.” </em></p><p> Edward Tufte’s full report makes for<a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB" target="_blank"> fascinating reading</a>. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where <a href="https://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/are-we-wasting-250-million-per-day-due-to-bad-powerpoint/" target="_blank">it is now estimated</a> than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day.  Yet, PowerPoint is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/powerpoint-thought-students-bullet-points-information" target="_blank">blamed</a> by academics for killing critical thought.  Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/08/22/jeff-bezos-banned-powerpoint-presentations-at-amazon-meetings-heres-what-replaced-them/#4578b4773b5f" target="_blank">banned it from meetings</a>.   Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching.  An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning.  Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: “<strong>foam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data</strong>.”  Maybe NASA would have listened.  Maybe they wouldn’t have attempted re-entry.  Next time you’re asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don’t just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text.  Think about your message.  Don’t let that message be lost amongst text.  Death by PowerPoint is a real thing.  Sometimes literally.</p><p>Thanks for reading</p><p> - Jamie </p>

<p>One of the biggest lessons that I've learned in my career is that all software has bugs, and the more complicated your software gets the more complicated your bugs get. A lot of the time those bugs will be fairly obvious and easy to spot, validate, and replicate. Sometimes, the process of fixing it will uncover your core assumptions about how things work in ways that will leave you feeling like you just got trolled.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to talk about a single line fix that prevents people on a large number of devices from having weird irreproducible issues with Anubis rejecting people when it frankly shouldn't. Stick around, it's gonna be a wild ride.</p>

<p>In order to make sure the proof of work challenge screen <em>goes away as fast as possible</em>, the <a href="https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/tree/main/web/js/worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worker code</a> is optimized within an inch of its digital life. One of the main ways that this code is optimized is with how it's run. Over the last 10-20 years, the main way that CPUs have gotten fast is via increasing multicore performance. Anubis tries to make sure that it can use as many cores as possible in order to take advantage of your device's CPU as much as it can.</p>
<p>This strategy sometimes has some issues though, for one Firefox seems to get <em>much slower</em> if you have Anubis try to absolutely saturate all of the cores on the system. It also has a fairly high overhead between JavaScript JIT code and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebCrypto</a>. I did some testing and found out that Firefox's point of diminishing returns was about half of the CPU cores.</p>
<h2 id="another-invalid-response-bug">Another "invalid response" bug<a href="#another-invalid-response-bug" aria-label="Direct link to Another &quot;invalid response&quot; bug" title="Direct link to Another &quot;invalid response&quot; bug">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the complaints I've been getting from users and administrators using Anubis is that they've been running into issues where users get randomly rejected with an error message only saying "invalid response". This happens when the challenge validating process fails. This issue has been blocking the release of the next version of Anubis.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate this better, I've made a little interactive diagram for the proof of work process:</p>
<div><div><div><h2>1. Challenge</h2><p>3e2c67c9ef91d81fff589db473a2f996</p></div><div><h2>3. Combined Data</h2><p>3e2c67c9ef91d81fff589db473a2f9960</p></div></div><div><h2>4. Resulting Hash (SHA-256)</h2><p><span>...</span></p></div></div>
<p>I've fixed a lot of the easy bugs in Anubis by this point. A lot of what's left is the hard bugs, but also specifically the kinds of hard bugs that involve weird hardware configurations. In order to try and catch these issues before software hits prod, I test Anubis against a bunch of hardware I have locally. Any issues I find and fix before software ships are issues that you don't hit in production.</p>
<p>Let's consider <a href="https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/blob/main/web/js/algorithms/fast.mjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the line of code</a> that was causing this issue:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>hardwareConcurrency</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is intended to make your browser spawn a proof of work worker for <em>half</em> of your available CPU cores. If you only have one CPU core, you should only have one worker. Each thread is given this number of threads and uses that to increment the nonce so that each thread doesn't try to find a solution that another worker has already performed.</p>
<p>One of the subtle problems here is that all of the parts of this assume that the thread ID and nonce are integers without a decimal portion. Famously, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all JavaScript numbers are IEEE 754 floating point numbers</a>. Surely there wouldn't be a case where the thread count could be a <em>decimal</em> number, right?</p>
<p>Here's all the devices I use to test Anubis <em>and their core counts</em>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Device Name</th><th>Core Count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MacBook Pro M3 Max</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>MacBook Pro M4 Max</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen 9 7950x3D</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Google Pixel 9a (GrapheneOS)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 15 Pro Max</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>iPad Pro (M1)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>iPad mini</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Deck</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Core i5 10600 (homelab)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>ROG Ally</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Notice something? All of those devices have an <em>even</em> number of cores. Some devices such as the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_8_pro-12545.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel 8 Pro</a> have an <em>odd</em> number of cores. So what happens with that line of code as the JavaScript engine evaluates it?</p>
<p>Let's replace the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/hardwareConcurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>navigator.hardwareConcurrency</code></a> with the Pixel 8 Pro's 9 cores:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then divide it by two:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>4.5</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Oops, that's not ideal. However <code>4.5</code> is bigger than <code>1</code>, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Math.max</code></a> returns that:</p>

<p>This means that each time the proof of work equation is calculated, there is a 50% chance that a valid solution would include a nonce with a decimal portion in it. If the client finds a solution with such a nonce, then it would think the client was successful and submit the solution to the server, but the server only expects whole numbers back so it rejects that as an invalid response.</p>
<p>I keep telling more junior people that when you have the weirdest, most inconsistent bugs in software that it's going to boil down to the dumbest possible thing you can possibly imagine. People don't believe me, then they encounter bugs like this. Then they suddenly believe me.</p>
<p>Here is the fix:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>threads </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>trunc</span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>hardwareConcurrency</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/trunc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Math.trunc</code></a> to truncate away the decimal portion so that the Pixel 8 Pro has <code>4</code> workers instead of <code>4.5</code> workers.</p>
<h2 id="today-i-learned-this-was-possible">Today I learned this was possible<a href="#today-i-learned-this-was-possible" aria-label="Direct link to Today I learned this was possible" title="Direct link to Today I learned this was possible">​</a></h2>
<p>This was a total "today I learned" moment. I didn't actually think that hardware vendors shipped processors with an odd number of cores, however if you look at the core geometry of the Pixel 8 Pro, it has <em>three</em> tiers of processor cores:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Core type</th><th>Core model</th><th>Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High performance</td><td>3 Ghz Cortex X3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Medium performance</td><td>2.45 Ghz Cortex A715</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>High efficiency</td><td>2.15 Cortex A510</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I guess every assumption that developers have about CPU design is probably wrong.</p>
<p>This probably isn't helped by the fact that for most of my career, the core count in phones has been largely irrelevant and most of the desktop / laptop CPUs I've had (where core count does matter) uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simultaneous multithreading</a> to "multiply" the core count by two.</p>
<p>The client side fix is a bit of an "emergency stop" button to try and mitigate the badness as early as possible. In general I'm quite aware of the terrible UX involved with this flow failing and I'm still noodling through ways to make that UX better and easier for users / administrators to debug.</p>
<p>I'm looking into the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>This could have been prevented on the server side by doing less strict input validation in compliance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postel's Law</a>. I feel nervous about making such a security-sensitive endpoint <em>more liberal</em> with the inputs it can accept, but it may be fine? I need to consult with a security expert.</li>
<li>Showing an encrypted error message on the "invalid response" page so that the user and administrator can work together to fix or report the issue. I remember Google doing this at least once, but I can't recall where I've seen it in the past. Either way, this is probably the most robust method even though it would require developing some additional tooling. I think it would be worth it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm likely going to go with the second option. I will need to figure out a good flow for this. It's likely going to involve <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age</a>. I'll say more about this when I have more to say.</p>
<p>In the meantime though, looks like I need to expense a used Pixel 8 Pro to add to the testing jungle for Anubis. If anyone has a deal out there, please let me know!</p>
<p>Thank you to the people that have been polite and helpful when trying to root cause and fix this issue.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>It’s awful. And you don’t need it.</p>

<p>The intro paragraph of this post is tongue-in-cheek. It’s there to get you to read the rest of the post. I suspect the megabytes of tracking scripts intertwined with bad code is far more likely to be the real culprit behind all the terrible sites out there. Web frameworks have their time and place. And despite my personal distaste for them, I know they are used by many teams to build awesome well-optimized apps.</p>
<p>Despite that, I think there’s some beauty in leaving it all behind. Not just the frameworks, but JavaScript altogether.<!-- [Figmas](https://www.figma.com/) and [Photopeas](https://www.photopea.com/) need their JavaScript. [Interactive](https://x3c.tf/archive/) [experiences](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) do[^interactive]. But does your homepage or blog need it?--> Not every site needs JavaScript. Perhaps your <a href="https://justfuckingusereact.com/">e-commerce site needs it for its complex carts and data visualization dashboards</a>, but is it really a necessity for most of what’s out there?</p>
<p>It’s actually <a href="https://lyra.horse/css-clicker/">pretty incredible</a> what HTML and CSS alone can achieve.</p>
<!--I don't think that everyone should switch to a strict CSS-only diet, but I do believe that the average web developer could benefit from knowing just a little more about our cascading little friend.-->
<h2 id="so-what-do-you-say">So, what do you say?</h2>
<p>My goal with this article is to share my perspectives on the web, as well as introduce many aspects of modern HTML/CSS you may not be familiar with. I’m not trying to make you give up JavaScript, I’m just trying to show you everything that’s possible, leaving it up to you to pick what works best for whatever you’re working on.</p>
<p>I think there’s a lot most web developers don’t know about CSS.</p>
<p>And I think JS is often used where better alternatives exist.</p>
<p>So, let me show you what’s out there.</p>

<h2 id="but-css-sucks">“But CSS sucks”</h2>
<p>I believe a lot of the negativity towards CSS stems from not really knowing how to use it. Many developers kind of just skip learning the CSS fundamentals in favor of the more interesting Java- and TypeScript, and then go on to complain about a styling language they don’t understand.</p>
<p>I suspect this is due to many treating CSS as this silly third wheel for adding borders and box-shadows to a webapp. <!--rephrase-->It’s undervalued and often compared to glorified crayons, rather than what it really is - a powerful domain-specific programming language.</p>
<p>It’s telling when to this day the only CSS joke in the webdev circles is centering a div.</p>
<!-- it was fun recreating all of the flexbox icons in css haha -->
<code-compare id="center-gadget" aria-label="a centered div and its code" role="figure"><fake-frame id="demo-center-gadget">

<p>Yes, the syntax isn’t the prettiest, but is it <em>really</em> that hard?</p>
<p>Besides, your devtools probably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> come with a fun little gadget that lets you fiddle with the flexbox by just clicking around. You don’t even need to remember the syntax.</p>
<!--i wanted to write about: maybe something about box-model and clock directions-->
<p>I don’t think CSS is fundamentally any more difficult than JS, but if you skip the basics on one and only focus on the other, it’s no surprise it feels that way.</p>
<h2 id="but-its-painful-to-write">“But it’s painful to write”</h2>
<p>Another source of disdain for CSS is how awful it has been to write in the past. This is very much true, and is probably why things like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> exist.</p>

<p><em>(yes! the code above is standards compliant<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>In the past few years, CSS has received a ton of awesome quality-of-life additions, making it nice to do stuff that has historically required preprocessors or JavaScript.</p>
<p>Nesting is definitely one of my favorite additions!</p>
<p>In the past, you’ve had to write code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>: <sx-n>#24A4F3</sx-n>;
  <sx-e>--like-color-hover</sx-e>: <sx-n>#54B8F5</sx-n>;

<p>And yeah, that’s pretty awful to work with. For anything that involves multiple chained selectors, you kind of have to keep a mental map of how every parent selector relates to its children, and the more CSS you add the harder it gets.</p>
<p>But let’s try it with nesting:</p>
<pre><code>:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>: <sx-n>#24A4F3</sx-n>;
  <sx-e>--like-color-hover</sx-e>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-a>from</sx-a> <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>) <sx-a>h</sx-a> <sx-a>s</sx-a> <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-a>l</sx-a> + <sx-n>10</sx-n>));
  <sx-e>--like-color-active</sx-e>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-a>from</sx-a> <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--like-color</sx-e>) <sx-a>h</sx-a> <sx-a>s</sx-a> <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-a>l</sx-a> - <sx-n>20</sx-n>));
}

.<sx-y>post</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>display</sx-p>: <sx-a>block</sx-a>;

<p>That is way nicer to read<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>! All the relevant parts are right next to each other, so it’s a lot easier to understand what’s going on. Seeing the <code>&amp;:hover</code> and <code>&amp;:active</code> right next to the <code>.like</code> button is especially nice imo.</p>
<p>And since you can sort of see the structure - the parent selectors “guarding” the child ones - it also makes it a lot easier to get away with short and simple class names (or even referring to elements themselves).</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I’m also making use of relative colors in the second example. I think the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors">MDN article</a> has a lot of awesome examples, but the jist of it is that you can take an existing color, modify it in many different ways across multiple color spaces, and mix it with other colors using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix">color-mix()</a>.</p>

<p>These snippets are really useful for when you want something to be just ever so slightly darker or brighter, such as a button hover effect or a matching border color, and they’re way nicer to use than doing all those color conversions in JavaScript. If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, you could even go ahead and generate your entire color scheme in just CSS.</p>

<p>There are so many cool new CSS features that make writing it just that little bit nicer. Things like letting you use <code>(width &lt;= 768px)</code> instead of <code>(max-width: 768px)</code> in your <a href="https://web.dev/articles/media-query-range-syntax"><em>@media</em> query</a>, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#lh">lh unit</a> that matches the line-height, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter">scrollbar-gutter</a> property that solves the little scrollbar-related layout shifts, or the ability to finally <a href="https://web.dev/blog/align-content-block">center stuff vertically</a> without flex/grid.</p>
<art-frame aria-label="Baseline logo" role="img" flex="">

Baseline</art-frame>
<p>And all of this is brought together by the cherry on top that is <a href="https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/">Baseline</a>. It’s a guarantee that a specific feature works in every major browser<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and it also lets you know since when - <strong>newly available</strong> features work in all the latest browsers, and <strong>widely available</strong> ones work in browsers up to 2.5 years old. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector">Nesting</a>, for example, has been fully supported in all browsers since December 2023, and thus will become <em>widely available</em> in June 2026. You can find the Baseline symbols in various places, such as the MDN docs<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of what makes modern CSS so much nicer to write than what we had even just 5 years ago. It almost feels like comparing ES3<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> to ECMAScript 2025 - and I wouldn’t blame your grudge if the former is what you’re used to.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>Okay, so CSS has more quality-of-life stuff than before. Still, why would one choose to use it over something else? Doesn’t JavaScript already let us do everything just fine?</p>
<art-frame aria-label="You need to disable JavaScript to run this app" role="img" center=""><fake-frame>You need to <span>disable</span> JavaScript to run this app.</fake-frame></art-frame>
<p>I think my reasons for using CSS fall into two main categories - because some users don’t want to use JavaScript, and because doing things in CSS can be genuinely better.</p>
<p>My blog, for example, focuses on infosec topics. Many security researchers (myself included) use a hardened browser configuration to protect themselves, which often means disabling JavaScript by default. I think it’s nice that they can fully experience my blog without changing their security settings or running a separate, sandboxed browser.</p>
<p>The same goes for privacy-conscious users, and it makes sense! As an experiment, I opened up a local Estonian news site in a web browser with JavaScript enabled. Can you guess how many js files it fetched? <em>(answer in footnote<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>)</em> That’s crazy! You do not want that running on your computer.</p>
<p>But surely, you are not <em>one of the evil devs</em> who loads a double-digit number of analytics scripts on your site - is there still any reason to reach for CSS?</p>
<p>Well, I think a lot of things are just plain nicer to make in HTML/CSS, both from the developer and end-user perspectives, be it for ease of use, accessibility, or performance.</p>
<p>Hover effects for your buttons? Toast animations? Input validation? All of these things <em>just work</em> in CSS, and you won’t have to reinvent the wheel, or throw kilobytes of someone else’s code at it. There will always be some cases where you do need that extra flexibility JavaScript often provides, but if you don’t need that, and doing it in CSS is easier, then why not save yourself the trouble?</p>

<p>And the performance of CSS is so much better! Every JavaScript interaction has to go through an event loop that wastes CPU cycles, eats some battery, and adds that tiny bit of stutter to everything.</p>
<p>Sure, in the grand scale of things it isn’t <em>that</em> bad, APIs like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame</a> are really good at keeping things smooth. But CSS animations run in the separate compositor thread, and <a href="https://web.dev/articles/animations-and-performance#css_vs_javascript_performance">aren’t affected</a> by stutters and blocking in the event loop.</p>
<p>It makes quite a difference on low-end devices, but feels nice even on high-end ones. CSS animations on my 240hz monitor look amazing<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> - JS can look pretty good too, but it has that tiny bit of stutter to it that keeps it from being perfect, especially if you plan on running other heavy code at the same time.</p>
<p>It also means you won’t have to worry as much about optimization, as the browser takes care of a lot more of the rendering side of things, and often runs your stuff on the GPU if possible.</p>
<p><em>Pro tip! Wanna trigger animations from JS anyways? Use the modern <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API">Web Animations API</a> to easily play the smooth CSS animations from JS.</em></p>
<h2 id="transitioning">Transitioning</h2>
<!--Speaking of which, let's get to the first show & tell section of the post, where I show you something cool and tell you how it's made.-->
<p>Speaking of which, I think it’s time I start showing you practical examples, and a good place to <em>start</em> showing the <em>styles</em> is well, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style"><em>@starting-style</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the past it has been pretty annoying to add start animations (such as fade-ins) to elements. You’ve had to either set up an entire CSS animation with a separate <em>@keyframes</em> block to go with it, or do a transition using JavaScript where you first add an element to the page, then wait a frame, and then add a class to the element.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: A toast message fading in from bottom" role="figure" id="starting-style-toast"><code-frame role="code">.<sx-y>toast</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>transition</sx-p>: <sx-a>opacity</sx-a> <sx-n>1s</sx-n>, <sx-a>translate</sx-a> <sx-n>1s</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>opacity</sx-p>: <sx-n>1</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>translate</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n> <sx-n>0</sx-n>;
  <sx-z>@starting-style</sx-z> {
    <sx-p>opacity</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>translate</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n> <sx-n>10px</sx-n>;
  }
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame><span></span><p>Success!</p></fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>But this has all changed thanks to the new <em>@starting-style</em> at-rule!</p>
<p>Pretty much all you have to do is set your properties as usual, add the initial transition states to <em>@starting-style</em>, and add those properties to a transition. It’s pretty simple and it kind of <em>just works</em> without having to trigger the animation in any way.</p>
<h2 id="lunalover">Lunalover</h2>
<p>Another good example of where CSS shines is theming. Many sites <em>need</em> separate light and dark modes, and modern CSS makes dealing with that pretty easy.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Various elements affected by theme setting" role="figure" id="dark-example-1"><code-frame role="code">:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>light</sx-a> <sx-a>dark</sx-a>;
  <sx-e>--text</sx-e>: <sx-k>light-dark</sx-k>(<sx-n>#000</sx-n>, <sx-n>#FFF</sx-n>);
  <sx-e>--bg</sx-e>: <sx-k>light-dark</sx-k>(<sx-n>#EEE</sx-n>, <sx-n>#242936</sx-n>);
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame><p>hi there!</p><a href="https://karnaboy.bandcamp.com/track/lunalover" target="_blank"></a><p>you are awesome!<br><label>i am!</label></p></fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>By setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme">color-scheme</a> property to <code>light dark</code>, you are telling the browser to automatically pick the theme according to the user preference, and you can then make use of that by setting color values with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark">light-dark()</a> function.</p>
<p>Not only does it set your own colors, but also those of the native components, such as the default buttons, form elements, and scrollbars. It kind of just <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rebane2001/115060623979682479">makes stuff work</a> by default, and that’s nice!</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Buttons to change theme between auto, light, and dark" role="figure" id="dark-example-2"><code-frame role="code">:<sx-l>root</sx-l> {
  <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>light</sx-a> <sx-a>dark</sx-a>;
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(#<sx-a>theme-light</sx-a>:<sx-l>checked</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>light</sx-a>;
  }
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(#<sx-a>theme-dark</sx-a>:<sx-l>checked</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>color-scheme</sx-p>: <sx-a>dark</sx-a>;
  }
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame><theme-picker aria-label="Theme picker" role="radiogroup">
    <label>Auto</label>
    <label>Light</label>
    <label>Dark</label>
  </theme-picker></fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>You can then add some way of overriding the <em>color-scheme</em> property to let the user pick a theme different from their system setting. Here I am using radio buttons to accomplish that.</p>
<p><em>Pro tip! CSS can’t save the theme preference, but you can still do progressive enhancement. Make the themes work CSS-only, and then add the saving/loading of preference as an optional extra in JavaScript or server-side code.</em></p>
<h2 id="lyres-and-accordions">Lyres and accordions</h2>
<p><em>“But those don’t look like radio buttons”</em> I hear you cry.</p>
<p>Input elements such as radio buttons and checkboxes are a great foundation to build other stuff on top of - the example above consists of labels for the buttons and invisible radio buttons that can be checked for with the <em>:checked</em> pseudo-class.</p>

<fake-frame><radio-picker aria-label="Radio buttons example" role="radiogroup">

<p>This is how I made the theme selector from the previous example. I’ve made the radio buttons half-visible in the demo for clarity, but with the <code>opacity: 0</code> they would not actually be visible.</p>
<p>There’s a whole lot going on here, so let’s break it down.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;radio-picker</sx-t> <sx-r>aria-label</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"Radio buttons example"</sx-v> <sx-r>role</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radiogroup"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>
<p>We start off with the <em>radio-picker</em> element - I just made it up, you can use a div instead if you’d prefer. We give it an aria-label to give the group an accessible name, and the aria role of <em>radiogroup</em> to make it work as a group for the radio buttons.</p>
<p>You could also use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/fieldset"><em>fieldset</em></a> element instead of doing the aria roles if that’d fit your use case better.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</sx-t> <sx-r>type</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radio"</sx-v> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"demo"</sx-v> <sx-r>id</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"veni"</sx-v> <sx-r>checked</sx-r><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>veni<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>
<sx-t>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</sx-t> <sx-r>type</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radio"</sx-v> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"demo"</sx-v> <sx-r>id</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"vidi"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>vidi<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>
<sx-t>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input</sx-t> <sx-r>type</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"radio"</sx-v> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"demo"</sx-v> <sx-r>id</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"vici"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>vici<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we add the radio buttons with their respective labels - usually you’d have to use the <em>for</em> attribute on labels to define which element they’re referring to, but since we have the <em>input</em> inside the <em>label</em> we don’t have to do that.</p>
<p>All the <code>type="radio"</code> inputs should also have a <em>name</em> value set to the same thing so that they are grouped together (you still need<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> the radiogroup though). And then you can give them values or ids however you want.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>label</sx-t> {
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(<sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>checked</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>box-shadow</sx-p>: <sx-a>inset</sx-a> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>8px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>#888</sx-n>;
  }
  &amp;:<sx-l>has</sx-l>(<sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>focus-visible</sx-l>) {
    <sx-p>outline</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-n>#000</sx-n>;
  }
  <sx-p>box-shadow</sx-p>: <sx-a>inset</sx-a> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>1.2px</sx-n> <sx-n>0px</sx-n> <sx-n>#000</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>10px</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>cursor</sx-p>: <sx-a>pointer</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#0002</sx-n>;
  &amp;:<sx-l>hover</sx-l> { <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#0004</sx-n>; }
  &amp;:<sx-l>active</sx-l> { <sx-p>background</sx-p>: <sx-n>#0006</sx-n>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We then style the labels as we wish - the <em>:hover</em> and <em>:active</em> pseudo-classes can be used to make the buttons more fun to click, the <em>:has(input:checked)</em> selector can be used to define the style of the selected button, and the <em>:has(input:focus-visible)</em> selector can be used to add an outline when someone tabs over to the button.</p>
<p>The difference between <em>:focus</em> and <em>:focus-visible</em> is that the former shows up even if you use your mouse, while the latter only shows up when you use keyboard navigation, so it’s often visually more clean to use the latter.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>input</sx-t> {
  <sx-p>opacity</sx-p>: <sx-n>0</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>position</sx-p>: <sx-a>absolute</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>pointer-events</sx-p>: <sx-a>none</sx-a>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And last, we make the radio button input <em>exist</em> while not being visible. This is a bit hacky, but it’s how you can keep this control accessible to keyboard navigation and screen readers.</p>
<p>And that’s how we get the cool-looking radio buttons!</p>

<p>We can now use them in the CSS however we want by just seeing if they’re <em>:checked</em>. Here I made tabs with separate divs for the content by using a <em>:has</em> selector on a parent element to find out which radio button is currently selected.</p>
<p>The <em>:has</em> selector has to be on a parent element that contains both the radio button and the target element - you can simply use <em>html</em> or <em>body</em> if you want it to work across the entire page. You should <strong>never</strong> use something like <code>:has(…)</code> by itself as it’ll run the selector for every element of the page, which can cause performance issues (<code>body:has(…)</code> is okay).</p>

<p>Finally, before we move on, I want to give you a quick introduction to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/details">details</a> element. It’s great for if you want an accordion-style menu, such as for a FAQ section. The details open and close independently of each other, but you can set their name attribute to the same value to have only one open at a time.</p>
<p>Using them is pretty easy, put your content and a <em>summary</em> tag inside a <em>details</em> tag, and put the title inside the <em>summary</em> tag. The example above is a bit more convoluted for the visual flair, but all you <em>really</em> need is the html part of it.</p>
<p>The details elements are pretty stylable! You can add animations depending on the <em>[open]</em> state, and you can also get rid of the arrow by setting <code>list-style: none</code> on the <em>summary</em>.</p>
<p>Also, ctrl+f works with it, which is a big win in my book!</p>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>And lastly, I want to show you the power of input validation in HTML and CSS.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Input validation" role="figure" vertical="" id="validation-example-1"><code-frame role="code"><sx-t>&lt;label</sx-t> <sx-r>for</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"usrname"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>Username<sx-t>&lt;/label&gt;</sx-t>

<sx-t>&lt;small&gt;</sx-t>3-16 letters, only alphanum and _.<sx-t>&lt;/small&gt;</sx-t>
<sx-t>&lt;style&gt;</sx-t>
 <sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>valid</sx-l> {
   <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-n>1px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-a>green</sx-a>;
 }
 <sx-t>input</sx-t>:<sx-l>invalid</sx-l> {
   <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-n>1px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
 }
<sx-t>&lt;/style&gt;</sx-t></code-frame>
<fake-frame>
  <p><label for="usrname">Username</label>
    
    <small>3-16 letters, only alphanum and _.</small>
  </p>
</fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>This is a simple example of how you can validate an input field with a regex pattern. If you set a <em>pattern</em> attribute like above, a form that contains the input cannot be submitted unless the field matches the pattern. If you’re submitting something like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/email">an e-mail address</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/tel">a phone number</a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/url">a url</a>, it might make sense to use the respective input types instead of writing your own regex.</p>
<p>Now, where CSS comes in is styling the input to show whether its value is valid. In the example above, I’m using <em>:valid</em> and <em>:invalid</em> to set a border color, but that comes with the downside of <em>always</em> having your input marked, even if the user hasn’t entered anything yet.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: Input validation" role="figure" id="validation-example-2"><code-frame role="code"><sx-t>input</sx-t> {
  <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-a>none</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>border-radius</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n>;
  <sx-p>outline</sx-p>: <sx-n>1px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a> <sx-n>#000</sx-n>;
  &amp;:<sx-l>focus</sx-l> { <sx-p>outline-width</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n>; }
  &amp;:<sx-l>user-valid</sx-l> { <sx-p>outline-color</sx-p>: <sx-a>green</sx-a>; }
  &amp;:<sx-l>user-invalid</sx-l> { <sx-p>outline-color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>; }
}</code-frame>
<fake-frame>
  <p><label for="usrname2">Username</label>
    
    <small>3-16 letters, only alphanum and _.</small>
  </p>
</fake-frame></code-compare>

<p>An easy win here is to instead use <em>:user-valid</em> and <em>:user-invalid</em> - these pseudo-classes only become active once you’ve interacted with input field. I also made this example use an outline instead of a border, which I think looks a lot nicer.</p>
<p>It may sometimes even make sense to use a combination of <em>:valid</em> and <em>:user-invalid</em>.</p>
<p>And of course, you can use the <em>:has</em> selector to style other elements depending on the input too!</p>

<p>I do want to mention that for some stuff, such as date pickers <no-wrap>()</no-wrap> or datalists <no-wrap>()</no-wrap>, there are built-in elements that do the job, but you may find them limited in one way or the other. If you’re making an input like that with specific requirements, you may still need to dip your feet in a bit of JavaScript.</p>

<p>This section is kind of random but I wanted to include it here because I think a lot of people are messing this one up and I want more people to know how to do this stuff right.</p>
<p>So CSS has vw/vh units that correspond to 1% of the viewport width and height respectively, which makes perfect sense for desktop browsers.</p>

<p>Where it becomes a bit more nuanced is on mobile devices. For example, mobile versions of both Firefox and Chrome will hide the URL bar when scrolling down on a page.</p>
<p>This causes the vw/vh units to be a bit ambigous - do they represent the <em>entire</em> available screen, only the area that’s visible with the URL bar, or something in between?</p>
<p>If it’s the first option, you might end up with buttons or links off-screen<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>! If it’s the second, you may end up with a background div that doesn’t cover the entire background.</p>

<p>Above is a table of values your browser reports - if you're on mobile, try scrolling the blogpost up and down so that the URL bar hides and see how the numbers change.</p>
<p>The values are multiplied by 100 (eg 100vh is used instead of 1vh).</p>

</phone-content>
</phone-screen></epic-phone>
</div>
<p>The solution to this is to use the new responsive viewport units: <strong>lvh</strong>, <strong>svh</strong>, and <strong>dvh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>lvh</strong> stands for <em>largest</em> viewport height, and thus is useful for things like backgrounds that you’d want to cover the entire screen with, and wouldn’t care about getting cut off.</p>
<p><strong>svh</strong> stands for <em>smallest</em> viewport height, and should be used for things that must always fit on the screen, such as buttons and links.</p>
<p>And <strong>dvh</strong> stands for <em>dynamic</em> viewport height - this one will update to whatever the current viewport height is. It might seem like the obvious choice, but it should not be used for elements you don’t want resizing or moving around as the user scrolls the page, as it could become quite annoying and possibly even laggy otherwise.</p>
<p>Of course, the respective <strong>lvw</strong>, <strong>svw</strong>, and <strong>dvw</strong> units exist too :).</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-cat">Keyboard cat</h3>
<p>By default, the viewport units do not account for the keyboard overlaying the page.</p>
<p>There are two ways to deal with that: the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Viewport_meta_element#interactive-widget">interactive-widget</a></em> attribute, and the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VirtualKeyboard_API">VirtualKeyboard</a></em> API.</p>
<p>The former option is widely supported across browsers, works without JS, and goes in the meta viewport tag. It makes it so that opening the keyboard will change <em>all</em> of the viewport units.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>&lt;meta</sx-t> <sx-r>name</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"viewport"</sx-v> <sx-r>content</sx-r><sx-t>=</sx-t><sx-v>"width=device-width, interactive-widget=resizes-content"</sx-v><sx-t>&gt;</sx-t>
</code></pre>
<p>The latter option is currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers, and requires a single line of JavaScript to use:</p>
<pre><code><sx-e>navigator</sx-e>.<sx-p>virtualKeyboard</sx-p>.<sx-p>overlaysContent</sx-p> = <sx-a>true</sx-a>;
</code></pre>
<p>The advantage of the second option is that it allows you to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env">environment variables</a> in CSS to get the position and size of the keyboard, which is pretty cool.</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>floating-button</sx-t> {
  <sx-p>margin-bottom</sx-p>: <sx-k>env</sx-k>(<sx-a>keyboard-inset-height</sx-a>, <sx-n>0px</sx-n>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But considering the fact that it doesn’t work cross-browser, I’d avoid it.</p>
<h2 id="css-wishlist">CSS wishlist</h2>
<p>Alright, so this is a little different from the rest of the post, but I wanted to bring up some things that I wish were in CSS. I haven’t fully fleshed out all of them, so some definitely wouldn’t fit the spec as-is, but maybe they can inspire some other stuff at least.</p>
<p>They are just fun ideas, don’t take them too seriously.</p>
<h3 id="reusable-blocks">Reusable blocks</h3>
<p>I wish it was possible to put classes in other classes in CSS, so that you could write something like:</p>
<pre><code>.<sx-y>border</sx-y> {
  <sx-p>border</sx-p>: <sx-n>2px</sx-n> <sx-a>solid</sx-a>;
  <sx-p>border-radius</sx-p>: <sx-n>4px</sx-n>;
}

.<sx-y>button</sx-y> {
  <sx-z>@apply</sx-z> <sx-y>border</sx-y>;
}

.<sx-y>card</sx-y> {
  <sx-z>@apply</sx-z> <sx-y>border</sx-y>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is something that <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply-directive">Tailwind already has</a>, and that makes me jealous.</p>
<!--
### Scoped variables

I wish we could scope variables, so that an inner element could set the value for an outer element.

<pre class="sx-block"><code><sx-t>foo</sx-t> {
  <sx-k>@property</sx-k> <sx-k>--color</sx-k> {
    <sx-p>syntax</sx-p>: <sx-s>'&lt;color&gt;'</sx-s>;
    <sx-p>initial-value</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>scoped</sx-p>: <sx-a>true</sx-a>;
  }
  <sx-t>bar</sx-t> {
    &amp;:<sx-l>hover</sx-l> {
      <sx-e>--color</sx-e>: <sx-a>blue</sx-a>;
    }
  }
  <sx-c>/* foo will be blue on bar hover */</sx-c>
  <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--color</sx-e>);
}
</code></pre>
This idea has a lot of problems in practice, from little things such as nested statements getting reordered, to bigger issues that'd require rewriting and rethinking big parts of CSS. I don't see this ever being added, but it would be fun to have.
-->
<h3 id="combined-media-selectors">Combined @media selectors</h3>
<p>We can currently do nested <em>@media</em> queries, and also multiple selectors at the same time:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  &amp;.<sx-y>foo</sx-y>, &amp;.<sx-y>bar</sx-y> {
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>2em</sx-n>;
  }
  <sx-z>@media</sx-z> (<sx-p>width</sx-p> &lt; <sx-n>480px</sx-n>) {
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>2em</sx-n>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But we cannot combine the two into a single selector:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-z>@media</sx-z> (<sx-p>width</sx-p> &lt; <sx-n>480px</sx-n>), &amp;.<sx-y>foo</sx-y> {
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-a>red</sx-a>;
    <sx-p>padding</sx-p>: <sx-n>8px</sx-n>;
    <sx-p>font-size</sx-p>: <sx-n>2em</sx-n>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which means if you want to do that you’ll inevitably have to repeat code or do some silly variable hacks, neither of which is ideal.</p>
<h3 id="n-th-child-variable">n-th child variable</h3>
<p>For many of the CSS crimes I like to commit, I often end up writing code like:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>1</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>1</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>2</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>2</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>3</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>3</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>4</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>4</sx-n>; }
  <sx-t>span</sx-t>:<sx-l>nth-child</sx-l>(<sx-n>5</sx-n>) { <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-n>5</sx-n>; }
  ...
  <sx-y>span</sx-y> {
    <sx-p>top</sx-p>: <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e> * <sx-n>24px</sx-n>);
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e>) * <sx-n>90deg</sx-n>) <sx-n>100</sx-n> <sx-n>90</sx-n>);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I think it would be a lot nicer if we could instead just do:</p>
<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-t>span</sx-t> {
    <sx-e>--nth</sx-e>: <sx-k>nth-child</sx-k>();
    <sx-p>top</sx-p>: <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e> * <sx-n>24px</sx-n>);
    <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--nth</sx-e>) * <sx-n>90deg</sx-n>) <sx-n>100</sx-n> <sx-n>90</sx-n>);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="n-th-letter-targeting">n-th letter targeting</h3>
<p>CSS has the ability to style the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::first-letter">::first-letter</a> of text. It’d be cool if were was also a <strong>::nth-letter(…)</strong> selector, similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child">:nth-child</a>. I suspect the reason this isn’t a thing is because the <em>::first-letter</em> selector is a pseudo-element, which would be a bit tricky to implement with the nth-letter idea.</p>
<code-compare aria-label="Demo: the letter i in hi there is made red" role="figure" id="nth-example"><code-frame role="code"><sx-c>/* not a real feature */</sx-c>
<sx-t>p</sx-t>::<sx-l>nth-letter</sx-l>(2) {

}</code-frame>
<fake-frame>
<p>h<span>i</span> there~</p>
</fake-frame></code-compare>

<p><a href="https://www.blackle-mori.com/">Blackle</a> suggested that combining the nth-child() variable with :nth-letter targeting would also be fun for certain effects, such as putting the value in the sin() function to create wavy text.</p>

<h3 id="unit-removal">Unit removal</h3>
<p>I wish you could easily remove units from values, for example by dividing them.</p>

<pre><code><sx-t>div</sx-t> {
  <sx-c>/* Turns into: <screen-size></screen-size> (no unit) */</sx-c>
  <sx-e>--screen-width</sx-e>: <sx-k>calc</sx-k>(<sx-n>100vw</sx-n> / <sx-n>1px</sx-n>);
  <sx-p>color</sx-p>: <sx-k>hsl</sx-k>(<sx-k>var</sx-k>(<sx-e>--screen-width</sx-e>) <sx-n>100</sx-n>, <sx-n>50</sx-n>);
}</code></pre>
<p>This would allow you to use the size of the viewport or container as a numeric variable for things other than length. For example, the <a href="#color-picker">color picker</a> from earlier uses it to convert the location of the color picker dot to a number to be used in a color value instead.</p>
<p>Uh, but wait? Does that mean this feature already exists?</p>
<p>Yeah, lol! We already have the ability to get unitless values in CSS, but it involves doing hacky stuff such as <code>tan(atan2(var(--vw), 1px))</code> with a custom <em>@property</em>. It’d be nice to have this as just a division, for example.</p>
<p>Oh, and good news, this one we might actually be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#calc-type-checking">getting soon</a>!</p>
<p><em>Also if you do something like <code>calc(1px + sqrt(1px * 1px))</code> your browser will crash<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</em></p>
<h3 id="a-better-image-function">A better image function</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image"><strong>image()</strong> function</a> exists, but no browsers implement it. It’s similar to just using <em>url()</em>, but adds some really cool features such as a fallback color, and image fragments to crop a smaller section out of a bigger image (think spritesheets).</p>
<p>We can already do both fallbacks and spritesheets with the various background properties, but it’d be nice to have this pretty syntax. I’d honestly love this syntax even more for &lt;img&gt; tags than CSS.</p>
<h3 id="style-tags-in-body">style tags in body</h3>
<p>I make heavy use of &lt;style&gt; tags in &lt;body&gt; for my projects. On my blog, for example, I write the relevant CSS close to their graphics so that you can <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@rebane2001/114931064484832451">start reading the blog</a> before the entire page (or the entire CSS) has finished loading<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. And it works great!</p>
<p>But what’s unfortunate is that despite browsers supporting this, and major sites using this, it’s <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1605">not officially spec-compliant</a>. I suspect it’s in the spec to avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">FOUC</a> footgun, but there are so many reasons you would want/need style in body that I don’t think it justifies it.</p>
<p>I think an HTML validator should warn for this, but not error.</p>
<h2 id="the-art">The art</h2>
<p>I want to end this article by saying that to me, web development is an art, and thus, CSS is too. I often have a hard time relating to people who do webdev solely to earn money or build a startup - web development is very different when you’re on a team and are given tasks from above instead of having free will over what you create for fun.</p>
<p>It’s probably most apparent with things like AI<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, that for me take all the fun and creativity out of my work. But it also applies to build chain tooling such as linters and minifiers - the way I write my code is part of the art, and I don’t want a tool to erase that. I don’t even use an IDE<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Among the practical reasons for sticking to CSS listed throughout this post, there’s a secret extra reason I like to do everything in CSS, and that’s expression and art. Art isn’t always practical, and using CSS isn’t either. But it’s how I like to express myself, and it’s why I do what I do.</p>
<p>I tried to keep this post approachable and practical for all web developers. But there is so much more to CSS that I’d like to talk about, so expect another post about the stuff that isn’t practical, and is instead just cool as fuck. I think <em>CSS is a programming language</em>, and <a href="https://lyra.horse/css-clicker/">I made a game to prove it</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s a topic for another time.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">afterword</h2>
<p>it’s been almost a year since my last post, but i hope it’s been worth the wait ^_^</p>
<p>as usual, this post is a self-contained html file with no javascript, images, or other external resources - everything on the page is handwritten html/css, weighing in at around 49kB gzipped. it was really fun creating all the little interactive widgets and visuals this time around, i think i’ve improved in css a lot since the last time i posted.</p>
<p>this entire post turned out to be a bit of a fun mess (as did i!), it’s almost like a chaotic gradient of tone throughout, i hope it was still interesting and enjoyable to read though.</p>
<p>i have a few new posts in the works: in addition to the second css one mentioned earlier, i also have one about a new web vulnerability subclass i discovered, and one about a trans topic. i’m not sure when these posts will come out, but we’ll see! make sure to add me to your rss reader if that sounds fun.</p>
<p>i’ll also be giving <a href="https://pretalx.com/bsides-tallinn-2025/talk/S3V8UY/">a talk</a> at bsides tallinn in september! i’m hoping to also do css-related talks at the next ccc and disobey, but we’ll have to see whether i get accepted and have the travel budget for those.</p>
<p>thank you so much for reading &lt;3</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a relatively new member of adult society, and an absolute infant of
the business world, I didn't think much about bank choice. I figured: you
put money in, you take money out, they're all the same. I also figured a local
branch of a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking
machine, so also... who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let's relive and
rediscover the effect of these assumptions as I did.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2012">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I start my company. I am a 22 year old recent college graduate living in San
Francisco and pursuing the startup dream. I file my incorporation paperwork
and wait to receive the necessary information for one of the first
steps in the life of any new business: opening a bank account.</p>
<p>My filing is processed and I receive my EIN while visiting my parents
in a suburb of Los Angeles. I have time to kill during one of the days so
I drive down to the nearest Chase bank branch and open a business banking
account. We'll call the person who helped me at the local branch Alex (this
will be important later). I fund that account with a $20,000 personal loan which
was almost all of my savings. I get an account number, an online login, and
<em>boom, we're in business!</em></p>
<p>About 6 months later, I raise a ~$1M seed round. I supply my Chase business
banking account information for the wire, and at close the funding is wired to
the account. I am sitting in a cafe in downtown San Francisco and I receive a
call from an unknown number -- it's Alex, the banker that
helped me open my account. He is being very casual, sort of like
"Hey, just wanted to check on things." "I noticed a big deposit and wanted
to make sure you had everything you needed." etc. For my side, I am
mostly confused: why is this person calling me? I mostly say things like
"yes yes I'm fine" and end the call quickly. Some wheels have started
turning in Southern California, and I just hadn't known it yet.</p>
<div><p>Someone out there is probably mentally screaming at me "you fool!"
at this point. With hindsight, I agree, but I will remind you
dear reader that I have only been legally allowed to purchase alcohol
for just over a year at this point in my life in the story.</p></div>
<hr>
<ol start="2014">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The two years since 2012 -- from a banking perspective -- are quiet. Alex
doesn't call me again, and we have no changes in our banking setup. For two years,
the company was in heads-down building mode. We had shown significant product
traction and were now ready to ramp up hiring to continue building.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, we raise a $10.2M series A. I once again provide the
same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds are
wired. Surprise surprise, Alex calls me! I'm starting to realize banks get
an alert when there are major changes in account balances. Regardless,
I once again brush Alex off -- "everything is good thanks! bye!" -- and
continue on with my life.</p>
<p>At this point, I am bewildered that this guy I met at the random local branch
to sign some papers is the one calling me, but didn't think much more of
it at the time.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2016">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, the two years since 2014 are mostly quiet from a banking
perspective. Alex called more regularly to "check in" but otherwise
nothing has changed. We still bank with Chase. I still have never gone
back into a branch. I do everything online.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2016, we raise a $24M series B. I once again provide the
same Chase business banking account and when the round closes, the funds
are wired. Again, Alex calls. Again, I brush him off. The bank is where I
plant money, I don't need anyone calling me. I just want to focus on building
the company.</p>
<p>Throughout 2016, we had been building out an executive team for the company.
And around the same time of the funding, we hire a Vice President of Finance. As he gets
up to speed with our financial footing, he notices we have ~$35M sitting in
cash in a Chase bank account. This is <em>obviously</em> not a smart thing to do,
so he suggests some financial plans for how to better safeguard and utilize
this mountain of cash.</p>
<p>As part of these plans, he suggests moving to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
They're local to the Bay Area, he's worked with them before, and their
bankers understand startups. It'll make accounts receivables, payables,
payroll, etc. easier. To me, a bank is a bank is a bank, and if it helps
make his job easier, I support his plan.</p>
<p>I log into the Chase online portal and initiate a wire for the full account
balance to SVB. I have to pay something like a $30 fee to wire $35M
(inconsequential to the story, but amusing nonetheless). Someone calls me for
verification -- not Alex -- and the wire processes. <em>Boom, we're done with
Chase.</em> Or so I think.</p>
<p>Alex calls me the next day. The day we initiated the wire was his day off.
He sounds slightly agitated. I wasn't rude to him, but I was short with him.
I switched banks, that's all there is to it. Thanks and goodbye. I never
talk to Alex ever again. A bank is a bank is a bank, you put money in,
you get money out, I don't understand why I would need to <em>talk to someone</em>.</p>
<div><p>I once again interrupt this story to appeal to the readers who are
screaming at me and thank you for joining me on this story recounting
my learning journey. Rest assured, at this point in the story, a professional
was now in charge of the company's finances. But the decisions of the
years leading up to this would have lingering effects for a few more years...</p></div>
<hr>
<ol start="2017">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>We now take a brief detour from the company, because this is where my
personal life becomes relevant to the story.</p>
<p>For the prior three years, I had been living in Los Angeles. At some
point during 2017, I had to go to a local Chase branch to make some
changes to my personal accounts. It has been close to a year since the company
stopped using Chase.</p>
<p>I visit the closest bank branch to my apartment. This bank branch is 20
miles north of where my parents live -- or the area with the branch where I
opened the original company business bank accounts. I'm going to Chase for
purely personal reasons, but this information is unfortunately relevant
to the story.</p>
<p>At my local branch, I walk up to the teller and provide some handwritten
information: my name, account number, desired transaction, etc. The teller looks at the paper,
then looks at me, then looks back at the paper, then asks "Are you the
HashiCorp guy?" <em>What?</em> HashiCorp is doing well but its not <em>at all</em>
something a random non-technical consumer would know about. What is going on?</p>
<p>I say yes and he acknowledges but doesn't automatically offer any more
information. I have to know, so I continue "How do you know that?" His
response is "Dude, everyone at Chase down here knows about HashiCorp." <em>Huh?</em></p>
<div><p>Up to this point, everything in the story is what I know and experienced
first hand. What follows however is now second hand information as told
by this teller. I haven't verified it, but other employees (at other branches)
have said similar things to me over the years.</p></div>
<p>The teller proceeds to explain that Alex -- the guy I opened my original
company account with -- became a fast rising star in the area. He had
opened a business account in a small suburb that grew from $20,000 to
$35,000,000 in balances in just four years! Despite the business (my business)
not engaging in higher-revenue activities with the bank, the opportunity
this account represented to the small business wing of the small suburban
branch stirred up some excitement. It was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>And then, overnight, the account went to $0. Without talking to anyone,
without any prior warning, that account was <em>gone</em>. I used online banking
to transfer the entirety of the balance to another bank. The small suburban
branch viewed this as a <em>huge loss</em> and Alex came into work with some tough
questions and no answers. I instantly recalled feeling that Alex was agitated
when he called me the day after the transfer, and I now had an idea of why.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened to Alex, the teller said he was "no longer
working in the area" and said it with a noticably negative tone. I don't
know what this means and I never found out. Perhaps, he just moved.</p>
<p>Following this event, Chase began an educational series to other local
branches in the Los Angeles area explaining that there are these "startups"
and how their financial patterns do not match those of a typical business. This series
taught branches how to identify startups and how to consider their accounts.
The case study they used for this presentation: HashiCorp.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2018">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It has been two years since hiring our VP of Finance and our financial
department is in really healthy shape. I still have certain approval rights
but no longer directly manage the accounts of the company.</p>
<div><p>Given the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank, I feel it's important to
mention that at this point of the company, we had already begun diversifying
our balances across multiple banks. SVB will not be mentioned again for
the remainder of the story.</p></div>
<p>I'm working at my office at home in Los Angeles and I receive a phone
call from our finance department. That's weird, I rarely receive phone calls.
They tell me that during a routine internal audit, they realized there are
a few customer accounts that are still paying their bill into the old Chase
account.</p>
<p><em>I never closed that original Chase business account back in 2016.</em> Let
me explain how that happens. To close an account, I had to do it in person at
any local Chase branch. Startups are busy, the account balance in 2016 was $0,
and so I just put it off. Well, a couple years passed, it was still open,
and a few customers were actually sending payments to it.</p>
<p>Worse, upon the realization that a few customers were paying into this account,
our finance team realized that there was also fraud. For over a year, someone
had been wiring thousands of dollars out every few weeks. We were short
over $100,000 due to fraud. The finance team immediately called Chase and
reported the fraud, locked down the account, and Chase started an investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the finance team wanted me to close the account and wire the
remaining balance to our actual business bank. With the fraud actively being
handled by Chase and the finance team, I take on the task of closing the
account. I immediately head to the nearest local Chase branch (once again
a branch I've never been to before) and explain the situation.</p>
<p>After waiting for 15 minutes, a manager walks up to me. I know this can't
be good. The branch manager explains that due to the actions taken to lock
down the account for fraud, electronic transfers are unavailable. It doesn't
matter that I'm provably the person who opened the account, electronic
transfers are "impossible."</p>
<p>I say okay, and ask how I am supposed to close the account and transfer
the remaining balance. He said I can close the account and withdraw the
remaining balance only in cash. <em>Cash?</em> At this point, I literally asked:
"like, green paper money cash?" He says yes. The balance in the account is
somewhere around $1M.</p>
<p>I spent another two hours at the bank, juggling between calling our
finance department, talking to this branch manager, and calling the Chase
business phone line. We determine that instead of literal green cash, I
can get a cashier's check. But there is a major problem: the amount the
cashier's check is made out for has to be available <em>at that local branch</em>
(or, whichever branch issues it).
And, well, local branches I guess don't usually have $1M cash lying around.
Or, if they do, its not enough to cover other business activities for the day
so they're not willing to part with it.</p>
<p>The bank manager gives me the phone number of another branch manager that
"may be able to help me." He literally writes down a phone number on a
piece of paper. This is all feeling so surreal. I call this number and
its for a slightly larger branch a few miles down the road. He says
"you're the HashiCorp guy right?" And I roll my eyes. My infamy in the
area is still well known.</p>
<p>This manager is very helpful, if not a bit gruff. He explains to me that
each local branch has some sort of performance metric based on inflows and
outflows at the given branch. Therefore, funding a $1M cash withdrawal was
not attractive to them. I'm learning a lot in a really condensed period of
time at this point. I don't even know if what he's telling me is true, or
legal, all I hear is "this is going to be hard to do if you want it all at
once."</p>
<p><em>But we do want it all at once. And we want to close the account. Now.</em>
He is not happy, but he says he'll call me back in 24 to 48 hours. True
to his word, he calls me back the next day. He says that he had to coordinate
to ensure his branch had the proper funding to satisfy this transaction,
and that the funding would be available at a specific date a few days hence.
He said I have to do the withdrawal <em>that day</em> because his branch will not
hold that amount in cash for any longer.</p>
<p>He also subtly suggested I hire personal security or otherwise deposit
those funds somewhere with haste. I believe his exact words were "if you
lose that check, I can't help you." Again, this was a one time event, and
I don't know how true that all is, but it was said to me.</p>
<p>A few days later, I walk into the branch (I did not hire personal security).
I tell the teller my name and there is a flicker of immediate recognition.
The teller guides me to a cubicle, the account is successfully closed,
I'm issued a $1M cashier's check, and I walk out the door.</p>
<p>My business banking relationship with Chase is, at long last, complete.</p>
<div><p>I want to make it clear that Chase could've been an excellent
banking partner. I never gave them the chance. I never told them what
my business does or what I'd use the money for. I never talked to anyone
(besides saying what I needed to get off the phone). This story isn't
a cautionary tale about Chase, it is rather recounting my naivete
as a young, first-time startup founder.</p></div>
<hr>
<p>Epilogue.</p>
<p>The cashier's check was uneventfully deposited into our primary business
banking account shortly after I walked out of the Chase branch.</p>
<p>The fraud investigation took a few months to complete but we were
able to recover all of the lost funds.</p>
<p>Enough time has passed and employees cycled that I'm no longer recognized at
any Los Angeles area Chase branches.</p>
<p>I look back on these events and there are many places I cringe. At the
same time, I can't imagine making different choices because I was acting in
good faith at all times with the knowledge I had. I think the choices I made were
reasonable for any new founder, and I know many founders who have made
similar choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there was no long term negative impact of the events that
transpired (except maybe for Alex, but I truly don't know) and I can now
look back on it with amusement.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html">https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45055641">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m about to head away from looking after this site for a few weeks (part vacation, part work stuff). As I contemplate some weeks away from the daily routine, I feel an urge to share some scattered thoughts about the state of LLMs and AI.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’ve seen a few early surveys on the effect AI is having on software development, is it really speeding folks up, does it improve or wreck code quality? One of the big problems with these surveys is that they aren’t taking into account <em>how</em> people are using the LLMs. From what I can tell the vast majority of LLM usage is fancy auto-complete, often using co-pilot. But those I know who get the most value from LLMs reckon that auto-complete isn’t very useful, preferring approaches that allow the LLM to directly read and edit source code files to carry out tasks. My concern is that surveys that ignore the different work-flows of using LLMs will produce data that’s going to send people down the wrong paths.</p>

<p>(Another complication is the varying capabilities of different models.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’m often asked, “what is the future of programming?” Should people consider entering software development now? Will LLMs eliminate the need for junior engineers? Should senior engineers get out of the profession before it’s too late? My answer to all these questions is “I haven’t the foggiest”. Furthermore I think anyone who says they know what this future will be is talking from an inappropriate orifice. We are still figuring out how to use LLMs, and it will be some time before we have a decent idea of how to use them well, especially if they gain significant improvements.</p>

<p>What I suggest, is that people experiment with them. At the least, read about what others are doing, but pay attention to the details of their workflows. Preferably experiment yourself, and do share your experiences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❇&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’m also asked: “is AI a bubble”? To which my answer is “OF COURSE IT’S A BUBBLE”. All major technological advances have come with economic bubbles, from canals and railroads to the internet. We know with near 100% certainty that this bubble will pop, causing lots of investments to fizzle to nothing. However what we don’t know is <em>when</em> it will pop, and thus how big the bubble will have grown, generating some real value in the process, before that happens. It could pop next month, or not for a couple of years.</p>

<p>We also know that when the bubble pops, many firms will go bust, but not all. When the dot-com bubble burst, it killed pets.com, it killed Webvan… but it did not kill Amazon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/202106-reducing-speaking.html">retired from public speaking</a> a couple of years ago. But while I don’t miss the stress of giving talks, I do miss hanging out with my friends in the industry. So I’m looking forward to catching up with many of them at <a href="https://gotocph.com/2025">GOTO Copenhagen</a>. I’ve been involved with the GOTO conference series since the 1990s (when it was called JAOO), and continue to be impressed with how they put together a fascinating program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>My former colleague Rebecca Parsons, has been saying for a long time that hallucinations aren’t a bug of LLMs, they are a feature. Indeed they are <em>the</em> feature. All an LLM does is produce hallucinations, it’s just that we find some of them useful.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of this is that we should always consider asking the LLM the same question more than once, perhaps with some variation in the wording. Then we can compare answers, indeed perhaps ask the LLM to compare answers for us. The difference in the answers can be as useful as the answers themselves.</p>

<p>Certainly if we ever ask a hallucination engine for a numeric answer, we should ask it at least three times, so we get some sense of the variation. Furthermore we shouldn’t ask an LLM to calculate an answer than we can calculate deterministically (yes, I’ve seen this). It is OK to ask an LLM to generate code to calculate an answer (but still do it more than once).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>Other forms of engineering have to take into account the variability of the world. A structural engineer builds in tolerance for all the factors she can’t measure. (I remember being told early in my career that the unique characteristic of digital electronics was that there was no concept of tolerances.) Process engineers consider that humans are executing tasks, and will sometimes be forgetful or careless. Software Engineering is unusual in that it works with deterministic machines. Maybe LLMs mark the point where we join our engineering peers in a world on non-determinism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>I’ve often heard, with decent reason, an LLM compared to a junior colleague. But I find LLMs are quite happy to say “all tests green”, yet when I run them, there are failures. If that was a junior engineer’s behavior, how long would it be before H.R. was involved?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p>

<p>LLMs create a huge increase in the attack surface of software systems. Simon Willison described the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">The Lethal Trifecta</a> for AI agents: an agent that combines access to your private data, exposure to untrusted content, and a way to externally communicate (“exfiltration”). That “untrusted content” can come in all sorts of ways, ask it to read a web page, and an attacker can easily put instructions on the website in 1pt white-on-white font to trick the gullible LLM to obtain that private data.</p>

<p>This is particularly serious when it comes to agents acting in a browser. Read an attacker’s web page, and it could trick the agent to go to your bank account in another tab and “buy you a present” by transferring your balance to the kind attacker. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/">Willison’s view</a> is that “the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely”.</p>

<section id="TheWaveOfCliCodingAgents">
<h2>The wave of CLI Coding Agents</h2>

<p>If you have tried Claude Code, Gemini Code, Open Code or Simon
      Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">LLM CLI</a>, you’ve experienced something fundamentally
      different from ChatGPT or Github Copilot. These aren’t just chatbots or
      autocomplete tools - they’re agents that can read your code, run your
      tests, search docs and make changes to your codebase async.</p>

<p>But how do they work? For me the best way to understand how any tool
      works is to try and build it myself. So that’s exactly what we did, and in
      this article I’ll take you through how we built our own CLI Coding Agent
      using the Pydantic-AI framework and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
      You’ll see not just how to assemble the pieces but why each capability
      matters and how it changes the way you can work with code.</p>

<p>Our implementation leverages AWS Bedrock but with Pydantic-AI you could
      easily use any other mainstream provider or even a fully local LLM.</p>
</section>

<section id="WhyBuildWhenYouCanBuy">
<h2>Why Build When You Can Buy?</h2>

<p>Before diving into the technical implementation, let's examine why we
      chose to build our own solution.</p>

<p>The answer became clear very quickly using our custom agent, while
      commercial tools are impressive, they’re built for general use cases. Our
      agent was fully customised to our internal context and all the little
      eccentricities of our specific project. More importantly, building it gave
      us insights into how these systems work and the quality of our own GenAI
      Platform and Dev Tooling.</p>

<p>Think of it like learning to cook. You can eat at restaurants forever
      but understanding how flavours combine and techniques work makes you
      appreciate food differently - and lets you create exactly what you
      want.</p>
</section>

<section id="TheArchitectureOfOurDevelopmentAgent">
<h2>The Architecture of Our Development Agent</h2>

<p>At a high level, our coding assistant consists of several key
      components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Core AI Model: Claude from Anthropic accessed through AWS Bedrock </li>

<li>Pydantic-AI Framework: provides the agent framework and many helpful
        utilities to make our Agent more useful immediately </li>

<li>MCP Servers: independent processes that give the agent specialised
        tools, MCP is a common standard for defining the servers that contain these
        tools. </li>

<li>CLI Interface: how users interact with the assistant</li>
</ul>

<p>The magic happens through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which
      allows the AI model to use various tools through a standardized interface.
      This architecture makes our assistant highly extensible - we can easily
      add new capabilities by implementing additional MCP servers, but we’re
      getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
</section>

<section id="StartingSimpleTheFoundation">
<h2>Starting Simple: The Foundation</h2>

<p>We started by creating a basic project structure and installing the
      necessary dependencies:</p>

<pre>uv init
uv add pydantic_ai
uv add boto3
</pre>

<p>Our primary dependencies include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pydantic-ai</code>: Framework for building AI agents</li>

<li><code>boto3</code>: For AWS API interactions</li>
</ul>

<p>We chose Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic (accessed via AWS Bedrock) as
      our foundation model due to its strong code understanding and generation
      capabilities. Here's how we configured it in our <code>main.py</code>:</p>

<pre>import boto3
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider
</pre>

<pre>bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig(
    read_timeout=300,
    connect_timeout=60,
    retries={"max_attempts": 3},
)
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config
)
model = BedrockConverseModel(
    "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
    provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client),
)
agent = Agent(
    model=model,
)
</pre>

<pre>if __name__ == "__main__":
  agent.to_cli_sync()
</pre>

<p>At this stage we already have a fully working CLI with a chat interface
      which we can use as you would a GUI chat interface, which is pretty cool
      for how little code this is! However we can definitely improve upon
      this.</p>
</section>

<section id="FirstCapabilityTesting">
<h2>First Capability: Testing!</h2>

<p>Instead of running the tests ourselves after each coding iteration why
      not get the agent to do it? Seems simple right?</p>

<pre>import subprocess
</pre>

<pre>@agent.tool_plain()
def run_unit_tests() -&gt; str:
    """Run unit tests using uv."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["uv", "run", "pytest", "-xvs", "tests/"], capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    return result.stdout
</pre>

<p>Here we use the same pytest command you would run in the terminal (I’ve
      shortened ours for the article). Now something magical happened. I could
      say “X isn’t working” and the agent would:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Run the test suite</li>

<li>2. Identify which specific tests were failing</li>

<li>3. Analyze the error messages</li>

<li>4. Suggest targeted fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Instead of staring at test failures or copy
      pasting terminal outputs into ChatGPT we now give our agent super relevant
      context about any issues in our codebase.</p>

<p>However we noticed our agent sometimes “fixed” failing tests by
      suggesting changes to the tests, not the actual implementation. This led
      to our next addition.</p>
</section>

<section id="AddingIntelligenceInstructionsAndIntent">
<h2>Adding Intelligence: Instructions and intent</h2>

<p>We realised we needed to teach our agent a little more about our
      development philosophy and steer it away from bad behaviours.</p>

<pre>instructions = """
You are a specialised agent for maintaining and developing the XXXXXX codebase.

## Development Guidelines:

1. **Test Failures:**
   - When tests fail, fix the implementation first, not the tests
   - Tests represent expected behavior; implementation should conform to tests
   - Only modify tests if they clearly don't match specifications

2. **Code Changes:**
   - Make the smallest possible changes to fix issues
   - Focus on fixing the specific problem rather than rewriting large portions
   - Add unit tests for all new functionality before implementing it

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Keep functions small with a single responsibility
   - Implement proper error handling with appropriate exceptions
   - Be mindful of configuration dependencies in tests

Remember to examine test failure messages carefully to understand the root cause before making any changes.
"""
</pre>

<pre>agent = Agent(
instructions=instructions,
model=model,
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> The agent now understands our values around
      Test Driven Development and minimal changes. It stopped suggesting large
      refactors where a small fix would do (Mostly).</p>

<p>Now while we could continue building everything from absolute scratch
      and tweaking our prompts for days we want to go fast and use some tools
      other people have built - Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP).</p>
</section>

<section id="TheMcpRevolutionPluggableCapabilities">
<h2>The MCP Revolution: Pluggable Capabilities</h2>

<p>This is where our agent transformed from a helpful assistant to
      something approaching the commercial CLI agents. The Model Context
      Protocol (MCP) allows us to add sophisticated capabilities by running
      specialized servers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide
        context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.
        Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to
        various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to
        connect AI models to different data sources and tools. </p>

<p>-- <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">MCP Introduction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can run these servers as a local process, so no data sharing, where
      we interact with STDIN/STDOUT to keep things simple and local. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/function-call-LLM.html">(More details on tools and MCP)</a></p>
</section>

<section id="SandboxedPythonExecution">
<h2>Sandboxed Python Execution</h2>

<p>Using large language models to do calculations or executing arbitrary code they create is not effective and potentially very dangerous! To make our Agent more accurate and safe our first MCP addition was Pydantic Al’s default server for sandboxed Python code execution:</p>

<pre>run_python = MCPServerStdio(
    "deno",
    args=[
        "run",
        "-N",
        "-R=node_modules",
        "-W=node_modules",
        "--node-modules-dir=auto",
        "jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python",
        "stdio",
    ],
)
</pre>

<pre>agent = Agent(
    ...
    mcp_servers=[
        run_python
    ],
)
</pre>

<p>This gave our agent a sandbox where it could test ideas, prototype
      solutions, and verify its own suggestions.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is very different from running the tests where we need the
      local environment and is intended to be used to make calculations much
      more robust. This is because writing the code to output a number and then
      executing that code is much more reliable and understandable, scalable and
      repeatable than just generating the next token in a calculation. We have
      seen from frontier labs (including their leaked instructions) that this is
      a much better approach.</p>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Doing calculations, even more complex ones,
      became significantly more reliable. This is useful for many things like
      dates, sums, counts etc. It also allows for a rapid iteration cycle of
      simple python code.</p>
</section>

<section id="Up-to-dateLibraryDocumentation">
<h2>Up-to-Date library Documentation</h2>

<p>LLMs are mostly trained in batch on historical data this gives a fixed
      cutoff while languages and dependencies continue to change and improve so
      we added <a href="https://context7.com/">Context7</a> for access to up to date python
      library documentation in LLM consumable format:</p>

<pre>context7 = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx", args=["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"], tool_prefix="context"
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> When working with newer libraries or trying to
      use advanced features, the agent could look up current documentation
      rather than relying on potentially outdated training data. This made it
      much more reliable for real-world development work.</p>
</section>

<section id="AwsMcps">
<h2>AWS MCPs</h2>

<p>Since this particular agent was built with an AWS platform in mind, we
      added the AWS Labs MCP servers for comprehensive cloud docs and
      integration:</p>

<pre>awslabs = MCPServerStdio(
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"},
    tool_prefix="awslabs",
)
aws_docs = MCPServerStdio(
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION": "aws"},
    tool_prefix="aws_docs",
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Now when I mentioned “Bedrock is timing out”
      or “the model responses are getting truncated,” the agent could directly
      access AWS documentation to help troubleshoot configuration issues. While
      we've only scratched the surface with these two servers, this is the tip
      of the iceberg—the <a href="https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/">AWS Labs MCP
      collection</a> includes servers for
      CloudWatch metrics, Lambda debugging, IAM policy analysis, and much more.
      Even with just documentation access, cloud debugging became more
      conversational and contextual.</p>
</section>

<section id="InternetSearchForCurrentInformation">
<h2>Internet Search for Current Information</h2>

<p>Sometimes you need information that's not in any documentation—recent
      Stack Overflow discussions, GitHub issues, or the latest best practices.
      We added general internet search:</p>

<pre>internet_search = MCPServerStdio(command="uvx", args=["duckduckgo-mcp-server"])
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> When encountering obscure errors or needing to
      understand recent changes in the ecosystem, the agent could search for
      current discussions and solutions. This was particularly valuable for
      debugging deployment issues or understanding breaking changes in
      dependencies.</p>
</section>

<section id="StructuredProblemSolving">
<h2>Structured Problem Solving</h2>

<p>One of the most valuable additions was the code reasoning MCP, which
      helps the agent think through complex problems systematically:</p>

<pre>code_reasoning = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@mettamatt/code-reasoning"],
    tool_prefix="code_reasoning",
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> Instead of jumping to solutions, the agent
      would break down complex problems into logical steps, explore alternative
      approaches, and explain its reasoning. This was invaluable for
      architectural decisions and debugging complex issues. I could ask “Why is
      this API call failing intermittently?” and get a structured analysis of
      potential causes rather than just guesses.</p>
</section>

<section id="OptimisingForReasoning">
<h2>Optimising for Reasoning</h2>

<p>As we added more sophisticated capabilities, we noticed that reasoning
      and analysis tasks often took much longer than regular text
      generation—especially when the output wasn't correctly formatted on the
      first try. We adjusted our Bedrock configuration to be more patient:</p>

<pre>bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig(
    read_timeout=300,
    connect_timeout=60,
    retries={"max_attempts": 3},
)
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config
)
</pre>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> The longer timeouts meant our agent could work
      through complex problems without timing out. When analyzing large
      codebases or reasoning through intricate architectural decisions, the
      agent could take the time needed to provide thorough, well-reasoned
      responses rather than rushing to incomplete solutions.</p>
</section>

<section id="DesktopCommanderWarningWithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility">
<h2>Desktop Commander: Warning! With great power comes great responsibility!</h2>

<p>At this point, our agent was already quite capable—it could reason
      through problems, execute code, search for information, and access AWS
      documentation. This MCP server transforms your agent from a helpful
      assistant into something that can actually <i>do</i> things in your development
      environment:</p>

<pre>desktop_commander = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"],
    tool_prefix="desktop_commander",
)
</pre>

<p>Desktop Commander provides an incredibly comprehensive toolkit: file
      system operations (read, write, search), terminal command execution with
      process management, surgical code editing with <code>edit_block</code>, and even
      interactive REPL sessions. It's built on top of the MCP Filesystem Server
      but adds crucial capabilities like search-and-replace editing and
      intelligent process control.</p>

<p><b>The workflow change:</b> This is where everything came together. I
      could now say “The authentication tests are failing, please fix the issue”
      and the agent would:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Run the test suite to see the specific failures</li>

<li>2. Read the failing test files to understand what was expected</li>

<li>3. Examine the authentication module code</li>

<li>4. Search the codebase for related patterns</li>

<li>5. Look up the documentation for the relevant library</li>

<li>6. Make edits to fix the implementation</li>

<li>7. Re-run the tests to verify the fix</li>

<li>8. Search for similar patterns elsewhere that might need updating</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this happened in a single conversation thread, with the agent
      maintaining context throughout. It wasn't just generating code
      suggestions—it was actively debugging, editing, and verifying fixes like a
      pair programming partner.</p>

<p>The security model is thoughtful too, with configurable allowed
      directories, blocked commands, and proper permission boundaries. You can
      learn more about its extensive capabilities at the <a href="https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP">Desktop Commander
      documentation</a>.</p>

<p>How it changes our workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debugging becomes collaborative: you have an intelligent partner
        that can analyze error messages, suggest hypotheses, and help test
        solutions.</li>

<li>Learning accelerates: when working with unfamiliar libraries or
        patterns, the agent can explain existing code, suggest improvements, and
        teach you why certain approaches work better.</li>

<li>Context switching reduces: rather than jumping between
        documentation, Stack Overflow, AWS Console, and your IDE, you have a
        single interface that can access all these resources while maintaining
        context about your specific problem.</li>

<li>Problem-solving becomes structured: rather than jumping to
        solutions, the agent can break down complex issues into logical steps,
        explore alternatives, and explain its reasoning. Like having a real life talking rubber duck!</li>

<li>Code review improves: the agent can review your changes, spot
        potential issues, and suggest improvements before you commit—like having a
        senior developer looking over your shoulder.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="WhatWeLearnedAboutCliAgents">
<h2>What We Learned About CLI Agents</h2>

<p>Building our own agent revealed several insights about this emerging
      paradigm:</p>

<ul>
<li>MCP is (almost) all you need: the magic isn't in any single
        capability, but in how they work together. The agent that can run tests,
        read files, search documentation, execute code, access AWS services, and
        reason through problems systematically becomes qualitatively different
        from one that can only do any single task.</li>

<li>Current information is crucial: having access to real-time search
        and up-to-date documentation makes the agent much more reliable for
        real-world development work where training data might be outdated.</li>

<li>Structured thinking matters: the code reasoning capability
        transforms the agent from a clever autocomplete into a thinking partner
        that can break down complex problems and explore alternative
        solutions.</li>

<li>Context is king: commercial agents like Claude Code are impressive
        partly because they maintain context across all these different tools.
        Your agent needs to remember what it learned from the test run when it's
        making file changes.</li>

<li>Specialisation matters: our agent works better for our specific
        codebase than general-purpose tools because it understands our patterns,

        can go and make the required changes.</li>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>The CLI agent paradigm is still evolving rapidly. Some areas we're
      exploring:</p>

<ul>
<li>AWS-specific tooling: the AWS Labs MCP servers
        (https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/) provide incredible depth for cloud-native
        development—from CloudWatch metrics to Lambda debugging to IAM policy
        analysis.</li>

<li>Workflow Enhancements: teaching the agent our common development
        workflows so it can handle routine tasks end-to-end. Connecting the agent
        to our project management tools so it can understand priorities and
        coordinate with team processes.</li>

<li>Benchmarking: <a href="https://www.tbench.ai/">Terminal Bench</a>
        looks like a great dataset and leaderboard to test this toy agent against
        the big boys!</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="WhyThisMatters">
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>CLI coding agents represent a fundamental
      shift from AI as a writing assistant to AI as a development partner.
      Unlike Copilot's autocomplete or ChatGPT's Q&amp;A, these agents can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand your entire project context</li>

<li>Execute tasks across multiple tools</li>

<li>Maintain state across complex workflows</li>

<li>Learn from your specific codebase and patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>Building one yourself—even a simple version—gives you insights into
      where this technology is heading and how to make the most of commercial
      tools when they arrive.</p>

<p>The future of software development isn't just about writing code
      faster. It's about having an intelligent partner that understands your
      goals, your constraints, and your codebase well enough to help you think
      through problems and implement solutions collaboratively.</p>

<p>And the best way to understand that future? Build it yourself.</p>

              <p>You know what’s wrong with people?
                They’re too sure of themselves.</p>
              <p>Better to be wrong and own it than be right with caveats.
                Hard to build a personal brand out of nuance these days.
                People are attracted to confidence — however misplaced.</p>
              <p>But can you blame them? (People, that is)
                Working in software,
                the most annoying part of reaching Senior level
                is having to say <em>“it depends”</em> all the time.
                Much more fun getting to say
                <em>“let’s ship it and iterate”</em> as Staff or
                <em>“that won’t scale”</em> as a Principal.</p>
              <p>Yet, for all of our intellectual humility,
                why do we <del>write</del> vibe code like this?</p>
              <pre data-lang="Swift"><code><span>if</span> <span>current<wbr>Location</span><span>.</span><span>distance</span><span>(</span><span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>target</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"You've arrived!"</span><span>)</span> <span>// But have you, really? 🤨</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
              <p>GPS coordinates aren’t exact.
                They’re noisy. They’re approximate. They’re probabilistic.
                That <code>horizontal<wbr>Accuracy</code> property tucked away in your <code>CLLocation</code> object
              is trying to tell you something important:
              you’re <em>probably</em> within that radius.
              <em>Probably.</em></p>
            <p>A <code>Bool</code>, meanwhile, can be only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
              That <code>if</code> statement needs to make a choice one way or another,
              but code like this doesn’t capture the uncertainty of the situation.
              If truth is light,
              then current programming models collapse the wavefunction too early.</p>
            <h2>
              Picking the Right Abstraction</h2>
            <p>In 2014, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft Research
              proposed a radical idea:
              What if uncertainty were encoded directly into the type system?
              Their paper,
              <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/uncertaint-a-first-order-type-for-uncertain-data-2/">Uncertain&lt;T&gt;: A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data</a></em>
              introduced a probabilistic programming approach that’s both
              mathematically rigorous and surprisingly practical.</p>
            
            <p>As you’d expect for something from Microsoft in the 2010s,
              the paper is implemented in C#.
              But the concepts translate beautifully to Swift.</p>
            <p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/mattt/Uncertain">my port on GitHub</a>:</p>

            <p>When you compare two <code>Uncertain</code> values,
              you don’t get a definitive <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
              You get an <code>Uncertain&lt;Bool&gt;</code> that represents the <em>probability</em> of the comparison being <code>true</code>.</p>

            <p>This code builds a computation graph,

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_probability_ratio_test">Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT)</a>
              to efficiently determine how many samples are needed —

</code></pre>
            <p>Using an abstraction like <code>Uncertain&lt;T&gt;</code> forces you to deal with uncertainty as a first-class concept
              rather than pretending it doesn’t exist.
              And in doing so, you end up with much smarter code.</p>

          <p>The statistics are computed through sampling.

          <h2>
            Putting Theory to Practice</h2>
          <p>Users don’t notice when things work correctly,
            but they definitely notice impossible behavior.
            When your running app claims they just sprinted at 45 mph,
            or your IRL meetup app shows someone 500 feet away when GPS accuracy is ±1000 meters,
            that’s a bad look 🤡</p>
          <p>So where do we go from here?
            Let’s channel our Senior+ memes from before for guidance.</p>
          <p>That Staff engineer saying <em>“let’s ship it and iterate”</em>
            is right about the incremental approach.
            You can migrate uncertain calculations piecemeal
            rather than rewriting everything at once:</p>
          <pre data-lang="Swift"><code><span>extension</span> <span>CLLocation</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>uncertain</span><span>:</span> <span>Uncertain</span><span>&lt;</span><span>CLLocation</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Uncertain</span><span>&lt;</span><span>CLLocation</span><span>&gt;.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Gradually migrate critical paths</span>
<span>let</span> <span>is<wbr>Nearby</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>current<wbr>Location</span><span>.</span><span>uncertain</span><span>.</span><span>distance</span><span>(</span><span>to</span><span>:</span> <span>destination</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>threshold</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>probability</span><span>(</span><span>exceeds</span><span>:</span> <span>0.68</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
          <p>And we should consider the Principal engineer’s warning of <em>“that won’t scale”</em>.
            Sampling has a cost, and you should understand the
            computational overhead for probabilistic accuracy:</p>
          <pre data-lang="Swift"><code><span>// Fast approximation for UI updates</span>
<span>let</span> <span>quick<wbr>Estimate</span> <span>=</span> <span>speed</span><span>.</span><span>probability</span><span>(</span>
    <span>exceeds</span><span>:</span> <span>walking<wbr>Speed</span><span>,</span>
    <span>max<wbr>Samples</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// High precision for critical decisions</span>
<span>let</span> <span>precise<wbr>Result</span> <span>=</span> <span>speed</span><span>.</span><span>probability</span><span>(</span>
    <span>exceeds</span><span>:</span> <span>walking<wbr>Speed</span><span>,</span>
    <span>confidence<wbr>Level</span><span>:</span> <span>0.99</span><span>,</span>
    <span>max<wbr>Samples</span><span>:</span> <span>10_000</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre>
          
          <p>Start small.
            Pick one feature where GPS glitches cause user complaints.
            Replace your distance calculations with uncertain versions.
            Measure the impact.</p>
          <p>Remember:
            the goal isn’t to eliminate uncertainty —
            it’s to acknowledge that it exists and handle it gracefully.
            Because in the real world,
            nothing is certain except uncertainty itself.</p>
          <p>And perhaps,
            with better tools,
            we can finally stop pretending otherwise.</p>

<div><p>Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s).</p><p>- First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship.</p><p>- Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer.</p><p>Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups.</p><p>Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator (<a href="https://github.com/OperatorFoundation" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/OperatorFoundation</a>). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case.</p><p>In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols.</p><p>- The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term.</p><p>I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055852"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055852" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055852&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Thank you very much for a detailed answer. Might I rudely ask -- as you're knowledgeable in this space, what do you think of Mullvad's DAITA, which specifically aims to defeat traffic analysis by moving to a more pulsed constant bandwidth model?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055940"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055940" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055940&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>DAITA was introduced after my time in the industry, but this isn't a new idea (though as far as I know, it's the first time this kind of thing's been commercialized).</p><p>It's clever. It tries to defeat attacks against one of the tougher parts of VPN connections to reliably obfuscate, and the effort's commendable, but I'll stop short of saying it's a good solution for one big reason: with VPNs and censorship circumvention, the data often speaks for itself.</p><p>A VPN provider working in this space will often have aggregate (and obviously anonymized, if they're working in good faith) stats about success rates and failure classes encountered from clients connecting to their nodes. Where I worked, we didn't publish this information. I'm not sure where Mullvad stands on this right now.</p><p>In any case -- some VPN providers deploying new technology like this will partner with the research community (because there's a small, but passionate formal research community in this space!) and publish papers, studies, and other digests of their findings. Keep an eye out for this sort of stuff. UMD's Breakerspace in the US in particular had some extremely clever people working on this stuff when I was involved in the industry.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45055945"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45055945" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45055945&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45054260"></a></center></td><td><br>

        <p>Classes began this week for students at the University at Buffalo, a public research university in western New York, but there were about 750 fewer international students on campus than expected.</p><p>The new students who did make it gathered for a welcome from the school's dean of students. "We know you have had to overcome hurdles to be here – especially this summer, with visas," Tomás Aguirre told the assembled students, representing more than 100 countries. "And I just wanted you to know that we are so glad you were able to make it."</p>

But it's not just Buffalo. Universities all over the country are experiencing similar drops. Arizona State University <a href="https://news.asu.edu/20250813-sun-devil-community-asu-welcomes-14600-international-students-fall" target="_blank">reported a fall semester decline</a> for the <a href="https://www.kjzz.org/education/2025-08-17/international-student-enrollment-at-asu-drops-following-recent-federal-visa-guidance-changes" target="_blank">first time since 2020</a>.

The <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/08/26/massachusetts-international-students-customs-trump-administration" target="_blank">state of Massachusetts</a> is expecting about 10,000 fewer new international students this year.</p><p>"One would describe the situation with international students to be very much in flux with tremendous levels of uncertainty," says Fanta Aw, who leads the Association of International Educators, or NAFSA.</p><p>Last year more than a million international students studied in the U.S., contributing about $43 billion into the U.S. economy. But Aw's organization <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/about/about-nafsa/us-economy-could-suffer-7-billion-loss-precipitous-drop-international-students" target="_blank">predicts a drop of about 150,000</a> new international students this fall, leading to a decline of about 15% overall. If that happens, local economies could lose as much as $7 billion in spending and more than 60,000 jobs.</p>

The State Department has revoked <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93vznxd07o" target="_blank">about 6,000 student visas</a> so far this year, citing threats of academic espionage, support for terrorist groups in Gaza and criminal behavior.</p><p>And in May, the State Department said it would <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china" target="_blank">"aggressively revoke"</a> visas for Chinese students and add additional scrutiny for future visa applications from China.</p><p>But in recent days Trump has signaled a shift. This week, Trump told reporters he planned to double the amount of Chinese students studying in the U.S. He defended those comments a day later, saying "I like that their [China] students come here. I like that other countries students' come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly."</p>

But leaders at the University at Buffalo said at least at their institution, that's not something U.S. families need to worry about.</p><p>"We recruit all qualified students to the University at Buffalo and are eager for all of them to attend," explains Scott Webber, the provost there. "I would assure you that our international students do not take spots, you know for other students who are qualified to attend and would be successful here."

        <p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> International students are arriving on American college campuses.</p><p>DARIA TOFAN: Hi. I'm Daria (ph). I'm a first-year international student, and I'm from Romania.</p><p>PRIYOTA NADH: Priyota Nadh (ph), and I'm from Bangladesh.</p><p>FRANCOIS HUMPHRIES: My name's Francois Humphries (ph). I'm from South Africa.</p><p>SHIVIKA SINGH: My name is Shivika (ph), and I'm from India.</p><p>FADEL: Those students made it to school in Buffalo, New York, after a rocky summer, when the Trump administration temporarily paused and then revamped student visa interviews. NPR's Elissa Nadworny reports from Buffalo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome. We're so excited that you're here on campus.</p><p>ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: At orientation at the University at Buffalo, a public research university in western New York, newly arrived international students are getting their campus IDs...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So just smile. I'm going to take it on three. One, two, three.</p><p>NADWORNY: ...And feeling relieved they made it to campus.</p><p>TOFAN: At least we're here. For me, the main thing is that I got here.</p><p>NADWORNY: Daria Tofan (ph) from Romania didn't get her student visa until a week before orientation.</p><p>TOFAN: To get scheduled for classes, you need to provide the immigration documents. So if you don't have the visa stamp, you're basically behind everything.</p><p>NADWORNY: Over the last six months, the Trump administration has clamped down on international student visas. That's created lots of delays and anxiety for accepted students.</p><p>SINGH: I only had one goal from the beginning. It was to go to college here. So if I didn't reach that goal, it would've been very painful.</p><p>NADWORNY: Shivika Singh (ph) is from New Delhi, starting as a freshman at UB to study psychology. When she first got accepted to Buffalo, she joined a group chat of other students from India. Many of them couldn't get a visa appointment in time.</p><p>SINGH: Most of them are now transferring to U.K. because of the visa situation, but some are still waiting for the spring semester.</p><p>SCOTT WEBER: Clearly, this year we're having more deferrals. They haven't been able to get appointments for the most part.</p><p>NADWORNY: Scott Weber is the provost at the University at Buffalo. The university is expecting a decline of about 750 international students this fall, many in graduate programs, especially in the STEM fields.</p><p>FANTA AW: The loss of international students will lead to really a significant downturn in innovation.</p><p>NADWORNY: Fanta Aw leads the Association of International Educators. She says universities all over the country are expecting similar drops. Last year, more than a million international students studied in the U.S. But Aw's organization estimates a decline of about 15% overall this fall.</p><p>AW: This will affect communities large and small.</p><p>NADWORNY: Other countries like Canada, the U.K. and South Korea have stepped up to fill the gap. President Trump has said he wants to keep campuses safe, citing threats of academic espionage, support for terrorist groups in Gaza and criminal behavior - all without much evidence. He's also accused international students of taking university spots that could go to American citizens. Provost Scott Weber says there's room for everyone at his university.</p><p>WEBER: I would assure you that our international students do not take spots, you know, for other students who are qualified to attend and would be successful here.</p><p>NADWORNY: Enrollment is actually up at the university overall, and there are still about 4,000 international students on campus this year.</p><p>WEBER: What they bring to the university is this incredibly rich, diverse cultural experience for students who may not have ever been outside of New York state.</p><p>NADWORNY: For the lucky ones, like Shivika Singh from New Delhi, now it's time to focus on being a college student.</p><p>What's the most exciting thing you bought for your dorm?</p><p>SINGH: I bought a pink "Lilo &amp; Stitch" soft toy (laughter).</p><p>NADWORNY: A toy?</p><p>SINGH: (Laughter) Yeah.</p><p>NADWORNY: To sleep with?</p><p>SINGH: Yeah. There are, like, three soft toys on my bed.</p><p>NADWORNY: She says those stuffed animals are the key to warding off home sickness that comes from being 7,000 miles from home.</p><p>Elissa Nadworny, NPR News, Buffalo, New York.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)</p></div></div>]]></description>
