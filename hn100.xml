                  <p>I'm not an expert on China, but during ongoing work on global supply chain disruptions with my co-authors Rebecca Freeman and Angelos Theodorakopoulos, I've noticed a stark fact that I don’t think is as widely known as it should be. China is the now world’s sole manufacturing superpower.</p>

<p>This column uses the OECD’s recently released <a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/measuring-trade-in-value-added.htm">2023 update</a> of their invaluable TiVA database to show, in eight charts, how this came to be. I will skip the historical Chinese reform narrative as that has been well covered by real China experts (e.g. Wang 2023, World Bank 2013, Ranganathan 2023).</p>

<h2>The world’s big players in manufacturing</h2>

<p>The charts in Figure 1 show two views of global manufacturing shares in 2020 (the latest year in the database). The left panel displays world shares in terms of gross production; in the right panel, the same is shown in terms of value added. The distinction is in intermediate inputs: Chinese gross production equals the total sales of Chinese manufacturers; Chinese value added is their gross production minus the purchased intermediates.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> Slicing the global manufacturing pie, 2020, gross production basis</p>

  


<h6><em>Source</em>: OECD TiVA database, 2023 update.</h6>

<p>Six nations manufacture at least 3% of the world total. China is followed by the US, Japan, Germany, India, and South Korea. Note how the world has changed. Only three of these are long-established industrial economies; the other three are newly industrialised economies. Four of the G7 don’t make the cut. The chart separately identifies nations with shares of at least 2%, and on the left, this includes Italy, France, and Taiwan (two of the G7, the UK and Canada, don’t make the cut). In the right panel (value-added basis), the UK makes an appearance with a share just above 2%.</p>

<p>When it comes to gross production, China’s share is three times the US’ share, six times Japan’s, and nine times Germany’s. Taiwan, Mexico, Russia, and Brazil now have higher gross output than the UK. Canada is further down the ranking, in 15th place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Unprecedented industrialisation</h2>

<p>China’s industrialisation is unprecedented. The last time the ‘king of the manufacturing hill’ got knocked off the throne was when the US surpassed the UK just before WW1. It took the US the better part of a century to rise to the top; the China-US switch took about 15 or 20 years. China’s industrialisation, in short, defies comparison.</p>

<p>Figure 2 portrays how China dethroned the king of the hill. If we think of this as a 25-lap horserace – one lap per year – all the excitement was in the first 13 laps. Since data only go back to 1995, China started the race a bit ahead of Canada, Britain, France, and Italy. China passed Germany in 1998, Japan in 2005, and the US in 2008. Since then, China has more than doubled its world share while the US’s share has fallen by another three percentage points. If this were a live horserace, boredom would have driven most of the audience away years ago.</p>

<p>The right panel shows that China’s share now exceeds that of the next largest manufacturers combined. This remarkable fact helps us to understand current US-China trade tensions, and the magnitude of supply chain disruptions that occurred when China dialled down its production during Covid. India (not shown separately) was the second fastest share gainer: its global share of manufacturing production rose by two percentage points since 1995.</p>

<p>China’s rise has slowed and looks to have stagnated at about a third of world output. To confirm this, however, we will need more recent data since the last two years in the sample are muddled by events related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) has data to 2022 for value added, and these conform to the flattening narrative, but the WDI do not report gross production data.</p>

<p>China’s dominance is less stark in exports (Figure 3), though the rise is equally amazing. In 1995 China had just 3% of world manufacturing exports, By 2020, its share had risen to 20%. The corresponding fall in the G7 share was less dramatic than for its share of production. This is explained by the meteoric rise in Chinese domestic consumption, which has absorbed an increasing share of its manufacturing production since 2004. Not shown in the charts is that China’s export to production ratio, having peaked at 18% in 2004, is 13% in 2020 – almost back to its 1995 level of 11%. The same diagrams in the Annex are shown for a value-added basis.</p>

<h2>Asymmetric supply chain exposure: G7 and China</h2>

<p>The global supply chain indicators that Rebecca Freeman, Angelos Theodorakopoulos and I developed last year (Baldwin et al. 2022) provide a convenient way of identifying foreign production exposure in supply chains (eight of our new indicators can be found in the TiVA 2023 update). Two of our new indicators are particularly intuitive when it comes to portraying global supply chain exposure.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Foreign Production Exposure: iMport side (FPEM). </strong>This shows the share of all industrial inputs (including domestically sourced inputs) that one nation sources from another on a scale of 0 to 100. FPEM accounts for exposure on a look-through basis in the sense that it looks through the suppliers-to-suppliers veil to discover the purchasing nation’s reliance on production in the selling nation.</li>
</ul><p>Figure 4, left panel, shows that the US relies far more on Chinese manufacturing production than vice versa.<sup>
  <a id="footnoteref2_fk48lrp" title="Scroll down to this footnote" href="#footnote2_fk48lrp" aria-describedby="footnoteref2_fk48lrp">2</a>
</sup>
 While shocking at first sight, this should not be unexpected. It is natural that a country with 11% of the world output buys more from a country that produces 35% than vice versa, but the numbers are astounding. China was more exposed to US inputs before 2002, but the US has had greater exposure since then. In 2020, the US was about three times more exposed to Chinese manufacturing production than vice versa.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Foreign Production Exposure: eXport side (FPEX)</strong>. This indicator reflects the share of a nation’s gross output of intermediate goods that is exported to a particular partner. It is a measure of exposure on the sales side.</li>
</ul><p>Figure 4, right panel, shows the expected result: China is and always has been more reliant on sales to the US than the other way round. In the mid-2000s, China’s dependence on the US was ten times the reverse dependence, but the asymmetry has narrowed substantially.</p>

<p>Putting together the pieces, this shows a remarkable, historical, world-shaping asymmetry in supply chain reliance between China and other major manufacturing countries. Politicians may wish to decouple their economies from China. These data suggest that decoupling would be difficult, slow, expensive, and disruptive – especially to G7 manufacturers. For explicit estimates, see the simulation studies by Felbermayr et al. (2023) and Goes and Bekkers (2022).</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter on the China rise story, it is important to say that the massive asymmetry has nothing really to do with China. It has to do with China’s superpower standing in manufacturing. To see this, imagine what the charts would look like if they displayed the facts for OPEC and the G7 in the petroleum sector. We would see that the G7 is massively more dependent on OPEC supplies than vice versa. The next chapter of the story redirects the spotlight to the China level.</p>

<h2>China’s balance of trade by sector, supply chain engagement, and openness</h2>

<p>What does the rise to superpower status look like from the shores of China? One convenient, if simplistic, yardstick of a country’s competitive profile is its balance of trade by sector.</p>

<p>The left panel of Figure 5 shows the balance of exports less imports in the major sectors: manufactures, agriculture, mining, and services. The overall trade balance, which is just the sum of the sectoral balances, is shown with the thin black line.&nbsp; The pattern is as clear as it is unsurprising. China is a net exporter of manufactured goods and a net importer of everything else – agriculture goods, mining goods and fuels, and services. Both the positive and negative net balances have been growing quickly. Plainly, China is a big importer and a big exporter. Overall, it ran surpluses in the late 2000s, which then decreased and turned negative in 2018 and 2019 (black line).</p>

<p>The right panel provides important hints about the evolution of China’s manufacturing. It charts the evolution of the country’s net exports of intermediate inputs and final goods. Until the mid-2000s, China was a typical offshore destination: a net importer of intermediate inputs and a net exporter of final goods that embodied the imported inputs. From about 2002, China became a large net exporter of intermediate goods as well as final goods.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5</strong> Net exports by sector, China, 1995 to 2020</p>

<p>Aggregate balance-of-trade numbers like those in Figure 5 can hide the evolution of the constituent parts. Figure 6, which focuses on manufactured goods, shows exports and imports separately. In the left panel, we can observe that China’s engagement with global supply chains was extremely vigorous until the mid-2000s. Imports and exports of industrial parts and components were growing rapidly, and imports and exports were growing in tandem. Afterward that, exports grew faster, and this difference has produced the positive balance in manufactured goods..</p>

<p>The right panel shows a different picture for final manufactured goods. Here, exports have always exceeded imports, with the imbalance growing rapidly in the 2010s.</p>

<p>The next pair of charts shows the change in the sectoral composition of China’s exports.</p>

<p>Figure 7 presents the sectoral shares for 1995 (first year in the database) and 2020. It shows that China has moved from being relatively reliant on simple manufacturing sectors like textiles and clothing to more sophisticated sectors like electronics, basic and fabricated metal products, and chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A telling factoid is that textiles accounted for the biggest share in 1995, but electronics did so in 2020.</p>

<h2>Globalisation ratio</h2>

<p>Finally, consider China’s globalisation ratios (Figure 8). The right panel exhibits the country’s gross globalisation ratio (GGR) in manufacturing. This is the share of manufactured production that is sold abroad, where production is measured as the total sales of all China-based manufacturers. It differs from manufacturing GDP since it includes all sales, not just final good sales.</p>

<p>Turning to the facts, we see that during its rise to manufacturing superpower status, China’s GGR rocketed up – almost doubling – in the first decade of the data. Indeed, most of the action came between 1999 and 2004. That period was an extraordinary feat of globalisation, and it is probably why so many think of China as an economy that is incredibly dependent on exports. But the story doesn’t end in 2004.</p>

<p>Since 2004, China’s GGR has been falling steadily. And don’t miss the fact that it is, in 2020, not far above where it started in 1995. Chinese manufacturing, in short, is no longer as dependent on exports as many might believe. True, the first part of the rapid growth period involved exports growing faster than production (so the GGR rises). But then production grows faster than exports, implying that domestic sales were becoming relatively more important, compared to export sales – even though domestic and foreign sales were both booming throughout the high-growth episode. This dispels the myth that China’s success can be entirely attributed to exports. From around 2004, China increasingly became its own best customer.</p>

<p>The takeaway is simple: China’s openness, as measured by the GGR, has fallen rapidly. By 2020 it was only slightly more dependent on export sales than it was 1995.</p>

<h2>Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>China is now the world’s sole manufacturing giant. As its recent success in electric vehicles demonstrates, its wide and deep industrial base can help it gain a competitive edge in virtually all sectors. The exceptions are the most advanced sectors, where the G7 countries still dominate.</p>

<p>Politicians who indulge in loose talk about decoupling from China need a clear-eyed look at the facts. As we have shown (Baldwin et al. 2023), all the major manufacturers in the world source at least 2% of all their industrial inputs from China. Decoupling would be difficult, to say the least.</p>

<p>The fields surrounding Byron Kominek’s farm lay fallow. But on a sunny morning in mid-December, Kominek harvests the sun’s rays.
</p>
<p>The idea to add solar panels to his family’s 24-acre farm emerged out of necessity.
</p>
<p>“Without much farming experience, it's hard to just jump into agriculture and expect to make a living on it. Solar was a way to have a long-term, steady income.” said Kominek, who moved to his grandfather’s farm in 2016 and now runs Jack’s Solar Garden — a nationally <a href="https://www.jackssolargarden.com/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>recognized site</u></a> for agrivoltaic research named in honor of his grandfather.
</p>
<p>Today, Kominek’s 3,276 solar panels generate enough electricity to power approximately 300 homes (the panels themselves take up just four acres of the property).
</p>
<p>This year delivered Denver’s second <a href="https://www.weather.gov/bou/DenverSummerHeat" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>hottest summer on record</u></a>. As temperatures rise, agrivoltaics could provide a blueprint for how farmers can adapt.
</p>
<p>Beneath the solar panels, ducks, geese and sheep graze, and workers tend to a variety of crops, including salad greens, corn and radishes — all of which have flourished in the partial shade of his solar panels.
</p>
<p>As temperatures continue to rise, creating usable shade will become even more important.
</p>
<p>“Having shade on the ground is a climate adaptation. I hate to say it, but I've kind of given up on the thought that we're going to fix climate change whatsoever,” said Komenik. “Climate change is going to happen. It's going to be rapid. It's going to be terrible. So we need to figure out how to adapt to that changing climate.”
</p>
<p>Traditional solar arrays are built low to the ground. They may help to meet <a href="https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/climate-energy" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>clean energy targets</u></a>, but they can have lasting negative impacts on the land, like soil compaction and habitat loss, and they often prohibit simultaneous uses of the land, such as growing food.
</p>
<p>By raising solar panels eight feet, Kominek argues that solar companies open a world of opportunities below.
</p>
<p>Growing crops or grazing animals in conjunction with solar can protect soil, provide landowners with an additional source of income and create valuable shade — which Kominek argues will become even more important to plants, animals and farm workers as temperatures rise.
</p>
<p>At 42, Kominek’s resume includes a smattering of experience — from long distance motorcycle trips through western Africa to work in the Foreign Service and multiple engineering degrees. But it wasn’t until a few years ago that he tried his hand at growing food.
</p>
<p>Kominek grew up in Johnson City, Tennessee, largely disconnected from agriculture. In the 1990s, he occasionally visited his family’s hay farm in Longmont, but by that time his grandfather had passed away and tenants farmed the fields.
</p>
<p>While working as a natural resource officer in Zambia and Mozambique, Kominek
</p>
<p>began to question the relationship many Americans had with the natural world.
</p>
<p>“We don't have to be extractive, it's just how we've chosen to do it,” he said.
</p>
<p>“Going to a different culture, different country, different context shows you that the same things that you do in your community can be achieved just by doing it differently.”

<p>Kominek moved to his family’s farm in 2016. Two years later, he took over the agricultural side of the property. From the start, he knew something needed to change.
</p>
<p>“Property taxes were going up, our utilities were going up, everything was going up,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>Growing hay wasn’t going to cut it.
</p>
<p>“The idea for solar came about as a means to have a passive income that could help make ends meet here on the land,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and University of Arizona tipped him off to the emerging field of agrivoltaics — a portmanteau of agriculture and photovoltaics, which are more commonly known as solar panels.
</p>
<p>“I liked the idea of keeping the land active,” he said.
</p>
<p>Thanks to soaring property values in Boulder County, Kominek was able to put a lien on his farm to finance the construction of the solar panels. A series of lucky breaks followed: the farm sat across the street from a transmission line, the utility accepted his bid and the county changed its land use code to allow the project.
</p>
<p>Today, Kominek estimates that he earns $20,000 annually by selling energy to subscribers.

<p>Industry experts <a href="https://seia.org/state-solar-policy/colorado-solar/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>value</u></a> Colorado’s solar market at $8.1 billion. In 2023 alone, investors poured $2.3 billion into solar. Unfortunately, Kominek argues that the current evaluation system for large-scale solar projects could cost communities in the long run.
</p>
<p>“Oftentimes how [communities] evaluate bids from solar companies has nothing to do with land stewardship, has nothing to do with the agricultural activities or what goes on there. It really focuses on the price per kilowatt hour and whether they've done a project before or not,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>Without further regard for land stewardship, large-scale projects can quickly turn into “a race to the bottom,” he said.
</p>
<p>“Does the community want the cheapest power possible at the expense of our lands? That’s a big question,” said Kominek.
</p>
<p>In order to make way for solar arrays, utility companies typically grade the land, which compacts soil.
</p>
<p>“Compaction is the enemy of all vegetation,” said Komenik.
</p>
<p>Once land is compacted, it can be difficult to revive since tilling can further degrade the soil and its ability to retain water.

<p>Perhaps a bigger problem, however, is that the status quo doesn’t incentivize agrivoltaics.
</p>
<p>According to Komenik, rules for solar development vary widely county by county. Even communities that welcome solar projects often don’t request stipulations for agriculture.
</p>
<p>According to Komenik, utility companies fear animals could damage solar arrays and that vegetation could interfere with energy capture.
</p>
<p>“The solar industry sees all vegetation as the enemy. If it grows too tall, they think it will shade the panels,” he said.
</p>
<p>Since the panels need to be elevated, the costs of agrivoltaics are higher than traditional solar arrays. Komenik thinks the price is overblown.
</p>
<p>“A lot of the cost of the solar array is the people — installing the solar panels and all the wiring that goes into it. Inverters and the transformers and the switchgear. None of that changes,” he said.
</p>
<p>NREL <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/77811.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><u>estimates</u></a> that agrivoltaic systems cost between $0.07 and $0.80 more per watt of direct current.
</p>
<p>Komenik understands that agrivoltaics’ long-term future is dependent on community buy-in. That’s why he dedicates a lot of his time to education.
</p>
<p>“We need more examples. If there's just one in the country, it's easy to dismiss, but when there's thousands of them, people are more able to go out, learn about it, and figure out how they can do it,” he said.
</p>
<p>In Delta County, construction is underway at the Garnet Mesa solar project, an 80 megawatt agrivoltaic project that will provide power to approximately 18,000 homes and forage to approximately 600 sheep. Once built, it will become the state’s largest irrigated agrivoltaic site.
</p>
<p>County Commissioner Wendell Koontz was skeptical when the project first came across his desk.
</p>
<p>After a lifetime working in the energy industry, Koontz saw the plan’s lack of provisions for reclamation and irrigation as red flags.
</p>
<p>“Solar developers need to be held to the same economic and environmental standards that we would hold oil and gas, coal, any other energy provider to,” said Koontz.
</p>
<p>Koontz and fellow county commissioners gave their approval once developers revised the plan to add irrigation, changes to fences and landscaping and bonding for site reclamation.
</p>
<p>Once “I put my name on the resolution approving this project I got a stake in the game. Now I don't want to see it fail,” he said.
</p>
<p>Although elevated panels may provide sufficient room for people and sheep, they complicate mechanized agriculture. Koontz worries that noxious weeds or pooling water could become a problem if the irrigated land isn’t properly managed.
</p>
<p>Among the people he represents in Delta County, Koontz said that many would prefer to keep irrigated lands separate and relegate solar to barren mineral lands.
</p>
<p>“The ag economy is what really drives Delta County. It's part of our heritage. It's part of our culture,” said Kootnz. “We’ve got to be very thoughtful about what we're doing here because this is about food and economies.”
</p>
<p>Koontz said he’s “cautiously optimistic,” about the future of agrivoltaics. But after seeing how difficult these projects are to complete, he’s highly skeptical of the state’s promise to have 100% renewable energy by 2040.

<p>During the growing season, Jack’s Solar Farm buzzes with activity. Workers from Sprout City Farms, a Denver nonprofit, cultivate vegetables to sell at local farmers markets and donate to food pantries. The rest of the space is divided among researchers from Colorado State University, the University of Arizona and NREL.
</p>
<p>Although Komenik said that certain squash and beets haven’t fared well in the partial shade of his solar panels, most species have thrived.
</p>
<p>“Colorado is not a light-limited state. We're a water limited state. A lot of the little seed packets that we get come from the East Coast, where they have cloud cover and rain and such. We don't have those things out here,” said Komenick.
</p>
<p>Solar panels that rotate throughout the day provide partial sunlight akin to a sky of rolling clouds.
</p>
<p>On the hottest days, Komenik estimates that the shade beneath his panels is 15 to 20 degrees cooler than areas in direct sun. Working in the shade isn’t just a boon to workers who tend the property’s vegetables, it also helps to save water.
</p>
<p>Despite the success of Komenik’s operation, he thinks that future agrivoltaic development can take many forms. His farm’s proximity to Longmont, high quality soil and small footprint favored market vegetables and small-scale grazing.
</p>
<p>In all likelihood, future solar projects are likely to unfold on grasslands, where developers can get the most bang for their buck.
</p>
<p>“The majority of large solar arrays are being built in communities that have less than a few thousand people anywhere near them and so you don't have as much labor as is required for this type of work,” said Komenik.
</p>
<p>In these areas, sheep and cattle grazing offer an additional way to use the land that is less labor intensive and a better fit for the environment.
</p>
<p>Regardless of location, the number one key to success is a willingness to adapt.
</p>
<p>“If you're expecting to do the exact same thing as you were before the solar panels, you're going to be in for a surprise,” said Komenik.
</p>
<p>“It is going to change. It doesn't mean that it will necessarily be worse. It will simply be different.”

            <span>Abstract:</span>OpenAI o1 represents a significant milestone in Artificial Inteiligence, which achieves expert-level performances on many challanging tasks that require strong reasoning <a href="http://ability.openai/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> has claimed that the main techinique behinds o1 is the reinforcement learining. Recent works use alternative approaches like knowledge distillation to imitate o1's reasoning style, but their effectiveness is limited by the capability ceiling of the teacher model. Therefore, this paper analyzes the roadmap to achieving o1 from the perspective of reinforcement learning, focusing on four key components: policy initialization, reward design, search, and learning. Policy initialization enables models to develop human-like reasoning behaviors, equipping them with the ability to effectively explore solution spaces for complex problems. Reward design provides dense and effective signals via reward shaping or reward modeling, which is the guidance for both search and learning. Search plays a crucial role in generating high-quality solutions during both training and testing phases, which can produce better solutions with more computation. Learning utilizes the data generated by search for improving policy, which can achieve the better performance with more parameters and more searched data. Existing open-source projects that attempt to reproduce o1 can be seem as a part or a variant of our roadmap. Collectively, these components underscore how learning and search drive o1's advancement, making meaningful contributions to the development of LLM.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Background</h2><a id="user-content-background" aria-label="Permalink: Background" href="#background"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We started looking into Android APK Signing Block oddities at the request of
F-Droid [1] on 2021-08-25; we opened F-Droid issue "APK Signing Block
considerations" [2] on 2022-10-19.  No action was taken as a result.</p>
<p dir="auto">We published the "Android APK Signing Block Payload PoC" [3] to the Reproducible
Builds mailing list [4] on 2023-01-31.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">But the Android APK Signature Scheme v2/v3 actually allows embedding arbitrary
data (or code) in the signing block, meaning that two APKs with the exact same
valid signature -- though not a bit-by-bit identical signing block -- can
behave differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Jason Donenfeld reported "Potential security hazard: <code>apk_signer_fingerprint()</code>
looks at certs in reverse order that Android checks them" [5] on 2023-05-05; no
action was taken to fix this bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">However, there's a discrepancy between how these certificates are extracted
and how Android actually implements signature checks. [...] Notice how [the
google flowchart [6]] checks v3, then v2, and then v1. Yet the [F-Droid] code
above looks at v1, then v2, and then v3, in reverse order. So v1 could have a
bogus signer that some versions of Android never even look at, yet fdroid
makes a security decision based on it. Yikes! Also, it's worth noting that
apk_signer_fingerprint() also does not bother validating that the signatures
are correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Andreas Itzchak Rehberg (IzzyOnDroid) reported about "BLOBs in APK signing
blocks" in "Ramping up security: additional APK checks are in place with the
IzzyOnDroid repo" [7] on 2024-03-25.  The accompanying German article
"Android-Apps auf dem Seziertisch: Eine vertiefte Betrachtung" [8] points out
that we noticed that <code>apksigner</code> and <code>androguard</code> handle duplicate signing
blocks rather differently: the former only sees the first, the latter only the
last, which allows all kinds of shenanigans.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Observations</h2><a id="user-content-observations" aria-label="Permalink: Observations" href="#observations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We observed that embedding a v1 (JAR) signature file in an APK with <code>minSdk &gt;= 24</code> will be ignored by Android/<code>apksigner</code>, which only checks v2/v3 in that
case.  However, since <code>fdroidserver</code> checks v1 first, regardless of <code>minSdk</code>,
and does not verify the signature, it will accept a "fake" certificate and see
an incorrect certificate fingerprint.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also realised that the above mentioned discrepancy between <code>apksigner</code> and
<code>androguard</code> (which <code>fdroidserver</code> uses to extract the v2/v3 certificates) can
be abused here as well.  Simply copying the v2/v3 signature from a different APK
and appending it to the APK Signing Block will not affect <code>apksigner</code>'s
verification, but <code>androguard</code>, and thus also <code>fdroidserver</code>, will see only the
second block.  Again, the signature is not verified, a "fake" certificate
accepted, and an incorrect fingerprint seen.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a result, it is trivial to bypass the <code>AllowedAPKSigningKeys</code> certificate
pinning, as we can make <code>fdroidserver</code> see whatever certificate we want instead
of the one Android/<code>apksigner</code> does.  Note that we don't need a valid signature
for the APK (we really only need a copy of the DER certificate, though having
another APK signed with the certificate we want to use makes things easy).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-04-14)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-04-14" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-04-14)" href="#update-2024-04-14"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Having been asked about multiple certificates in APK signatures [5], we realised
that, like v2/v3 signatures, v1 signatures can indeed also contain multiple
certificates (e.g. a certificate chain, though neither <code>jarsigner</code> nor
<code>apksigner</code> seem to enforce any relationships between certificates).  However,
unlike v2/v3 -- which guarantee that the certificate used for the signature is
always the first in the sequence -- v1 does not define an ordering: the
signature block file is a PKCS#7 DER-encoded ASN.1 data structure (per RFC 2315)
and uses a SET for the list of certificates.</p>
<p dir="auto">Android/<code>apksigner</code> will find and use the first certificate that matches the
relevant <code>SignerInfo</code>, ignoring any other certificates, but <code>fdroidserver</code>
always returns the first certificate it finds in the signature block file.  Thus
we can once again trick it into seeing any certificate we want -- as long as it
only checks the v1 certificate (e.g. when the <code>fdroidserver.patch</code> has not been
applied or the APK only has a v1 signature).</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: apps with <code>targetSdk &gt;= 30</code> are required to have a v2/v3 signature.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: Android &lt; N will only check the first <code>SignerInfo</code>, later versions pick the
first one that verifies if there are multiple.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-04-20)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-04-20" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-04-20)" href="#update-2024-04-20"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Despite repeated warnings [5] that using the last certificate instead of the
first one does not in any way fix the vulnerability described in the 2024-04-14
update (PoC #3), the proposed patches for <code>fdroidserver</code> [10] and <code>androguard</code>
[11] do exactly this.  With that patch, version A (which inserts the fake
certificate first) of the PoC now fails, but version B (which inserts it last)
now works.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Update (2024-12-30 #1)</h3><a id="user-content-update-2024-12-30-1" aria-label="Permalink: Update (2024-12-30 #1)" href="#update-2024-12-30-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of adopting the fixes we proposed, F-Droid wrote and merged their own
patch [10], ignoring repeated warnings it had significant flaws (including an
incorrect implementation of v1 signature verification and making it impossible
to have APKs with rotated keys in a repository).  As a result it is possible to
construct a valid v1 signature that <code>fdroidserver</code> matches to the wrong
certificate.</p>
<p dir="auto">We do this by simply creating and prepending a second SignerInfo using our own
certificate, which has the same serial number and an almost identical issuer --
e.g. a common name with a space (0x20) replaced by a tab (0x09) or a DEL (0x7f)
appended -- to exploit an implementation that will match the SignerInfo against
the wrong certificate through incorrect canonicalisation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Luckily, the impact is lower than that of the other vulnerabilities as it does
require a valid signature from the certificate one wishes to spoof.</p>

<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, we found another more severe vulnerability as well, caused by a
regex incorrectly handling newlines in filenames.  This allows another trivial
bypass of certificate pinning, as we can once again make <code>fdroidserver</code> see
whatever certificate we want instead of the one Android/<code>apksigner</code> does (as
long as we have a valid v1 signature for some other APK).</p>
<p dir="auto">The regex in question, <code>^META-INF/.*\.(DSA|EC|RSA)$</code>, is supposed to match all
filenames that start with <code>META-INF/</code> and end with <code>.DSA</code>, <code>.EC,</code> or <code>.RSA</code>.
Unfortunately, the <code>.*</code> does not match newlines, and the <code>$</code> matches not just
the end of the string but "the end of the string or just before the newline at
the end of the string".  As a result we can use a newline in the filename of the
real signature files (before the extension), which Android/<code>apksigner</code> see but
<code>fdroidserver</code> does not, and a newline after the <code>.RSA</code> extension for the
spoofed signature files, which <code>fdroidserver</code> will see but Android/<code>apksigner</code>
will not.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: <code>androguard</code> seems to use a similarly incorrect regex.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can do almost the exact same thing with NUL bytes instead of newlines,
independently of the flawed regex, because Python's <code>ZipInfo.filename</code> is
sanitised by removing any NUL byte and everything after it.  This will have the
same result for <code>fdroidserver</code> and <code>apksigner</code> (which happily accepts NUL bytes
in filenames) as above, but luckily Android rejects APKs with NUL bytes in
filenames, and such an APK will thus fail to install.</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: in light of all of the above we reiterate that we strongly recommend using
the official <code>apksig</code> library (used by <code>apksigner</code>) to both verify APK
signatures and return the first signer's certificate to avoid these kind of
implementation mistakes and inconsistencies and thus further vulnerabilities.
Handling common cases correctly is fairly easy, but handling edge cases
correctly is hard; rolling your own implementation without the required
expertise and care to get it right is irresponsible.</p>

<p dir="auto">NB: you currently need the <code>signing</code> branch of <code>apksigtool</code> [9].</p>
<p dir="auto">NB: the "fake" signer shown here is from the official F-Droid client (its APK
has a v1+v2+v3 signature), the one <code>apksigner</code> sees is randomly generated by
<code>make-key.sh</code>; the <code>app.apk</code> used for testing had <code>minSdk 26</code> and a v2 signature
only.  Using APKs with other signature scheme combinations is certainly
possible, but might require adjusting the PoC code accordingly.</p>

further vulnerabilities like this one.</p>

<p dir="auto">Let us go back to the year 1992. The CPUs were 1000 times slower than today and the acceleration via a GPU was unknown or unaffordable. 3D games were calculated exclusively on the CPU and the rendering engine rendered filled polygons with a single color.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/blob/master/images/gunship2000-1991.gif"><img src="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/raw/master/images/gunship2000-1991.gif" alt="Game Gunship 2000 in 1991" data-animated-image=""></a>

<p dir="auto">It was during that year <a href="http://www.novalogic.com/" rel="nofollow">NovaLogic</a> published the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_(video_game_series)" rel="nofollow">Comanche</a>.</p>

<em>Game Comanche published by NovaLogic in 1992</em></p>
<p dir="auto">The graphics were breathtaking for the time being and in my opinion 3 years ahead of its time. You see many more details such as textures on mountains and valleys, and for the first time a neat shading and even shadows. Sure, it's pixelated, but all games in those years were pixelated.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Render algorithm</h2><a id="user-content-render-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink: Render algorithm" href="#render-algorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_(video_game_series)" rel="nofollow">Comanche</a> uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel_Space" rel="nofollow">Voxel Space</a>, which is based on the same ideas like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting" rel="nofollow">ray casting</a>. Hence the Voxel Space engine is a 2.5D engine, it doesn't have all the levels of freedom that a regular 3D engine offers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Height map and color map</h3><a id="user-content-height-map-and-color-map" aria-label="Permalink: Height map and color map" href="#height-map-and-color-map"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to represent a terrain is through a height map and color map. For the game Comanche a 1024 * 1024 one byte height map and a 1024 * 1024 one byte color map is used which you can download on this site. These maps are periodic:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/blob/master/images/periodicmap.gif"><img src="https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/raw/master/images/periodicmap.gif" alt="periodic map" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Such maps limit the terrain to "one height per position on the map" - Complex geometries such as buildings or trees are not possible to represent. However, a great advantage of the colormap is, that it already contains the shading and shadows. The Voxel Space engine just takes the color and doesn't have to compute illumination during the render process.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic algorithm</h3><a id="user-content-basic-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink: Basic algorithm" href="#basic-algorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For a 3D engine the rendering algorithm is amazingly simple. The Voxel Space engine rasters the height and color map and draws vertical lines. The following figure demonstrate this technique.</p>

<li>Clear Screen.</li>
<li>To guarantee occlusion start from the back and render to the front. This is called painter algorithm.</li>
<li>Determine the line on the map, which corresponds to the same optical distance from the observer. Consider the field of view and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection" rel="nofollow">perspective projection</a> (Objects are smaller farther away)</li>

          <div>
      <p>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.hubrecht.eu/research-groups/bakkers-group/">Bakkers group</a> at the Hubrecht Institute have successfully repaired damaged mouse hearts using a protein from zebrafish. They discovered that the protein Hmga1 plays a key role in heart regeneration in zebrafish. In mice, this protein was able to restore the heart by activating dormant repair genes without causing side effects, such as heart enlargement. This study, supported by the Dutch Heart Foundation and Hartekind Foundation, marks an important step toward regenerative therapies to prevent heart failure. The findings were published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-024-00588-9">Nature Cardiovascular Research</a> on January 2, 2025.</p>
    </div>
          <div>
        <p>After a heart attack, the human heart loses millions of muscle cells that cannot regrow. This often leads to heart failure, where the heart struggles to pump blood effectively. Unlike humans, zebrafish grow new heart muscle cells: they have a regenerative capacity. When a zebrafish heart is damaged, it can fully restore its function within 60 days. “We don’t understand why some species can regenerate their hearts after injury while others cannot”, explains Jeroen Bakkers, the study’s leader. “By studying zebrafish and comparing them to other species, we can uncover the mechanisms of heart regeneration. This could eventually lead to therapies to prevent heart failure in humans.”</p>
<h5><strong>A protein that repairs damage</strong></h5>
<p>The research team identified a protein that enables heart repair in zebrafish. “We compared the zebrafish heart to the mouse heart, which, like the human heart, cannot regenerate”, says Dennis de Bakker, the study’s first author. “We looked at the activity of genes in damaged and healthy parts of the heart”, he explains. “Our findings revealed that the gene for the Hmga1 protein is active during heart regeneration in zebrafish but not in mice. This showed us that Hmga1 plays a key role in heart repair.” Typically, the Hmga1 protein is important during embryonic development when cells need to grow a lot. However, in adult cells, the gene for this protein is turned off.</p>
<h5><strong>Clearing ‘roadblocks’</strong></h5>
<p>The researchers investigates how the Hmga1 protein works. “We discovered that Hmga1 removes molecular ‘roadblocks’ on chromatin”, explains Mara Bouwman, co-first author. Chromatin is the structure that packages DNA. When it is tightly packed, genes are inactive. When it unpacks, genes can become active again. “Hmga1 clears the way, so to say, allowing dormant genes to get back to work”, she adds.</p>

          <h5><strong>From fish to mammals</strong></h5>
<p>To test if the protein works similarly in mammals, the researchers applied it locally to damaged mouse hearts. “The results were remarkable: the Hmga1 protein stimulated heart muscle cells to divide and grow, significantly improving heart function”, says Bakkers. Surprisingly, cell division occurred only in the damaged area—precisely where repair was needed. “There were no adverse effects, such as excessive growth or an enlarged heart. We also didn’t see any cell division in healthy heart tissue”, Bouwman emphasizes. “This suggests that the damage itself sends a signal to activate the process.”</p>
<p>The team then compared the activity of the Hmga1 gene in zebrafish, mice, and humans. In human hearts, as in adult mice, the Hmga1 protein is not produced after a heart attack. However, the gene for Hmga1 is present in humans and active during embryonic development. “This provides a foundation for gene therapies that could unlock the heart’s regenerative potential in humans”, Bakkers explains.</p>

      </div>
          <div>
        <h5><strong>What’s next?</strong></h5>
<p>These findings open doors for safe, targeted regenerative therapies, but there is still much work to do. “We need to refine and test the therapy further before it can be brought to the clinic”, says Bakkers. “The next step is to test whether the protein also works on human heart muscle cells in culture. We are collaborating with UMC Utrecht for this, and in 2025, the Summit program (DRIVE-RM) will begin to explore heart regeneration further.”</p>
<h5><strong>Heart for collaboration</strong></h5>
<p>This research brought together scientists from the Hubrecht Institute and beyond. It was conducted as part of the OUTREACH consortium and funded by the Dutch Heart Foundation and <a href="https://www.hartekind.nl/onderzoeken/outreach#regeneratie">Hartekind Foundation.</a> The OUTREACH consortium is a collaboration between research institutes and all academic hospitals involved in treating patients with congenital heart defects in the Netherlands. “Normally, our group only focusses on zebrafish”, says Bouwman. “But to understand how our findings could be applied to mammals, we collaborated with the Van Rooij group and Christoffels group (Amsterdam UMC), experts in mouse research. Thanks to the Single Cell Core at the Hubrecht Institute, we were able to study heart regeneration at a detailed level.”</p>
<p>“We’re very lucky that we were able to set up these collaborations”, Bouwman continues. “It allows us to translate discoveries from zebrafish to mice and, hopefully, eventually to humans. We are learning so much from the zebrafish and its remarkable ability to regenerate its heart.”</p>

	Sun pours through the lush foliage of a jungle, bleaching the pale limestone as a rotting man stands in the center of an otherwise empty arena, his yellow eyes leering from beneath a fringe of limp, blonde hair. Positioned around the edge are a hundred bodies, Orcs and Trolls and bipedal oxen shouting, demanding, the death of the dishonorable. Their voices swell into a cacophony of noise before one rings out above the rest, howling, “Kill the cheater and you’ll get 20 gold!” There is silence, and then another frenzy. As I watch, eyes fixed on the dim glow of a laptop screen, I think of the colosseum in Rome — sweat running down the muscled arms of battle-tested gladiators, the crowd cheering for blood.</p>



<p>
	This might sound like a moment pulled from a high fantasy drama made for prestige TV, but this is <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/world-of-warcraft/" id="auto-tag_world-of-warcraft" data-tag="world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-20-anniversary-1235176713/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-20-anniversary-1235176713/">now 20-year old online RPG</a>.

<p>
	Sequisha’s execution and subsequent reincarnation is just one of hundreds of stories playing out everyday in <em>World of Warcraft</em> as streamers have flocked to the massively multiplayer online RPG (MMORPG) to play together.

<p>
	In Hardcore mode, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has become the best soap opera on the internet, all playing out across over dozens of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/onlyfangs/" id="auto-tag_onlyfangs" data-tag="onlyfangs">OnlyFangs</a> creator streams every day.

		What is OnlyFangs?	</h2>



<p>
	To commemorate the 20th anniversary of <em>World of Warcraft, </em>Blizzard Entertainment created a set of new servers designed to draw in fans old and new. This included a “Classic” server, which recreates the look and mechanics of the game’s earliest days, and will eventually be updated to include its expansions, starting with 2007’s <em>The Burning Crusade</em> and 2008’s <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The other big addition is a “Hardcore” server. Unlike standard servers, if you die in Hardcore, that character is lost forever — including rare items and gold. Between these new high-stakes servers and 2024’s <em>The War Within</em> expansion, interest in the game had been renewed, driving creators back to the world of Azeroth to mine a deep well of fresh content. Since the bump in users, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has remained a hot category on platforms like <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/twitch/" id="auto-tag_twitch" data-tag="twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube, with overall viewership reaching well above 50 thousand, even during usual off hours, and it seems like everyone wants a piece of the pie.</p>



<p>
	Swaths of streamers have decided to team up and create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-undaunted-guild-accessibility-1235183220/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/world-of-warcraft-undaunted-guild-accessibility-1235183220/">guilds, enclosed social networks</a> where players can ask for help or chat in semi-private spaces, for the sole purpose of jumping into the new Hardcore server. One such guild began early with the first wave of Hardcore servers: OnlyFangs — a group of some of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://win.gg/news/all-the-members-of-onlyfangs-the-twitch-wow-superguild/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://win.gg/news/all-the-members-of-onlyfangs-the-twitch-wow-superguild/">most popular creators</a> on Twitch like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twitch-gambling-ban-sliker-debt-rehab-1234596040/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twitch-gambling-ban-sliker-debt-rehab-1234596040/">Mizkif</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/top-social-media-influencers-creators-2024-1235084589/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/top-social-media-influencers-creators-2024-1235084589/">Pokimane</a>, and the guild’s leader Sodapoppin, who is currently the world’s most popular <em>World of Warcraft </em>streamer.

<p>
	After amassing a huge following with their first big season of Hardcore mode streaming, OnlyFangs made some big changes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/">even dropping famou</a><a href="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" data-type="link" data-id="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">s</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://gameland.gg/sodapoppin-reveals-full-list-of-streamers-kicked-from-onlyfangs/"> names like Pokimane</a> for not being devoted to the leveling grind.

And there would be a lot more drama this time around as OnlyFangs would be diving headfirst into the world of roleplaying, demanding that everyone involved fully commit to the bit.

<p>
	What they didn’t know was their experiment in <em>World of Warcraft</em> roleplay would inadvertently create one of the best emergent dramas on the internet.</p>



	



<p>
	In November 2024, OnlyFangs began the long journey to Molten Core, a level 60 dungeon, for their second season on the side of the Horde — <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s seemingly nefarious, but far more narratively complex faction. Choosing a faction, be it Horde or Alliance, impacts what quests players can pick up, what major cities and outposts they will have access to, and the races and classes they can select when it comes time to create a character.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Comprised of green Orcs, blue-hued and tusked Trolls, rotting Undead, and the bestial, horned Tauren, participating streamers were sorted into these four racial groups based on a personality test taken beforehand. This would also limit streamers on what classes they could play, as the options in Classic (also known as “vanilla”) <em>World of Warcraft </em>were not as expansive as they are now. But most importantly, once a streamer’s character died in game, that character would be gone forever, with the streamer forced to start from zero should they want to continue the challenge of making it to level 60 and completing Molten Core.</p>



<p>
	The nature of these specific servers means that there’s actually something to lose, that time and energy put into a character could be wasted with one bad encounter or another player fumbling with their button inputs or healing potions. This is one of the core components of what makes <em>World of Warcraft </em>Hardcore so compelling. It’s the risk factor that makes games <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-1235005986/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-1235005986/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like <em>Dark Souls</em> </a>so exciting to play or watch.

	On top of an already rigid set of rules and the high stakes environment, each streamer is expected to role-play as the character they had created, similar to a session of <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-dungeons-and-dragons-interview-1235188141/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/critical-role-dungeons-and-dragons-interview-1235188141/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. Adhering to the lore of <em>World of Warcraft</em> and responding to situations the way their character might<em>. </em>Are they a hard-headed Orc that had a lust for battle? Or are they an Undead that wouldn’t hesitate letting another player die if it meant their own survival? These factors contribute to how players approach specific situations and weave into how they interact with their fellow guild members. It’s like a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/valkyrae-youtuber-gta-v-roleplay-interview-1235005962/" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/valkyrae-youtuber-gta-v-roleplay-interview-1235005962/"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em> role-playing server</a>, just with high fantasy races and the shadow of perma-death looming over every dungeon run.&nbsp;</p>

	For the season, over 100 streamers, including members of OTK or other popular independent talents such as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PirateSoftware</a>, are placed into factions and must stay in-character to create a sense of emergent storytelling. Some Troll players thank their deities, the “Loa,” (the gods of the Troll faction) for good luck or even claim to feel the death of another player through the invisible gods. In reality, the divine voice they “hear” is actually just an in-game notification that another player had bitten the dust. On top of this, each faction is vying against one another every week for the top spot, with the loser facing some kind of punishment. This fosters rivalries among the individual factions, adding to the narrative that continues to unfold week after week.</p>



<p>
	During each session, it’s up to the streamers to keep up the performance and remain in-character. This self-imposed rule creates organic events, making the streams more engaging to watch as players chat about the current activity of the guild and the latest gossip. With the amount of participants in every time zone, dozens of individual narratives emerge, creating a mix of faction and interpersonal politics within the guild.</p>

<p>
	Other limitations are instated, such as the ability to trade materials and crafted items exclusively with one another. This had been an issue with OnlyFangs’ first attempt at Hardcore, with several members of OTK avoiding any direct repercussions for their reckless deaths as their followers floated them valuable items to gear up for follow-up runs after losing everything before.

	</p>




<p>
	Cooperation is essential to survive, as <em>World of Warcraft </em>in its earliest iterations relied on players to party up to complete quests and successfully run dungeons to obtain valuable gear. This allows for organic relationships between characters to form, and through the use of in-game proximity voice chat, which allows players to hear each other by getting physically close in virtual space, viewers become familiar with characters through the sound of their voice.</p>



<p>
	As the campaign evolves, each streamer’s specific schtick provides a different lens into the guild’s daily happenings. Watching PirateSoftware offers viewers a glimpse into the politicking and bickering over who would become the de facto Warchief for the Trolls. Dropping into <a rel="nofollow" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" data-type="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" target="_blank">Sequ</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" target="_blank" data-type="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha">i</a><a rel="nofollow" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" data-type="link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sequisha" target="_blank">sha’</a>s stream gives a taste of the mundane, slice of life roleplaying the Undead faction engaged in. But this is <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and the world of Azeroth isn’t always kind of filled with the most charitable characters.</p>



	<h2 id="the-drama-begins">
		<strong>The drama begins</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	Early on, one event had already rocked the guild, as Sodapoppin announced that Sequisha had been caught cheating by breaking a cardinal rule. In order to create more inventory space for items he didn’t have room for, Sequisha abused the in-game auction house to store items. This was strictly prohibited, and due to the nature of his crime, he would be sentenced to trial by combat. The guild was abuzz with Trolls, Orcs, Tauren, and Undead sprinting to the Gurubashi arena to watch Sequisha fight for his life. If he could last a total of twenty minutes, killing anyone who entered the arena in honorable one-versus-one combat , he would be allowed to live. It seemed as though Sequisha would be given a second chance, that is, until he met defeat at the hands of another guild member, and all over the sum of 20 gold.</p>

<p>
	After Sequisha’s cheating, and the chaos that followed in his subsequent execution, the Undead mostly kept to their own. Because of how severe the punishment was, there was division within the guild and tense arguments that occurred on stream both in and out of character. But as the drama snowballed, streamers only leaned deeper into their characters. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esfand</a> (co-founder of OTK, playing a Tauren) began donning a mask during streams to fully immerse viewers into the character he was playing: a giant bipedal cow. Others even put on accents; in the case of Hubert, the Queen’s English to denote that he is of “higher intellect” and more cultured than his Orc brethren.

	</p>




<p>
	Despite the absurdity of watching a streamer try to navigate through dungeons and forests with a cow’s head pulled over his face, it shows a level of dedication to roleplaying that makes the OnlyFangs universe so enthralling. Its constant chaos becomes addictive to watch, like high fantasy reality TV.</p>



<p>
	Although there weren’t any more executions, OTK’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mizkif" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/mizkif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mizkif </a>had been banished from his group and was temporarily left to fend for himself, leading to a near daily cycle of deaths and restarts. Hubert began gifting his fellow Orc with temporary intellect, which nearly caused an uprising amongst his clansmen.</p>



<p>
	However, as the event stretched on, streamers began to drop like flies. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/larxa" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.twitch.tv/larxa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Larxa,</a> who had never played <em>World of Warcraft</em> before, was determined to become the first to reach level 60 without having any real experience with the game. While roaming through The Barrens, a vast field of grass littered with hostile creatures, she stumbled upon a patrol of centaurs, and run down and killed. Reaching the end would require perseverance and dedication — which she showed by jumping back into the saddle for a second attempt weeks later.</p>

<p>
	While some members of OnlyFangs have reached level 60 as of reporting, none have tackled Molten Core, and for good reason. PirateSoftware describes the gauntlet of <em>World of Warcraft</em> Hardcore as more or less a test of knowledge. Those familiar with the game will no doubt have the edge over others who have never experienced these dungeons as they existed in the early days of the game. OnlyFangs has had to wait until enough players hit level 60, armed with better equipment, before tackling the final challenge. Without proper education and preparation,&nbsp; the number of possible deaths that could occur might set the entire guild back another series of weeks, or even a month.</p>



<p>
	The harsh reality of their task has pushed more streamers to help each other, easing previous tensions as alchemists created potions as temporary salves for wounds sustained in dungeon expeditions, weavers made cloth armor for healers and valuable bags to store items. It’s now understood that if OnlyFangs wanted to reach the end, they’ll need to do it together.

	</p>




	<h2 id="why-you-should-be-watching">
		<strong>Why you should be watching</strong>	</h2>



<p>
	What has been most surprising is the insistence of specific streamers to continue the long and hard road to level 60. Since the beginning of the event, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has remained within the top five games watched on Twitch, even with the release of highly anticipated titles like <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/path-of-exile-2-explained-1235195377/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/path-of-exile-2-explained-1235195377/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/marvel-rivals-review-1235200428/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/marvel-rivals-review-1235200428/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a></em>. While this doesn’t necessarily translate to the amount of players in the MMORPG, it’s been riveting to watch how a nearly two decade old game has been rejuvenated by a simple server launch. As online celebrity-filled guilds like OnlyFangs continue to stretch the storytelling potential of <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s toolkit, the emergent drama and likelihood of ridiculous moments has become a massive draw.</p>



<p>
	For fans of <em>World of Warcraft</em>, there’s a clear upside as the game’s renewed popularity ensures its ongoing survival. With current viewership on Twitch rivaling that of a big new release or a massive content update for the free-to-play flavor of the week, Blizzard are bound to be paying attention in ways that will reflect future content for the game. For streamers, it’s a boon, as the living world of online roleplay makes for easy hours filled with content for their followers. And even for the more casual, the silent observer who knows nothing about <em>World of Warcraft</em> or each content creator’s persona, the interpersonal drama is enough to keep them coming back for more.

</p>



<p>
	Throughout my time watching, I’ve lovingly called these streams “my soaps.” Like any good TV show or online trends, what OnlyFangs is doing comes with a dash of FOMO; you simply have to be there. The emergent roleplay aspects and big names may be replicated, but it won’t be the same. There’s a special kind of in-the-moment urgency that comes with seeing a livestream trend rise in real-time.</p>



<p>
	After all, it’s not every day you tune into Twitch for a public execution.</p>

</p><h2>The Ruby Community has lost one of its titans.</h2><p>
Noah Gibbs contributed to our community to <em>such a great an extent</em> in <em>so many different ways</em> in 
<strong>such a long period of time</strong>. It is a genuine challenge to sit down at a keyboard and capture a picture
of this wonderful person.
</p><p>However, I think it's important to take a few moments and give a testimony about someone 
who has meant so much to you. Why? Well, for the <strong>record</strong>. During my years of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxp2E0efspM">Ruby Archaeology</a> 
(via newsletter, talk, blog or conversation) I found it incredibly valuable to see what the community 
had to say <em>about someone</em> who they had lost. Ezra, Chris, Jason, _why, those impacted by them took 
time to share their story and impact on their lives. Here is mine.
</p><h2>Meeting Noah</h2><p>
I've looked up to Noah since I joined the community in 2014. He was "Ruby Famous" to me, and I very much enjoyed his talks, writing, books and posts.
</p><p>Flash forward to the 2020's, when we were coworkers. Thanks to a lot of work and luck I found myself on the Ruby &amp; Rails Infrastructure Team at Shopify. Not long after, Noah joined. He wasn't a stranger at this point.. We'd engaged a fair bit on social media over the years. But I was <em>thrilled</em> to have him on my team! Isn't that like, your dream?
</p><p>Our interactions got more and more frequent. Noah popped up in a virtual ScotRug meetup (I live in Belfast, Noah in Inverness). I was pitching a talk idea where I would delve into old Ruby code. Noah's encouragement and mentorship resulted in me giving this talk at Ruby Kaigi, Ruby Conf, and Rails Conf. It even inspired a sequel talk that was also given at Ruby Kaigi, Ruby Conf and Rails Conf. Our ensuing work together would inspire my talk in the slot just before Noah at Brighton Ruby on Desktop Ruby development.
</p><p>Isn't it amazing what a little bit of support or encouragement can do?
</p><h2>Working with Noah</h2><p>
Noah was a supreme joy to work with. I'm sure this surprises no one. Noah made me feel <em>proud</em> of myself! He left me feeling inspired, curious and excited for my craft. I would share something "cool" with him and he'd give me half a dozen interesting ideas I could jump into off of that idea. We could talk for hours.
</p><p>In the private team chat you could always rely on him for a good geek out session. We were OBSESSED with the winter and summer solstices and how long/short the days get in Inverness and Belfast. It's really bonkers. We loved a good whisky chat (and why not! we live in whisky central!)
</p><p>Noah could criticize something in good faith in a kind way. He wouldn't really, shy away, from a spicy opinion. But he never gave it in a way that made you feel bad about yourself. What I'm saying is he wasn't squishy! But he was also incredibly aware of others and their feelings and just the nuance of life that we always have to dance around.
</p><p>He always had joy for the craft. It never got old. For fun we once revisited the <a href="https://www.rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a> from Edgecase and I specifically recall
just how fired up he was about the silly little things a string can do in Ruby.
</p><h2>Scarpe</h2><p>
Noah, Marco Rudilosso and I founded the <a href="https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe">Scarpe</a> project in January 2022. The project was a simple idea: take a stab at getting feature parity with _why's Shoes.rb using Webview. Our thinking was Webview gives us the backend we want. Here's some HTML, now build it into multiple different packages for different platforms. So, how could we rebuild the Shoes DSL in _Ruby_ to push out raw HTML that would be fed to Webview?
</p><p>We made a decent amount of progress. In the end, Noah became the main engineering force. Although I am the maintainer, Noah (with full admin rights) doubled my commit count in the project. He also was the engineering architect behind most of our challenging work and decisions.
</p><p><img src="https://blog.schwad.org/assets/metrics-6fed81d3.png" width="500"></p><p>During our time on the team, Noah (essentially as the other half leading the project):
</p><ul><li>Helped facilitate weekly Scarpe meetings</li><li>Single handedly wrote our <a href="https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe/wiki">massive wiki</a> covering everything from Shoes history to reasoning behind our decisions.</li><li>Mentored multiple engineers who joined us as an official Google Summer of Code Ruby Project</li><li>All the while giving me the space as Maintainer to help set the vision and direction of the project, where he had every right to push me out</li><li>Invented the <a href="https://codefol.io/posts/introducing-spaceshoes/">SpaceShoes</a> prototype, which would let coders write Shoes Ruby code for the browser <strong>directly</strong> in their HTML.</li><li>Published a working fork of _why's music library <a href="https://github.com/scarpe-team/bloopsaphone">bloopsaphone</a>. &lt;-- This was needed for Shoes, but is its own independent library he helped save.</li><li>Implemented half a dozen new repos <a href="https://github.com/scarpe-team">around Scarpe</a>. This included implementations in GTK+ and WASM</li><li>Built <a href="https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe/blob/main/examples/highlander.rb">Highlander</a> which is without a doubt my favourite Shoes app <strong>of all time</strong></li></ul><p>I stepped back a bit from Scarpe in 2024 due to the birth of our first child. I am sad knowing that my future work on this project will be a little bit more lonely. Noah knew the codebase and history better than anyone alive. Our most recent chat in mid-October was him thanking me for finally turning off Rubocop. It's funny how much he disliked the linter! Which is fair enough - he had written Ruby in his own flair for years before standardized linting. Many of us have had lint beaten into our heads. I think I'll keep the linter out going forward.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_introduction"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_introduction" title="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The complex beauty of the world's most famous fractal, the Mandelbrot set,
emerges from the repeated iteration of a simple formula:</p>
<blockquote>\[z \to z^2 + c\]</blockquote>
<p>Zooming into the intricate boundary of the shape reveals ever more detail,
but one needs higher precision numbers and higher iteration counts as you
go deeper.  The computational cost rises quickly with the classical
rendering algorithms which use high precision numbers for each pixel.</p>
<p>In 2013, K.I. Martin's SuperFractalThing and accompanying white paper
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408070057/http://superfractalthing.co.nf/sft_maths.pdf" title="sft_maths.pdf">sft_maths.pdf</a>
popularized a pair of new acceleration techniques.  First one notes that
the formula \(z \to z^2 + c\) is continuous, so nearby points remain
nearby under iteration.  This means you can iterate one point at high
precision (the reference orbit) and compute differences from the reference
orbit for each pixel in low precision (the perturbed orbits).  Secondly,
iterating the perturbed formula one ends up with a polynomial series in
the initial pertubation in \(c\), which depends only on the reference.  The
degree rises rapidly but you can truncate it to get an approximation.
This means you can compute the series approximation coefficients once, and
substitute in the perturbed \(c\) values for each pixel, allowing you to
initialize the perturbed orbits at a later iteration, skipping potentially
lots of per-pixel work.</p>
<p>The perturbation technique has since been extended to the Burning Ship
fractal and other "abs variations", and it also works for hybrid fractals
combining iterations of several formulas.</p>
<p>Prerequisites for the rest of this article: a familiarity with complex
numbers and algebraic manipulation; knowing how to draw the unzoomed Mandelbrot
set; understanding the limitations of computer implementation of numbers
(see for example <a href="https://fractalwiki.org/wiki/Number_types#Hardware_floating_point_types">Hardware Floating Point Types</a>).</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_perturbation"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_perturbation" title="Perturbation">Perturbation</a></h3>
<p>In the remainder of this post, lower case and upper case variables with
the same letter mean different things.  Upper case means unperturbed or
reference, usually high precision or high range.  Lower case means perturbed
per pixel delta, low precision and low range.</p>
<p>In perturbation, on starts with the iteration formula <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_1" title="Equation 1">[1]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_1">\[Z \to Z^2 + C\]</blockquote>
<p>Perturb the variables with unevaluated sums <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_2" title="Equation 2">[2]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_2">\[(Z + z) \to (Z + z)^2 + (C + c)\]</blockquote>
<p>Do symbolic algebra to avoid the catastrophic absorption when adding tiny
values \(z\) to large values \(Z\) (e.g. 1 million plus 1 is still 1 million

\(c, z\) are the "pixel" orbit, you can do many of these near each reference

<p>There is a problem that can be noticed when you zoom deeper near certain
features in the fractal.  There are parts that can have a "noisy" appearance,
or there may be weird flat blobs that look out of place.  These are the
infamous perturbation glitches.  It was observed that adding references in
the glitches and recomputing the pixels could fix them, but there was no
reliable way to detect them programmatically until Pauldelbrot
discovered/invented a method:
<a href="http://www.fractalforums.com/announcements-and-news/pertubation-theory-glitches-improvement/msg73027/#msg73027" title="Perturbation Theory Glitches Improvement">Perturbation Theory Glitches Improvement</a>.</p>
<p>The solution: if <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_4" title="Equation 4">[4]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_4">\[|Z+z| &lt;&lt; |Z|\]</blockquote>
<p>at any iteration, then glitches can occur.  The solution: retry with a
new reference, or (for well-behaved formulas like the Mandelbrot set) rebase
to a new reference and carry on.</p>
<p>Perturbation assumes exact maths, but some images have glitches when
naively using perturbation in low precision.  Pauldelbrot found his glitch
criterion by perturbing the perturbation iterations: one has perturbed iteration
as in <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_3" title="Equation 3">[3]</a> (recap: \(z \to 2 Z z + z^2 + c\)).  Then one perturbs this with
\(z \to z + e, c \to c + f\) <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_5" title="Equation 5">[5]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_5">\[e \to (2 (Z + z) + e) e + f\]</blockquote>
<p>We are interested what happens to the ratio \(e/z\) under iteration, so
rewrite <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_3" title="Equation 3">[3]</a> as <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_6" title="Equation 6">[6]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_6">\[z \to (2 Z + z) z + c\]</blockquote>
<p>Pattern matching, the interesting part (assuming \(c\) and \(f\) are
small) of \(e/z\) is \(2(Z + z) / 2 Z\).  When \(e/z\) is small, the nearby
pixels "stick together" and there is not enough precision in the number
type to distinguish them, which makes a glitch.  So a glitch can be detected
when <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_7" title="Equation 7">[7]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_7">\[|Z + z|^2 &lt; G |Z|^2\]</blockquote>
<p>where G is a threshold (somewhere between 1e-2 and 1e-8, depending how
strict you want to be).  This does not add much cost, as \(|Z+z|^2\) already
needs to be computed for escape test, and \(G|Z^2|\) can be computed once
for each iteration of the reference orbit and stored.</p>
<p>The problem now is: How to choose G?  Too big and it takes forever as
glitches are detected all over, too small and some glitches can be missed
leading to bad images.</p>
<p>The glitched pixels can be recalculated with a more appropriate
reference point: more glitches may result and adding more references
may be necessary until the image is finished.</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_rescaling"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_rescaling" title="Rescaling">Rescaling</a></h3>
<p>Double precision floating point (with 53 bits of mantissa) is more than
enough for computing perturbed orbits: even single precision (with 24 bits)
can be used successfully.  But when zooming deeper another problem occurs:
double precision has a limited range, once values get smaller than about
1e-308 then they underflow to 0.  This means perturbation with double
precision can only zoom so far, as eventually the perturbed deltas are
smaller than can be represented.</p>
<p>An early technique for extending range is to store the mantissa as a
double precision value, but normalized to be near 1 in magnitude, with
a separate integer to store the exponent.  This floatexp technique works
for arbitrarily deep zooms, but the performance is terrible because it
needs to handle every arithmetic operation in software (instead of them
being a single CPU instruction).</p>
<p>The solution for efficient performance turned out to be using an
unevaluated product (compare with the unevaluated sum of perturbation)
to rescale the double precision iterations to be nearer 1 and avoid
underflow: substitute \(z = S w\) and \(c = S d\) to get <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_8" title="Equation 8">[8]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_8">\[S w \to 2 Z S w + S^2 w^2 + S d\]</blockquote>
<p>and now cancel out one scale factor \(S\) throughout <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_9" title="Equation 9">[9]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_9">\[w \to 2 Z w + S w^2 + d\]</blockquote>
<p>Choose \(S\) so that \(|w|\) is around \(1\).  When \(|w|\) is at risk
of overflow (or underflow) after some iterations, redo the scaling; this
is typically a few hundred iterations as \(|Z|\) is bounded by \(2\) except
at final escape.</p>
<p>Optimization: if \(S\) underflowed to \(0\) in double precision, you
don't need to calculate the \(+ S w^2\) term at all when \(Z\) is not small.
Similarly you can skip the \(+ d\) if it underflowed.  For higher powers
there will be terms involving \(S^2 w^3\) (for example), which might not
need to be calculated either due to underflow.  Ideally these tests would
be performed once at rescaling time, instead of in every inner loop iteration
(though they would be highly predictable I suppose).</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_full_iterations"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_full_iterations" title="Full Iterations">Full Iterations</a></h3>
<p>There is a problem: if \(|Z|\) is very small, it can underflow to \(0\)
in unscaled double in <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_9" title="Equation 9">[9]</a>.  One needs to store the full range \(Z\) and
do a full range (e.g. floatexp) iteration at those points, because \(|w|\)
can change dramatically.  Rescaling is necessary afterwards.  This was
described by Pauldelbrot:
<a href="https://fractalforums.org/programming/11/memory-bandwidth-trade-offs-for-perturbation-rendering/3717/msg23497#msg23497" title="Rescaled Iterations in Nanoscope">Rescaled Iterations in Nanoscope</a>.</p>
<p>To do the full iteration, compute \(z = S w\) in floatexp (using a floatexp
for \(S\) so that there is no underflow), do the perturbed iteration <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_3" title="Equation 3">[3]</a> with
all variables in floatexp.  To rescale afterwards, compute \(S = |z|\) and
\(w = z/S, d = c/S\) (computed in floatexp with \(w\) and \(d\) rounded to
double precision afterwards).  Then a double precision \(s\) can be computed
for use in <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_9" title="Equation 9">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>when \(d\) is small the \(\pm d\) cases are much more likely.  With rescaling
in the mix <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_11" title="Equation 11">[11]</a> works out as <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_13" title="Equation 13">[13]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_13">\[\operatorname{diffabs}(XY/s, Xy + xY + sxy)\]</blockquote>
<p>which has the risk of overflow when \(s\) is small, but the signs work
out ok even for infinite \(c\) as \(d\) is known to be finite.  Moreover,
if \(s = 0\) due to underflow, the \(\pm d\) branches will always be taken
(except when \(XY\) is small, when a full floatexp iteration will be performed
instead), and as \(s \ge 0\) by construction, <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_13" title="Equation 13">[13]</a> reduces to <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_14" title="Equation 14">[14]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_14">\[\operatorname{sign}(X) * \operatorname{sign}(Y) * (X y + x Y)\]</blockquote>
<p>(Note: this formulation helps avoid underflow in \(\operatorname{sign}(XY)\)
when \(X\) and \(Y\) are small.)</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_deep_needle"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_deep_needle" title="Deep Needle">Deep Needle</a></h3>
<p>For well-behaved functions like the Mandelbrot set iterations, one needs
to do full iterations when \(Z\) gets small.  For the Burning Ship and other
abs variations, this is not sufficient: problems occur if either X and Y are
small, not only when both are small at the same time.  Full iterations need
to be done when either variable is small.  This makes rescaled iterations for
locations near the needle slower than just doing full floatexp iterations
all the time (because of the extra wasted work handling the rescaling).
This is because near the needle all the iterations have Y near 0, which means
floatexp iterations will be done anyway.  Using floatexp from the get go avoids
many branches and rescaling in the inner loop, so it's significantly faster.
The problem is worse in single precision because it has much less range: it
underflows below 1e-38 or so, rather than 1e-308 for double precision.</p>
<p>The problem of automatically detecting these "deep needle" locations (which
may be in the needles of miniships) and switching implementations to avoid the
extra slowdown remains unresolved in KF.</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_hybrid_fractals"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_hybrid_fractals" title="Hybrid Fractals">Hybrid Fractals</a></h3>
<p>The Mandelbrot set has lovely logarithmic spirals all over, and the
Burning Ship has interesting "rigging" on the miniships on its needle.
Hybridization provide a way to get both these features in a single
fractal image.  The basic idea is to interleave the iteration formulas,
for example alternating between <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_1" title="Equation 1">[1]</a> and <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_10" title="Equation 10">[10]</a>, but more complicated
interleavings are possible (eg <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_1" title="Equation 1">[1]</a><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_10" title="Equation 10">[10]</a><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_1" title="Equation 1">[1]</a><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_1" title="Equation 1">[1]</a> in a loop, etc).</p>
<p>Hybrid fractals in KF are built from stanzas, each has some lines, each
line has two operators, and each operator has controls for absolute x,
absolute y, negate x, negate y, integer power \(p\), complex multiplier \(a\).
The two operators in a line can be combined by addition, subtraction or multiplication,
and currently the number of lines in a stanza can be either 1 or 2 and
there can be 1, 2, 3 or 4 stanzas. The output of each line is fed into
the next, and at the end of each stanza the +c part of the formula happens.
There are controls to choose how many times to repeat each stanza, and which
stanza to continue from after reaching the end.</p>
<p>Implementing perturbation for this is quite methodical.  Start from an
operator, with inputs \(Z\) and \(z\).  Set mutable variables:</p>
<blockquote><pre>z := input
W := Z + z
B := Z</pre></blockquote>
<p>If absolute x enabled in formula, then update</p>
<blockquote><pre>re(z) := diffabs(re(Z), re(z))
re(W) := abs(W)
re(B) := abs(B)</pre></blockquote>
<p>Similarly for the imaginary part.  If negate x enabled in formula, then update</p>
<blockquote><pre>re(z) := -re(z)
W := -W
B := -B</pre></blockquote>
<p>Similarly for the imaginary part. Now compute</p>
<blockquote>\[S = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} W^i B^{p-1 - i}\]</blockquote>
<p>and return \(a z S\).  Combining operators into lines may be done by
<a href="https://mathr.co.uk/blog/2018-03-12_perturbation_algebra.html" title="Perturbation Algebra">Perturbation Algebra</a>.
Combining lines into stanzas can be done by iterating unperturbed \(Z\)
alongside perturbed \(z\); only the \(+C\) needs high precision, and that
is not done within a stanza.</p>
<p>Rescaling hybrid iterations seems like a big challenge, but it's not that hard:
if either or both the real and imaginary parts of the reference orbit \(Z\)
are small, one needs to do a full range iteration with floatexp and recalculate
the scale factor afterwards, as with formulas like Burning Ship.  Otherwise,
thread \(s\) through from the top level down to the operators.  Initialize with</p>
<blockquote><pre>W := Z + z*s</pre></blockquote>
<p>and modify the absolute cases to divide the reference by \(s\):</p>
<blockquote><pre>re(z) := diffabs(re(Z/s), re(z))</pre></blockquote>
<p>Similarly for imaginary part.  When combining operators (this subterm only
occurs with multiplication) replace \(f(o_1, Z + z)\) with \(f(o_1, Z + z s)\).</p>
<p>And that's almost all the changes that need to be made!</p>
<p>For distance estimation of hybrid formulas I use dual numbers for
automatic differentiation.  One small adjustment was needed for it to work
with rescaled iterations: instead of initializing the dual parts (before
iteration) with 1 and scaling by the pixel spacing at the end for screen-space
colouring, initialize the dual parts with the pixel spacing and don't scale
at the end.  This avoids overflow of the derivative, and the same rescaling
factor can be used for regular and dual parts.</p>

<p>Naive implementations of parametric hybrids are very slow due to all
the branches in the inner loops (checking if absolute x enabled at every
iteration for every pixel, etc).  Using for example OpenCL, these branches can
be done once when generating source code for a formula, instead of every
iteration for every pixel.  This runs much faster, even when compiled
to run on the same OpenCL device that is interpreting the parametric code.</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_series_approximation"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_series_approximation" title="Series Approximation">Series Approximation</a></h3>
<p>The other part of the thing that K I Martin's SuperFractalThing popularized
was that iteration of <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_3" title="Equation 3">[3]</a> gives a polynomial series in \(c\) <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_15" title="Equation 15">[15]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_15">\[z_n = \sum A_{n,k} c^k\]</blockquote>
<p>(with 0 constant term). This can be used to "skip" a whole bunch of
iterations, assuming that truncating the series and/or low precision
doesn't cause too much trouble.  Substituting <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_15" title="Equation 15">[15]</a> into <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_3" title="Equation 3">[3]</a> gives <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_16" title="Equation 16">[16]</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_16">\[\sum A_{n+1,k} c^k = 2 Z \sum A_{n,k} c^k + (\sum A_{n,k} c^k)^2 + c\]</blockquote>
<p>Equating coefficients of \(c^k\) gives recurrence relations for the
series coefficients \(A_{n,k}\).  See <a href="https://mathr.co.uk/blog/2016-03-06_simpler_series_approximation.html" title="Simpler Series Approximation">Simpler Series Approximation</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional way to evaluate that it's ok to do the series approximation
at an iteration is to check whether it doesn't deviate too far from regular
iterations (or perturbed iterations) at a collection of "probe" points.
When it starts to deviate, roll back an iteration and initialize all the
image pixels with <a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_15" title="Equation 15">[15]</a> at that iteration.</p>
<p>Later, knighty extended the series approximation to two complex variables.
If the reference \(C\) is a periodic point (for example the center of a
minibrot), the biseries in \(z, c\) allows skipping a whole period of
iterations.  Then multiple periods can be skipped by repeating the biseries
step.  This gives a further big speedup beyond regular series approximation
near minibrots.  An escape radius is needed for \(z\), based on properties
of the reference, so as not to perform too many biseries iterations.  After
that, regular perturbed iterations are performed until final escape.  This
is available in KF as NanoMB1.</p>
<p>Current research by knighty and others involves a chain of minibrots
at successively deeper zoom levels.  One starts with the deepest minibrot,
performing biseries iterations until it escapes its \(z\) radius.  Then
rebase the iterates to the next outer minibrot, and perform biseries
iterations with that.  Repeat until final escape.  This is available in
KF as NanoMB2, but it's highly experimental and fails for many locations.
Perhaps it needs to be combined with more perturbation or higher precision:
sometimes the iterates may still be too close to each other when they
escape a deep minibrot, such that catastrophic absorption occurs.
In progress...</p>
<p>For Burning Ship and other abs variations (and presumably hybrids too),
series approximation can take the form of two bivariate real series in
\(\Re(c)\) and \(\Im(c)\) for the real and imaginary parts of \(z\).  But
these are only good so long as the region is not folded by an absolute
value, so typically only a few iterations can be skipped.  Maybe the series
can be split into two (or more) parts with the other side(s) shifted when
this occurs?  In progress...</p>

<h3 id="a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_conclusion"><a href="#a2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice_conclusion" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Perturbation techniques that greatly reduce the quantity of high precision
iterations needed, as well as (for well-behaved formulas) series approximation
techniques that reduce the quantity of low precision iterations needed still
further, provide a vast speedup over classical algorithms that use high
precision for every pixel.  Rescaling can provide an additional constant factor
speedup over using full range floatexp number types for most (not "deep needle")
locations.  Chained biseries approximation ("NanoMB2") and series approximation
for abs variations and hybrids are still topics of research.</p>
<p>It remains open how to choose the \(G\) for Pauldelbrot's glitch detection
criterion, and how to robustly compute series approximation skipping: there
is still no complete mathematical proof of correctness with rigourous error
bounds, although the images do most often look plausible and different
implementations do tend to agree.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>System76 built their first workstation-class Arm PC, the <a href="https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra-a1-n1/configure">Thelio Astra</a>, and it's marketed for <a href="https://system76.com/autonomous-vehicles">streamlined autonomous vehicle development</a>.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-hero.jpeg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Hero with Launch Keyboard"></p>

<p>But I'm not an automotive developer, just someone who enjoys Linux, Arm, and computing. So I was excited to spend a few weeks (which turned into a few <em>months</em>) testing the latest Ampere-based computer to come to market.</p>

<p>I initially ran my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/53">gauntlet of tests</a> under Ubuntu 24.04 (the OS this workstation ships with), but after discovering System76 dropped in ASRock Rack's <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asrock-rack-tpm-spi/p/N82E16816775069">TPM 2.0 module</a>, I switched tracks and installed Windows 11—which went without a hitch!</p>

<p>With that, I spent some time comparing this workstation to the current 'best of breed' Windows on Arm PC, the models based on Snapdragon's X Elite chips. And this thing <em>wipes the floor</em>.</p>

<h2>Hardware - Ampere Altra (Max)</h2>

<p>But before we get into Linux, Windows, benchmark results, and why I'm not running Pop!_OS, we should discuss the hardware.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-rear.jpg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Rear"></p>

<p>The base model costs $3,299—which is in line with most x86 workstation-class PCs, at least in the Threadripper and Xeon W range. That'll get you a 64-core CPU, 64GB of ECC RAM, 500 GB of NVMe storage, an Nvidia RTX A400 Workstation GPU, and dual 10 GbE Ethernet.</p>

<p>But the configuration System76 sent me for review had some upgrades:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ampere Altra Max M128-30 CPU (128 Neoverse N1 CPU cores at 3.00 GHz)</li>
<li>512 GB ECC DDR4 RAM</li>
<li>1TB NVMe SSD</li>
<li>Dual 25 GbE Ethernet (on-motherboard, Broadcom NIC)</li>
<li>ASRock Rack TPM 2.0 module</li>
</ul>

<p>This upgraded configuration costs around $7,000—which is the <em>starting price</em> of an M2 Ultra Mac Pro workstation.</p>

<p>Note that you can buy every part of this system—aside from System76's case and support—from a retailer like NewEgg (e.g. <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asrock-rack-altrad8ud-1l2t-q64-22-ampere-altra-max-ampere-altra-processors/p/N82E16813140135">the motherboard + CPU combo</a> for $2349) should you wish to build a custom arm64 workstation PC.</p>

<p>Everything is built into System76's Thelio case, which is very solid sheet metal with a design similar to the Mac Pro, where the entire shell slides over the top, revealing the chassis within:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-inside-cooling.jpg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Open Inside Cooling Zones"></p>

<p>There are three distinct cooling zones—and despite having no mesh or holes in the front (it's a solid facade), there is enough airflow for HEDT-class performance. The top contains a custom metal shroud to guide airflow through the <a href="https://amzn.to/3WrVQ7l">Arctic Freezer 4U-M CPU cooler</a>, directing it's airflow over the RAM and motherboard power regulators to an exhaust fan in the back.</p>

<p>The middle section has a wide metal fan bracket which provides a ton of intake for GPUs and other PCIe devices.</p>

<p>The bottom has an additional 140mm intake fan to pull air up to the GPU area and motherboard, as well as the power supply, drawing air from the bottom.</p>

<p>The result is an elegant, if heavy, case, that maximizes airflow while keeping the system <em>very</em> quiet. During long HPL and Cinebench runs, the noise only rose to a low 40 dB range, and with 140mm and 120mm fans, the sound was not unpleasant.</p>

<p>The default fan curve keeps the CPU down to around 60°C fully loaded, so there's even wiggle room if you wanted to adjust it. It should be noted my initial review unit had a bug in the BIOS which resulted in the fan curve not being applied—so my first tests were literally cooking the CPU to thermal limits!</p>

<p>I saw it hit 99°C a few times, with the CPU pulling 250W, and entire system power draw at 450W, then the system would hard lock up until I pulled power!</p>

<p>Luckily, a firmware update fixed that issue universally, and the proper installation of a <code>system76</code> background daemon allowed me to tweak things further.</p>

<p>There are three aspects of the case design I do <em>not</em> like, however:</p>

<ol>
<li>The custom case design includes screwless PCIe slot covers—however, these covers are a bit loose, and besides rattling when transporting the computer, they are prone to popping out whenever you loosen the retention bracket that holds PCIe cards in place. Which is highly annoying when adding or replacing cards in the 4 x16 card slots!</li>
<li>There is no front IO with the current Astra design—and only four USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports on the rear. So in my use, I needed a USB hub (the first time I've had to use one in a while!). It would be nice to have some front panel IO, even if only one or two USB-C ports.</li>
<li>Unlike the Mac Pro, this case has no handles, and the front edge is flush with the surface it's resting on. This can make picking it up, moving it around, and removing the top case a little awkward. It's not a huge deal, but I <em>do</em> love Apple's case design in that regard, considering you might want to put one of these on wheels and move it around a bit.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Linux (and no Pop!_OS... yet)</h2>

<p>The primary reason someone would buy this thing is for automotive development. Since most cars and infotainment systems run on Arm chips, building software with an Arm workstation makes sense—it's a lot faster compiling Arm software and running tests on it natively on a monster Arm CPU than even the fastest AMD or Intel CPU with emulation.</p>

<p>The nice thing about System76 selling this machine is you get their excellent support (you can choose from 1-3 years of support at purchase). This is a huge boon to businesses who elect to run open source software, because they get a fully-supported hardware configuration instead of having to figure out compatibility themselves.</p>

<p>And System76 builds Pop!_OS (and a new COSMIC desktop environment), which is meant to ease the adoption of Linux for desktop use... unfortunately, Pop!_OS is not yet fully supported on arm64.</p>

<p>In lieu of that, System76 is shipping Ubuntu 24.04 (or 22.04, your choice), which has great support for Ampere CPUs already, and in my experience, is the easiest Linux distribution to run when working on various hardware configurations. Arm64 driver compatibility is excellent with most anything made in the last 5-10 years, including graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia!</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>To see <em>all</em> my benchmark data, see my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/53">GitHub issue on the Thelio Astra</a>. But here are a few selected benchmarks I'd like to highlight:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-benchmark-hpl.png" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - HPL Benchmark Results"></p>

<p>Besides the 192-core AmpereOne, which <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/ampereone-cores-are-new-mhz">I reviewed late last year</a>, no other Arm machine comes close to the overall performance of Ampere's Altra Max—at least as far as multi-core is concerned.</p>

<p>Single-core, the Neoverse N1 cores are getting long in the tooth, but still faster than any of the common SBC cores (like the A76 and A78).</p>

<p>But multi-core, the Thelio Astra takes advantage of all eight DDR4 memory channels available on an Ampere Altra Max CPU, and propels it past the previous champ, the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/testing-96-core-ampere-altra-developer-platform">Adlink Dev Workstation</a>. That machine was limited to 6 memory channels, though it <em>did</em> have a bit more panache, courtesy of built-in RGB fans :)</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-benchmark-linux.png" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Linux Timed Compile Benchmark Results"></p>

<p>I benchmarked a number of things with Phoronix Test Suite, and above are some results for the timed Linux compilation benchmark. This machine obviously scores worse than the AmpereOne, but I left in the fastest current Arm SBC I own (an Orange Pi 5 Max), to show the massive difference you get with 128 cores and enough high-speed memory to feed them.</p>

<p>Eagle-eyed readers will note I have not shown any Threadripper or EPYC results, nor anything x86 at all! That's because core-for-core, x86 dominates on many, if not most, benchmarks, especially current-generation core designs like Zen 5. The Ampere Altra is now 5 years old, and though it still has some fight in it, it can't keep up with 'the big boys'.</p>

<p>That is, unless we <em>change the rules of the game</em>...</p>

<h2>Windows on Arm and a Cinebench 2024 WR</h2>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-benchmark-cinebench.png" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Cinebench 2024 Benchmark Results"></p>

<p>Being the fastest Arm PC means it <em>of course</em> obliterates the fastest Mac Pro money can buy—to say nothing of the puny Snapdragon X Elite I tested in the very-short-lived Dev Kit last year.</p>

<p>But this system is <em>also</em> unofficially the fastest 128-core system on the planet, running Cinebench 2024. At least <a href="https://hwbot.org/benchmark/cinebench_-_2024/rankings?cores=128&amp;hardwareType=cpu">according to HWBot.org</a>.</p>

<p>I've been <a href="https://community.hwbot.org/topic/40155-please-add-other-hardware-thread/page/40/#findComment-684073">attempting to submit a result of <code>5003 cb</code></a>, but am stymied by a technicality: The Ampere Altra Max is apparently too exotic to exist in most Windows PC hardware databases, so submissions aren't able to be made!</p>

<p>I've been in contact with the authors of CPU-Z, and am hopeful we can get more results for high-end Arm chips into HWBot soon. We'll see!</p>

<p>It is a bit difficult to overclock these chips, but I <em>can</em> coax a little more performance out of them by cooling them better. I was able to increase the score consistently by 2-3% running the fans at 100%... one wonders if more gains could be had!</p>

<p>But I'm burying the lede—full Windows 11 is running on this machine. And not like "spend 6 hours patching things together to get Windows running", but <em>download ISO, plug in USB stick, and install</em>.</p>

<p>It's been possible to install Windows on Arm to earlier Ampere Altra systems, but a <a href="https://github.com/AmpereComputing/Windows-11-On-Ampere">rather annoying process involving UUP Dump was required</a>. Now that Microsoft is <em>finally</em> publishing a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11arm64">Windows 11 arm64 ISO</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AmpereComputing/Windows-11-On-Ampere/issues/6">the process has become much easier</a>.</p>

<p>And x86 software that runs in Windows' emulation mode is still limited to using only 64 CPU cores, but native arm64 versions can address all 128 cores on the Ampere Altra Max. Cinebench 2024 had a bug where it would still only address 64 cores on the Arm version, but that has since been fixed:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-cinebench-all-core.jpg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Cinebench 2024 multi 128 core task manager"></p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>If Windows can run, what about the vast library of software Microsoft's been touting as native on Arm, like on their new AI Copilot+ PCs?</p>

<p>Well, I loaded up a number of apps, and Photoshop worked great right away:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-windows-photoshop.jpg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Photoshop running on Windows"></p>

<p>Everything ran well, including new AI features like generative AI fill, AI-assisted remove and background isolation tools, etc. It was smooth enough I couldn't really tell a difference from working on my M1 Max Mac Studio (where I normally do work on YouTube thumbnails and graphics for videos).</p>

<p>But I quickly ran into issues launching other applications...</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-windows-arm-davinci-opengl.jpg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - OpenGL not found in Davinci Resolve"></p>

<p>The problem is, any app that requires GPU support or OpenGL has trouble, because even though <em>from what I've heard</em> Nvidia has working Arm drivers for Windows... none have been released publicly. So no matter what GPU you try, you can't get any kind of graphics acceleration working in Windows.</p>

<p>ASPEED's little BMC chip has a built-in VGA controller, and they even have a Windows Arm driver for it... but despite its best effort, it has no 3D graphics rendering capabilities or GPU compute!</p>

<p>In the video embedded later, I also demonstrated running Minecraft and Crysis Remastered in Windows, but both rely on CPU rendering, which is... just not ideal at all. You could play both games if you enjoy powerpoint-presentation-style gameplay.</p>

<h2>Linux Gaming with Steam, Proton, and Box86</h2>

<p>Luckily, switching back to Linux solves that issue. Games not only run with 3D acceleration, they run <em>smoothly</em>.</p>

<p>Crysis Remastered rendered out smoothly in 'Can It Run Crysis?' mode, Halo 3 ran just as smooth as an Xbox 360, and Doom Eternal—with Ray Tracing enabled—ran well enough to be playable, though the older workstation A4000 GPU I was testing it with is <em>not</em> meant for gaming by any stretch.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/system76-thelio-astra-doom-eternal-gpu-steam.jpg" alt="System76 Thelio Astra - Doom Eternal on Steam with Proton and Box86"></p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a gaming machine. But I was able to install Box86/Box64 and Steam using <a href="https://pi-apps.io/">Pi-Apps</a> (it's literally one click to get Steam installed!), and then I could play a number of games; almost anything that runs through Proton can play on arm64 nowadays, and <a href="https://box86.org/2024/12/new-version-of-box64-v0-3-2-and-box86-v0-3-8/">Box32 is now trying to fill the gap</a> with more modern Linux distros which are dropping support for 32-bit packages!</p>

<h2>Quirks and Downsides</h2>

<p>To paint a complete picture of the experience running System76's first arm64 desktop, I also have to run through some of the quirks inherent to the hardware design, and to running Ampere's silicon:</p>

<ul>
<li>Video card support for arm64 is still not perfect; <code>nouveau</code> <em>really</em> has issues, depending on kernel version and card, and even Nvidia's proprietary drivers can cause weird issues, like a blank screen with just a mouse cursor, or an invisible second display, and debugging these problems can become challenging, since the ASPEED BMC also supplies a built-in VGA display... which can sometimes confuse both Windows and Linux when you're sorting out driver issues!</li>
<li>AMD GPUs have a text artifacting bug that requires a patch to the <code>amdgpu</code> driver to fix. It didn't seem to break my experience using the machine, but it's just another quirk to deal with on arm64.</li>
<li>There are still very few people running arm64 in a 'professional' manner like through this workstation. So you often have to convince people that <em>yes</em>, you're using arm64, but <em>no</em>, you're not dealing with a puny SBC like a Raspberry Pi. It leads to some interesting support tickets, though, especially for Windows devs who were led to believe Snapdragon is the penultimate Windows on Arm processor :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Video and more</h2>

<p>If this blog post wasn't enough, I have a full video where I go even more in depth, and give a better idea of how well games and applications run under both Linux and Windows. I also go into more detail on my GPU upgrades and some of the random bugs I ran into (and how I resolved them with System76's help). You can watch it here:</p>

</div>

<p>Thank you to System76 and Ampere for providing the hardware and supporting my three months of testing, leading up to this review. And thank you to Micro Center for providing two workstation graphics cards for more testing.</p>

<p>System76 also recently sent over an Nvidia RTX 4080 Super, and I will be installing that and trying to resolve some lingering issues with Blender and Steam.</p>

<p>My biggest takeaway: <em>Microsoft is missing out on a lotta fun.</em> They need to convince their hardware partners to start supporting Arm64, if they want any chance at catching up to Linux for arm64.</p>

<time datetime="2025-01-03T00:00:00.000Z"> Jan 3, 2025 </time>  </p> </div>  <p>Since the beginning of Val Town, our users have been clamouring for the state-of-the-art <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> code generation experience. When we launched our code hosting service in 2022, the state-of-the-art was GitHub Copilot. But soon it was ChatGPT, then Claude Artifacts, and now <a href="https://bolt.new/">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, and <a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a>. We’ve been trying our best to keep up. Looking back over 2024, our efforts have mostly been a series of <em>fast-follows</em>, copying the innovation of others. Some have been successful, and others false-starts. This article is a historical account of our efforts, giving credit where it is due.</p>
<h3 id="github-copilot-completions"><a href="#github-copilot-completions">GitHub Copilot Completions</a></h3>
<p>The story starts, of course, with GitHub Copilot. From day 1, Val Town users asked for a GitHub-Copilot-like completions experience.</p>
<p>We were wary of building this ourselves, but one day we stumbled upon Asad Memon’s <a href="https://github.com/asadm/codemirror-copilot">codemirror-copilot</a>, and hooked it up. That gave us our first taste of LLM-driven autocomplete, but behind the scenes, it was using ChatGPT. The prompt essentially asked ChatGPT to cosplay as an autocomplete service and fill in the text at the user’s cursor. So it was fairly slow, occasionally the model would forget its role and do something unexpected, and it didn’t have the accuracy of a purpose-built autocomplete model.</p>
<p>We wanted a faster, more accurate autocomplete sytem, one that used a model trained for the task - which is technically called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14255">‘Fill in the Middle’</a>. Finding an option that we could use within a product like Val Town was tricky – Copilot and most of its competitors lack documented or open APIs. But <a href="https://codeium.com/">Codeium</a> did, and they also had very good accuracy and performance. We <a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-newsletter-16/#-codeium-completions">launched Codeium completions</a> in April 2024 and open-sourced our <a href="https://github.com/val-town/codemirror-codeium">codemirror-codeium</a> component. It’s been pretty great. It’s enabled by default for new users.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.val.town/_astro/codeium.DmWVlUN2_ZSR3s9.webp" alt="Codeium" width="903" height="324" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h3 id="chatgpt"><a href="#chatgpt">ChatGPT</a></h3>
<p>Then came ChatGPT. We found our users asking it to write Val Town code, and copying and pasting it back into Val Town. We figured we could automate that process for our users: provide an interface with a pre-filled system prompt and a one-click way to save the generated code as a val. The <a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-newsletter-18/#-townie">first version of Townie</a> was born: a simple chat interface, very much inspired by ChatGPT, powered by GPT-3.5.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.val.town/_astro/townie.B_9WgDMi_Z1eUctW.webp" alt="Townie" width="2310" height="2012" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>It was just ok. It didn’t get much use, mostly because it was hard to iterate on its results. Getting good results from an LLM usually requires a conversation because programming-via-English is pretty imprecise, and you need follow-up requests to clarify your needs.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-tool-use"><a href="#chatgpt-tool-use">ChatGPT Tool Use</a></h3>
<p>Earlier this year, ChatGPT Function Calling, now called ‘tool-use’, was seen as the next big thing. The promise was that with a good OpenAPI spec, AI would be able to do just about anything on Val Town. So we dutifully cleaned up our OpenAPI spec, and <a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/openapi/#our-ai-townie-can-now-call-our-rest-api">rebuilt Townie around it</a>.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="420" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/clj1prZunW0?si=O7l6qvW8B2OB79NT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>It was, ahem, fine. Function calling was a disappointment. You do all the work to provide the LLM with a strict definition of what functions it can call and with which arguments. But even with all of that, the LLM would hallucinate functions that didn’t exist. Function calling has improved since, with the introduction of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#structured-outputs">Structured Outputs</a>.</p>
<p>But for us, the issue was that the interface was too generic. In theory, it was capable of doing anything (editing your blobs or sqlite data), but it wasn’t very useful at any specific thing. Most notably, it wasn’t a good interface for iterating on code. It could write a first version of code, but it wasn’t optimized to let you run that code, see the output, debug it, let you ask the AI for more help. In other words, the feedback loop was bad.</p>
<h3 id="claude-artifacts"><a href="#claude-artifacts">Claude Artifacts</a></h3>
<p>We had begun to see the potential of Claude for code generation with the amazing results produced by <a href="https://websim.ai/">Websim</a>. But it was the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet">launch of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude Artifacts</a> that really got our attention. Claude 3.5
Sonnet was dramatically better at generating code than anything we’d seen before. It blew all of our minds. And Claude Artifacts solved the tight feedback loop problem that we saw with our ChatGPT tool-use version. And thus after about a month of prototyping and building, the <a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/codegen/">current version of Townie</a> was born in August 2024.</p>
<p>For a couple weeks there, it felt like we had one of the best tools in the space. Townie can generate a fullstack app, with a frontend, backend, and database, in minutes, and fully deployed. The space has since gotten crowded. Live by the fast follow; die by the fast follow.</p>
<h3 id="our-contributions"><a href="#our-contributions">Our Contributions</a></h3>
<p>While we were out in front, we invested in trying to stay there, and we made some contributions of our own that have since found there way into other tools in the space.</p>
<h4 id="speed"><a href="#speed">Speed</a></h4>
<p>The biggest problem with all current codegen systems is the speed of generation. It takes minutes to generate just a couple hundred lines of code. If you regenerate the whole file every time – which is how most systems work – that means minutes between every feedback loop. (Not to mention the cost of regenerating the whole file every time, even when you are making a small change.)</p>
<p>We worked hard to get the LLM producing diffs, based on <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/unified-diffs.html">work we saw in Aider</a>. We were able to get it working most of the time, but not reliably enough. It’s now off by default, but you can ask Townie to “reply in diff” if you’d like to try your luck with it.</p>
<p>Our system prompt has always been open (you can view it in your Townie settings), so you can see how we’re doing that. Here’s the relevant section:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="md"><code><div><p><span>Follow the requirements above and respond by generating code in a format based on whether or not the user explicitly requests diff format in their most recent prompt:</span></p></div><div><p><span>-</span><span> If the user does not explicitly request diff format in their prompt, generate the entire val:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>Use &lt;</span><span>existing_code</span><span>&gt; as the basis for generating code if it is provided.</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>Write code that is complete and directly runnable.</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>DO NOT omit code or use comments such as "more content here" or "code remains unchanged."</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>Write the code in `val code fences.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Include the val type as metadata on the code fence, e.g.: `val type=script</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>If this is a new val, decide what val type is appropriate based on the user's prompt. Default to choosing http type vals unless the user has requested specific functionality that requires a different type.</span></p></div><div><p><span>-</span><span> If the user requests diff format in their prompt, follow these steps:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>Write a valid unified diff with change hunk headers. The file headers can be omitted.</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>Base the diff off of the &lt;</span><span>existing_code</span><span>&gt; tags below.</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>Use the ```diff language code fence.</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>We’ve gotten scared off of investing more time in diffs right now, but I expect it may have been solved by others in the space already, or will be shortly. Anthropic’s long-rumored “fast-edit mode” solve this problem in one fell swoop. OpenAI launched their own <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/predicted-outputs">Predicted Outputs</a>, which is also compelling, but then we’d have to switch to OpenAI. Or maybe the solution is simply faster models, smaller, mini-models, or faster chips, like Groq or Cerebras. A couple weeks ago I built <a href="https://cerebrascoder.com/">Cerebras Coder</a> to demonstrate how powerful an instant feedback loop is for code generation. <a href="https://cerebrascoder.com/">Try it out yourself</a> or <a href="https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/cerebras_coder">fork it here</a>.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://blog.val.town/video/cerebras-coder.mp4"></video>
<p>DeepSeek <a href="https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1872242657348710721">recently open-sourced an almost-Sonnet-3.5-level model that’s twice as fast and trained for only $6m</a>. A boy can dream of a world where Sonnet-3.5-level codegen (or even smarter!) is available on a chip like Cerebras at a fraction of Anthropic’s cost. I think that would unleash a whole new class of innovation here.</p>
<h4 id="autodetecting-errors"><a href="#autodetecting-errors">Autodetecting errors</a></h4>
<p>We did contribute one possibly-novel UI interaction, where the LLM automatically detects errors and asks you if you’d like it to try to solve them. We detect server-side errors by polling our backend for 500 errors in your logs. We detect client-side errors in the iframe by prompting Townie to import <a href="https://www.val.town/v/std/catch">this client-side library</a>, which pushes errors up to the parent window.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://blog.val.town/video/TownieErrorDetection.mp4"></video>
<p>It’s not <em>particularly</em> novel (in that others would have thought of this if we didn’t), but maybe the folks at <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9949260-try-fixing-with-claude-for-artifact-errors">Anthropic</a> or Bolt saw our implementation and it inspired their own. I’d like to think we’re not <em>only</em> free-riding in this space.</p>
<h3 id="hosted-runtime-and-included-apis"><a href="#hosted-runtime-and-included-apis">Hosted runtime and included APIs</a></h3>
<p>Maybe some of our UI ideas made it into GitHub Spark too, including deployment-free hosting, persistent data storage, and the ability to use LLMs in your apps without a your own API key – their versions of <a href="https://docs.val.town/std/sqlite/">@std/sqlite</a> and <a href="https://docs.val.town/std/openai/">@std/openai</a>, respectively. In other words, you can say, “make me a ChatGPT clone with persistent thread history”, and in about 30 seconds, you’ll have a deployed app that does exactly that.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://blog.val.town/video/TownieChatGPTClone.mp4"></video>
<p>But we’re not the first hosting company to provide an LLM tool; that
honor likely goes to Vercel’s <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cursor"><a href="#cursor">Cursor</a></h3>
<p>The next big thing was <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>. I must admit that I never personally fell in love with it, but given how many people I respect love it, I think that’s a me-problem. I think Cursor is best for development in larger codebases, but recently my work has been on making vals in Val Town which are usually under 1,000 lines of code. (Our upcoming launch of multi-file Projects, now in private beta, will change this.) However Cursor is a real pioneer in the space, and has some UI interactions there that we have an eye to copy.</p>
<h3 id="windsurf"><a href="#windsurf">Windsurf</a></h3>
<p>Over the holiday, I fell in love with <a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a> by the folks at Codeium. Its Cascade feature is a chat interface, which has tool use and multi-turn agentic capabilities, to search through your codebase and edit multiple files. It feels a bit like we’re coming full-circle back to when we did our tool-use version of Townie. However, I think we now all understand that you can’t simply give your OpenAPI spec to an LLM and expect good results. The magic of Windsurf is that they carefully crafted what actions their agent can take, and that it can take multiple actions in a row without your input.</p>
<p>I am salivating at the idea of giving Townie some of these capabilities. Imagine if Townie could search through all public vals, and maybe even npm, or the public internet, to find code, docs, and other resources to help you.</p>
<h3 id="devin"><a href="#devin">Devin</a></h3>
<p>Watching Windsurf take multiple actions on my behalf without my input is very inspirational. I’m dreaming of a world where Townie not only detects errors, but also automatically tries to fix them, possibly multiple times, possibly in parallel across different branches, without any human interaction. Here, of course, we’d be getting into territory mostly explored by the folks at <a href="https://devin.ai/">Devin</a>.</p>
<p>For starters, we could feed back screenshots of the generated website back to the LLM. But soon you’d want to give the LLM access to a full web browser so it can itself poke around the app, like a human would, to see what features work and which ones don’t. Maybe then it’d even write some tests, also like a human would, to make sure things don’t break as it continues to iterate.</p>
<p>I have a vague sense by the end of this year that you’ll be able to tell Townie to “make a fully realistic Hacker News Clone, with user accounts, nested comments, upvotes, downvotes” and it could iterate for potentially hours on your behalf. You could even go to bed and wake up with it done.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-and-competition"><a href="#collaboration-and-competition">Collaboration and competition</a></h3>
<p>Is this fast-following competitive or is it collaborative? So far it’s been feeling mostly collaborative. The pie is so freaking large — there are millions and maybe billions who are jumping at the chance to code — that we’re all happy to help each other scramble to keep up with the demand. I love that, and hope it remains this way. We at Val Town certainly don’t keep (m)any secrets. Our system prompt is open, and we blog about all our interesting technical choices. This very post is a case in point.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-bow-out"><a href="#should-we-bow-out">Should we bow out?</a></h3>
<p>All this copying, and how fast everything is moving begs the question: Should we get out of this race entirely? How can we hope to compete against better funded competitors? Should we instead focus on improving our core differentiator, and do a better job integrating with AI editors like VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, and Bolt? Maybe! We’re planning to dip our toes into integrating: we plan to improve our local development experience, which would allow editors like VSCode, Cursor, and Windsurf to directly edit files in Val Town. We also plan to improve our API, so tools like Bolt could “deploy to Val Town”, like they currently deploy to Netlify.</p>
<p>However, it still feels like there’s a lot to be gained with a fully-integrated web AI code editor experience in Val Town – even if we can only get 80% of the features that the big dogs have, and a couple months later. It doesn’t take <em>that</em> much work to copy the best features we see in other tools. The benefits to a fully integrated experience seems well worth that cost. In short, we’ve had a lot of success fast-following so far, and think it’s worth continuing to do so.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it this far in the article, you should really <a href="https://www.val.town/townie">try out Townie</a>. It’s still is one of the best tools to create fullstack web apps. Make yourself a <a href="https://www.val.town/v/danphilibin/what_did_i_work_on_today">‘what did I work on today’ app that pulls from Linear and GitHub</a> or <a href="https://x.com/destroytoday/status/1856709997737984089">a tool to extract dominant colors from an image</a> or <a href="https://deeperfates.com/">an AI clone for your personality</a>. Your imagination is the limit. And if you do, please let me know (<a href="mailto:steve@val.town">steve@val.town</a>) what features from other tools you’d like to see in Townie. We’re eager to learn from you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>An example of this phenomenon occurred at Google in 2021. We set and enforce resource quotas for some kinds of internal software running on our infrastructure. To maximize efficiency, we also monitor how much of its quota each software service uses. If a service consistently uses less resources than its quota, we automatically reduce the quota. In STPA terms, this quota rightsizer has a control action to reduce a service's quota. From a safety perspective, we then ask when this action would be unsafe. As one example, if the rightsizer&nbsp; ever reduced a service's quota below the actual needs of that service, it would be unsafe—the service would be resource-starved. This is what STPA calls an </span><span>unsafe control action</span><span> (UCA).</span></p><p><span>STPA analyzes each interaction in a system to determine comprehensively how the interaction must be controlled in order for the system to be safe. Unsafe control actions lead to the system entering one or more hazard states. There are only four possible types of UCA:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>A required control action is not provided.</span></p></li><li><p><span>An incorrect or inadequate control action is provided.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A control action is provided at the wrong time or in the wrong sequence.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A control action is stopped too soon or applied for too long.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>This particular unsafe control action—reducing an assigned quota to be less than what the service requires—is an example of the second type of UCA.</span></p><p><span>Simply identifying this unsafe control action by itself is only partially useful. If "quota rightsizer reduces the assigned quota under what the service requires" is unsafe, then preventing that behavior is what the system must do, i.e. "quota rightsizer must not reduce the assigned quota under what the service currently requires." This is a </span><span>safety requirement</span><span>. Safety requirements can be very useful for formulating future designs, elaborating testing plans, and helping people understand the system. And let’s be honest—even mature software systems can operate in ways that are undocumented, unclear, and surprising.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, what we really want is to anticipate all of the concrete scenarios that lead to a hazard state. Again, STPA has a simple and comprehensive way to structure an analysis to find all of the scenarios that could lead the quota rightsizer to violate this safety requirement.</span></p><p><span>So in the case of the rightsizer, there are four archetypal scenarios that we can investigate.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the rightsizer has incorrect behavior.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the rightsizer gets incorrect feedback (or no feedback at all).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the quota system never receives an action from the rightsizer (even though the rightsizer tried to send one).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the quota system has incorrect behavior.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>One specific scenario quickly jumped out to us when analyzing the rightsizer. It gets feedback on the current resource usage from the quota service. As implemented, the calculation of current resource usage is complicated, involving different data collectors and some tricky aggregation logic. What if something went wrong with this complex calculation, resulting in a value that was too low? In short, the rightsizer would react exactly as designed and reliably shrink a service’s quota to the incorrect lower usage level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Exactly the disaster we wanted to prevent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Up to this point, lots of attention had been paid to getting the quota adjustment algorithm right and reliably producing the correct outputs, namely, the action to adjust a service’s quota. However, the feedback path—including the service’s current resource usage—had been less well understood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This highlights a major advantage of STPA—by looking at the system level and by modeling the system in terms of control-feedback loops, we find issues both in the control path and the feedback path. As we run STPA on more and more systems, we see that the feedback path is often less well understood than the control path, but just as important from a system safety perspective.</span></p><p><span>As we dug into the feedback paths for the rightsizer, we saw many opportunities to improve them. None of these changes looked like a traditional reliability solution—it didn’t boil down to managing the rightsizer with a different SLO and error budget. Instead, the solutions showed up in other parts of the system and involved redesigning parts of the stack that had previously appeared to be unrelated–again, an advantage of STPA’s system theory approach.</span></p><p><span>In the 2021 incident, incorrect feedback about the resources used by a critical service in Google's infrastructure was sent to the rightsizer. The rightsizer calculated a new quota, allocating far fewer resources than the service was actually using. As a precautionary measure, this quota reduction was not immediately applied, but was held for several weeks to give time for someone to intervene in case the quota was wrong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Of course, major incidents are never simple events—the next problem was that despite adding the delay as a safety feature, feedback about the pending change was never sent to anyone. The entire system was in a hazard state for weeks, but because we weren't looking for it, we missed our chance to prevent the loss that followed. After several weeks, the quota reduction was applied resulting in a significant outage. Using STPA, we have anticipated problems just like this one in many different systems across Google.</span></p><p><span><span>As Leveson writes in </span><span>Engineering a Safer World</span><span>: "In [STAMP], understanding why an accident occurred requires determining why the control was ineffective. Preventing future accidents requires shifting from a focus on preventing failures to the broader goal of designing and implementing controls that will enforce the necessary constraints."</span><span> This shift in perspective - from trying to prove the absence of problems to effectively managing known and potential hazards - is a key principle in our system safety approach.</span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>
