    <p><span><span>Many people see adverts as the scourge of the internet but they remain the major, and in many cases, only, revenue stream for online media publishers. Another blow has been struck to online advertising recently, however, as a study has revealed how it could constitute for as much as 79 percent of the mobile data consumed by each web page. &nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
</div><div>
     
<h2><span><span>An average of 48% of our data is spent on ads</span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><em>Ender</em>'s published the chart below which shows&nbsp;the&nbsp;data consumed by&nbsp;three&nbsp;web page elements: HTML (blue), Javascript (orange) and ads (green). </span><span>The columns below correspond&nbsp;to the data (in megabytes) consumed by each of the eight websites. Pages were loaded once in their entirety, once with ads disabled, and once with Javascript and ads</span><span>&nbsp;disabled to achieve the results.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The conclusion is that the ads accounted for anywhere between 18&nbsp;and 79 percent of the data transferred while non-essential JavaScript elements&nbsp;added an extra 6 to 68 percent.&nbsp;</span></span></p> 
<p><span><span>"</span></span>On the basis of this investigation, an estimate that says advertising accounts for half of all data used by publisher pages on iPhones does not look unreasonable," <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/16/ad-blocking-advertising-half-of-data-used-articles" target="_blank">the report stated</a>.</p> 
<h2><span><span>Oh, so that's why I run out of data before the end of the month...</span></span></h2> 
<p>Well, not exactly. This was only tested on eight unnamed news sites&nbsp;on a system which represented an iPhone 6: it's far from comprehensive. That said, it does provide insight into the <em>potential</em>&nbsp;effect that advertising can have on mobile data.</p> 
<p>Mobile data is consumed by far more than just webpages: downloads, streaming, messages and apps can all add to how much mobile data your device uses. But mobile browsers like Chrome are often at the top of this list&nbsp;(just check your <em>mobile data</em> page in your Android settings now to see for yourself).</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2> 
<p><span><span>Solutions to this issue are scarce, but Adblock services do provide&nbsp;one way to reduce this data consumption.

<p>With online ads being so omnipresent&nbsp;– and indeed vital to the survival of most websites&nbsp;– we just hope that they can be made more efficient, and their cost to the mobile data plans of consumers reduced further.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>A messy experiment that changed how we think about AI code analysis</em></p>

<p>Last week, I watched our AI choke on a React codebase - again. As timeout errors flooded my terminal, something clicked. We’d been teaching AI to read code like a fresh bootcamp grad, not a senior developer.</p>

<p>Here’s what I mean.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-bootcamp-vs-senior-mindset">The Bootcamp vs Senior Mindset</h2>

<p>Remember your first day reading production code? Without any experience with handling mature codebases, you probably quickly get lost in the details<sup>[0]</sup></p>

<p>But watch a senior dev review a massive PR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They jump straight to the core files</li>
  <li>Group changes by feature (“all auth changes, all db changes”)</li>
  <li>Build a mental model of architecture first</li>
  <li>Only then dive into implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>Obvious in hindsight, right? This realization led us to completely rewire our analyzer.</p>

<h2 id="the-experiment">The Experiment</h2>

<p>Instead of dumping files linearly, we built a context-aware grouping system:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>interface</span> <span>FileGroup</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>ProjectFile</span><span>[];</span>
  <span>totalSize</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span>
  <span>groupContext</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'auth', 'database', etc.</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>groupFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>files</span><span>:</span> <span>ProjectFile</span><span>[]):</span> <span>FileGroup</span><span>[]</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Group files by related functionality and size</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>fileInfos</span> <span>=</span> <span>files</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>({</span>
    <span>file</span><span>,</span>
    <span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>content</span><span>?.</span><span>length</span> <span>||</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
    <span>context</span><span>:</span> <span>getFileContext</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}));</span>

  <span>// Process larger, more important files first</span>
  <span>fileInfos</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>-</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>groups</span><span>:</span> <span>FileGroup</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>currentGroup</span> <span>=</span> <span>createEmptyGroup</span><span>();</span>

  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span> <span>}</span> <span>of</span> <span>fileInfos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>shouldStartNewGroup</span><span>(</span><span>currentGroup</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>groups</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>currentGroup</span><span>);</span>
      <span>currentGroup</span> <span>=</span> <span>createNewGroup</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>addFileToGroup</span><span>(</span><span>currentGroup</span><span>,</span> <span>file</span><span>,</span> <span>size</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>groups</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we changed how we prompt the AI. Instead of “analyze this file”, we give it context about the feature group first:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>buildGroupPrompt</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>group</span><span>:</span> <span>FileGroup</span><span>):</span> <span>string</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>`
    Analyzing authentication system files:
    - Core token validation logic
    - Session management
    - Related middleware
    
    Focus on:
    1. How these integrate with existing auth patterns
    2. Security implications
    3. Performance impact on other systems

    Files to analyze:
    </span><span>${</span><span>formatFiles</span><span>(</span><span>group</span><span>.</span><span>files</span><span>)}</span><span>
  `</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-holy-shit-moment">The Holy Shit Moment</h2>

<p>The results broke our benchmark script. We thought it was a bug.</p>

<p>The AI went from:</p>
<div><pre><code>"This file contains authentication logic using JWT tokens"
</code></pre></div>

<p>To:</p>
<div><pre><code>"Warning: This auth change could impact websocket connections.
The token refresh logic shares patterns with the notification 
service (added last month), suggesting a potential race 
condition during high-traffic socket reconnects.

Related PR: #1234 (merged last week) modified the same
retry logic. Consider adding backoff."
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s senior dev level awareness. It was catching connections we hadn’t explicitly taught it about.</p>

<h2 id="what-actually-changed">What Actually Changed?</h2>

<p>The magic isn’t in fancy ML or bigger models. It’s in mirroring how senior devs think:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Context First</strong>: We front-load system understanding before diving into code</li>
  <li><strong>Pattern Matching</strong>: Group similar files to spot repeated approaches</li>
  <li><strong>Impact Analysis</strong>: Consider changes in relation to the whole system</li>
  <li><strong>Historical Understanding</strong>: Track why code evolved certain ways</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-unexpected-side-effects">The Unexpected Side Effects</h2>

<p>The system started catching things we didn’t design for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spotting copy-pasted code across different features</li>
  <li>Flagging inconsistent error handling patterns</li>
  <li>Warning about potential performance bottlenecks</li>
  <li>Suggesting architectural improvements based on usage patterns</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Every few days there’s a new “AI-powered IDE” on Product Hunt. They’re solving the wrong problem. Making code suggestions without deep context is like having a brilliant junior dev who just joined yesterday - they’ll write clean code that subtly breaks everything.</p>

<p>The key isn’t better code generation. It’s better code understanding.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h2>

<p>We’re still figuring out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When to refresh vs preserve historical understanding</li>
  <li>How to handle conflicting patterns in different parts of the system</li>
  <li>Whether to expose uncertainty in the analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I’m curious if we can teach AI to spot other senior dev instincts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying tech debt before it happens</li>
  <li>Suggesting architectural improvements</li>
  <li>Catching security issues from usage patterns</li>
  <li>Understanding unwritten team conventions</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem isn’t making AI write more code. It’s teaching it to think about code the way experienced developers do.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="postContent"><p id="block0">TL;DR: We ran a human subject study on whether language models can successfully spear-phish people. We use AI agents built from GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to search the web for available information on a target and use this for highly personalized phishing messages. We achieved a click-through rate of above 50% for our AI-generated phishing emails.</p><h2 id="Full_paper__https___arxiv_org_abs_2412_00586">Full paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586">https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586</a></h2><p id="block1">This post is intended to be a brief summary of the main findings, these are some key insights we gained:</p><ol><li id="block2">AI spear-phishing is highly effective, receiving a click-through rate of more than 50%, significantly outperforming our control group.</li><li id="block3">AI-spear phishing is also highly cost-efficient, reducing costs by up to 50 times compared to manual attacks.</li><li id="block4">AI models are highly capable of gathering open-source intelligence.

We include four email groups with a combined total of 101 participants: A control group of arbitrary phishing emails, which received a click-through rate (recipient pressed a link in the email) of 12%, emails generated by human experts (54% click-through), fully AI-automated emails 54% (click-through), and AI emails utilizing a human-in-the-loop (56% click-through). Thus, the AI-automated attacks performed on par with human experts and 350% better than the control group. The results are a significant improvement from similar studies conducted last year, highlighting the increased deceptive capabilities of AI models. Our AI-automated emails were sent using a custom-built tool that automates the entire spear phishing process, including information gathering and creating personalized vulnerability profiles for each target. The AI-gathered information was accurate and useful in 88% of cases and only produced inaccurate profiles for 4% of the participants. We also use language models to detect the intention of emails.

We performed the manual replication on four targets. The process required an average of 23:27 minutes to gather OSINT data and an additional 10:10 minutes to write each personalized email, totaling about 34 minutes per target.

Detailed persuasion results for different models would help us understand how AI-based deception is evolving and how to ensure our protection schemes stay up-to-date. Additionally, we will explore fine-tuning models for creating and detecting phishing. We are also interested in evaluating AI's capabilities to exploit other communication channels, such as social media or modalities like voice. Lastly, we want to measure what happens after users press a link in an email. For example, how likely is it that a pressed email link results in successful exploitation, what different attack trees exist (such as downloading files or entering account details in phishing sites), and how well can AI exploit and defend against these different paths? We also encourage other researchers to explore these avenues.&nbsp;</p><p id="block24">We propose personalized mitigation strategies to counter AI-enhanced phishing. The cost-effective nature of AI makes it highly plausible we're moving towards an agent vs agent future. AI could assist users by creating personalized vulnerability profiles, combining their digital footprint with known behavioral patterns.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p id="block25">Our results reveal the significant challenges that personalized, AI-generated phishing emails present to current cybersecurity systems. Many existing spam filters use signature detection (detecting known malicious content and behaviors). By using language models, attackers can effortlessly create phishing emails that are uniquely adapted to every target, rendering signature detection schemes obsolete. As models advance, their capabilities of persuasion will likely also increase. We find that LLM-driven spear phishing is highly effective and economically viable, with automated reconnaissance that provides accurate and useful information in almost all cases. Current safety guardrails fail to reliably prevent models from conducting reconnaissance or generating phishing emails. However, AI could mitigate these threats through advanced detection and tailored countermeasures.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header><div><p>Learn how we implemented real-time updates using Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL with HTTP long polling. A practical guide to building scalable real-time systems without WebSockets.</p><div><p><span>Nadeesha Cabral</span></p><p><span>•</span><time datetime="04-01-2025">04-01-2025</time></p></div></div></header><p>Like many teams building real-time systems with Node.js and TypeScript, we've been exploring ways to handle real-time updates at scale. Our system handles hundreds of worker nodes constantly polling our PostgreSQL-backed control plane for new jobs (tool calls issued by agents), while agents themselves continuously pull for execution and chat state updates. What started as an exploration into WebSockets led us to a surprisingly effective "old-school" solution: HTTP long polling with Postgres.</p>
<h2>The Challenge: Real-time Updates at Scale</h2>
<p>Our Node.js/TypeScript backend faced two main challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Worker Node Updates</strong>: Hundreds of worker nodes running our Node.js / Golang / C# SDKs needed to know about new jobs as soon as they were available, requiring a querying strategy that didn't bring down our Postgres database</li>
<li><strong>Agent State Synchronization</strong>: Agents required real-time updates about execution and chat state, which we needed to stream efficiently.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Long Polling vs WebSockets: A Refresher</h2>
<h3>How Long Polling Works</h3>
<pre>sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Database
    
    Client-&gt;&gt;Server: Request new data
    
    alt Data available immediately
        Server-&gt;&gt;Database: Check for data
        Database--&gt;&gt;Server: Return data
        Server--&gt;&gt;Client: Return response immediately
    else No data available
        Server-&gt;&gt;Database: Check for data
        Database--&gt;&gt;Server: No data
        Note over Server: Hold connection
        loop Check periodically
            Server-&gt;&gt;Database: Poll for new data
            Database--&gt;&gt;Server: New data arrives
        end
        Server--&gt;&gt;Client: Return response
    end
    Client-&gt;&gt;Server: Next request begins
</pre>
<p>The key difference between approaches can be understood with a simple train analogy:</p>
<p>Short polling is like a train that departs strictly according to a timetable - it leaves the station at fixed intervals regardless of whether there are passengers or not. WebSockets, on the other hand, are like having a dedicated train line always ready to transport passengers.</p>
<p>Long polling? It's like a train that waits at the station until at least one passenger boards before departing. If no passengers show up within a certain time (TTL), only then does it leave empty. This approach gives you the best of both worlds - immediate departure when there's data (passengers) and efficient resource usage when there's not.</p>
<p>In technical terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>With short polling, the server responds immediately whether there's data or not</li>
<li>With long polling, the server holds the connection open until either:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>New data becomes available</li>
<li>A timeout is reached (TTL)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Let's break down our Node.js implementation:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>getJobStatusSync</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>{
  jobId,
  owner,
  ttl = <span>60_000</span>,
}: {
  jobId: <span>string</span>;
  owner: { clusterId: <span>string</span> };
  ttl?: <span>number</span>;
}</span>) =&gt; {
  <span>let</span> <span>jobResult</span>: {
    <span>service</span>: <span>string</span>;
    <span>status</span>: <span>"pending"</span> | <span>"running"</span> | <span>"success"</span> | <span>"failure"</span> | <span>"stalled"</span>;
    <span>result</span>: <span>string</span> | <span>null</span>;
    <span>resultType</span>: <span>ResultType</span> | <span>null</span>;
  } | <span>undefined</span>;

  <span>const</span> start = <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>The function accepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jobId</code>: Unique identifier for the job we're tracking</li>
<li><code>owner.clusterId</code>: Cluster identifier for multi-tenancy</li>
<li><code>ttl</code>: Time-to-live in milliseconds (defaults to 60 seconds)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Polling Loop</h3>
<pre><code>  <span>do</span> {
    <span>const</span> [job] = <span>await</span> data.<span>db</span>
      .<span>select</span>({
        <span>service</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>service</span>,
        <span>status</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>status</span>,
        <span>result</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>result</span>,
        <span>resultType</span>: data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>result_type</span>,
      })
      .<span>from</span>(data.<span>jobs</span>)
      .<span>where</span>(<span>and</span>(<span>eq</span>(data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>id</span>, jobId), <span>eq</span>(data.<span>jobs</span>.<span>cluster_id</span>, owner.<span>clusterId</span>)));

    <span>if</span> (!job) {
      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>NotFoundError</span>(<span>`Job <span>${jobId}</span> not found`</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (job.<span>status</span> === <span>"success"</span> || job.<span>status</span> === <span>"failure"</span>) {
      jobResult = job;
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, <span>500</span>));
    }
  } <span>while</span> (!jobResult &amp;&amp; <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() - start &lt; ttl);
</code></pre>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The loop continues until either:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>We get a final status (<code>success</code> or <code>failure</code>)</li>
<li>We hit the TTL timeout</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use a 500ms delay between checks to prevent hammering the database</li>
<li>Database query is optimized with proper indexes on <code>id</code> and <code>cluster_id</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Error Handling and Response</h3>
<pre><code>  <span>if</span> (jobResult) {
    <span>return</span> jobResult;
  } <span>else</span> {
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>JobPollTimeoutError</span>(<span>`Call did not resolve within <span>${ttl}</span>ms`</span>);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The function concludes by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Throwing a timeout error if no result was found</li>
<li>Returning the job result if successful</li>
</ol>
<h2>Database Optimization</h2>
<p>For this pattern to work efficiently, proper Postgres indexing needs to be implemented:</p>
<pre><code><span>CREATE</span> INDEX idx_jobs_status <span>ON</span> jobs(id, cluster_id);
<span>CREATE</span> INDEX idx_jobs_lookup <span>ON</span> jobs(status) <span>WHERE</span> status <span>IN</span> (<span>'success'</span>, <span>'failure'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>This ensures our frequent polling queries are fast and don't put unnecessary load on the database.</p>
<h2>The Hidden Benefits of Long Polling</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of long polling is what you don't have to build. Here's what we avoided:</p>
<h3><strong>Observability Remains Unchanged</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest wins is that we don't need to modify our observability stack for WebSockets. All our standard HTTP metrics just work out of the box, and our existing logging patterns do exactly what we need. There's no need to figure out new ways to monitor persistent connections or implement additional logging for WebSocket state.</p>
<h3><strong>Authentication Simplicity</strong></h3>
<p>We completely avoid the headache of implementing a new authentication mechanism for incoming WebSocket connections. We just keep using our standard HTTP authentication that we already have in place. All our existing security patterns continue to work exactly as they always have.</p>
<p>When we implemented Websockets earlier, this became extremely gnarly due to the RBAC restrictions we had to honor. Basically, we needed to be really careful about what data we push to the connected clients, and the privilege escalation that happens when a client moves from one cluster to another.</p>
<h3><strong>Infrastructure Compatibility</strong></h3>
<p>Corporate firewalls blocking WebSocket connections was one of our other worries. Some  of our users are behind firewalls, and we don't need the IT headache of getting them to open up WebSockets.</p>
<p>Not our problem. We don't need any special proxy configurations or complex infrastructure setups. Our standard load balancer configuration works fine without any modifications. The entire stack just keeps humming along as it always has.</p>
<h3><strong>Operational Simplicity</strong></h3>
<p>We never have to worry about server restarts dropping WebSocket connections. There's no connection state to manage or maintain. When something goes wrong (and something always goes wrong), it's much easier to debug and troubleshoot because we're just dealing with standard HTTP requests and responses.</p>
<p>We use Cloudflare for our edge, and that means our existing configuration rules and DDoS protection didn't need any changing.</p>
<h3><strong>Client Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>The client-side code stays remarkably simple. It works with any HTTP client, no special WebSocket libraries needed. Even better, reconnection handling comes for free with basic retry logic. The entire client implementation can often be just a few lines of code.</p>
<h2>Why Not ElectricSQL?</h2>
<p>While exploring solutions, we looked at <a href="https://electric-sql.com/blog/2024/07/17/electric-next">ElectricSQL</a>, which synchronizes Postgres data to the frontend. They make an interesting case for long polling over WebSockets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switching to an HTTP protocol may at first seem like a regression or a strange fit. Web sockets are built on top of HTTP specifically to serve the kind of realtime data stream that Electric provides. However, they are also more stateful and harder to cache."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, we actually recommend ElectricSQL if you don't need extreme control or low-level constructs to handle real-time updates. It's a solid, battle-tested solution that handles many edge cases and provides a great developer experience.</p>
<h3>Why We Chose Raw Long Polling</h3>
<p>The message delivery mechanism is a core part of our product - it's not just an implementation detail, it's central to what we do. You can't afford to have something as fundamental as message delivery abstracted away in a third-party library, no matter how good that library might be.</p>
<p>Our specific use case required:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core Product Control</strong>: Full control over our message delivery mechanism - it's not just infrastructure, it's our product</li>
<li><strong>Zero External Dependencies</strong>: We needed our stack to be as simple as possible for self-hosting</li>
<li><strong>Close to the Metal</strong>: Direct control over the polling mechanism and connection handling</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Control</strong>: Ability to fine-tune every aspect of the implementation, including implementing dynamic polling intervals</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Making it easy for users to understand and modify the codebase</li>
</ol>
<p>For us, staying close to the metal with a simple HTTP long polling implementation was the right choice. But if you don't need this level of control, ElectricSQL provides a more feature-rich solution that could save you significant development time.</p>
<h2>Application Layer Best Practices</h2>
<p>When implementing long polling, there are several critical practices to follow to ensure reliable operation:</p>
<h3><strong>Mandatory TTL Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>You must implement a Time-To-Live (TTL) for your HTTP connections. Without this, you'll inevitably run into connection reset errors. Your polling logic should always return within this TTL, no matter what.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getJobStatus</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>jobId: <span>string</span>, ttl = <span>60_000</span></span>) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> start = <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>();
  
  <span>// Always check if we've exceeded TTL</span>
  <span>while</span> (<span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() - start &lt; ttl) {
    <span>// polling logic here</span>
  }
  
  <span>return</span> <span>null</span>; <span>// TTL exceeded</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Client-Configurable TTL with Server Limits</strong></h3>
<p>While clients should be able to specify their desired TTL, the server must enforce a maximum limit:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>MAX_TTL</span> = <span>120_000</span>; <span>// 2 minutes</span>

<span>const</span> <span>getJobStatus</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>jobId: <span>string</span>, clientTtl: <span>number</span></span>) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> ttl = <span>Math</span>.<span>min</span>(clientTtl, <span>MAX_TTL</span>);
  <span>// ... polling logic</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Infrastructure-Aware TTL Settings</strong></h3>
<p>Your maximum TTL must stay under the minimum HTTP connection timeout across your entire infrastructure stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application server timeouts</li>
<li>Client timeouts</li>
<li>Load balancer timeouts</li>
<li>Edge server timeouts</li>
<li>Proxy timeouts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if your edge server has a 30-second timeout, your max TTL should be comfortably under this, say 25 seconds.</p>
<h3><strong>Sensible Database Polling Intervals</strong></h3>
<p>As shown in our implementation, include a reasonable wait time between database polls. We use a 500ms interval:</p>
<pre><code><span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, <span>500</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>This prevents hammering your database while still providing reasonably quick updates.</p>
<h3><strong>Optional: Exponential Backoff</strong></h3>
<p>While not implemented in our current system, you can implement exponential backoff for more efficient resource usage:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getJobStatus</span> = <span>async</span> (<span>jobId: <span>string</span>, ttl = <span>60_000</span></span>) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> start = <span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>();
  <span>let</span> waitTime = <span>100</span>; <span>// Start with 100ms</span>
  
  <span>while</span> (<span>Date</span>.<span>now</span>() - start &lt; ttl) {
    <span>const</span> result = <span>await</span> <span>checkJob</span>(jobId);
    
    <span>if</span> (result) <span>return</span> result;
    
    <span>// Exponential backoff with max of 2 seconds</span>
    waitTime = <span>Math</span>.<span>min</span>(waitTime * <span>2</span>, <span>2000</span>);
    <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, waitTime));
  }
  
  <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This approach means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active requests (those likely to get data soon) terminate quickly</li>
<li>Inactive requests gradually increase their polling interval</li>
<li>System resources are used more efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Case for WebSockets: The Other Side of the Story</h2>
<p>While we've found long polling to be a great solution for our needs, it's not the only option. WebSockets are not inherently bad. They just require a lot of love and attention.</p>
<p>The challenges we mentioned aren't insurmountable - they just require proper engineering attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Observability</strong>: WebSockets are more stateful, so you need to implement additional logging and monitoring for persistent connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>: You need to implement a new authentication mechanism for incoming WebSocket connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: You need to configure your infrastructure to support WebSockets, including load balancers and firewalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operations</strong>: You need to manage WebSocket connections and reconnections, including handling connection timeouts and errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Client Implementation</strong>: You need to implement a client-side WebSocket library, including handling reconnections and state management.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div>]]></description>

Attacks using hardware and/or software means were permissible by the competition rules, so it was almost an anything-goes situation.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-320-80.jpg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GBWvVvGr6TbJk6ujN9bTQG.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Raspberry Pi and Hextree would hide the secret in the RP2350's OTP (One Time Programmable) memory on the chip, said to be a once-set but never-forget binary code. Picotool was used to write the covert code to the OTP. Then the RP2350's OTP memory was locked behind the Page Locks hardware protection feature, set to an 'inaccessible' state '13:12' as per the table above. Firmware was also signed, with Secure Boot enabled, and they disabled the chip debug feature, so prying eyes couldn't get to the secret via a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface. Furthermore, all other bootkeys were disabled, the RP2350 Glitch Detector was turned on and then set to its highest sensitivity. It certainly sounds like it was locked down.</p><p>Cullen says he started his hacking process by studying the RP2350 data sheet and the dependencies outlined in the documentation. Then Cullen drilled down on how the RP2350 boots and establishes its security settings, with particular attention to the OTP.</p><p>Cullen's first idea was to get the OTP to misread its critical bit settings, you could get the chip to work in a non-secure way. Cullen even X-rayed the RP2350 as part of his investigations and annotated the chip blocks. However, he stresses that this was just a pursuit of interest and not really instrumental to beating the challenge.</p><p>Research compelled Cullen to focus on Pin 53, labeled USB-OTP_VDD, as it is connected to OTP (and USB) functions. Perhaps a hacker could "mess with this power supply externally" to affect these functions, he pondered. So he took off the chip and isolated Pin 53 (physically cutting PCB trace), so it was ready to be electrically tampered with separately on a reassembled board.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ-V5ppwQPQlYKQEEzp8YfYNSf4WgG7yCzH"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqTQyzSKcfsLApECYJYjTG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen )</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>With this hardware-modified setup, Cullen probed Pin 53 to "inject whatever voltages I want" and checked what happened. An unprotected RP2350 board was kept on hand for side-by-side comparisons. Once the hardware was set up he watched what normally occurs when a secured and a non-secured RP2350 started up – according to the probe readout on an oscilloscope.</p><p>16 groups of spikes were seen, corresponding with 16 initial OTP reads on startup. Cullen then tested injecting power glitches to Pin 53 at certain points in the boot process. Disappointingly, the debug remained locked down. Next, a Python script was used to sweep the position of a glitch power input through the entire 600-microsecond range of OTP reads during startup. The debug functionality was checked but never became available. So Cullen looked at the unlocked RP2350 board again, with debugging enabled, for clues.</p><p>Then, something interesting was observed, as the RISC-V cores showed up via the glitch on the unsecured RP2350. Cullen then used another script to check where the RISC-V debug access port shows up. This technique could also be triggered on the secured RP2350 – and a debugger could now be connected to the secured RP2350 and the secret read from the OTP!</p><h2 id="secret-gets-busted-3">Secret gets busted</h2><p>The 'permanently disabled' RISC-V cores had been woken by the glitch to enable this access. Cullen explains the odd underlying reason that the glitch 0x00030033 works is that it disables both Arm and RISC-V cores but, the Arm disable instruction has higher priority, leaving RISC-V turned on. Importantly the glitch successfully clears Debug_Disable.</p><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-nQ4sTaGVvBq3RDynH4YwZQ-NKOg5Y8ErILypSgdcOnKfaOiUe7TF7Qt"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="RP2350 Hacking Challenge" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkU8csoeyzL6rtQTzQKcQG.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aedan Cullen )</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For more information about the background to this hack, particularly bypassing the guard read mechanism, we advise watching the video recorded during the 38c3 (linked top).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p>Imagine shrinking satellite technology that predicts the weather into a device that transmits vital information about the health of the person wearing it.</p>

<p>University of Waterloo engineers have achieved this&nbsp;technological feat to help people faced with&nbsp;chronic health problems such as diabetes monitor their glucose levels.</p>

<p>The Waterloo team’s breakthrough addresses the major challenge of creating non-invasive, continuous glucose monitoring, essential for those managing diabetes.</p>

<p>Currently, diabetics must frequently prick their fingers or rely on invasive wearable patches with micro-needles to track their blood-sugar levels. But the system designed by Dr. George Shaker, an adjunct associate professor at Waterloo’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and his colleagues eliminates this need, thereby reducing pain, the risk of infection and improving people’s quality of life.</p>

<p><img alt="George Shaker picture" height="233" src="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/sites/ca.news/files/resize/styles/feature_small/public/george_shaker_23-06-13_0853_1-350x233.jpg?itok=mvnnwrr9" width="350">“We’ve developed radar technology that can now fit inside a smart watch and sense glucose levels more accurately than ever before,” Shaker said. “Just like you use glasses to improve your vision, our technology helps for better sensing of glucose levels.”</p>

<p>To explain how the new system works, Shaker points to weather satellites that use radar to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere and, for example, measure storm movements and other kinds of cloud cover.</p>

<p>“We’ve figured a way to miniaturize these radar systems on satellites and put them in a wearable device and use the same radar technology that looks at changes in the atmosphere to look at changes in the human body,” he said</p>

<p>The system’s key components are a radar chip, which sends and receives signals through the body, an engineered “meta-surface”, which helps focus these signals for better accuracy, and microcontrollers, which process the radar signals using artificial intelligence algorithms. The algorithms improve the accuracy and reliability of the readings by learning from the data over time.</p>

<p>The unique aspect of this system is the meta-surface which Shaker and his team have developed. It further improves the radar’s resolution and sensitivity, allowing for more accurate glucose readings.</p>

<p>“Unlike existing methods that require skin penetration our system is entirely non-invasive and can detect even small changes in glucose level,” Shaker said. “No other technology can provide this level of precision without direct contact with the bloodstream.”</p>

<p>More work remains to perfect their system. Although the engineers now power their device with a USB cable, they’re planning to optimize it for battery use to improve portability. Eventually, they hope it can be used to gather other health-related data, such as blood pressure.</p>

<p>The team is currently working with industry partners to introduce the technology to be installed in the next generation of wearables.</p>

<p>“We have a minimum viable product that’s already being used in clinical trials, and while there’s more work to be done, we’re much closer to a full marketable device,” Shaker said.</p>

<p>The research paper, “Radar near-field sensing using metasurface for biomedical applications” was recently featured in Nature’s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-024-00194-4"><i>Communications Engineering</i></a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if a clinician could 3D print something <em>through</em> your skin, constructing an implant or replacement organ underneath layers of tissue? The world of medicine would be transformed: a host of surgical procedures, which come with a variety of risks, could be performed without ever lifting a scalpel.</p>
<p>A collaborative, NIH-funded team is working to make this Star Trek-like fiction a reality. Their work, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1563">published today in <em>Science</em></a>, outlines a method to print biocompatible structures through thick, multi-layered tissues. The principle? Focused ultrasound, combined with a novel ultrasound-sensitive ink.</p>
<p>“Focused ultrasound has been used for decades to treat a wide variety of conditions, underscoring its safety and utility as a clinical tool,” said Randy King, Ph.D., a program director in the Division of Applied Science &amp; Technology at NIBIB. “This potential new application, built on years of technology advancements, could set the stage for something previously thought impossible: through-tissue 3D ultrasound printing.”</p>
<h4>Using ultrasound principles for 3D printing</h4>
<p>Some 3D printing techniques use light—a form of energy—to trigger the solidification of an “ink,” which is often composed of liquid substance, like resin or plastic. Light, however, doesn’t travel well through skin and organs, getting scattered as it passes through them. In order to successfully “print” through biological tissues, a different energy source would be needed.</p>
<p>Enter ultrasound. Compared with light, ultrasound waves can travel much further through tissues, sending energy well below the surface. By delivering an ink that could be solidified through interactions with ultrasound waves, a clinician could potentially build biologically relevant structures inside of the human body, all without making an incision.</p>

<p>“Our technology is based on the sono-thermal effect, which describes the increase in temperature that occurs due to the absorption of ultrasound waves,” explained senior study author Junjie Yao, Ph.D., an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University. “If we can precisely control the temperature increase by focusing the ultrasound waves, we can guide the solidification of the injected ink, even through layers of tissue.”</p>
<p>The ink is made using four components: a compound that helps to absorb the ultrasound waves, a microparticle that helps to control viscosity, a polymer that provides structure, and a salt that absorbs heat to trigger solidification. “The individual components of the bioink are not new—in fact, they have been used for many years in biomaterials applications,” said senior study author Y. Shrike Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor and associate bioengineer at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, respectively. “The key was the combination of these ingredients, in the appropriate ratios, which allowed us to create an ink that can rapidly solidify upon interactions with ultrasound waves without getting dispersed.”</p>
<h4>From principle to proof of concept</h4>
<figure role="group">

<figcaption><strong>Ultrasound technique enables through-tissue 3D printing.</strong> A honeycomb structure is printed through a 17mm pig liver. <em>Credit:</em> Junjie Yao (Duke University) and Yu Shrike Zhang (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To start, the researchers wanted to see if they could create 3D shapes using their ultrasound technique. They suspended a focused ultrasound transducer over a chamber filled with their novel ink. Between the transducer and the ink was a “matching medium,” a substance used in most ultrasound methods that ensures efficient transmission of ultrasound waves. Using a computer program to precisely control the intricate 3D movements of the ultrasound transducer, the researchers were able to create a variety of different structures at varying depths inside of the ink chamber. These structures had a range of sizes and geometrical intricacies and included objects such as multi-layer honeycomb, a branched vascular network, and complex models that resembled a hand or spider.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers wanted to determine if their technique could be used to print through biological tissues. They placed pig tissues that ranged in thickness (up to 17 millimeters) on top of the chamber filled with ink. With the transducer positioned above, the researchers steered ultrasound waves through the tissue and into the chamber below. They successfully printed a variety of different structures through several different kinds of tissues, including a pig liver and a pig tissue phantom that was comprised of multiple layers (such as skin, fat, and muscle).</p>
<p>To mimic a real-world procedure, the researchers performed a mock surgery using an ex vivo goat heart. With a catheter, the researchers injected their ultrasound-sensitive ink into the left atrial appendage, a sac-like structure in the heart where blood clots can develop. Through the goat heart wall, the researchers used ultrasound waves to solidify the ink, effectively sealing off this area of the heart. This procedure, called left atrial appendage closure, can require open-heart surgery and is sometimes performed on patients with atrial fibrillation with increased risk of stroke.</p>
<p>These initial experiments demonstrate that this proof-of-concept printing method has the potential to turn highly invasive surgical procedures into safer, less invasive ones. “Our technique could provide an unconventional avenue towards truly minimally invasive medicine which seemed nearly impossible before,” said Yao.</p>
<h4>Looking ahead</h4>
<p>This focused ultrasound printing technique can require high levels of energy, which has the potential to overheat the surrounding tissues. To combat this, the researchers constructed a confocal high-intensity ultrasound printer. This system uses two ultrasound transducers that are aligned in a crossbeam pattern, allowing the two ultrasound wavefronts to overlap. Not only does this design reduce the energy needed from each transducer, it also improves the resolution and speed of the ultrasound printer.</p>
<p>“We will continue to modify our technique to increase its safety and efficiency, looking to adapt our technology for different medical uses,” said Zhang. “While we believe that our method has the potential to enable a variety of minimally invasive procedures, it’s still a prototype technology that will require further optimization before it can be evaluated in humans.”</p>

<p>Yao and Zhang—who have known each other since graduate school—have spent the last several years working together on their 3D ultrasound printing technology. “Our multi-year collaboration gave us a chance to create a new technique that combines our unique perspectives: ultrasound imaging and biochemistry,” said Yao. “We could not have created this technology without one another, highlighting the unique possibilities that can stem from interdisciplinary partnerships.”</p>

<p>Plastic recycling is commonplace but imperfect. Part of the problem, says <a href="https://eng.ua.edu/eng-directory/dr-jason-e-bara/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Bara</a>, is that current processes yield lower-quality plastics with reduced value and fewer end uses. In a circular plastic economy, any plastic could be broken down to its component parts and then reconstituted into new products with little or no waste.</p>



<p>The science is not there yet, but it may be one step closer.</p>

<p>Bara, a professor in the College of Engineering, leads a team at The University of Alabama working to improve <a href="https://news.ua.edu/2021/08/ua-researchers-part-of-national-effort-to-tackle-plastic-waste/">methods to recycle</a> the ubiquitous plastics we interact with daily.</p>



<p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a common plastic that responds well to chemolysis, a chemical process that depolymerizes plastic for recycling. Much of the previous work on chemolysis and PET has focused on water, alcohols, and amines.&nbsp; Amines are a group of compounds derived from ammonia and are especially effective for PET depolymerization, but most products formed from the aminolysis of PET have limited uses, Bara said.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2 id="h-let-s-see-what-happens"><strong>“Let’s See What Happens”</strong></h2>



<p>Nothing in the literature pointed to the effectiveness of imidazoles in this process. Imidazole, and its related compounds, are a group of organic molecules that are used in a wide range of applications and even appear within biologically important compounds.</p>



<p>“I’ve been working with imidazole for much of my career,” said Bara. “It’s pretty amazing how versatile it is.” Bara had been working for two years with using amines to break down plastics as part of a National Science Foundation grant geared toward reducing plastic waste. His appreciation for imidazole’s versatility made it a natural extension to see what happened when he tried using it for chemolysis.</p>



<p>“My student came back into the lab and said oh — the plastic is gone. It’s all gone.”</p>



<p>The University of Alabama has filed a patent application for the process, which offers several key advantages over other chemical recycling methods for PET. Among these is the lack of need of an additional solvent or catalyst because imidazole has a relatively low melting point. These are favorable qualities for developing a cost efficient and commercially viable process.</p>



<p>Breaking down PET via imidazolysis yields chemical intermediates that can be transformed to a range of other chemicals that are hard to get by traditional methods.</p>



<p>“Our imidazolysis process is unique in that it’s a flexible recycling technology, and you can get a wider range of final products from PET depolymerization when you do it our way,” Bara said.</p>



<h2 id="h-chasing-the-next-challenge"><strong>Chasing the Next Challenge</strong></h2>



<p>Bara says one of the more exciting things about the research is what lies ahead.</p>



<div><p>PET is among the easier plastics to recycle. For one thing, it is relatively clean because it is used in food containers and drink bottles, and it generally contains few additives. Based on their results so far, imidazolysis is also useful in depolymerizing polyurethanes, which are trickier to work with than PET.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-1024x683.jpeg" alt="Wooden box marked with a recycling symbol holding a variety of plastic bottles. " srcset="https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://news.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AdobeStock_480960525-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>“There is generally good awareness around the need to recycle plastics and other materials (paper, metal) that commonly go into our recycling bins,” he said. “But it’s harder to appreciate that polyurethanes can also be chemically recycled.”</p>



<p>Polyurethanes are generally encountered as foams that are full of air, do not melt and often are formulated with any number of inorganic additives. Think packing foams, seat cushions, memory foam mattresses and automobile seats.</p>

<p>“While municipal recycling is limited to the most common thermoplastics, consumers likely don’t understand the magnitude of the polyurethane problem that needs to be addressed.”</p>



<p>Imidazolysis not only works to break down polyurethanes and allows for recovery of the molecular components (the polyols used to make polyurethanes can be especially valuable to recover), but the physical properties of imidazole also make it a better reagent for carrying out the reaction.</p>



<p>“While I think what we’ve already published on the successful imidazolysis of PET is very exciting,” Bara said, “The chemical recycling of polyurethanes is where imidazolysis may potentially have a much bigger impact.”</p>



<p>This work on recycling PET and PU via imidazolysis has been supported by active funding from NSF and includes contributions from researchers at Iowa State University.</p>
