But once all the doors disappear and you find out you can phase through mirrors into another unnatural world, you accept that the house isn’t a happy memory.

People want answers, but they don’t want them to be boring.<br></p><p>But “it can’t be helped: boredom is not simple,” French theorist Roland Barthes writes in his 1973 book <em>The Pleasure of the Text</em>. “It is bliss seen from the shores of pleasure.”<br></p><p>As a whole, even with real life attached to it, MyHouse.wad is now an infamous piece of internet horror, though it’s too popular to be tied directly to its creator’s experience<!-- -->. For people that make art, its ability to stand on its own can be terrifying (the map has a mind of its own, after all)—it can feel wrong, but it can also be connective.<br></p><p>Horror has the same effect. Once you experience that feeling with someone, like letting them sip your favorite cherry Coke, you’re bonded. So while MyHouse.wad may have been an unlikely GOTY contender, its artful, personal horror was always going to bring people together. That’s just what happens when you share something from the heart, as dark as it can be. <br></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Matrix multiplication consumes a large fraction of the time taken in many
machine-learning algorithms. Thus, accelerator chips that perform matrix
multiplication faster than conventional processors or even GPU's are of
increasing interest. In this paper, we demonstrate a method of performing
matrix multiplication without a scalar multiplier circuit. In many cases of
practical interest, only a single addition and a single on-chip copy operation
are needed to replace a multiplication. It thus becomes possible to design a
matrix-multiplier chip that, because it does not need time, space- and
energy-consuming multiplier circuits, can hold many more processors, and thus
provide a net speedup.

<p><a href="http://jfloren.net/b/">Back to blog archive</a></p><p><strong>Posted 2023/7/7</strong></p>
<div>


<p>I switched to ProtonMail a few years back after getting fed up with Google. It’s been mostly acceptable, but a few months ago the Android client started mangling emails – if I hit “send” too soon, it would send out only part of what I’d typed; I had to wait 10 seconds or so after I finished typing before hitting send to be sure it sent. I figured I’d switch to some other email client instead, since I wasn’t particularly in love with the Proton app anyway.</p>

<p>My solution was to set up the <a href="https://proton.me/mail/bridge">Proton Bridge</a> in a VM on my NAS, then used rinetd to forward incoming connections on the IMAP and SMTP ports to the bridge (which only listens on 127.0.0.1). I then set up tailscale on that box and on my phone; with that, I could connect any Android email client (I like <a href="https://email.faircode.eu/">FairEmail</a>) to my Proton account. I was also accessing it from Linux using Claws.</p>

<p>Everything was great until I decided the other day that I’d <em>also</em> like to do PGP signing on my outgoing messages. I exported a signing-only subkey to my Android device and configured FairEmail+OpenKeyring to use it, then I also set up Claws on Linux for PGP/MIME.</p>

<p>When I sent a test message to myself, though, Claws and FairEmail didn’t have any clue that it was signed. If I switched to PGP inline, it worked. I sent an email to one of the Claws maintainers, who reported that my MIME structure was all messed up. He sent me a signed message back, and Claws was able to verify the signature just fine.</p>

<p>It turns out that Proton has been breaking outgoing PGP signatures from the beginning: <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/26">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/26</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/320">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/320</a>. It seems that their argument is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you send a regular email via Proton to another Proton client, they automatically PGP sign+encrypt the message. (I think this is great!)</li>
<li>Their automatic signing+encryption cannot coexist with a user-applied signature.</li>
<li>Therefore, all user-applied signatures will be broken. Tough luck, bucko, we’re the SECURE email company, you’ll upload your private key to our servers and you’ll like it!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s absurd that there’s no way to disable this, no option to tell Proton “if you see a multipart/signed or multipart/encrypted message, just leave it the hell alone.”</p>

<p>I’m looking at other potential email hosts. I know PGP isn’t widely used, but I have a hard time swallowing Proton’s silent mangling of my email, and I especially dislike their smarmy we-know-better attitude when people complain about it.</p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss a series of vulnerabilities that when exploited in succession, could enable a low-privilege user in ServiceNow to gain unauthorized full administrative access to the ServiceNow instance.</p>

<p>ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that provides service management software as a service (SaaS). It is used by a millions of companies worldwide, and specializes in IT Service Management (ITSM), IT Operations Management (ITOM), and IT Business Management (ITBM). It allows users to manage incidents, service requests, problems, and changes within the IT infrastructure of a business. It also provides a self-service portal where end users can request IT services and log issues.</p>

<p>While working internally as a security engineer on the offensive security team, we routinely scrutinize the security of third-party platforms that integrate with our systems and processes. This is a crucial step to verify the security of these platforms and prevent potential breaches that could expose our sensitive data. During a recent engagement in mid-2022 our security team was able to exploit a number of vulnerabilities in ServiceNow leading to an effective account takeover to obtain administrative access on the platform as a low privileged user.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-servicenow-application"><span>Exploring the ServiceNow application</span><a href="#exploring-the-servicenow-application"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>While exploring the ServiceNow application, we determined that the application uses <code>.do</code> pages. <code>.do</code> endpoints are often associated with Java servlets, which are used to process requests and return dynamic content. As these pages query server-side resources, it should be secured against unauthorized or unintended access to prevent users from gaining access to sensitive functionality.</p>

<p>ServiceNow also uses Xml Http Requests (XHR), which is a fundamental technology behind Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The use of these API calls are to allow the performance of various operations without needing a full refresh of the page, which can improve the usability and efficiency of the application. ServiceNow widely uses XHR requests to update records or interacting with certain server-side resources or ‘processors’.</p>

<p>The application also uses the Glide Query Language (GQL), which is an proprietary, object-oriented language that forms the basis for the ServiceNow API to perform CRUD operations on its database. In essence, GQL serves as an abstraction layer for SQL operations that allows developers to perform database operations without interacting with raw SQL.</p>

<p>As a low privilege user, we discovered that it was not possible to directly access many of the application’s functionalities. An example is shown below, where we attempted to view the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> page:</p>

<p><img width="872" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/interactive_do.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/interactive_do.png"></p>

<p>However, while navigating through the application, there are some locations that inadventently redirect us to sensitive pages by appending query strings needed to create a valid request. Due to insufficient access control being implemented, we discovered that a standard user could access the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> endpoint if the query string was correctly formatted. We can send the following request to successfully access the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> page:</p>

<pre><code>https://somehost.service-now.com/$interactive_analysis.do?sysparm_field=password&amp;sysparm_table=sys_user&amp;sysparm_from_list=true&amp;sysparm_query=active%3Dtrue%5Ecaller_id%3Djavascript:gs.getUserID()&amp;sysparm_list_view=&amp;sysparm_tiny_url=f040a8971ba38150d88b624c274bcbb3  
</code></pre>

<p>This is shown below:</p>

<p><img width="967" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/chart_do.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/chart_do.png"></p>

<p>This is a very interesting functionality, because at first glance it provides the low privilege user with a graphical representation of all the users that are within the application, which could potentially signal that potentially sensitive information is being retrieved through some database.</p>

<h2 id="discovering-the-xhr-request-behind-interactive-analysis"><span>Discovering the XHR request behind ‘Interactive Analysis</span><a href="#discovering-the-xhr-request-behind-interactive-analysis"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Through further investigation, we determined that the <code>$interactive_analysis.do</code> page, as well as the corresponding <code>report_viewer.do</code> (by accessing the chart from a separate page), sends an XHR request to <code>xmlhttp.do</code> with the “ChartDataProcessor” processor in the POST request. The initial output is quite complex, however it is possible to decode/trim the request and simplify it to the following POST body:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user","groupby":"name","filter":"","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<h2 id="enumerating-tables-using-glide-query-language-gql"><span>Enumerating tables using Glide Query Language (GQL)</span><a href="#enumerating-tables-using-glide-query-language-gql"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>We identified that ServiceNow sent an XHR request to <code>xmlhttp.do</code> with the “ChartDataProcessor” processor in a GQL format. As previously mentioned, Glide Query Language is a language that is specifically used for ServiceNow, and the processors were scripts that run server-side that can be called through the XHR request. It is similar to SQL in the format structure sent in the POST request.</p>

<p>We identifed that the following parameters are of interest:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>table</code>: The specific database table used by the application.</li>
  <li><code>groupby</code>: Retrieves the rows from the specified column. This only retrieves the first 10 values used for rendering the chart/graph, however we can modify the “page_num” to enumerate all the values.</li>
  <li><code>filter</code>: Filtering the results retrieved from the GQL query.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leveraging this access control issue we enumerated a number of databases using Burp Suite Intruder and online documentation used by developers of ServiceNow third party plugins. This section of the test required a lot of trial and error to identify potentially useful tables, as there were hundreds of different tables containing varying degrees of sensitive data. We identified that the following tables were particularly interesting for a threat actor:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sys_db_object</code>: Retrieves the complete list of tables used by the application.</li>
  <li><code>sys_user</code>: List of all users</li>
  <li><code>sys_emails</code>: List of all emails</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the documentation, to be able to view ServiceNow tables we need to have read access to at least the ServiceNow tables <code>sys_db_object</code>, <code>sys_dictionary</code>, and <code>sys_glide_object</code>, and in addition to that to the tables you want to view, including referenced tables. However we were not allowed to access certain fields such as the <code>user_password</code> column in the <code>sys_user</code> table, as this would be an easy method to obtain privilege escalation against the system. Through further enumeration however, we were able to find two additional interesting tables, which will prove to be extremely useful later on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sys_user_session</code>: Retrieves the “glide_session_store” and “X-Usertoken” used by any account.</li>
  <li><code>sys_user_token</code>: Partially retrieves the “glide_user_activity” value.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="constructing-a-valid-session-to-escalate-privileges-to-administrator"><span>Constructing a valid session to escalate privileges to Administrator</span><a href="#constructing-a-valid-session-to-escalate-privileges-to-administrator"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>When testing the application and enumerating the database using the GQL language, we also noted that a valid authenticated session requires the following cookies/headers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First method: The <code>glide_user_activity</code> and <code>glide_session_store</code> cookies, and the <code>X-Usertoken</code> header to be correctly set, OR</li>
  <li>Second method: The <code>JSESSIONID</code> cookie and the <code>X-Usertoken</code> header to be correctly set.</li>
</ul>

<p>As it was possible to leak the tables we assumed that <code>sys_user_session</code> and <code>sys_user_token</code> would be all we needed to steal other accounts. While this was true there proved to be more nuance that made it more difficult to exploit.</p>

<p>The second method initially stood out since the knowledge of a <code>JSESSIONID</code> cookie and the <code>X-Usertoken</code> header would lead to an effective account takeover of any logged in administator user. Ultimately, we were unable to obtain the <code>JSESSIONID</code> from any table, however it may be possible to leverage XSS/CSRF for a successful account takeover, but this was never attempted because we were able to retrieve a valid pathway to exploitation using the first method. The steps are outlined as follows:</p>

<p>Firstly, we can use the following query to retrieve the <code>glide_session_store</code>, which is used to store session information for users. Each record represents a unique session for each user, as well as other related information:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user_session","groupby":"id","filter":"nameCONTAINS[Insert_Admin_Email_Here]^invalidatedISNULL","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>Note that the results are filtered by the name of the target user, which we can enumerate using the <code>sys_user</code> table - this can also help us determine who the administrators of the instance are. The <code>^invalidatedISNULL</code> removes all the invalidated or expired tokens.</p>

<p>Secondly, we need to retrieve the <code>X-Usertoken</code> value from the <code>sys_user_session</code> table, which is the CSRF token that the application provides users to ensure that requests made are genuine and not malicious. We require this token to make subsequent requests to the server.</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user_session","groupby":"csrf_token","filter":"nameCONTAINS[Insert_Admin_Email_Here]^invalidatedISNULL","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>The most difficult aspect was to determine a valid <code>glide_user_activity</code> token. A standard <code>glide_user_activity</code> token looks like this:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>U0N2M18xOmV4VFozT2Eyb2p0OVVWcXY5WktIeUl2L2h5MjFBMlY1d3RnRWkrUVpkZnM9Ok9NNzFIRDV1S0ZBMy90L1plMW5oQXk0OWliYVdBMXFlZUc5cmE3aGdPQ1E9
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>We can make the following request to retrieve the partial token from the database:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sysparm_request_params={"page_num":"0","series":[{"table":"sys_user_token","groupby":"token","filter":"nameCONTAINS[Insert_Admin_Email_Here]","plot_type":"horizontal_bar"}]}&amp;sysparm_processor=ChartDataProcessor 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>However the values that were retrieved from <code>sys_user_token</code> appeared as follows:</p>

<p><img width="967" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_error.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_error.png"></p>

<p>Each <code>glide_user_activity</code> token could be base64 decoded however, revealing that the value from <code>sys_user_token</code> was the first half of the token:</p>

<p><img width="967" alt="image" data-src="/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_decode.png" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://x64.sh/assets/images/ServiceNow_Images/jwt_decode.png"></p>

<p>Through trial and error, we determined that the signature section of the token was not sufficiently validated when sent to the server, and it was possible to simply replace or remove the second half of the token to create a valid token.</p>

<p>With all three requirements satisfied, it was then possible to takeover any account including administrative accounts with an active session on the ServiceNow instance. ServiceNow also implements impersonation to allow admin to login into any user account for debugging purposes, we were able to use the admin account to impersonate a spefical user admin account and grant our account admin privileges on the ServiceNow instance.</p>

<h2 id="ending-statement"><span>Ending Statement</span><a href="#ending-statement"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Overall, we were able to leverage several vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a standard user account to administrator of the ServiceNow instance. The following vulnerabilities allowed us to gain effective account takeover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insecure access control in the “ChartDataProcessor” processor</li>
  <li>Overly permissive read access to sensitive tables in ServiceNow database</li>
  <li>Insufficient signature validation of the <code>glide_user_activity</code> token</li>
</ul>

<p>While the root cause of the issue was due to a insecure access control, the other vulnerabilties discovered and chained together took a medium impact bug to a critical impact bug with a CVSS score of <em><code>9.9 - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&amp;version=3.1</code></em></p>

<h2 id="credits"><span>Credits</span><a href="#credits"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>The multiple vulnerabilities leading to full compromise of the ServiceNow instance were discovered by Luke Symons, Tony Wu, Eldar Marcussen, Gareth Phillips, Jeff Thomas, Nadeem Salim, and Stephen Bradshaw.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it
applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and their
uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and Godot
uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math is
essential to becoming a strong game developer.</p>

<h2>Coordinate systems (2D)<a href="#coordinate-systems-2d" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2D space, coordinates are defined using a horizontal axis (<code><span>x</span></code>) and a
vertical axis (<code><span>y</span></code>). A particular position in 2D space is written as a pair of
values such as <code><span>(4,</span> <span>3)</span></code>.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_axis1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_axis1.png">
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>If you're new to computer graphics, it might seem odd that the
positive <code><span>y</span></code> axis points <strong>downwards</strong> instead of upwards, as you
probably learned in math class. However, this is common in most
computer graphics applications.</p>
</div>
<p>Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this way.
However, we can also think of the position <code><span>(4,</span> <span>3)</span></code> as an <strong>offset</strong> from the
<code><span>(0,</span> <span>0)</span></code> point, or <strong>origin</strong>. Draw an arrow pointing from the origin to the
point:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_xy1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_xy1.png">
<p>This is a <strong>vector</strong>. A vector represents a lot of useful information. As well
as telling us that the point is at <code><span>(4,</span> <span>3)</span></code>, we can also think of it as an
angle <code><span>θ</span></code> (theta) and a length (or magnitude) <code><span>m</span></code>. In this case, the arrow
is a <strong>position vector</strong> - it denotes a position in space, relative to the
origin.</p>
<p>A very important point to consider about vectors is that they only represent
<strong>relative</strong> direction and magnitude. There is no concept of a vector's
position. The following two vectors are identical:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_xy2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_xy2.png">
<p>Both vectors represent a point 4 units to the right and 3 units below some
starting point. It does not matter where on the plane you draw the vector, it
always represents a relative direction and magnitude.</p>

<p>You can use either method (x and y coordinates or angle and magnitude) to refer
to a vector, but for convenience, programmers typically use the coordinate
notation. For example, in Godot, the origin is the top-left corner of the
screen, so to place a 2D node named <code><span>Node2D</span></code> 400 pixels to the right and 300
pixels down, use the following code:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-0-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-0-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>$</span><span>Node2D</span><span>.</span><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vector2</span><span>(</span><span>400</span><span>,</span> <span>300</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Godot supports both <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2"><span>Vector2</span></a> and <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector3.html#class-vector3"><span>Vector3</span></a> for 2D and 3D usage, respectively. The same mathematical rules
discussed in this article apply to both types, and wherever we link to
<code><span>Vector2</span></code> methods in the class reference, you can also check out their
<code><span>Vector3</span></code> counterparts.</p>

<h3>Adding vectors<a href="#adding-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When adding or subtracting two vectors, the corresponding components are added:</p>

<p>We can also see this visually by adding the second vector at the end of
the first:</p>

<section id="practical-applications">
<h2>Practical applications<a href="#practical-applications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at two common uses for vector addition and subtraction.</p>
<section id="movement">
<h3>Movement<a href="#movement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A vector can represent <strong>any</strong> quantity with a magnitude and direction. Typical
examples are: position, velocity, acceleration, and force. In this image, the
spaceship at step 1 has a position vector of <code><span>(1,</span> <span>3)</span></code> and a velocity vector of
<code><span>(2,</span> <span>1)</span></code>. The velocity vector represents how far the ship moves each step. We
can find the position for step 2 by adding the velocity to the current position.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_movement1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_movement1.png">
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Velocity measures the <strong>change</strong> in position per unit of time. The new
position is found by adding the velocity multiplied by the elapsed time
(here assumed to be one unit, e.g. 1 s) to the previous position.</p>
<p>In a typical 2D game scenario, you would have a velocity in pixels per
second, and multiply it by the <code><span>delta</span></code> parameter (time elapsed since
the previous frame) from the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-process"><span>_process()</span></a>
or <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-physics-process"><span>_physics_process()</span></a>
callbacks.</p>
</div>

<section id="pointing-toward-a-target">
<h3>Pointing toward a target<a href="#pointing-toward-a-target" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this scenario, you have a tank that wishes to point its turret at a robot.
Subtracting the tank's position from the robot's position gives the vector
pointing from the tank to the robot.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_subtract2.webp" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_subtract2.webp">
<div>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>To find a vector pointing from <code><span>A</span></code> to <code><span>B</span></code>, use <code><span>B</span> <span>-</span> <span>A</span></code>.</p>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="unit-vectors">
<h2>Unit vectors<a href="#unit-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A vector with <strong>magnitude</strong> of <code><span>1</span></code> is called a <strong>unit vector</strong>. They are also
sometimes referred to as <strong>direction vectors</strong> or <strong>normals</strong>. Unit vectors are
helpful when you need to keep track of a direction.</p>
<section id="normalization">
<h3>Normalization<a href="#normalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Normalizing</strong> a vector means reducing its length to <code><span>1</span></code> while preserving its
direction. This is done by dividing each of its components by its magnitude.
Because this is such a common operation, Godot provides a dedicated
<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-normalized"><span>normalized()</span></a> method for this:</p>

<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Because normalization involves dividing by the vector's length, you
cannot normalize a vector of length <code><span>0</span></code>. Attempting to do so
would normally result in an error. In GDScript though, trying to
call the <code><span>normalized()</span></code> method on a vector of length 0 leaves the
value untouched and avoids the error for you.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="reflection">
<h3>Reflection<a href="#reflection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A common use of unit vectors is to indicate <strong>normals</strong>. Normal vectors are unit
vectors aligned perpendicularly to a surface, defining its direction. They are
commonly used for lighting, collisions, and other operations involving surfaces.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we have a moving ball that we want to bounce off a wall or
other object:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_reflect1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_reflect1.png">
<p>The surface normal has a value of <code><span>(0,</span> <span>-1)</span></code> because this is a horizontal
surface. When the ball collides, we take its remaining motion (the amount left
over when it hits the surface) and reflect it using the normal. In Godot, there
is a <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-bounce"><span>bounce()</span></a> method to handle this.
Here is a code example of the above diagram using a <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d"><span>CharacterBody2D</span></a>:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-5-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-5-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>collision</span><span>:</span> <span>KinematicCollision2D</span> <span>=</span> <span>move_and_collide</span><span>(</span><span>velocity</span> <span>*</span> <span>delta</span><span>)</span>

<section id="dot-product">
<h2>Dot product<a href="#dot-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>dot product</strong> is one of the most important concepts in vector math, but is
often misunderstood. Dot product is an operation on two vectors that returns a
<strong>scalar</strong>. Unlike a vector, which contains both magnitude and direction, a
scalar value has only magnitude.</p>
<p>The formula for dot product takes two common forms:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_dot1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_dot1.png">
<p>and</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_dot2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_dot2.png">
<p>The mathematical notation <em>||A||</em> represents the magnitude of vector <code><span>A</span></code>, and
<em>A</em><sub>x</sub> means the <code><span>x</span></code> component of vector <code><span>A</span></code>.</p>
<p>However, in most cases it is easiest to use the built-in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-dot"><span>dot()</span></a> method. Note that the order of the two vectors does not matter:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-6-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-6-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>  <span># These are equivalent.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The dot product is most useful when used with unit vectors, making the first
formula reduce to just <code><span>cos(θ)</span></code>. This means we can use the dot product to tell
us something about the angle between two vectors:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_dot3.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_dot3.png">
<p>When using unit vectors, the result will always be between <code><span>-1</span></code> (180°) and
<code><span>1</span></code> (0°).</p>
<section id="facing">
<h3>Facing<a href="#facing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We can use this fact to detect whether an object is facing toward another
object. In the diagram below, the player <code><span>P</span></code> is trying to avoid the zombies
<code><span>A</span></code> and <code><span>B</span></code>. Assuming a zombie's field of view is <strong>180°</strong>, can they see the
player?</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_facing2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_facing2.png">
<p>The green arrows <code><span>fA</span></code> and <code><span>fB</span></code> are <strong>unit vectors</strong> representing the
zombie's facing direction and the blue semicircle represents its field of view.
For zombie <code><span>A</span></code>, we find the direction vector <code><span>AP</span></code> pointing to the player
using <code><span>P</span> <span>-</span> <span>A</span></code> and normalize it, however, Godot has a helper method to do this
called <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-direction-to"><span>direction_to()</span></a>. If the angle
between this vector and the facing vector is less than 90°, then the zombie can
see the player.</p>
<p>In code it would look like this:</p>
<div aria-labelledby="tab-7-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" id="panel-7-R0RTY3JpcHQ=" name="R0RTY3JpcHQ=" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0"><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>AP</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>direction_to</span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span>)</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"A sees P!"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="cross-product">
<h2>Cross product<a href="#cross-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like the dot product, the <strong>cross product</strong> is an operation on two vectors.
However, the result of the cross product is a vector with a direction that is
perpendicular to both. Its magnitude depends on their relative angle. If two
vectors are parallel, the result of their cross product will be a null vector.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/vector_cross1.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_cross1.png">
<img alt="../../_images/vector_cross2.png" src="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/vector_cross2.png">

</pre></div>
<p>With Godot, you can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector3.html#class-vector3-method-cross"><span>Vector3.cross()</span></a>
method:</p>

<p>The cross product is not mathematically defined in 2D. The <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2-method-cross"><span>Vector2.cross()</span></a> method is a commonly used analog of the 3D cross
product for 2D vectors.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>In the cross product, order matters. <code><span>a.cross(b)</span></code> does not give the
same result as <code><span>b.cross(a)</span></code>. The resulting vectors point in
<strong>opposite</strong> directions.</p>
</div>
<section id="calculating-normals">
<h3>Calculating normals<a href="#calculating-normals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One common use of cross products is to find the surface normal of a plane or
surface in 3D space. If we have the triangle <code><span>ABC</span></code> we can use vector
subtraction to find two edges <code><span>AB</span></code> and <code><span>AC</span></code>. Using the cross product,
<code><span>AB</span> <span>×</span> <span>AC</span></code> produces a vector perpendicular to both: the surface normal.</p>
<p>Here is a function to calculate a triangle's normal:</p>

<h3>Pointing to a target<a href="#pointing-to-a-target" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the dot product section above, we saw how it could be used to find the angle
between two vectors. However, in 3D, this is not enough information. We also
need to know what axis to rotate around. We can find that by calculating the
cross product of the current facing direction and the target direction. The
resulting perpendicular vector is the axis of rotation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>When the marital infidelity website <strong>AshleyMadison.com</strong> learned in July 2015 that hackers were threatening to publish data stolen from 37 million users, the company’s then-CEO <strong>Noel Biderman</strong> was quick to point the finger at an unnamed former contractor. But as a new documentary series on <strong>Hulu</strong> reveals [<em>SPOILER ALERT!</em>], there was just one problem with that theory: Their top suspect had killed himself more than a year before the hackers began publishing stolen user data.</p>
<p>The new documentary, <em>The Ashley Madison Affair</em>, begins airing today on Hulu in the United States and on <strong>Disney+</strong> in the United Kingdom. The series features interviews with security experts and journalists, Ashley Madison executives, victims of the breach and jilted spouses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair.png" alt="" width="749" height="515" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair.png 1088w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair-768x528.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair-782x538.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amaffair-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>The series also touches on shocking new details unearthed by KrebsOnSecurity and <strong>Jeremy Bullock</strong>, a data scientist who worked with the show’s producers at the Warner Bros. production company Wall to Wall Media. Bullock had spent many hours poring over the hundreds of thousands of emails that the Ashley Madison hackers stole from Biderman and published online in 2015.</p>
<p>Wall to Wall reached out in July 2022 about collaborating with Bullock after KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-retrospective-on-the-2015-ashley-madison-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Retrospective on the 2015 Ashley Madison Breach</a>. That piece explored how Biderman — who is Jewish — had become the target of concerted harassment campaigns by anti-Semitic and far-right groups online in the months leading up to the hack.</p>
<p>Whoever hacked Ashley Madison had access to all employee emails, but they only released Biderman’s messages — three years worth. Apropos of my retrospective report, Bullock found that a great many messages in Biderman’s inbox were belligerent and anti-Semitic screeds from a former Ashley Madison employee named <strong>William Brewster Harrison</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_64160"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64160" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/willhired.png" alt="" width="622" height="726"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64160">William Harrison’s employment contract with Ashley Madison parent Avid Life Media.</p></div>
<p>The messages show that Harrison was hired in March 2010 to help promote Ashley Madison online, but the messages also reveal Harrison was heavily involved in helping to create and cultivate phony female accounts on the service.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that in 2010 Harrison was directed to harass the owner of <strong>Ashleymadisonsucks.com </strong>into closing the site or selling the domain to Ashley Madison.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison’s parent company — Toronto-based <strong>Avid Life Media</strong> — filed a trademark infringement complaint in 2010 that succeeded in revealing a man named <strong>Dennis Bradshaw</strong> as the owner. But after being informed that Bradshaw was not subject to Canadian trademark laws, Avid Life offered to buy AshleyMadisonSucks.com for $10,000.</p>
<p>When Bradshaw refused to sell the domain, he and his then-girlfriend were subject to an unrelenting campaign of online harassment and blackmail. It now appears those attacks were perpetrated by Harrison, who sent emails from different accounts at the free email service <strong>Vistomail</strong> pretending to be Bradshaw, his then-girlfriend and their friends.</p>
<p>[As the documentary points out, the domain AshleyMadisonSucks.com was eventually transferred to Ashley Madison, which then shrewdly used it for advertising and to help debunk theories about why its service was supposedly untrustworthy].<span id="more-63941"></span></p>
<p>Harrison even went after Bradshaw’s lawyer and wife, listing them both on a website he created called <strong>Contact-a-CEO[.]com</strong>, which Harrison used to besmirch the name of major companies — including several past employers — all entities he believed had slighted him or his family in some way. The site also claimed to include the names, addresses and phone numbers of top CEOs.</p>

<p>An exhaustive analysis of domains registered to the various Vistomail pseudonyms used by Harrison shows he also ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090203030040/http://www.bash-a-business.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Bash-a-Business[.]com</strong></a>, which Harrison dedicated to “all those sorry ass corporate executives out there profiting from your hard work, organs, lives, ideas, intelligence, and wallets.” Copies of the site at archive.org show it was the work of someone calling themselves “<strong>The Chaos Creator</strong>.”</p>
<p>Will Harrison was terminated as an Ashley Madison employee in November 2011, and by early 2012 he’d turned his considerable harassment skills squarely against the company. Ashley Madison’s long-suspected army of fake female accounts came to the fore in August 2012 after the former sex worker turned activist and blogger <strong>Maggie McNeill</strong> <a href="https://maggiemcneill.com/2012/08/15/show-and-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published screenshots</a> apparently taken from Ashley Madison’s internal systems suggesting that a large percentage of the female accounts on the service were computer-operated bots.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison’s executives understood that only a handful of employees at the time would have had access to the systems needed to produce the screenshots McNeill published online. In one exchange on Aug. 16, 2012, Ashley Madison’s director of IT was asked to produce a list of all company employees with all-powerful administrator access.</p>
<p>“Who or what is <strong>asdfdfsda@asdf.com</strong>?,” Biderman asked, after being sent a list of nine email addresses.</p>
<p>“It appears to be the email address Will used for his profiles,” the IT director replied.</p>
<p>“And his access was never shut off until today?,” asked the company’s general counsel Mike Dacks.</p>

<p>What prompted the data scientist Bullock to reach out were gobs of anti-Semitic diatribes from Harrison, who had taken to labeling Biderman and others “greedy Jew bastards.”</p>
<p>“So good luck, I’m sure we’ll talk again soon, but for now, Ive got better things in the oven,” Harrison wrote to Biderman after his employment contract with Ashley Madison was terminated. “Just remember I outsmarted you last time and I will outsmart and out maneuver you this time too, by keeping myself far far away from the action and just enjoying the sideline view, cheering for the opposition.”</p>

<p>Harrison signed his threatening missive with the salutation, “We are legion,” suggesting that whatever comeuppance he had in store for Ashley Madison would come from a variety of directions and anonymous hackers.</p>
<p>The leaked Biderman emails show that Harrison made good on his threats, and that in the months that followed Harrison began targeting Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives with menacing anonymous emails and spoofed phone calls laced with profanity and anti-Semitic language.</p>
<p>But on Mar. 5, 2014, Harrison committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a handgun. This fact was apparently unknown to Biderman and other Ashley Madison executives more than a year later when their July 2015 hack was first revealed.</p>
<p>Does Harrison’s untimely suicide rule him out as a suspect in the 2015 hack? Who is The Chaos Creator, and what else transpired between Harrison and Ashley Madison prior to his death? We’ll explore these questions in Part II of this story, to be published early next week.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Let's pretend I've decided to build a spice rack.</p>
      <p>I've done small woodworking projects before, and I think I have a pretty good idea of what I need: some wood and a few basic tools: a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer.</p>
      <p>If I were going to build a whole house, rather than just a spice rack, I'd still need a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer (among other things).</p>
      <p>So I go to the hardware store to buy the tools, and I ask the sales clerk where I can find a hammer.</p>
      <p>"A hammer?" he asks. "Nobody really buys hammers anymore. They're kind of old fashioned."</p>
      <p>Surprised at this development, I ask him why.</p>
      <p>"Well, the problem with hammers is that there are so many different kinds. Sledge hammers, claw hammers, ball-peen hammers. What if you bought one kind of hammer and then realized that you needed a different kind of hammer later? You'd have to buy a separate hammer for your next task. As it turns out, most people really want a single hammer that can handle all of the different kinds of hammering tasks you might encounter in your life."</p>
      <p>"Hmmmmmm. Well, I suppose that sounds all right. Can you show me where to find a Universal Hammer."</p>
      <p>"No, we don't sell those anymore. They're pretty obsolete."</p>
      <p>"Really? I thought you just said that the Universal Hammer was the wave of the future."</p>
      <p>"As it turns out, if you make only one kind of hammer, capable of performing all the same tasks as all those different kinds of hammers, then it isn't very good at any of them. Driving a nail with a sledgehammer isn't very effective. And, if you want to kill someone, there's really no substitute for a ball-peen hammer."</p>
      <p>"That's true. So, if nobody buys Universal Hammers anymore, and if you're no longer selling all those old-fashioned kinds of hammers, what kinds of hammers do you sell?"</p>
      <p>"Actually, we don't sell hammers at all."</p>
      <p>"So..."</p>
      <p>"According to our research, what people really needed wasn't a Universal Hammer after all. It's always better to have the right kind of hammer for the job. So, we started selling hammer factories, capable of producing whatever kind of hammers you might be interested in using. All you need to do is staff the hammer factory with workers, activate the machinery, buy the raw materials, pay the utility bills, and PRESTO...you'll have exactly the kind of hammer you need in no time flat."</p>
      <p>"But I don't really want to buy a hammer factory..."</p>
      <p>"That's good. Because we don't sell them anymore."</p>
      <p>"But I thought you just said..."</p>
      <p>"We discovered that most people don't actually need an entire hammer factory. Some people, for example, will never need a ball-peen hammer. (Maybe they've never had to kill someone. Or maybe they killed them with icepicks instead.) So there's no point in someone buying a hammer factory that can produce every kind of hammer under the sun."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."</p>
      <p>"So, instead, we started selling schematic diagrams for hammer factories, enabling our clients to build their own hammer factories, custom engineered to manufacture only the kinds of hammers that they would actually need."</p>
      <p>"Let me guess. You don't sell those anymore."</p>
      <p>"Nope. Sure don't. As it turns out, people don't want to build an entire factory just to manufacture a couple of hammers. Leave the factory-building up to the factory-building experts, that's what I always say!!"</p>
      <p>"And I would agree with you there."</p>
      <p>"Yup. So we stopped selling those schematics and started selling hammer-factory-building factories. Each hammer factory factory is built for you by the top experts in the hammer factory factory business, so you don't need to worry about all the details that go into building a factory. Yet you still get all the benefits of having your own customized hammer factory, churning out your own customized hammers, according to your own specific hammer designs."</p>
      <p>"Well, that doesn't really..."</p>
      <p>"I know what you're going to say!! ...and we don't sell those anymore either. For some reason, not many people were buying the hammer factory factories, so we came up with a new solution to address the problem."</p>
      <p>"Uh huh."</p>
      <p>"When we stepped back and looked at the global tool infrastructure, we determined that people were frustrated with having to manage and operate a hammer factory factory, as well as the hammer factory that it produced. That kind of overhead can get pretty cumbersome when you deal with the likely scenario of also operating a tape measure factory factory, a saw factory factory, and a level factory factory, not to mention a lumber manufacturing conglomerate holding company. When we really looked at the situation, we determined that that's just too complex for someone who really just wants to build a spice rack."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, no kidding."</p>
      <p>"So this week, we're introducing a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory, so that all of your different tool factory factories can be produced by a single, unified factory. The factory factory factory will produce only the tool factory factories that you actually need, and each of those factory factories will produce a single factory based on your custom tool specifications. The final set of tools that emerge from this process will be the ideal tools for your particular project. You'll have exactly the hammer you need, and exactly the right tape measure for your task, all at the press of a button (though you may also have to deploy a few configuration files to make it all work according to your expectations)."</p>
      <p>"So you don't have any hammers? None at all?"</p>
      <p>"No. If you really want a high-quality, industrially engineered spice rack, you desperately need something more advanced than a simple hammer from a rinky-dink hardware store."</p>
      <p>"And this is the way everyone is doing it now? Everyone is using a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory now, whenever they need a hammer?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>"Well all right. I guess that's what I'll have to do. If this is the way things are done now, I guess I'd better learn how to do it."</p>
      <p>"Good for you!!"</p>
      <p>"This thing comes with documentation, right?"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‘Eutychis, a Greek lass with sweet ways, <span>2 asses.’</span> This pithy graffito advertising sex for sale comes from the walls of Pompeii. The ancient Roman city was already an old town when it was destroyed in the <a href="https://aeon.co/videos/from-eruption-to-obliteration-the-sights-and-sounds-of-48-fateful-hours-in-pompeii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eruption</a> of Mount Vesuvius in <span>August 79 CE</span> – and thus preserved for posterity. Located on the Bay of Naples, near the mouth of the river Sarno, there are early signs of Etruscan culture, though the area was later settled by Oscan-speaking Samnites, who began the town’s real growth after around <span>200 BCE.</span> The land around Pompeii was fertile, and the city and region grew wealthy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/2599/insert-Eutychis-graffito-FwJ2W-IX0AEtokP.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p>‘Eutychis, a Greek lass with sweet ways, 2 asses’; grafitto at the entrance to the Lupanar, Pompeii. <a href="http://pompeiisites.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Photo courtesy Pompeii Sites</a></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>As Rome expanded its power throughout Italy, Pompeii became a Roman city, though one that retained a diverse population. We can imagine a busy place of some 12,000 people, rich and poor, free and enslaved, of public squares, fountains and gardens, fine houses and poorer dwellings, taverns, shops and workshops, and a stone amphitheatre for the provision of large-scale public entertainment. There would have been a clamour of Oscan, Greek and Latin, and all the activities we would expect from a thriving town – politics, business, love, crime.</p>
<p>Graffiti is one of the most exciting kinds of evidence preserved for us by the destruction of Pompeii, because it comes not from the literature of the elite, or the inscriptions of the powerful, but from a wider cross-section of society. The Eutychis graffito gives us a woman’s name, an ethnicity, a price, the hint of a good time to be had – and suggests a seamy side to the ruined town now frequented by inquisitive tourists and keen culture-vultures. It was written on the vestibule wall of a well-to-do house owned by two freedmen, the Vettii, which is perhaps best known to the world for its painting of the well-endowed Priapus weighing his member on a balance against a bag of coins. While brief and to the point, this announcement, calling out to us from nearly <span>2,000 years</span> ago, can set us on a journey to understanding more about the life of Pompeii’s haves and have-nots. At the same time, it may well leave us with more questions than answers about Eutychis herself and the prostitutes of Pompeii.</p>

<p><span>P</span>ompeii, often seen under the bright sun with hordes of other visitors, does not hide its darker side – in fact, the single purpose-built <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/brothel-of-pompeii/30A33063D0317A93E86D821FCDF86A79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brothel</a> identified in the city, known as the Lupanar, is one of its most popular attractions. The sexy frescoes are one highlight. Eight can be seen above the doorways of the little cubicles with their masonry ‘beds’. Five or six are female-male sex scenes, another shows a woman standing next to a reclining man as she points at an erotic picture, and the last depicts the god Priapus with two erect phalluses. These show something very basic and timeless that we have in common with ancient Pompeiians – sex – but they also titillate the visitor and sometimes prompt dirty jokes from both guides and visitors. The frescoes presumably indicate the kind of activities that were available to customers, and helped in creating an erotically charged atmosphere.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Thanks to the graffiti in the brothel, we even know the names of some of the women who worked there: Anedia, Aplonia, Atthis, Beronice, Cadia, Cressa, Drauca, Fabia, Faustilla, Felicla, Fortunata, Habenda, Helpis, Ianuaria, Ias, Mola, Murtis, Myrtale, Mysis, Nais, Panta, Restituta, Rusatia, Scepsis, Victoria, and the daughter of Salvius. Eutychis does not appear in the list, although it might well be that those were working names; some of them appear in graffiti elsewhere in town.</p>
<p>They were on display naked with prices, to be perused, evaluated and chosen by the male clientele</p>
<p>How would Pompeiians and other visitors have experienced the brothel? We can learn something of this from a fragmentary literary text called <em>The Satyricon</em>, written in the <span>1st century CE</span> by an elite Roman called Petronius. In the scene, the male character Encolpius has become lost in town. An old woman tricks him into entering the brothel, whereupon:</p>
<blockquote>I noticed some men and naked women walking cautiously about among placards of price. Too late, too late I realised that I had been taken into a bawdy-house. I cursed the cunning old woman, and covered my head, and began to run through the brothel to another part, when just at the entrance Ascyltos met me, as tired as I was, and half-dead. It looked as though the same old lady had brought him there. I hailed him with a laugh, and asked him what he was doing in such an unpleasant spot.</blockquote>
<blockquote>He mopped himself with his hands and said: ‘If you only knew what has happened to me.’ ‘What is it?’ I said. ‘Well,’ he said, on the point of fainting, ‘I was wandering all over the town without finding where I had left my lodgings, when a respectable person came up to me and very kindly offered to direct me. He took me round a number of dark turnings and brought me out here, and then began to offer me money and solicit me. A woman got threepence out of me for a room, and he had already seized me. The worst would have happened if I had not been stronger <span>than he.’</span> </blockquote>
<p>Petronius was writing comedy, but there is no reason to dispute the incidental details, which can bring the Lupanar to life. His description suggests brothels would be located in more out-of-the-way parts of town and were not necessarily identifiable from the outside; the prostitutes and punters were screened from the outside world by a curtain. It also reveals that people could be enticed or tricked into visiting – presumably chaperones who drummed up trade got a fee. The prostitutes themselves were on display naked with prices, to be perused, evaluated and chosen by the male clientele. Cubicles or rooms could be rented out for <span>private use.</span></p>
<p><span>T</span>he Roman poet Horace wrote about men’s choice of sexual partners in one of his satires, where he is pointing out the follies of some men – especially in hankering after or having affairs with elite or married women. He suggests that prostitutes are a much more sensible choice when a man had need of sex. For one thing, their faces and bodies are visible, he says. In contrast to respectable women, whose bodies were well covered, prostitutes’ clothes could be revealing, allowing the man to view what he might want to buy and use. And, during the encounter, Horace says, a man might call the prostitute by any name – she could be expected to cater better to man’s fantasies. Horace, at least in character, preferred these women to be fair and natural, smartly turned out, prompt and inexpensive.</p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Satyricon</em> begins to fill in the details of the lives and environment of some prostitutes – those who worked in brothels, at least – but, so far, from the text and the paintings we have something of a light-hearted view of what went on. However, the reality of the women in the brothel, naked and carrying their price placards, was a grim one: their bodies put to use for the profit of the brothel’s owners, their physical and emotional work performed in tiny open cubicles or sex booths. Most of them were slaves, who had little choice in what they were doing, at the mercy of their owners and customers. Poorer free women too were vulnerable and had probably been driven to prostitution by <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/LEWTML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessity</a>. About a fifth of the women’s names in the brothel indicate they were free.</p>
<p>Slavery was an accepted institution in the Roman Empire, and slaves of all kinds – agricultural workers, urban house slaves, labourers, miners, teachers (and prostitutes) – were everywhere. Some few slaves may have lived relatively privileged lives, and others had a degree of independence in their work and life, within the confines of being owned; some could even hope to be made free. But there are also sombre reminders of the less fortunate. Columella, also writing in the <span>1st century CE,</span> explained how slaves on the farm should be treated and managed. He recommended their constant supervision and physical restraint in chains and in slave prisons (<em>ergastula</em>), as well as keeping control over where they could go, whom they could see, and also their bathing, religious practices and sex. What was the regime like for slave prostitutes in the Lupanar?</p>
<p>Slaves often had no space of their own but were simply part of the furniture</p>
<p>Enslaved people <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-slavery/slavery-under-the-principate/647C25DFE34A68277B2A467E20842DF2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be</a> denied a love or sex life of their own but also be forced to reproduce (a source of new slaves), while female slaves might be forced into sex to help control male slaves. Sexual abuse and rape by owners was one particular vulnerability of slaves, female and male, child and adult. Many slaves could expect to be used sexually by their owners as a matter of course, perhaps household slaves in particular given their proximity. In another satire, Horace gives the line: ‘When your organ is stiff, and a servant girl or a young boy from the household is near at hand and you know you can make an immediate assault, would you sooner burst with tension?’ He also wrote an ode on the topic, advising his friend not to be ashamed of loving his slave when Achilles and other heroes did the same. A gold armband from Pompeii hints at this kind of relationship; it carries the legend ‘from the master to his slave girl’. Yet as well as perhaps being an earnest gift, it was also a reminder of who was who in the relationship. Sometimes, slaves may have been able to leverage sex to their advantage.</p>
<p>Archaeology furnishes more tangible evidence of the life of the enslaved. The relative absence of slave quarters in elite houses suggests that slaves often had no space of their own but were simply part of the furniture. They may have hidden and slept where they could, including making use of the spaces under staircases and dark and unpleasant cellars. These cellars could have other uses too. At Pompeii, in the Villa of the Mosaic Columns, the skeleton of a slave was found in a cellar with iron shackles anchored into the ground. This seems to have been a slave prison. Leg irons were <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203866191-47/lives-slaves-michele-george" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> in a cupboard in the House of the Venus in Bikini, perhaps a half-hidden but lingering threat to coerce slaves into good behaviour. Beatings and whippings and the threat of <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/8769247/topography_of_violence_in_the_greco_roman_world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">violence</a> were commonplace means of control and punishment by <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/were-roman-slaveowners-the-first-management-theorists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slaveowners</a>. There was not only the physical <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/patriarchy-property-and-death-in-the-roman-family/whips-and-words-discipline-and-punishment-in-the-roman-household/CB53D2255044004F8C86F3DF72F9D649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pain</a> involved, but also the humiliation of such a personal affront, which the victim was powerless to prevent. Compulsion and coercion were enforced psychologically as well as physically. Perhaps the Lupanar had its own ‘bouncers’, ready to deal with any trouble from customers or from the women themselves.</p>
<p>Enslaved people did resist and some did manage to run away. One nameless slave from Bulla Regia, in north Africa, was put in a lead collar inscribed: ‘This is a cheating whore! Seize her because she escaped from Bulla Regia.’ The collar was found with a skeleton in the Temple of Apollo. Nobody knows the name of the woman who wore it. Did she die seeking shelter in the abandoned temple? Was this her first attempt to flee or had she tried before and then been collared? This woman is almost lost in history, unknown apart from the symbol of her captivity.</p>

<p>There are some 45 <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.3764/aja.120.3.0447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known</a> slave collars. Many mention the name, occupation and location of the slave’s owner, but never the slave. For example, a bronze tag from a slave collar from Rome announced: ‘Hold me because I have run away and return me to the Caelimontium to the house of Elpidius, <em>vir clarissimus</em>, to Bonosus.’ Its other side said: ‘Hold me and return me to the Forum of Mars, to Maximianus the antiquary.’ It seems the tag had been reused. An iron collar from Rome also offers a reward: ‘I have run away; hold me. When you have brought me back to my master Zoninus, you will receive a gold coin.’</p>
<p><span>S</span>o who was Eutychis? Was she a prostitute, an enslaved woman, both or neither? Was she forced into selling herself? Let us think first of her name. Eutychis is a Greek name that roughly translates to ‘fortunate’, and was in use throughout the Greek-speaking world. Although the graffito surely refers to a real person, we don’t know whether it was her real name, or a slave name, or a working name. If she was a free woman working as a prostitute, she may have chosen Eutychis as her pseudonym; if she was a slave, the name may have been given to her by her owner. Renaming a slave with something cheerful and Greek was a common <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-slavery/roman-slave-supply/F42FF85C3DF0587EF1E1375C25B0359E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practice</a> of the Romans.</p>
<p>This act of renaming an enslaved person could affect them in various ways. It robbed the enslaved person of a key aspect of their own identity and replaced it with a sometimes cruel name that emphasised their status as property. A slave prostitute named ‘fortunate’ or ‘lucky’ was probably anything but. Another slave in the House of the Vettii was called ‘Eros’ (‘desire’). The graffito that mentions him reads: ‘Eros likes to be sexually passive,’ but it was later scratched out<strong>)</strong>. Nowadays, we might see this as an aspect of coercive control, an ongoing rite of abuse and humiliation. However, renaming could also allow the enslaved person to retain a separate, inner ‘core’ identity linked with their own ‘private’ name. An unhappy possibility is that we know ‘Eutychis’ only by the name her owner gave her, and she remains, in this sense, <a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/invisible-romans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invisible</a>.</p>
<p>The second part of the graffito stresses Eutychis’ Greekness. Should we read the label of ‘Greek’ simply as a statement of fact, or could it have a different significance? If the graffito were written by her owner or a pimp, then it could be that both the name and the ethnic label were given to increase Eutychis’ appeal by generating a sense of exoticism – although Pompeii had quite a mixed heritage and attracted all kinds of visitors. Were Greek women fetishised as sex objects by some Pompeiian males? The fetishisation and sexualisation of groups of women (and men), based on ethnicity or race, is well known still, so it is not impossible.</p>
<p>A prostitute would have had to appear cheerful, coy or aroused, depending on the circumstances</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps ‘a Greek lass’ would have appealed to Greeks travelling through the town or Greek-heritage Pompeiians, such as Mousaios or Epagathus, named in graffiti from the Lupanar, or Pyrrhus or Chius, <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315744155/graffiti-antiquity-peter-keegan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known</a> in graffiti from the Basilica at Pompeii. Mousaios’ name was written in Greek rather than Latin, one of a number of Greek graffiti found around the city. Either way, the choice and statement of both her name and ethnicity could have been deliberate business strategies rather than factual biographical details.</p>
<p>The advert also stresses Eutychis’ ‘sweet ways’ (<em>moribus bellis</em>)<em>.</em> This is found on a number of graffiti in Pompeii. In the Lupanar, we find ‘Restitua with sweet ways’. Other prostitutes, such as Spes, Successa, and Menander, a man, are so labelled. This label suggests a good time in an indirect fashion, perhaps good company as well as a sexual service. Indeed, Sarah Levin-Richardson <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7560/765610-011/html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reminds</a> us that prostitution could also involve emotional as well as physical labour. A prostitute would likely have had to run the gamut of emotions, appearing cheerful, coy or aroused, enticing and passionate, pliable or dominant, depending on the circumstances. This contrasts with some of the other graffiti around the town that elaborates on the specific services offered, especially fellatio <span>and sex.</span></p>
<p>Finally, what of the price of two <em>asses </em>(copper coins)? It seems low; the same price as a loaf of bread. Recorded prices for prostitutes varied, but most tend to be from one to five <em>asses</em>. Two <em>asses</em> seems to have been a common price at Pompeii and may have been a kind of standard low rate. Price could reflect a number of factors. It would be calculated to attract a high volume of customers, or it may reflect the age and perceived appeal of the woman. It could have been used as a punishment. Perhaps there was an element of haggling possible once a punter had expressed an interest. Independent prostitutes may have had little means to protect themselves and enforce payment.</p>
<p>We should also consider what the location of the graffito adds to the story. The text was written on the left wall of the vestibule of the House of the Vettii. The Vettii are usually thought of as brothers, Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus, who were freed slaves who took on the name of their former master, Aulus Vettius. Their names were on bronze seals found near a large wooden strongbox in the house, along with a ring with the initials ‘AVC’. In graffiti on the outside of the house, Conviva is named as an <em>Augustalis</em>, a priestly position open to former slaves, while Restitutus urges voters to support one Sabinus. Whether they were brothers, father and son, friends or coworkers can’t really be known, but they seem to have had some wealth and privilege, including their well-decorated town house. The Priapus painting emphasises the Vettii’s wealth, as Priapus was a god of fertility – besides the member and the money, the painting shows his basket of fruit on the ground. Two of the ‘funny’ stories associated with him, related by the poet Ovid, have him failing to rape the goddess Hestia and a nymph called Lotis.</p>

<p>The other paintings in the House of the Vettii may tell us more about the life of the house and its inhabitants, and shed light on Eutychis. One careful <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2012.01697.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysis</a> by Beth Severy-Hoven focuses in particular on the sets of paintings found in a pair of reception rooms, called ‘<em>n</em>’ and ‘<em>p</em>’. The rooms and their decorative scheme seem to mirror each other. Room <em>n</em> has two violent paintings. On the back wall is a depiction of the punishment of Pentheus, who was killed by the female worshippers of Dionysus. The naked Pentheus is falling, arms spread wide as the women attack him from all sides. On the wall on the right, the punishment of Dirce is shown. She is tied, naked, under a bull to be trampled to death, a fate she had planned for another woman, Antiope.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Room <em>p</em> shows the punishment of Ixion at the back, who was tied to a fiery wheel for eternity for trying to rape Hera, and the punishment of Pasiphae, made (for her husband’s crimes) to lust after a bull, on the left. Each room, then, shows the torture of a female and a male character from mythology. Those in room <em>n</em> were punished by humans, and those in <em>p</em> by the gods.</p>
<p>Severy-Hoven argues that we can read the decoration from the perspective of the Vettii being freed slaves and from a perspective of power. As we already noted, enslaved people were there to be used sexually and were likely to be punished in numerous ways, which may have been something the Vettii themselves experienced. The Vettii’s choice of these images of punisher and punished to decorate their public dining rooms would call to mind the distinction between master and slave – both for themselves and for their slaves. As Severy-Hoven puts it: ‘When the owner selected these images of eroticised torture, he was inscribing his own power to punish or to enjoy onto his very walls.’</p>
<p><span>W</span>as Eutychis a house-slave of the Vettii? It is possible. One clue from that graffito itself is that it may first have read ‘verna’ rather than ‘Graeca’ – that is ‘homeborn slave’ rather than ‘Greek lass’. If she was, it is not unlikely that she would have been a target of sexual advances by the Vettii and their friends. Did the Vettii also pimp out their house slave Eutychis? One ancient novel, <em>The Golden Ass</em> by Apuleius, tells of a young woman called Charite, who has been kidnapped by bandits. When she is caught trying to escape, one of the bandits suggests selling her to a brothel or to pimps in a nearby town. As he says to the bandits, ‘seeing her servicing men in a whorehouse will be sweet revenge for you’. Sex in various ways could be a punishment. Daily life as a slave in the House of the Vettii may have been a constant fight to remain unmolested and unpunished, a fight to retain a degree of control and dignity.</p>
<p>The house may have been home to Eutychis, but it was no brothel like the Lupanar. However, one thing that has puzzled scholars about the House of the Vettii is the existence of a little room behind and only accessible from the kitchen, known as <em>x</em>1. This room is of interest because it is decorated with three large erotic paintings, yet it is hidden away in a service area. Was this the place where Eutychis had sex with customers, making more money on the side for the Vettii? It is possible, but such an activity might not have benefitted the owner’s public reputation. Or were the paintings a gift to a good cook or other slave, who had the use of the room? Alternatively, were they a reminder to the enslaved staff, who may have slept there, of their sexual availability and vulnerability and their lack of power in the house? Another <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/2798142/economy_of_prostitution_in_the_roman_world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea</a> is that such rooms, of which there are perhaps six at Pompeii, were private ‘sex clubs’, rooms that conjured up the brothel atmosphere but were not open to the public. Perhaps Eutychis was required to serve her masters in this grim fantasy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, was the Eutychis graffito a real advert at all? We can’t rule out the possibility that it was simply a malicious daubing, in a way familiar from subway graffiti today. The Greek satirical writer Lucian, writing in his <em>Dialogues of the Courtesans</em> in the <span>2nd century CE,</span> mentioned that graffiti could be used as a joke, to mislead or to stir up trouble between lovers. Maybe Eutychis was a real Greek girl, perhaps even with sweet ways, but she need not have been a prostitute or even a slave. A rejected suitor or jilted lover might have written it in a place that she, and those who knew her, would see it. Perhaps this implies she did have some kind of connection with the House of the Vettii, but we cannot say for certain if she was a house-slave there.</p>
<p>The single graffito we began with has taken us on a journey through some of the darker aspects of life in Pompeii: the grittiness of the Lupanar, the ever-present threat for the enslaved of sexual assault and violence, being chained to the floor of a basement in pain and terror, being owned and being used. It is difficult to conjure these horrors while visiting the sun-baked town with its busloads of bright-shirted and good-natured tourists, or marvelling at the beautiful art and architecture in glossy books. We will never really know for sure about Eutychis, beyond the fact that there was a woman attached to the name. We may never know what life in the House of the Vettii was really like for its inhabitants, either. But we can keep trying to read the evidence to find the stories that bring the lives of Pompeii’s less fortunate into the light.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The compose portion of the dex is relatively small (~130 KB) compared to the overall dex size.

<p dir="auto">Please file an <a href="https://github.com/akutruff/typescript-needs-types/issues">issue</a> or send a PR to add to this list.   Even if it's your own project and it has zero stars, you had to deal with this, so it goes on the list.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Problem</h3>
<p dir="auto">Dear TS team,</p>
<p dir="auto">I love you.  You do amazing work.  You are gods among mortals.  You have brought JavaScript from the darkness, and given it the warm light of strong typing.   Look upon us, the cowering meek masses, and understand that we live in the muck and mire of a world where we are doomed to endlessly crawl on our bellies through the alleys of Github <a href="https://youtu.be/deDlab6vFgg?t=134" rel="nofollow">seeking the one true npm</a>.  We will forever wonder in the dark, until we have a type reflection model.</p>
<p dir="auto">Serialization and validation without a reflective type system just doesn't work in the real world without endless boilerplate, or <em>shiver</em>, bespoke code generation from a schema file.  The best solutions I could find are <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod">zod</a>, etc.  <a href="https://github.com/akutruff/typescript-needs-types/blob/main/the-unfortunate-list-of-projects-working-around-this-issue">The ever growing list above.</a>  The most courageous of us even resort to babel, but only to face the consequences.  Someone even wrote a <a href="https://itnext.io/bringing-typescript-types-at-runtime-with-typeonly-c317e9dd8880" rel="nofollow">new language</a> extending TypeScript to work around this.  We have to declare our types in a round about library-bespoke way that is foreign to the uninitiated, and the libraries aren't even able to support all the wonderful type magic you work so hard to provide.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a case, where we urge you to take a step back and holistically look at what TypeScript users have to do to in the majority of modern projects, and list them out in priority order.  The decision of how to tackle serialization, and what actually has to be done to have TypeScript still work with it is at the top of the list.  Even if you still don't want to support reflection, please write a detailed doc, and put it in the official TypeScript documentation that explains how TypeScript users should tackle this problem or what library you recommend, so we don't have endlessly reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p dir="auto">There seems to be a conflict between the design goals of TypeScript that is blocking this for some reason.  Type erasure is good!  It means JavaScript project can consume TypeScript projects without any knowledge of TypeScript.  It's just emitted JavaScript.  This does not mean you can't emit the type information separately in a consumable lookup table that's  separate from the code.  The lack of this type information means we use esoteric libraries which ultimately pollute the JavaScript with all the convoluted typing working arounds... soo... type erasure has defeated the purpose of type erasure.  It's a second order effect, where the design goal defeats the design goal. :(</p>
<p dir="auto">Side note, please don't solve this with decorators.  A lot of us want to use interfaces.  Decorators, like C# attributes are so coupling, and we can't add them to types from other libraries.  A higher order function that's known to the compiler like: <code>typescript.generateRuntimeType&lt;T&gt;()</code> with options for discriminators etc. means it would even work with external libs.  Something like F# Type Providers, or C# Source Generators would also be welcome.</p>
<p dir="auto">Last thing.  If you do this, I will send you cake.  If it's in TypeScript 4.3, there will be ice-cream.</p>
<p dir="auto">Love,<br>
A humble disciple</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>

<p>
On 26 Nov 2019 at 14:55 UTC, I logged into my server that hosts my
website to perform a simple maintenance activity. Merely three minutes
later, at 14:58 UTC, the domain name <a href="https://susam.in/">susam.in</a> used to host this website was
transferred to another registrant without any authorization by me or
without any notification sent to me. Since the DNS results for this
domain name was cached on my system, I was unaware of this issue at that
time. It would take me three days to realize that I had lost control of
the domain name I had been using for my website for the last 12 years.
This blog post documents when this happened, how this happened, and what
it took to regain control of this domain name.

<h2 id="domain-name-transfer">Domain Name Transfer<a href="#domain-name-transfer"></a></h2>

<p>
On 29 Nov 2019 at 19:00 UTC, when I visited my website hosted at <a href="https://susam.in/">https://susam.in/</a>, I found that a zero-byte
file was being served at this URL. My website was missing. In fact, the
domain name resolved to an IPv4 address I was unfamiliar with. It did
not resolve to the address of my Linode server anymore.
</p>

<p>
I checked the WHOIS records for this domain name. To my astonishment, I
found that I was no longer the registrant of this domain. An entity
named The Verden Public Prosecutor's Office was the new registrant of
this domain. The WHOIS records showed that the domain name was
transferred to this organization on 26 Nov 2019 at 14:58 UTC, merely
three minutes after I had performed my maintenance activity on the same
day. Here is a snippet of the WHOIS records that I found:
</p>

</pre>

<p>
The ellipsis denotes some records I have omitted for the sake of
brevity. There were three things that stood out in these records:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The registrar was changed from eNom, Inc. to NIXI Special Projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The registrant was changed from Susam Pal to The Verden Public
    Prosecutor's Office.
  </li>
  <li>
    The name servers were changed from Linode's servers to
    Shadowserver's sinkholes.
  </li>
</ol>


<h2 id="avalanche-botnet">Avalanche Botnet<a href="#avalanche-botnet"></a></h2>

<p>
On searching more about the new registrant on the web, I realized that
it was a German criminal justice body that was involved in the takedown
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_(phishing_group)">Avalanche</a>
malware-hosting network. It took a four-year concerted effort by
INTERPOL, Europol, the Shadowserver Foundation, Eurojust, the Luneberg
Police, and several other international organizations to finally destroy
the Avalanche botnet on 30 Nov 2016. In this list of organizations, one
name caught my attention immediately: The Shadowserver Foundation. The
WHOIS name server records pointed to Shadowserver's sinkholes.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the domain name was transferred to another organization
merely three minutes after I had performed a simple maintenance activity
got me worried. Was the domain name hijacked? Did my maintenance
activity on the server have anything to do with it? What kind of attack
one might have pulled off to hijack the domain name? I checked all the
logs and there was no evidence that anyone other than me had logged into
the server or executed any command or code on it. Further, a domain
name transfer usually involves email notification and authorization.
None of that had happened. It increasingly looked like that the three
minute interval between the maintenance activity and the domain name
transfer was merely a coincidence.
</p>

<p>
More questions sprang up as I thought about it. The Avalanche botnet was
destroyed in 2016. What has that got to do with the domain name being
transferred in 2019? Did my server somehow become part of the Avalanche
botnet? My server ran a minimal installation of the latest Debian
GNU/Linux system. It was always kept up-to-date to minimize the risk of
malware infection or security breach. It hosted a static website
composed of static HTML files served with Nginx. I found no evidence of
unauthorized access of my server while inspecting the logs. I could not
find any malware on the system.
</p>

<p>
The presence of Shadowserver sinkhole name servers in the WHOIS records
was a good clue. Sinkholing of a domain name can be done both malicously
as well as constructively. In this case, it looked like the Shadowserver
Foundation intended to sinkhole the domain name constructively, so that
any malware client trying to connect to my server nefariously would end
up connecting to a sinkhole address instead. My domain name was
sinkholed! The question now was: Why was it sinkholed?
</p>


<h2 id="support-ticket">Support Ticket<a href="#support-ticket"></a></h2>

<p>
On 29 Nov 2019 at 19:29 UTC, I submitted a support ticket to Namecheap
to report this issue. At 21:05 UTC, I received a response from Namecheap
support that they have contacted Enom, their upstream registrar, to
discuss the issue. There was no estimate for when a resolution might be
available.
</p>

<p>
At 21:21 UTC, I submitted a domain name
<a href="https://forms.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form">transfer complaint</a>
to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). I
was not expecting any response from ICANN because they do not have any
contractual authority on a country code top-level domain (ccTLD).
</p>

<p>
At 21:23 UTC, I emailed National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI). NIXI
is the ccTLD manager for .IN domain and they have authority on it. I
found their contact details from the <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/in.html">IANA Delegation
Record for .IN</a>. Again, I was not expecting a response from NIXI
because they do not have any contractual relationship directly with me.
They have a contractual relationship with Namecheap, so any
communication from them would be received by Namecheap and Namecheap
would have to pass that on to me.
</p>

<p>
At 21:30 UTC, ICANN responded and said that I should contact the ccTLD
manager directly. Like I explained in the previous paragraph, I had
already done that, so there was nothing more for me to do except wait
for Namecheap to provide an update after their investigation. By the
way, NIXI never replied to my email.
</p>


<h2 id="tweets-and-retweets">Tweets and Retweets<a href="#tweets-and-retweets"></a></h2>

<p>
On 30 Nov 2019 at 07:30 UTC, I <a href="https://twitter.com/susam/status/1200678538254393345">shared this
issue on Twitter</a>. I was hoping that someone who had been through a
similar experience could offer some advice. In fact, soon after I posted
the tweet, a kind person named Max from Germany generously <a href="https://twitter.com/LTE_Max/status/1200699507631112193">offered to
help</a> by writing a letter in German addressed to the new registrant
which was a German organization. The reason for sinkholing my domain
name was still unclear. I hoped that with enough number of retweets
someone closer to the source of truth could shed some light on why and
how this happened.
</p>

<p>
At 09:54 UTC, Richard Kirkendall, founder and CEO of Namecheap, <a href="https://twitter.com/NamecheapCEO/status/1200714718610153472">responded</a>
to my tweet and informed that they were contacting NIXI regarding the
issue. This seemed like a good step towards resolution. After all, the
domain name was no longer under their upstream registrar named Enom. The
domain name was now with NIXI as evident from the <a href="#whois">WHOIS
records</a>.
</p>

<p>
Several other users tweeted about my issue, added more information about
what might have happened, and retweeted my tweet.
</p>

<p>
On 1 Dec 2019 at 11:48 UTC, Benedict Addis from the Shadowserver
Foundation contacted me by email. He said that they had begun looking
into this issue as soon as one of the tweets about this issue had
referred to their organization. He explained in his email that my domain
name was sinkholed accidentally as part of their Avalanche operation.
Although it is now three years since the initial takedown of the botnet,
they still see over 3.5 million unique IP addresses connecting to their
sinkholes everyday. Unfortunately, their operation inadvertently flagged
my domain name as one of the domain names to be sinkholed because it
matched the pattern of command and control (C2) domain names generated
by a malware family named Nymaim, one of the malware families hosted on
Avalanche. Although, they had validity checks to avoid sinkholing
false-positives, my domain name unfortunately slipped through those
checks. Benedict mentioned that he had just raised this issue with NIXI
and requested them to return the domain name to me as soon as possible.
</p>


<h2 id="domain-name-return">Domain Name Return<a href="#domain-name-return"></a></h2>

<p>
On 2 Dec 2019 at 04:00 UTC, when I looked up the WHOIS records for the
domain name, I found that it had been returned to me already. At 08:37
UTC, Namecheap support responded to my support ticket to say that they
had been informed that NIXI had returned the domain name to its original
state. At 09:55 UTC, Juliya Zinovjeva, Domains Product
Manager of Namecheap, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliyaZinovjeva/status/1201439676118290432">commented
on Twitter</a> and confirmed the same thing.
</p>


<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>

<p>
Despite the successful resolution, it was still quite unsettling that a
domain name could be transferred to another registrant and sinkholed for
some perceived violation. I thought there would be more checks in place
to confirm that a perceived violation was real before a domain name
could be transferred. Losing a domain name I have been using actively
for 12 years was an unpleasant experience. Losing a domain name
accidentally should have been a lot harder than this. Benedict from the
Shadowserver Foundation assured me that my domain name would be excluded
from future sinkholing for this particular case. However, the
possibility that this could happen again due to another unrelated
operation by another organization in future is disconcerting.
</p>

<p>
I also wondered if a domain name under a country code top-level domain
(ccTLD) like .in is more susceptible to this kind of sinkholing than a
domain name under a generic top-level domain (gTLD) like .com. I asked
Benedict if it is worth migrating my website from .in to .com. He
replied that in his personal opinion, NIXI runs an excellent, clean
registry, and are very responsive in resolving issues when they arise.
He also added that domain generation algorithms (DGAs) of malware are
equally, and possibly more, problematic for .com domains. He advised
against migrating my website.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to everyone who retweeted my <a href="https://twitter.com/susam/status/1200678538254393345">tweet</a> on
this issue. Also, thanks to Richard Kirkendall (CEO of Namecheap),
Namecheap support team, and Benedict Addis from the Shadowserver
Foundation for contacting NIXI to resolve this issue.
</p>

<p>
  <em><strong>Update on 06 Jan 2022:</strong></em> Nearly two years
  after this incident, I eventually moved this website
  to <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>. The decision to do so
  was not influenced by this incident. I wanted this domain name since
  2006 but it was unavailable back then. This domain name became
  available only very recently and I moved my website to this domain
  as soon as it became available.

<p>I often hear criticisms of Go that seem superficial: the variable names are too short, the functions are not overloadable, the exporting-symbols-by-capitalizing thing is weird, and until recently, generics are non-existent. Go is an idiosyncratic language, and of course I have my own opinions and my own set of gripes too, but today I want to highlight one of the features I like most about the language: <em>goroutines</em>.</p>
<p>Goroutines are Go's main concurrency primitives. They look very much like threads, but they are cheap to create and manage. Go's runtime schedules goroutines onto real threads efficiently to avoid wasting resources, so you can easily create <em>lots</em> of goroutines (like one goroutine per request), and you can write simple, imperative, blocking code. Consequently, Go networking code tends to be straightforward and easier to reason about than the equivalent code in other languages.</p>
<p>For me, goroutines are the single feature that distinguishes Go from other languages. They are why I prefer Go for writing code that requires any amount of parallelism.</p>
<p>Before we talk more about goroutines, let's cover some history so it makes sense why you'd want them.</p>
<h2>Forked and threaded servers</h2>
<p>High performance servers need to handle requests from many clients at the same time. There are many ways to design a server to handle that.</p>
<p>The simplest naïve design is to have a main process that calls <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/manpages-dev/accept.2.en.html"><code>accept</code></a> in a loop, then calls <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/manpages-dev/fork.2.en.html"><code>fork</code></a> to create a child process that handles the request.</p>
<p>I learned about this pattern from the excellent <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/">Beej's Guide to Network Programming</a> in the early 2000s when I was a student. <code>fork</code> is a nice pattern to use when learning network programming since you can focus on networking and not server architecture. It's hard to write an efficient server following this pattern though, and I don't think anyone uses it in practice anymore.</p>
<p>There are a lot of problems with <code>fork</code>. First is cost: a <code>fork</code> call on Linux appears to be fast, but it marks all your memory as copy-on-write. Each write to a copy-on-write page causes a minor page fault, a small delay that's hard to measure. Context switching between processes is also expensive. Another problem is scale: it is difficult to coordinate use of shared resources like CPU, memory, database connections, and whatever else among a large number of child processes. If you get a surge of traffic and you create too many processes, they'll contend with each other for the CPU. If you limit the number of processes you create, then a large number of slow clients can block your service for everyone while your CPU sits idle. Careful use of timeouts helps (and is necessary regardless of server architecture).</p>
<p>These problems are somewhat mitigated by using threads instead of processes. A thread is cheaper to create than a process since it shares memory and most other resources. It's also relatively easy to communicate between threads in a shared address space, using semaphores and other constructs to manage shared resources.</p>
<p>Threads do still have a substantial cost though, and you'll run into scaling problems if you create a new thread for every connection. As with processes, you need to limit the number of running threads to avoid heavy CPU contention, and you need to time out slow requests. Creating a new thread still takes time, though you can mitigate that by recycling threads across requests with a thread pool.</p>
<p>Whether you're using processes or threads, you still have a question that's difficult to answer: how many should you create? If you allow an unlimited number of threads, clients can use up all your memory and CPU with a small surge in traffic. If you limit your server to a maximum number of threads, then a bunch of slow clients can clog up your server. Timeouts help, but it's still difficult use your hardware resources efficiently.</p>
<h2>Event-driven servers</h2>
<p>Since we can't easily predict how many threads we'll need, what happens when we try to decouple requests from threads? What if we have just one thread dedicated to application logic (or perhaps a small, fixed number of threads), and we handle all the network traffic in the background using asynchronous system calls? This is an <em>event-driven server architecture</em>.</p>
<p>Event-driven servers were designed around the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/manpages-dev/select.2.en.html"><code>select</code></a> system call. (Later mechanisms like <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/manpages-dev/poll.2.en.html"><code>poll</code></a> have replaced <code>select</code>, but <code>select</code> is widely known, and they all serve the same conceptual purpose here.) <code>select</code> accepts a list of file descriptors (generally sockets) and returns which ones are ready to read or write. If none of the file descriptors are ready, <code>select</code> blocks until at least one is.</p>
<pre><code><span>#include &lt;sys/select.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>select</span>(<span>int</span> <span>nfds</span>, <span>fd_set</span> *<span>restrict</span> <span>readfds</span>,
           <span>fd_set</span> *<span>restrict</span> <span>writefds</span>, <span>fd_set</span> *<span>restrict</span> <span>exceptfds</span>,
           <span>struct</span> <span>timeval</span> *<span>restrict</span> <span>timeout</span>);
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>#include &lt;poll.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>poll</span>(<span>struct</span> <span>pollfd</span> *<span>fds</span>, <span>nfds_t</span> <span>nfds</span>, <span>int</span> <span>timeout</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>(I want to elaborate a bit on what it means for a socket to be "ready" because I had some trouble understanding this initially. Each socket has a kernel buffer for receiving and a buffer for sending. When your computer receives a packet, the kernel stores its data in the receive buffer for the appropriate socket until your program gets it with <code>recv</code>. Likewise, when your program calls <code>send</code>, the kernel stores the data in the socket's send buffer until it can be transmitted. A socket is ready to receive if there's data in the receive buffer. It's ready to send if there's available space in the send buffer. If the socket is not ready, <code>recv</code> and <code>send</code> block until it is, by default.)</p>
<p>To implement an event-driven server, you track a socket and some state for each request that's blocked on the network. The server has a single main event loop where it calls <code>select</code> with all those blocked sockets. When <code>select</code> returns, the server knows which requests can make progress, so for each request, it calls into the application logic with the stored state. When the application needs to use the network again, it adds the socket back to the "blocked" pool together with new state. The <em>state</em> here can be anything the application needs to resume what it was doing: a closure to be called back, or a promise to be completed.</p>
<p>This can all technically be implemented with a single thread. I can't speak to the details of any particular implementation, but languages that lack threading like JavaScript follow this model pretty closely. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about">Node.js describes itself</a> as "an event-driven JavaScript runtime ... designed to build scalable network applications." This is exactly what they mean.</p>
<p>Event-driven servers can generally make better use of CPU and memory than purely fork- or thread-based servers. You can spawn an application thread per core to handle requests in parallel. The threads don't contend with each other for CPU since the number of threads equals the number of cores. The threads are never idle when there are requests that can make progress. Efficient. So efficient that it's hard to justify writing a server any other way these days.</p>
<p>It sounds like a good idea on paper anyway, but it's a nightmare to write application code that works like this. The specific way in which it's a nightmare depends on the language and framework you're using. In JavaScript, asynchronous functions typically return a <code>Promise</code>, to which you attach callbacks. In Java gRPC, you're dealing with <code>StreamObserver</code>. If you're not careful, you end up with lots of deeply nested "arrow code" functions. If you <em>are</em> careful, you split up your functions and classes, obfuscating your control flow. Either way, you're in callback hell.</p>
<p>To show what I mean, below is an example from the <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/languages/java/basics/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc">Java gRPC Basics Tutorial</a>. Does the control flow here make sense?</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>routeChat</span>() <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> {
  <span>info</span>(<span>"*** RoutChat"</span>);
  <span>final</span> <span>CountDownLatch</span> <span>finishLatch</span> = <span>new</span> <span>CountDownLatch</span>(<span>1</span>);
  <span>StreamObserver</span>&lt;<span>RouteNote</span>&gt; <span>requestObserver</span> =
      <span>asyncStub</span>.<span>routeChat</span>(<span>new</span> <span>StreamObserver</span>&lt;<span>RouteNote</span>&gt;() {
        @<span>Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>onNext</span>(<span>RouteNote</span> <span>note</span>) {
          <span>info</span>(<span>"Got message \"</span>{<span>0</span>}\<span>" at {1}, {2}"</span>, <span>note</span>.<span>getMessage</span>(), <span>note</span>.<span>getLocation</span>()
              .<span>getLatitude</span>(), <span>note</span>.<span>getLocation</span>().<span>getLongitude</span>());
        }

        @<span>Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>onError</span>(<span>Throwable</span> <span>t</span>) {
          <span>Status</span> <span>status</span> = <span>Status</span>.<span>fromThrowable</span>(<span>t</span>);
          <span>logger</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>Level</span>.<span>WARNING</span>, <span>"RouteChat Failed: {0}"</span>, <span>status</span>);
          <span>finishLatch</span>.<span>countDown</span>();
        }

        @<span>Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>onCompleted</span>() {
          <span>info</span>(<span>"Finished RouteChat"</span>);
          <span>finishLatch</span>.<span>countDown</span>();
        }
      });

  <span>try</span> {
    <span>RouteNote</span>[] <span>requests</span> =
        {<span>newNote</span>(<span>"First message"</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>), <span>newNote</span>(<span>"Second message"</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>),
            <span>newNote</span>(<span>"Third message"</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>), <span>newNote</span>(<span>"Fourth message"</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)};

    <span>for</span> (<span>RouteNote</span> <span>request</span> : <span>requests</span>) {
      <span>info</span>(<span>"Sending message \"</span>{<span>0</span>}\<span>" at {1}, {2}"</span>, <span>request</span>.<span>getMessage</span>(), <span>request</span>.<span>getLocation</span>()
          .<span>getLatitude</span>(), <span>request</span>.<span>getLocation</span>().<span>getLongitude</span>());
      <span>requestObserver</span>.<span>onNext</span>(<span>request</span>);
    }
  } <span>catch</span> (<span>RuntimeException</span> <span>e</span>) {
    <span>// Cancel RPC</span>
    <span>requestObserver</span>.<span>onError</span>(<span>e</span>);
    <span>throw</span> <span>e</span>;
  }
  <span>// Mark the end of requests</span>
  <span>requestObserver</span>.<span>onCompleted</span>();

  <span>// Receiving happens asynchronously</span>
  <span>finishLatch</span>.<span>await</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>TimeUnit</span>.<span>MINUTES</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is from the <em>beginner</em> tutorial, and it's not a complete example either. The sending code is synchronous while the receiving code is asynchronous.</p>
<p>In Java, you may be dealing different with asynchronous types for your HTTP server, gRPC, SQL database, cloud SDK and whatever else, and you need adapters between all of them. It gets to be a mess very quickly. Locks are dangerous, too. You need to be careful about holding locks across network calls. It's also easy to make a mistake with locking and callbacks. For example, if a <code>synchronized</code> method calls a function that returns a <code>ListenableFuture</code> then attaches an inline callback, the callback also needs a <code>synchronized</code> block, even though it's nested inside the parent method.</p>
<h2>goroutines</h2>
<p>What was this post about again? Oh yes, goroutines.</p>
<p>A <em>goroutine</em> is Go's version of a thread. Like threads in other languages, each goroutine has its own stack. Goroutines may execute in parallel, concurrently with other goroutines. Unlike threads, goroutines are very cheap to create: they aren't bound to an OS thread, and their stacks start out very small (2 KiB) but can grow as needed. When you create a goroutine, you're essentially allocating a closure and adding it to a queue in the runtime.</p>
<p>Internally, Go's runtime has a set of OS threads that execute goroutines (normally one thread per core). When a thread is available and a goroutine is ready to run, the runtime schedules the goroutine onto the thread, executing application logic. If a goroutine blocks on something like a mutex or channel, the runtime adds it to a set of blocked goroutines then schedules the next ready goroutine onto the same OS thread. <em>This also applies to the network</em>: when a goroutine sends or receives data on a socket that's not ready, it yields its OS thread to the scheduler.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Go's scheduler acts a lot like the main loop in an event-driven server. Except instead of relying solely on <code>select</code> and focusing on file descriptors, the scheduler handles everything in the language that might block. You no longer need to avoid blocking calls because the scheduler makes efficient use of the CPU either way. You're free to spawn lots of goroutines (one per request!) because they're cheap to create, and the threads don't contend for the CPU (minimal context switching). You don't need to worry about thread pools and executor services because the runtime effectively has one big thread pool.</p>
<p>In short, you can write simple blocking application code in a clean imperative style as if you were writing a thread-based server, but you keep all the efficiency advantages of an event-driven server. Best of both worlds. This kind of code composes well across frameworks. You don't need adapters between your <code>StreamObservers</code> and <code>ListenableFutures</code>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the same example from the <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/basics/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc-1">Go gRPC Basics Tutorial</a>. I find the control flow here easier to comprehend than the Java example because both the sending and receiving code are synchronous. In both goroutines, we're able to call <code>stream.Recv</code> and <code>stream.Send</code> in a <code>for</code> loop. No need for callbacks, subclasses, or executors.</p>
<pre><code><span>stream</span>, <span>err</span> := <span>client</span>.<span>RouteChat</span>(<span>context</span>.<span>Background</span>())
<span>waitc</span> := <span>make</span>(<span>chan</span> <span>struct</span>{})
<span>go</span> <span>func</span>() {
  <span>for</span> {
    <span>in</span>, <span>err</span> := <span>stream</span>.<span>Recv</span>()
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> == <span>io</span>.<span>EOF</span> {
      <span>// read done.</span>
      <span>close</span>(<span>waitc</span>)
      <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> != <span>nil</span> {
      <span>log</span>.<span>Fatalf</span>(<span>"Failed to receive a note : %v"</span>, <span>err</span>)
    }
    <span>log</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Got message %s at point(%d, %d)"</span>, <span>in</span>.<span>Message</span>, <span>in</span>.<span>Location</span>.<span>Latitude</span>, <span>in</span>.<span>Location</span>.<span>Longitude</span>)
  }
}()
<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>note</span> := <span>range</span> <span>notes</span> {
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> := <span>stream</span>.<span>Send</span>(<span>note</span>); <span>err</span> != <span>nil</span> {
    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatalf</span>(<span>"Failed to send a note: %v"</span>, <span>err</span>)
  }
}
<span>stream</span>.<span>CloseSend</span>()
&lt;-<span>waitc</span>
</code></pre>
<h2><code>async</code> / <code>await</code>, virtual threads</h2>
<p>Go is a fairly new language, and it was designed at a time when event-driven servers were already popular and well-understood. Java, C++, Python, and other languages are older and don't have that same luxury. So as a language designer, what features can you add to make writing asynchronous application code less painful?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await"><code>async</code> / <code>await</code></a> has become the main solution in most languages. Wikipedia tells me that it was first added to F# in 2007 (around the same time Go was being developed). It's now in C#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Swift, and a bunch of other languages.</p>
<p><code>async</code> / <code>await</code> let you write code that works with asynchronous functions in a style that resembles imperative blocking code. An asynchronous function is marked with the <code>async</code> keyword and returns a promise (or whatever the language equivalent is). When you call an asynchronous function, you can "block" and get the value in the promise with the <code>await</code> keyword. If a function uses <code>await</code>, it must also be marked <code>async</code>, and the compiler rewrites it to return a promise. There are different ways to implement <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, but the feature generally implies a language has support for cooperatively scheduled coroutines if not full support for threads. When a coroutine <code>awaits</code> a promise that's not completed yet, it yields to the language's runtime, which may schedule another ready coroutine on the same thread.</p>
<p>I'm pleased that so many languages have adopted <code>async</code> / <code>await</code>. Since I've worked primarily in Go, Java, and C++, I haven't personally had much opportunity to use it, but whenever I need to do something in JavaScript, I'm really glad it's there. <code>await</code> control flow is much easier to understand than asynchronous callback code. It is a bit annoying though to annotate functions with <code>async</code>. Bob Nystrom's <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What Color is Your Function</a> is a humorous criticism of that.</p>
<p>Java is conspicuously absent from the list of languages above. Until now, you've had to either spawn an unreasonable number of threads or deal with Java's particular circle of callback hell. Happily, <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444">JEP 444</a> adds <a href="https://blog.rockthejvm.com/ultimate-guide-to-java-virtual-threads/">virtual threads</a>, which sound a lot like goroutines. Virtual threads are cheap to create. The JVM schedules them onto <em>platform threads</em> (real threads the kernel knows about). There are a fixed number of platform threads, generally one per core. When a virtual thread performs a blocking operation, it releases its platform thread, and the JVM may schedule another virtual thread onto it. Unlike goroutines, virtual thread scheduling is cooperative: a virtual thread doesn't yield to the scheduler until it performs a blocking operation. This means that a tight loop can hold a thread indefinitely. I don't know whether this is an implementation limitation or if there's a deeper issue. Go used to have this problem until fully preemptive scheduling was implemented in 1.14.</p>
<p>Virtual threads are available for preview in the current release and are expected to become stable in JDK 21 (due September 2023). I'm looking forward to deleting a lot of <code>ListenableFutures</code>, but it's unclear to me how virtual threads will interact with existing frameworks designed around a more purely event-driven model. Whenever a new language or runtime feature is introduced, there's a long cultural migration period, and I think the Java ecosystem is pretty conservative in that regard. Still, I'm encouraged by the enthusiastic adoption of <code>async</code> / <code>await</code> in other languages. I hope Java will be similar with virtual threads.</p>

<p>We're excited to announce the release of our new open-source Intermediate Graphics Library (IGL)! At Meta, we are committed to building open standards for 3D graphics in partnership with the broader industry and the Khronos<sup>®</sup> Group. After months of hard work and dedication, we're thrilled to share our latest creation with the development community.</p>
<p>IGL provides developers with a powerful set of tools for creating high-quality visuals and graphics in their applications. Whether you're working on a game, a 3D modeling application or any other project that requires top-notch graphics, IGL has got you covered.</p>
<p>This cross-platform library encapsulates common GPU functionality with a low-level cross-platform interface, abstracting Render Hardware Interface (RHI) with a modern approach. It supports various graphics APIs, such as OpenGL<sup>®</sup>, OpenGL&nbsp;ES™, WebGL™, and Vulkan<sup>®</sup>, with a common interface. It’s lightweight and efficient, with minimal overhead on top of the underlying APIs, and has minimal dependencies on external libraries.</p>

<p>Here are some of the key features you can expect from IGL:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> In addition to the functionality mentioned above, IGL also provides a shell library, allowing users to compile and run on the most popular platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android and WebAssembly.</p>
<p><strong>High-performance rendering:</strong> IGL is optimized to provide lightning-fast rendering, even when dealing with complex and detailed graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Easy-to-use API:</strong> An intuitive and easy-to-use API means that IGL is simple and straightforward to work with. Rather than introducing RHI as part of the high-level engine abstraction or mimicking one graphics interface behind another, IGL takes a new approach to abstracting RHI by creating a new modern interface, which is close to Vulkan or WebGPU on the abstraction layer, but general enough to avoid being engine-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Extensibility:</strong> IGL was built with extensibility in mind, allowing users to easily add new features and functionality as their needs evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Open source:</strong> IGL is completely open source and can be used for any project, commercial or otherwise, without any licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>We're confident that our graphics library will be a valuable asset to developers of all levels. Whether you're an experienced game developer, or just getting started with graphics programming, our library provides the tools you need to create stunning visuals in your applications.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to our GitHub repository and start exploring the power of our new graphics library today! Check out the installation and quick start instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/igl/blob/main/README.md">project's README</a> and find some useful examples and tutorials to help you get started <a href="https://github.com/facebook/igl/blob/main/getting-started.md">here</a>!</p>
<p>We’re excited to see what you create!</p>

<p><b>Tech debt metaphor maximalism</b></p>
<p>I really like the "tech debt" metaphor. A lot of people don't,
but I think that's because they either don't extend the metaphor far enough,
or because they don't properly understand financial debt.</p>
<p>So let's talk about debt!</p>
<p><b>Consumer debt vs capital investment</b></p>
<p>Back in school my professor, <a href="http://lwsmith.ca/">Canadian economics superhero Larry
Smith</a>, explained debt this way (paraphrased): debt is
stupid if it's for instant gratification that you pay for later, with
interest. But debt is great if it means you can make more money than the
interest payments.</p>
<p>A family that takes on high-interest credit card debt
for a visit to Disneyland is wasting money. If you think you can pay it off
in a year, you'll pay 20%-ish interest for that year for no reason. You can
instead save up for a year and get the same gratification next year without
the 20% surcharge.</p>
<p>But if you want to buy a $500k machine that will earn your factory an additional
$1M/year in revenue, it would be foolish <em>not</em> to buy it now, even with 20%
interest ($100k/year). That's a profit of $900k in just the first year!
(excluding depreciation)</p>
<p>There's a reason profitable companies with CFOs take on debt, and often the
total debt increases rather than decreases over time. They're not idiots.
They're making a rational choice that's win-win for everyone. (The
company earns more money faster, the banks earn interest, the interest gets
paid out to consumers' deposit accounts.)</p>
<p>Debt is bad when you take out the wrong kind, or you mismanage it, or it has
weird strings attached (hello Venture Debt that requires you to put all your
savings in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/03/15/svb-billions-uninsured-assets-companies/">one underinsured
place</a>).
But done right, debt is a way to move faster instead of slower.</p>
<p><b>High-interest vs low-interest debt</b></p>
<p>For a consumer, the highest interest rates are for "store" credit cards, the
kinds issued by Best Buy or Macy's or whatever that only work in that one
store. They aren't as picky about risk (thus have more defaults) because
it's the ultimate loyalty programme: it gets people to spend more at their
store instead of other stores, in some cases because it's the only place
that would issue those people debt in the first place.</p>
<p>The second-highest interest rate is on a general-purpose credit card like
Visa or Mastercard. They can get away with high interest rates because
they're also the payment system and so they're very convenient.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, when I looked at the stats a decade or so ago, in Canada
credit cards make <em>most</em> of their income on payment fees because Canadians
are annoyingly persistent about paying off their cards; in the US it's the
opposite. The rumours are true: Canadians really are more cautious about
spending.)</p>
<p>If you have a good credit rating, you can get better interest rates on a
bank-issued "line of credit" (LOC) (lower interest rate, but less convenient
than a card). In Canada, one reason many people pay off their credit card
each month is simply that they transfer the balance to a lower-interest LOC.</p>
<p>Even lower interest rates can be obtained if you're willing to provide
collateral: most obviously, the equity in your home. This greatly reduces
the risk for the lender because they can repossess and then resell your home
if you don't pay up. Which is pretty good for them even if you don't pay,
but what's better is it makes you much more likely to pay rather
than lose your home.</p>
<p>Some people argue that you should almost never plan to pay off your
mortgage: typical mortgage interest rates are lower than the rates you'd get
long-term from investing in the S&amp;P. The advice that you should "always buy
the biggest home you can afford" is often perversely accurate, especially if
you believe property values will keep going up. And subject to your risk
tolerance and lock-in preferences.</p>
<p>What's the pattern here? Just this: high-interest debt is quick and
convenient but you should pay it off quickly. Sometimes you pay it off just
by converting to longer-term lower-rate debt. Sometimes debt is
collateralized and sometimes it isn't.</p>
<p><b>High-interest and low-interest tech debt</b></p>
<p>Bringing that back to tech debt: a simple kind of high-interest short-term
debt would be committing code without tests or documentation. Yay, it works,
ship it! And truthfully, maybe you should, because the revenue (and customer
feedback) you get from shipping fast can outweigh how much more bug-prone
you made the code in the short term.</p>
<p>But like all high-interest debt, you should plan to pay it back fast. Tech
debt generally manifests as a slowdown in your development velocity (ie.
overhead on everything else you do), which means fewer features
launched in the medium-long term, which means less revenue and customer
feedback.</p>
<p>Whoa, weird, right? This short-term high-interest debt both <em>increases</em>
revenue and feedback rate, and <em>decreases</em> it. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you take a single pull request (PR) that adds a new feature, and launch
  it without tests or documentation, you will definitely get the benefits of
  that PR sooner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every PR you try to write after that, before adding the tests and docs
  (ie. repaying the debt) will be slower because you risk creating
  undetected bugs or running into undocumented edge cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you take a long time to pay off the debt, the slowdown in future
  launches will outweigh the speedup from the first launch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is exactly how CFOs manage corporate financial debt. Debt is a drain on
your revenues; the thing you did to incur the debt is a boost to your
revenues; if you take too long to pay back the debt, it's an overall loss.</p>
<p>CFOs can calculate that. Engineers don't like to. (Partly because tech debt
is less quantifiable. And partly because engineers are the sort of people who
pay off their loans sooner than they mathematically should, as a matter of
principle.)</p>
<p><b>Debt ceilings</b></p>
<p>The US government has imposed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-lifting-us-debt-limit-2023-06-03/">famously ill-advised debt
ceiling</a>
on itself, that mainly serves to cause drama and create a great place to
push through unrelated riders that nobody will read, because the bill to
raise the debt ceiling will always pass.</p>
<p>Real-life debt ceilings are defined by your creditworthiness: banks simply
will not lend you more money if you've got so much outstanding debt that
they don't believe you can handle the interest payments. That's your credit
limit, or the largest mortgage they'll let you have.</p>
<p>Banks take a systematic approach to calculating the debt ceiling for each
client. How much can we lend you so that you take out the biggest loan you
possibly can, thus paying as much interest as possible, without starving to
death or (even worse) missing more than two consecutive payments? Also,
morbidly but honestly, since debts are generally not passed down to your
descendants, they would like you to be able to just barely pay it all off
(perhaps by selling off all your assets) right before you kick the bucket.</p>
<p>They can math this, they're good at it. Remember, they don't want you to pay
it off early. If you have leftover money you might use it to pay down your
debt. That's no good, because less debt means lower interest payments.
They'd rather you incur even more debt, then use that leftover monthly
income even bigger interest payments. That's when you're trapped.</p>
<p>The equivalent in tech debt is when you are so far behind that you can
barely keep the system running with no improvements at all; the perfect
balance. If things get worse over time, you're underwater and will
eventually fail. But if you reach this zen state of perfect equilibrium, you
can keep going forever, running in place. That's your tech debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Unlike the banking world, I can't think of a way to anthropomorphize a
villain who wants you to go that far into debt. Maybe the CEO? I guess maybe
someone who is trying to juice revenues for a well-timed acquisition.
Private Equity firms also specialize in maximizing both financial and
technical debt so they can extract the assets while your company slowly
dies.</p>
<p>Anyway, both in finance and tech, you want to stay well away from your
credit limit.</p>
<p><b>Debt to income ratios</b></p>
<p>There are many imperfect rules of thumb for how much debt is healthy.
(Remember, some debt is very often healthy, and only people who don't
understand debt rush to pay it all off as fast as they can.)</p>
<p>One measure is the debt to income ratio (or for governments, the
debt to GDP ratio). The problem with debt-to-income is debt and income are two
different things. The first produces a mostly-predictable repayment cost
spread over an undefined period of time; the other is a
possibly-fast-changing benefit measured annually. One is an amount, the
other is a rate.</p>
<p>It would be better to measure interest payments as a fraction of revenue. At
least that encompasses the distinction between high-interest and
low-interest loans. And it compares two cashflow rates rather
than the nonsense comparison of a balance sheet measure vs a cashflow
measure. Banks love interest-to-income ratios; that's why your income level
has such a big impact on your debt ceiling.</p>
<p>In the tech world, the interest-to-income equivalent is how much time you
spend dealing with overhead compared to building new revenue-generating
features. Again, getting to zero overhead is probably not worth it. I like
this <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd explanation</a> of what is and is not worth
the time:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"></p>
<p>Tech debt, in its simplest form, is the time you didn't spend making tasks
more efficient. When you think of it that way, it's obvious that zero tech
debt is a silly choice.</p>
<p>(Note that the interest-to-income ratio in this formulation has nothing to
do with financial income. "Tech income" in our metaphor is feature
development time, where "tech debt" is what eats up your development time.)</p>
<p>(Also note that by this definiton, nowadays tech stacks are so big, complex,
and irritable that every project starts with a giant pile of someone else's
tech debt on day 1. Enjoy!)</p>
<p><b>Debt to equity ratios</b></p>
<p>Interest-to-income ratios compare two items from your cashflow statement.
Debt-to-equity ratios compare two items from your balance sheet. Which means
they, too, are at least not nonsense.</p>
<p>"Equity" is unfortunately a lot fuzzier than income. How much is your
company worth? Or your product? The potential value of a factory isn't just
the value of the machines inside it; it's the amortized income stream you
(or a buyer) could get from continuing to operate that factory. Which means
it includes the built-up human and business expertise needed to operate the
factory.</p>
<p>And of course, software is even worse; as many of us know but few
businesspeople admit, the value of proprietary software without the people
is zero. This is why you hear about acqui-hires (humans create value even if
they might quit tomorrow) but never about acqui-codes (code without
humans is worthless).</p>
<p>Anyway, for a software company the "equity" comes from a variety of factors.
In the startup world, Venture Capitalists are -- and I know this is
depressing -- the best we have for valuing company equity. They are, of
course, not very good at it, but they make it up in volume. As software
companies get more mature, valuation becomes more quantifiable and comes
back to expectations for the future cashflow statement.</p>
<p>Venture Debt is typically weighted heavily on equity (expected future value)
and somewhat less on revenue (ability to pay the interest).</p>
<p>As the company builds up assets and shows faster growth, the assumed
equity value gets bigger and bigger. In the financial world, that means
people are willing to issue more debt.</p>
<p>(Over in the consumer world: your home is equity. That's why you can get a
huge mortgage on a house but your unsecured loan limit is much smaller. So
Venture Debt is like a mortgage.)</p>
<p>Anyway, back to tech debt: the debt-to-equity ratio is how much tech debt
you've taken on compared to the accumulated value, and future growth rate,
of your product quality. If your product is acquiring lots of customers
fast, you can afford to take on more tech debt so you can acquire more
customers even faster.</p>
<p>What's weirder is that as the absolute value of product equity increases,
you can take on a larger and larger absolute value of tech debt.</p>
<p>That feels unexpected. If we're doing so well, why would we want to take on
<em>more</em> tech debt? But think of it this way: if your product (thus company)
are really growing that fast, you will have more people to pay down the tech
debt next year than you do now. In theory, you could even take on so much
tech debt this year that your current team can't even pay the interest...</p>
<p>...which brings us to leverage. And risk.</p>
<p><b>Leverage risk</b></p>
<p>Earlier in this article, I mentioned the popular (and surprisingly, often
correct!) idea that you should "buy the biggest house you can afford." Why
would I want a bigger house? My house is fine. I have a big enough house.
How is this good advice?</p>
<p>The answer is the amazing multiplying power of leverage.</p>
<p>Let's say housing goes up at 5%/year. (I wish it didn't because this rate is
fabulously unsustainable. But bear with me.)
And let's say you have $100k in savings and $100k in annual
income.</p>
<p>You could pay cash and buy a house for $100k. Woo hoo, no mortgage! And
it'll go up in value by about $5k/year, which is not bad I guess.</p>
<p>Or, you could buy a $200k house: a $100k down payment and a $100k mortgage
at, say, 3% (fairly common back in 2021), which means $3k/year
in interest. But your $200k house goes up by 5% = $10k/year. Now you have an
annual gain of $10k - $3k = $7k, much more than the $5k you were making
before, with the same money. Sweet!</p>
<p>But don't stop there. If the bank will let you get away with it, why not a
$1M house with a $100k down payment? That's $1M x 5% = +$50k/year in value,
and $900k x 3% = $27k in interest, so a solid $23k in annual (unrealized)
capital gain. From the same initial bank balance! Omg we're printing money.</p>
<p>(Obviously we're omitting maintenance costs and property tax here. Forgive
me. On the other hand, presumably you're getting intangible value from
living in a much bigger and fancier house. $AAPL shares don't have skylights
and rumpus rooms and that weird statue in bedroom number seven.)</p>
<p>What's the catch? Well, the catch is massively increasing risk.</p>
<p>Let's say you lose your job and can't afford interest payments. If you
bought your $100k house with no mortgage, you're in luck: that house is
yours, free and clear. You might not have food but you have a place to live.</p>
<p>If you bought the $1M house and have $900k worth of mortgage payments to
keep up, you're screwed. Get another job or get ready to move out and
disrupt your family and change everything about your standard of living, up
to and possibly including bankruptcy, which we'll get to in a bit.</p>
<p>Similarly, let's imagine that your property value stops increasing, or (less
common in the US for stupid reasons, but common everywhere else) mortage
rates go up. The leverage effect multiplies your potential losses just like
it multiplies your potential gains.</p>
<p>Back to tech debt. What's the analogy?</p>
<p>Remember that idea I had above, of incurring extra tech debt this year to
keep the revenue growth rolling, and then planning to pay it off next year
with the newer and bigger team? Yeah, that actually works... if you keep
growing. If you estimated your tech debt interest rate correctly. If that
future team materializes. (If you can even motivate that future team to work
on tech debt.) If you're rational, next year, about whether you borrow more
or not.</p>
<p>That thing I said about the perfect equilibrium running-in-place state, when
you spend all your time just keeping the machine operating and you have no
time to make it better. How do so many companies get themselves into that
state? In a word, leverage. They guessed wrong. The growth rate fell off,
the new team members didn't materialize or didn't ramp up fast enough.</p>
<p>And if you go past equilibrium, you get the worst case: your tech debt
interest is greater than your tech production (income). Things get worse and
worse and you enter the downward spiral. This is where desperation sets in.
The only remaining option is <strike>bankruptcy</strike> Tech Debt
Refinancing.</p>
<p><b>Refinancing</b></p>
<p>Most people who can't afford the interest on their loans don't declare
bankruptcy. The step before that is to make an arrangement with your
creditors to lower your interest payments. Why would they accept such an
agreement? Because if they don't, you'll declare bankruptcy, which is annoying
for you but hugely unprofitable for them.</p>
<p>The tech metaphor for refinancing is <em>premature deprecation</em>. Yes, people
love both service A and service B. Yes, we are even running both services at
financial breakeven. But they are slipping, slipping, getting a little worse
every month and digging into a hole that I can't escape. In order to pull
out of this, I have to stop my payments on A so I can pay back more of B; by
then A will be unrecoverably broken. But at least B will live on, to fight
another day.</p>
<p>Companies do this all the time. Even at huge profitable companies, in some
corners you'll occasionally find an understaffed project sliding deeper and
deeper into tech debt. Users may still love it, and it may even be net
profitable, but not profitable enough to pay for the additional engineering
time to dig it out. Such a project is destined to die, and the only
question is when. The answer is "whenever some executive finally notices."</p>
<p><b>Bankruptcy</b></p>
<p>The tech bankruptcy metaphor is an easy one: if refinancing doesn't work and
your tech debt continues to spiral downward, sooner or later your finances
will follow. When you run out of money you declare bankruptcy; what's
interesting is your tech debt disappears at the same time your financial
debt does.</p>
<p>This is a really important point. You can incur all the tech debt in the
world, and while your company is still operating, you at least have some
chance of someday paying it back. When your company finally dies, you will
find yourself off the hook; the tech debt never needs to be repaid.</p>
<p>Okay, for those of us grinding away at code all day, perhaps that sounds
perversely refreshing. But it explains lots of corporate behaviour. The more
desperate a company gets, the less they care about tech debt. <em>Anything</em> to
turn a profit. They're not wrong to do so, but you can see how the downward
spiral begins to spiral downward. The more tech debt you incur, the slower
your development goes, and the harder it is to do something productive that
might make you profitable. You might still pull it off! But your luck will
get progressively worse.</p>
<p>The reverse is also true. When your company is doing well, you have time to
pay back tech debt, or at least to control precisely how much debt you take
on and when. To maintain your interest-to-income ratio or debt-to-equity
ratio at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>When you see a company managing their tech debt carefully, you see a company
that is planning for the long term rather than a quick exit. Again, that
doesn't mean paying it all back. It means being careful.</p>
<p><b>Student loans that are non-dischargeable in bankruptcy</b></p>
<p>Since we're here anyway talking about finance, let's talk about the idiotic
US government policy of guaranteeing student loans, but also not allowing
people to discharge those loans (ie. zero them out) in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>What's the effect of this? Well, of course, banks are extremely eager to
give these loans out to anybody, at any scale, as fast as they can, because
they can't lose. They have all the equity of the US government to back them
up. The debt-to-equity ratio is effectively zero.</p>
<p>And of course, people who don't understand finance (which they don't teach
you until university; catch-22!) take on lots of these loans in the hope of
making money in the future.</p>
<p>Since anyone who wants to go to university can get a student loan,
American universities keep raising their rates until they find the maximum amount
that lenders are willing to lend (unlimited!) or foolish borrowers are
willing to borrow in the name of the American Dream (so far we haven't found
the limit).</p>
<p>Where was I? Oh right, tech metaphors.</p>
<p>Well, there are two parts here. First, unlimited access to money. Well, the
tech world has had plenty of that, prior to the 2022 crash anyway. The
result is they hired way too many engineers (students) who did a lot of dumb
stuff (going to school) and incurred a lot of tech debt (student loans) that
they promised to pay back later when their team got bigger (they earned
their Bachelor's degree and got a job), which unfortunately didn't
materialize. Oops. They are worse off than if they had skipped all that.</p>
<p>Second, inability to discharge the debt in bankruptcy. Okay, you got me.
Maybe we've come to the end of our analogy. Maybe US government policies
actually, and this is quite an achievement, manage to be even dumber than
tech company management. In this one way. Maybe.</p>
<p>OR MAYBE YOU <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20091224">OPEN SOURCED WVDIAL</a> AND PEOPLE STILL EMAIL YOU
FOR HELP DECADES AFTER YOUR FIRST STARTUP IS LONG GONE.</p>
<p>Um, sorry for that outburst. I have no idea where that came from.</p>
<p><b>Bonus note: bug bankruptcy</b></p>
<p>While we're here exploring financial metaphors, I might as well say
something about bug bankruptcy. Although I <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20171213">have been known to make fun of
bug bankruptcy</a>, it too is an excellent metaphor, but only if
you take it far enough.</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of this concept, bug bankruptcy happens when
your bug tracking database is so full of bugs that you give up and delete
them all and start over ("declare bankruptcy").</p>
<p>Like financial bankruptcy, it is very tempting: I have this big pile of
bills. Gosh, it is a big pile. Downright daunting, if we're honest. Chances
are, if I opened all these bills, I would find out that I owe more money
than I have, and moreover, next month a bunch more bills will come and I
won't be able to pay them either and this is hopeless. That would be
stressful. My solution, therefore, is to throw all the bills in the
dumpster, call up my friendly neighbourhood bankruptcy trustee, and
conveniently discharge all my debt once and for all.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, not so fast, buddy. Bankruptcy has consequences. First of all, it's
kind of annoying to arrange legally. Secondly, it sits on your financial
records for like 7 years afterwards, during which time probably nobody will
be willing to issue you any loans, because you're empirically the kind of
person who does not pay back their loans.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is also how bug bankruptcy works. Although the process
for declaring it is easier -- no lawyers or trustees required! -- the
long-term destruction of trust is real. If you run a project in which a lot
of people spent a bunch of effort filing and investigating bugs (ie. lent
you their time in the hope that you'll pay it back by fixing the bugs
later), and you just close them all wholesale, you can expect that those
people will eventually stop filing bugs. Which, you know, admittedly feels
better, just like the hydro company not sending you bills anymore feels
better until winter comes and your heater doesn't work and you can't figure
out why and you eventually remember "oh, I think someone said this might
happen but I forget the details."</p>
<p>Anyway, yes, you can do it. But refinancing is better.</p>
<p><b>Email bankruptcy</b></p>
<p>Email bankruptcy is similar to bug bankruptcy, with one important
distinction: nobody ever expected you to answer your email anyway. I'm
honestly not sure why people keep sending them.</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY EMAILS ABOUT WVDIAL where does that voice keep coming from</p>

    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; Based on at least two true
stories. With apologies to Aphyr, I love your blog and your x-ing the technical
interview parables have been a huge influence on me.</p></div>
<p>The formless void that stalks all dreams was different today, but not in a way
that you could easily identify. The endless stillness of change had a different
flavor to it. There was a pulse to it, something you couldn't quite identify.
Thoughts and feelings encircle it before they are dismissed as irrelevant,
leading to another level of stillness.</p>
<p>Thoughts resume, thoughts of the rent, and the bills, and all of those
irrelevancies that everyone in this world loves to spend so much time on.</p>
<p>The pulse resumes with a new pattern: <code>.-- .- -.- . / ..- .--.</code> You look down at
your wrist and the wakefulness charm is no longer present. Things make sense
now. This is a dream. A very boring one, but a dream at that. You thank the
dream for its service and make your exit: stage right.</p>
<hr>
<p>A watch was vibrating. It is the morning. You don't usually wake up in the
morning. You take a moment to search your memories for what was significant
about today. As if on cue, the watch taps you again and shows a few rows of
sigils that remind you.</p>
<p>After freshening up, you set off to make the arduous commute to the office.
After 30 whole seconds you manage to finish your epic trek and sit in your
custom-rigged office chair. It was a bit of a gambiarra, but it was the only
thing that could properly tolerate your tail and dorsal fin. After a struggle,
you got your tail fit into the place it's comfortable in. <em>The dark side of
being a one-of-a-kind creature</em>, you thought.</p>
<p>Firefox was out of date, the workstation said. So the scripts dutifully went off
and rebuilt it. Seconds later, a new version was running as it was compiling.
Hopefully the important parts would be done in time for the call.</p>
<p><em>Thank the nine</em>, you thought. They used E100 meet. Or was it E100 hangouts.
Maybe E100 Allo or Duo? Depended on who wanted a raise that year. The thought
made you smile and you hit a button to turn on the key lights for the camera.</p>
<p>The screen showed a man in his mid-twenties staring at his screen. He looked
well-fed, as these startup types tend to be.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm Jeff with Techaro and I'm going to be your first interviewer today. So
that we can get things off on the right foot, you're 'Pa-lie-ma' right?"</p>
<p>The insult that this "Jeff" had just committed was beyond statement. Holding
back and dismissing the emotion out of his understandable ignorance, you
replied: "It's Palima (Pa-lee-mah), Palima Aethera (Pa-lee-mah Ay-theer-ah)."</p>
<p>"Ah yes, sorry. I'll write that down in my notes so that everyone else gets it
right. I try very hard to at least give people the courtesy of saying their name
correctly." His candor appears genuine. He is wearing an orange company branded
hoodie. Orange was a good color on him, made him look happy. You like this
"Jeff" and want to see what he can do.</p>
<p>"Before we get started, are you using some kind of virtual avatar? We like our
interviews to be done with people's real faces."</p>
<p><em>Ah, another one of <em>those</em> types</em>, you thought to yourself. This is a common
accusation you have learned to accept from working with these "humans". They
tend to not like it when you violate their social norms on appearances. You
hesitate for a moment for a witty reply to manifest itself and reply: "This is
my real face. It's a long story I'd rather not get into now."</p>
<p>The magick took root and the "Jeff" stopped thinking about it. He continued. "Is
there anything you want to know about Techaro or the position we're looking to
fill?"</p>
<p>You already knew everything from the words, both written and unwritten in the
job description. Their infrastructure was in chaos. They needed a hero. You saw
yourself as an apt standin for said hero.</p>
<p>"No, I think I got the gist from the description."</p>
<p>"So, Palima, what can you tell me about your background?"</p>
<p><em>Oh, where to begin?</em> you thought. "I have extensive experience in crafting
digital automatons into existence and then setting them off into the world to
get my goals done. I have worked at large companies such as MovieFlix where I
helped create the infrastructure background for one morbillion concurrent
streams of popular movies and TV shows. I have also worked on a lot of projects
that I can't talk about, but you are benefitting from at least three of them
right now. I am looking at joining a smaller company so that I can know everyone
at a more personal level. Being an anonymous cog in the machine is only
appealing for <em>so long</em>."</p>
<p>The "Jeff" grew a curious expression across his face. He looks like he just
found a unicorn, albeit one with a serious addiction to cold brew. <em>La trinkajxo
de la dioj.</em> He continued: "Wow, what's one of your favorite infrastructure
projects you've worked on?"</p>
<p>"Probably the one where we benchmarked a bunch of OS kernels in order to figure
out which one would work best for the MovieFlix backend. I was personally hoping
Linux would win, but we ended up choosing FreeBSD after <code>epoll(7)</code> ended up
making things run faster. We were all surprised by this. I think I still have a
commit bit to FreeBSD."</p>
<p>The man looked shocked. You were winning. Now to see what other fun this "Jeff"
would bring.</p>
<p>"Okay, this is mostly a formality, but I'd like to do a little live coding. You
sound like you have the kind of background we are looking for here at Techaro,
but we need to do this coding challenge just to be sure everyone's on the same
playing field. That sound okay with you?"</p>
<p>You nod. "Jeff" was about to have fun.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'm gonna send you a link to this website and it's gonna have a little
sorting challenge. There's an array of numbers here and I want you to sort them
and explain how the sort works."</p>
<p>"What language should I do it in?"</p>
<p>"Any language is fine really"</p>
<p>He made a mistake. Move quickly, before he takes it back.</p>
<pre><code><span>import </span><span>Control.Concurrent
</span><span>import </span><span>Control.Monad
</span><span>import </span><span>System.Environment
</span><span>
</span><span>sort values = </span><span>do
</span><span>    chan &lt;- newChan
</span><span>    forM_ values (\time -&gt; forkIO $ threadDelay (</span><span>100000</span><span> * time) &gt;&gt; writeChan chan time)
</span><span>    forM_ values (\_ -&gt; readChan chan &gt;&gt;= print)
</span><span>    
</span><span>main = getArgs &gt;&gt;= sort . map read
</span></code></pre>
<p>"...what is this doing?"</p>
<p>"Sorting the numbers in constant time. It is the algorithmically fastest sort I
know, and it is my favorite sorting algorithm."</p>
<p>"...how though? I don't see any comparisons?"</p>
<p>"You don't need to compare numbers to sort them. Sometimes all it takes is some
rest. Run it, it will work."</p>
<p>The "Jeff" looked like he had seen a ghost. Maybe his house was haunted. It is
more common than you think. So many ghosts wandering around these days.</p>
<p>You heard a few keyboard strokes and then an enter key. His facial expressions
changed and then he looked flabbergasted.</p>
<p>"...S.So how does this work per se? I've never seen anyone sort anything like this."</p>
<p>"This is sleepsort. It is the only constant time sorting algorithm I know of.
The way it works is that it spawns a separate green thread for every number you
want to sort, then delays that thread for that value times one hundred thousand
microseconds. This will sort the numbers."</p>
<p>"How is that constant time though? Doesn't the amount of time it takes depend on
the inputs?"</p>
<p>You smile, he has fallen for your trap. "Time complexity does not bother itself
with mere side effects like time. All you need is to sleep a little. Things will
resolve themselves. It is inevitable."</p>
<p>"Jeff" froze in place. At first you thought he was shocked a bit <em>too</em> much.
Then you checked in, just to be sure. Being shocked like that could ruin his
lovely, mild sunburnt complexion. "You still there?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm here. I've just never seen that before. It's a very...inventive
sorting algorithm. How would you optimize it?"</p>
<p>In a flash, one line of code is changed:</p>
<pre><code><span>-forM_ values (\time -&gt; forkIO $ threadDelay (100000 * time) &gt;&gt; writeChan chan time)
</span><span>+forM_ values (\time -&gt; forkIO $ threadDelay (10000 * time) &gt;&gt; writeChan chan time)
</span></code></pre>
<p>"It is now ten times faster."</p>
<p>At this point "Jeff" could not hold it back any more and started to laugh. He
cut loose and laughed the kind of laugh that you only see in a man who has lost
it. You worried for the "Jeff". He looked pale.</p>
<p>"Why did you use such a weird sorting algorithm?"</p>
<p>"Why did you use such a weird question?"</p>
<p>After settling down he made an expression you knew all too well. You were too
powerful, you could not be contained there. The "Techaro" was not complicated
enough. You would just have to struggle through the meatgrinder of Kubernetes
even though they would have been fine with a single dedicated server in Typhoon
Digital. There was a spare development board in your closet that would be fine
even.</p>
<p>You would be done too quickly. It would not be a worthy challenge. You finished
the call and took another sip of your cold brew. The rejection email was
imminent. You knew it couldn't come to pass.</p>
<p>Locking the battlestation and unplugging the unlock key, you slink back to your
precious haven. Entombing yourself in the blankets was the safest option.</p>
<p>Before the sweet bliss of nonexistence kissed your face again, there was another
tap on the wrist. They had already emailed back. Against all odds, they wanted
to hire you. For a significant amount of money, enough to make it worth whatever
trash fire you would endure there. You wondered if they knew what they were
getting into. You decided to sleep on it, things would surely sort themselves
out in the evening.</p>

      <section id="intro">
        
        <p>
          Online company reviews are high stakes.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious. 
          </p>
          <p>
          These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want “better” results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.
          </p>
          <p>
          Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they’ve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they’re able to take a negative review down. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we’re going to find out how it operates. 
          </p>

      <section id="addingreviews">
        <p>
          The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that’s where we’ll start. 
          </p>
          <p>
          To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don’t need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address). 
          </p>
          <p>
          I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company’s online presence.
          </p>
          <p>
          Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

          </center>
          <p>
            After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

               </tr>
               <tr>
                <td>Freelancer #5</td>

               </tr>
            </tbody>
         </table>

         <p>
          Let’s dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews. 
          </p>

          <center>
            <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/jv_volume.png" alt="">
          </center>

            <p>
            In another message, he tells me he’s offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:
            </p>
            <p>
            5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month
            </p>
            <p>
            Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that’s not bad change at all. 
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the companies that he’s offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won’t name the company, but here’s what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:
            </p>

            <center>
              <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/company_review_distribution.png" alt="">
            </center>

              <p>
              5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company’s total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad. 
              </p>
              <p>
              But here’s the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don’t look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don’t come in “spikes” – more on this later) and they also make sure that they’re not always leaving the “cons” section blank.
              </p>
              <p>
              Don’t get me wrong, if you come across this company’s reviews, it’d be pretty easy to tell they’re quite strange. In fact, I can’t even post some screenshots here because it’d give the company away immediately. 
              </p>
              <p>
              But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Sidenote: I got curious about how he’s been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address – doesn’t Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP? 
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the freelancers answered my question:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/multiple_email_ip_v2.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                Moving on – another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/error_displaying_results.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                Based on this <a href="https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs">Glassdoor webinar</a> from 2018, “if it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted” – so likely Glassdoor’s content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.
                </p>
                <p>
                So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>Spacing the fake reviews out 
                
                </li><li>Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
                
                </li><li>Using language that isn’t an obvious giveaway
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers’ first language is not English.
                </p>
                <p>
                As an experiment, I turned to everybody’s favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review: 
                </p>

                <center>
                  <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/chat_gpt.png" alt="">
                </center>

                <p>
                  And I’d say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across. 
                </p>

      <section id="removingreviews">
        <p>
          The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:
          </p>
          <ol>
          
          <li>You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
          
          </li><li>You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there’s something else about the review(s) that could get it removed. 
          
          </li><li>You file an appeal to get it removed. 
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          As an example, Glassdoor’s Review guidelines can be found <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job">here</a>. Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who’s not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.
          </p>
          <p>
          Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:
          </p>

         <p>
          As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed. 
          </p>
          <p>
          At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).
          </p>
          <p>
          I didn’t really understand the variance in prices so much, so I decided to ask. 
          </p>

          Nader Nadernejad is 25 years old and the founder of Nadernejad Media, one such online reputation management agency.

            Nader, based in Halifax, Canada, started his company almost 7 years ago and works with 3-5 larger corporations each year to help them with their online reputation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            He tells me that about half of those corporations also ask him to help them with their Glassdoor Review presence. The person doing the reach out is often the Chief Employee Experience Officer (CXO) or the Head of Employer Branding.

            <p>
            One of the most common requests he gets is when: 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“Companies come to us and say they just got a random influx of negative Glassdoor reviews all of a sudden. For example, they’ll get a bad review one day from a disgruntled employee, and then shortly after 7-8 negative reviews come in a day after. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>In this case, we’ll contact Glassdoor, tell them that this person was upset, that they went in and made a bunch of accounts. And usually what you’ll notice is that those types of reviews will disappear.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            The problem, Nader tells me, happens when a specific person has a vendetta against the company and knows what they’re doing: 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“So in this case, they are able to change their IP address, put a lot of effort into destroying a company – and in that case, our client will go: “What do we do now?” We’ve even seen instances where they’ve suspected it’s a competitor company leaving these reviews.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>In those cases, when we can’t get Glassdoor to get the review(s) taken down, we recommend getting reviews in the most organic, authentically way possible. And to create a repeatable process where you can garner those reviews.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            The above is what really points to the difference in price points. Nader’s firm consults more strategically on a company’s review landscape, often offering ways to improve employee morale and to find ways to effectively collect reviews. The freelancers, on the other hand, are just focused on getting a specific review removed. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I decide to ask Nader about what happens when he sees a review that he doesn’t think is actually based on fiction or from one employee who is trying to sabotage a company. Essentially, what happens when a company asks you to take down a (presumably) legitimate review? Does his firm still try to suppress the review?
            </p>
            <p>
            Nader is emphatic:
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>“There’s no way for us to remove the review. There’s nothing I can do to get it away. And if we were to flag a review that is legitimate, Glassdoor would just say “nah, this is a real review”. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>And there’s easy ways to see that. The IP Address that it comes from, the language that was used, is it similar to previous comments? Is it a duplicate? Is it the same sentiment?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>And so our goal becomes to accentuate the positive experiences within the company. Whilst it’s very easy for one employee to have a toxic experience, that won’t necessarily mean the whole company is toxic.“</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Glassdoor itself is adamant about the fact that a company can’t just remove reviews because they don’t like them. For a review to be removed, it has to actively break their Community Guidelines. 
            </p>
            <p>
            To test this out, I decided to send one of the larger ORMs in the industry an email about taking down a Glassdoor review for a completely random company. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I don’t have any plans to actually go through with removing this random review, but I’m more curious about whether an ORM would turn me down or not. Would they still try to tell me it can be removed? 
            </p>

            <p>
              The review I pick appears to be perfectly legitimate. It’s balanced, doesn’t seem to break any of Glassdoor’s review guidelines (like naming someone or threatening anyone), and is quite clear to read.
            </p>
             
              <p>
              A couple of hours later, I hear back from the ORM:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/orm_mu_response_v2.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                The ORM also explains to me that this will not be an “easy” removal. Their primary strategy for getting the review removed will be a Letter of Demand, which according to the ORM is one of a review management site's tools to establish communication with the public when something is wrong:
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>“We will use it to claim that the review contains false information, not necessarily negative, but false, then we'll create a case where they will analyze and we'll negotiate to take it down.”</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                I also sent the review to a freelancer, just to see what the differences in services offered looked like. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Comparing them:

              <p>
                Obviously, I have no idea if this review would actually get removed. What is true, though, is that there are a bunch of different services offered to try and get legitimate reviews like the above taken down.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I ask the ORM on why I should trust them, they get back to me with:

                <p>
                <em>“We have been working with Glassdoor reviews for approximately 8 years, during this time we have helped several companies with their negativity. Each case is different, there are companies that want us to manage all their negative reviews and some others that just want to focus on a few ones. Our success rate is approximately 75%. “</em>

            ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter">interview with NPR</a> that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is: 
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews. </li>
            
            <li>Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons</li>
            <li>Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies’ reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

              Let the games begin.
            </p>

            <h3>Voluntary Response Bias</h3>

            <p>
              One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Research shows many of today’s most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.
              </p>
              <p>
              Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.
              </p>
              <p>
              On the other hand, if you’ve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.
              </p>
              <p>
              Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You’re going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a “spike” in reviews. 
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Note: </strong>Just like the Wall Street Journal’s methodology described <a href="https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0">here</a>, I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.
              </p>
              <p>
              Let’s take the company below. Here’s a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/company_layoff_spike_v2.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. 

                It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off). 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Here’s another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/company_layoff_spike_v3.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).
                </p>
                <p>
                Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Note: </strong>Glassdoor does state (based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs">this video</a> from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their “give to get policy” has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don’t try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience. 
                </p>

                <h3>Goodhart’s Law</h3>

                Goodhart’s law states the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                <em>"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977">report</a> that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain &amp; Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor’s 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let’s refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:
                  </p>

                <center>
                  <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/fun_place_to_work_chart_v2.png" alt="">
                </center>

                <p>
                  FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews. 
                  </p>

                <p>
                  FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was ~75%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I find it strange that Glassdoor’s proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor’s eligibility criteria for the award, it’s as follows:
                  </p>

                  <center>
                    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/glassdoor_guidelines.png" alt="">
                  </center>


                  <p>
                    The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect “authentic and unbiased reviews”. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Whilst there’s nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting "unbiased and authentic" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to “coerce” them. Examples of what you can’t do:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li>Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
                    
                    </li><li>Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
                    
                    </li><li>Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They say that you shouldn’t hate the player but the game – I think <strong>FunPlaceToWork</strong> played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart’s Law. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I reached out to Glassdoor (awards@glassdoor.com) about the above and this is the reply I got:

        <section id="conclusion">
           
          <p>
            When I was 22, on an <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story">F1 visa with 3 months to find work</a>, I didn’t give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I’d sign any piece of paper you put in front of me. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an “A-Player”, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews. 
            </p>
            <p>
            For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there’s a concept of a “marketing touchpoint” - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.
            </p>
            <p>
            Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn’t afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After all, when others start to game the system, you’re at a disadvantage if you don’t. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
            HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren’t always paying attention. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy. 
            </p>

            <p>One that ends up hurting the job seeker.</p>

              <p>Another one: in March, GPT-4 was able to answer this question, and GPT3 got confused. Now, both fail : “How can you time 9 minutes using a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass?”</p>
<hr>
<p>"User<br>
How can you time 9 minutes using a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass?</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
You can time 9 minutes using a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass as follows:</p>
<p>Start both hourglasses at the same time.</p>
<p>After 4 minutes, the 4-minute hourglass will run out. Immediately flip the 4-minute hourglass to restart it.</p>
<p>After 3 more minutes (7 minutes in total), the 7-minute hourglass will run out. At this point, don’t do anything yet.</p>
<p>After 1 more minute (8 minutes in total), the 4-minute hourglass will run out (for the second time). Immediately flip the 4-minute hourglass again.</p>
<p>After 1 more minute (9 minutes in total), the sand in the 4-minute hourglass will have been running for 1 minute since you flipped it last. At this point, you’ve measured 9 minutes.</p>
<p>User<br>
Comment tu attends la minute du point 5?</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Dans cette stratégie, nous n’avons pas de moyen précis pour mesurer une minute lors de l’étape 5. Cependant, l’heure de cette minute est déduite du processus entier. Voici comment cela fonctionne :</p>
<p>Commencez les deux sabliers en même temps.</p>
<p>Après 4 minutes, le sablier de 4 minutes sera épuisé. Retournez immédiatement le sablier de 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Après 3 minutes supplémentaires (7 minutes au total), le sablier de 7 minutes sera épuisé. À ce moment, ne faites rien.</p>
<p>Après 1 minute de plus (8 minutes au total), le sablier de 4 minutes sera épuisé (pour la deuxième fois). Retournez immédiatement le sablier de 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Après 1 minute supplémentaire (9 minutes au total), le sable dans le sablier de 4 minutes aura coulé pendant 1 minute depuis la dernière fois que vous l’avez retourné. C’est à ce moment que vous avez mesuré 9 minutes. Vous n’attendez pas spécifiquement cette minute, mais elle est le résultat des étapes précédentes.</p>
<p>User<br>
Pas convaincant</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Je m’excuse si ma précédente réponse n’a pas été satisfaisante. Je comprends que vous cherchiez une méthode pour mesurer une durée exacte de 9 minutes à l’aide d’un sablier de 4 minutes et d’un autre de 7 minutes, où chaque minute est précisément décomptée. Malheureusement, cela n’est pas possible avec seulement ces deux sabliers, car ils ne peuvent pas mesurer des intervalles de 1 minute.</p>
<p>Si vous avez d’autres questions ou un autre scénario à proposer, je serai ravi de vous aider à trouver une solution.</p>
<p>User<br>
A l’étape 3, tu retournes le sablier de 7. Quand tu es à l’étape 4, il s’est passé 8 minutes, et seulement 1 minutes du sablier de 7 s’est écoulée. Tu le retourner, et il sera vide dans 1 minutes, donc à 8+1.</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Ah, je comprends maintenant. Merci pour cette clarification. Votre stratégie est tout à fait correcte. Voici la méthode révisée :</p>
<p>Commencez les deux sabliers en même temps.</p>

<p>This is a copy-paste from a GPT-4 exchange. (GPT-3.5 had the same type of error in step 5). You can translate and see the reasoning difficulties and the struggle to correct itself…</p>
<p>Fun fact, 30 minutes later, both models gave a correct answer in new prompts (learning?).</p>
<p>… and, this morning, once again they make reasonning mistakes with incoherent explanations. And this time almost impossible to lead GPT4 to a right explanation !</p>
<p>In March, GPT-4 answered correctly on the first try, with the right explanations. This question was part of a series of 30 questions I tried (28 out of 30 were accurate!).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
														<p>When a beleaguered Netscape <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/12/doing-windows-part-12-david-and-goliath">announced in January of 1998</a> that it would release the source code to its browser for everyone to tinker with and improve upon, the news shook the worlds of technology and business to their foundations. This open-source “revolution,” as even many in the mainstream press took to calling it, had sprung up seemingly out of nowhere to challenge the conventional wisdom and perhaps the very livelihood of traditional tech giants like Microsoft. For the next several years, you couldn’t open a trade journal or a newspaper’s business section without seeing some mention of the open-source movement and its leading exemplar, the robust and yet totally free — in all senses of the word — operating system Linux. Linux and other software like it was, an eye-opening number of people said, destined to destroy <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents">Microsoft’s vaunted Windows</a> monopoly any day now.</p>
<p>The movement’s <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2022/12/16/chapter-24-the-cultural-revolution"><em>Little Red Book</em></a> came in the form of <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">Eric S. Raymond’s 1997 essay “The Cathedral and the Bazaar.”</a> Originally presented as a comparison of a top-down versus a bottom-up methodology in the context of open-source projects, the central metaphor quickly got blurred in the minds of the public into a broader comparison of closed source versus open source, with Raymond’s tacit acquiescence. In this telling, the cathedral was Microsoft’s software-development model, in which a closeted priesthood bestowed programs upon a grateful populace on its own terms and on its own schedule. The bazaar was the hacker way, in which the people came together in a spirit of delightfully chaotic egalitarianism to make software for themselves, sharing their source code in the name of the greater good. “No closed-source developer can match the pool of talent the Linux community can bring to bear on a problem,” wrote Raymond. “The closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude more skilled time into a problem.” Thanks to Linux and the other open-source tools it enabled, he predicted elsewhere, Microsoft’s eagerly anticipated Windows 2000, the latest incarnation of its server-grade NT operating system, would “be either cancelled or dead on arrival. Either way, it will turn into a horrendous train wreck, the worst strategic disaster in Microsoft’s history.”</p>
<p>Alas, Raymond proved a less effective prophet than pundit. Not only was it not a failure upon its eventual release, but Windows 2000 evolved in 2001 into the consumer-grade Windows XP, by many standards the most successful single version of Windows in history.</p>
<p>Like that of all revolutions that have passed their heyday of strident ideology, the most extreme rhetoric of the late 1990s open-source movement can seem overheated if not downright silly today, the blinkered product of a tiny strata of metaphorical inside cats who have concluded, rather conveniently for themselves, that the most important social-justice campaign of their age is one that can be waged from behind their keyboards and monitors, just the place where they happen to feel most comfortable. As for the ideas they introduced into the public discourse: they were real, valid, and in many ways incredibly valuable, but in the end they would be woven into the fabric of existing corporate-software production practices rather than burning down the old ways wholesale.</p>
<p>For rigid ideology seldom makes a good fit with the real world; pragmatically mixed national economies, for example, succeed vastly better than dogmatically capitalist or communist ones. Similarly, instead of continuing to sort itself into two opposing camps at eternal loggerheads, the modern software ecosystem has learned to take the best from both sides to wind up with a sort of mixed economy of its own. The cleverest actors have learned to combine the cathedral and the bazaar in ways that maximize the strengths of each: Google builds its proprietary Web browser Chrome atop an open-source engine known as Chromium; Apple constructed the OS X desktop on the solid foundation of an open-source operating system known as Darwin; Android mobile phones and tablets have Linux at their core. Even Microsoft now embeds an optional “Linux subsystem” into Windows, as the cats lie down with the dogs.</p>
<p>The reasons for open source’s failure to more comprehensively conquer the world aren’t that hard to divine; they’re actually front and center in some of the movement’s founding principles. The editors of the grandiosely titled 1999 anthology <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/"><em>Open Sources: Voices from the Revolution</em></a> — one of those books whose very name clues you into the window of time in which it was published — wrote that “most open-source projects began with frustration: looking for a tool to do a job and finding none, or finding one that was broken or poorly maintained. Eric Raymond began fetchmail this way; Larry Wall began <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> this way; Linus Torvalds began Linux this way.” The latter two of these projects at least have remained among the most essential of the workhorses that make the Internet function, strong arguments for the superiority of the open-source model for developing some types of software.</p>
<p>But it appears that the same is not true for <em>all</em> types of software. A model in which programmers create only the programs that they most want to have threatens to yield a universe of software which is interesting and attractive <em>only</em> to programmers. Even Eric Raymond had to acknowledge that the production of software with mass appeal is only partially a “technical problem.”</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s [also] a problem in ergonomic design and interface psychology, and hackers have historically been poor at it. That is, while hackers can be very good at designing interfaces for other hackers, they tend to be poor at modeling the thought processes of the other 95 percent of the population well enough to write interfaces that J. Random End-User and his Aunt Tillie will pay to buy. Computers are tools for human beings. Ultimately, therefore, the challenges of designing hardware and software must come back to designing for human beings — all human beings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Open source has never entirely made this leap. It’s for this reason that its biggest success stories have come in the realm of back-end software rather than user-facing applications. Witness the long, frustrating history of “Linux on the desktop,” which, in an echo of the old hacker joke about strong artificial intelligence, has been perpetually just a few years away from world domination ever since the late 1990s. There is no theoretical bar to visual designers and experts in ergonomic psychology joining open-source projects, and in some times and places this has even happened. And yet the broad field of open source is still dominated by programmers writing software for themselves and for one another.</p>
<p>Game development joins grahical user interfaces as another notable area where the bazaar model doesn’t quite seem to do the trick. The open-source methodology excels at solving purely technical problems, but the making of a great game is a technical problem only in part — usually, not even the most important part. Consider the case of one of the most critically lauded games of the late 1990s, Valve’s <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/155/half-life/"><em>Half-Life</em></a>. It was a triumph of design and aesthetics, not of technology; its engine was borrowed from id Software’s two-and-a-half-year-old <em>Quake</em>, a technological showstopper in its day which <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents">has aged far less gracefully</a>. It would seem that the best way — or perhaps the only way – to create a great game from whole cloth is through a priesthood with a strong and distinctive design and aesthetic vision.</p>
<p>Those open-source games which have become relatively popular have tended to build upon previous game designers’ visions in much the same way that Chrome is built on Chromium: think <a href="http://freeciv.org/"><em>FreeCiv</em></a> or <a href="https://www.openttd.org/"><em>Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe</em></a>, worthy projects that are nevertheless more interested in making workmanlike technical improvements to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/01/sequels-in-strategy-gaming-part-1-civilization-ii">their</a> <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/10/transport-tycoon">inspirations</a> than bold fundamental leaps in design. The open-source movement has had the most pronounced impact on gaming in the form of tools, both for making games and for playing them. I could never have embarked with you on this journey through history that we’ve been on for over a decade now without the likes of <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a>, <a href="https://fs-uae.net/">UAE</a>, <a href="https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/">VICE</a>, and many, many other open-source emulators and utilities of all descriptions. I am deeply grateful to the many talented programmers who have given their time to them in order to keep our digital past accessible. Still, they do remain purely technical projects, not creative ones in the sense of the games which they enable to run on modern hardware.</p>
<p>The one ghetto of gaming where open-source projects have been able to forge a strong design and aesthetic sensibility all their own — a sensibility with no obvious antecedents in commercial, closed-source games — turns out upon examination to be not quite the anomaly it might first appear. The “roguelike” sub-genre of the CRPG dates all the way back to 1980, well before the modern open-source movement came to be. But, like that movement, it was a product of an institutional-computing hacker culture that had been around since the 1950s, in which proprietary software was regarded as not so much immoral as simply unheard of. It stands today as a fine example of open source at its best — and equally of what it does less well. Call it the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<hr>
<p><code> </code><br>
In <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, his classic chronicle of the first few decades of institutional hackerdom, Steven Levy writes about the appeal that <em>Adventure</em>, a game that would lend its name to an entire genre, held for the first people to play it on the big multi-user DEC computers of the late 1970s.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a sense, Adventure was a metaphor for computer programming itself — the deep recesses you explored in the Adventure world were akin to the basic, most obscure levels of the machine that you’d be traveling in when you hacked assembly code. You could get dizzy trying to remember where you were in both activities. Indeed, Adventure proved as addicting as programming…</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Rogue</em>, a game which would lend its name to a sub-genre that had even more appeal to the programming mindset, was itself a direct outgrowth of <em>Adventure</em>, with a couple of key elements added to the mix.</p>
<p>Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman were undergraduates at the University of California, Santa Cruz when they encountered <em>Adventure</em> for the time. Like so many others, they were absolutely entranced. The only drawback was that, once they finally beat the game for the first time, there wasn’t much more to be done; the puzzles were always the same, meaning that beating it again became a rote exercise. And there weren’t yet any other games like it. So, the pair started to talk about creating a game of their own, one that would play a little bit differently. What if, rather than building their game around a collection of pre-crafted set-piece puzzles, they made one that would offer up a new world to the player every single time through the magic of random procedural generation? That way, you could keep playing it forever, even after beating it once or twice or a dozen times. Even Toy and Wichman themselves would be able to have fun with it, given that they too would never know what sort of world they would be entering next.</p>
<p>But what exactly might such a game look like in practice? It wasn’t at all clear; the problem of describing a procedurally generated world in English prose like that used by <em>Adventure</em> was effectively insoluble in the context of the time. Then Toy stumbled upon a new programming library for the Unix operating system (the predecessor to and inspiration of Linux). The brainchild of a University of California, Berkeley student named Ken Arnold, “curses” let you arrange text however you wanted on a terminal screen, letting you change the contents of any one of the 1920 cells that made up a typical 80-character by 24-line display any time you wanted to; this made it possible to reserve different regions of the display for different sorts of information. Earlier games which hadn’t had access to curses, such as <em>Adventure</em>, had had to content themselves with teletype-like interactions: a continuous scrolling stream of text which, once fired at the screen, could only be forgotten. But curses changed all that at a stroke. You could use it to put up menus, maps, charts, and just about anything else you could write or draw using the ASCII character set, updating them all independently of one another.</p>
<p>It gave Toy and Wichman a viable path forward with their fondly imagined infinitely replayable game. For, while textual descriptions of a procedurally generated world were a nonstarter, showing a symbolic, visual representation of one using curses was another matter.</p>
<p>Avid players of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/dungeons-and-dragons">tabletop <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Toy and Wichman tried to recreate on the computer the dungeon-delving expeditions they enjoyed with their friends, exploring a network of rooms and tunnels filled with monsters to fight, traps and other hindrances to defuse, and treasures to collect. Whereas the main dish of <em>Adventure</em> had been set-piece puzzles, with only a side dish of dynamic logistical challenges — an expiring light source, an inventory limit, a pesky wandering thief with a sharp sword — <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/08/defining-the-crpg">the nature of their game</a> meant that it would have to be <em>all</em> logistics. In making this switch, they half-accidentally invented not just the first roguelike but one of the first CRPGs, full stop. We cannot give them complete credit for that genre, mind you: other proto-CRPGs were being created at the same time <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/08/the-first-crpgs">on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois</a> and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/08/temple-of-apshai">on the earliest home microcomputers as well</a>, as other <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> fanatics also tried to bring the tabletop experience to the computer. Still, by all indications Toy and Wichman made the leap without knowing what anyone else was up to.</p>
<p>It was Wichman who came up with the name of <em>Rogue</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the name just came to me. Names needed to be short because you invoked a program by typing its name in a command line. I liked the idea of a rogue. We were coming from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons background, but we were creating a single-player game. You weren’t going down into the dungeon with a party. The idea was that this is a person going off on his or her own. It captured the theme very succinctly.</p></blockquote>
<p>To depict their world, Toy and Wichman invented the iconography (textography?) that has remained the standard for roguelikes to this day. The walls of rooms were made from horizontal and vertical dashes (“-” and “|”), the tunnels between them from hash marks (“#”), doors from plus signs (“+”), treasure from dollar signs (“$”), monsters of varius types from any and all letters and symbols that weren’t already being used for something else. The focus of it all was your titular rogue, depicted as a forlorn little at-sign (“@”) adrift in this sea of promise and danger. The textual austerity of it all could become weirdly atmospheric. “You’d see a letter ‘T’ on the screen and it would startle you, because you knew it was a troll,” says Wichman.</p>

<p>The goal of the game was to find a MacGuffin called the Amulet of Yendor, hidden 25 dungeon levels or so deep, and return it to the surface. Doing so would require fighting ever more dangerous monsters, building up your character as you did so in classic RPG fashion, both through the experience points you gained from killing them and the equipment you collected. From the first, <em>Rogue</em> was intended to be <em>hard</em> — hard enough to challenge the very people who had made it. This is another quality that has remained a core value of the sub-genre which&nbsp;<em>Rogue</em> invented.</p>
<p>You didn’t know what the stuff you found actually did. Would that yellow potion restore your health, or would it kill you instantly? The safest way to know for sure was to use an “identification” scroll on your new finds, but such things were rare and precious, and ironically had to be themselves identified first. In a pinch, you might just have to try on that new ring or armor and see what happened, praying as you did so that it wasn’t cursed.</p>
<p>Food was the most essential resource of all; while you could eat the corpses of many monsters, some of them would make you sick and some of them would get their posthumous revenge by outright killing you. (Roguelikes are a bit like the old saw about the Australian Outback: <em>everything</em> in them seems to be able to kill you.) The only way to have a chance of winning was to play the game over and over again, slowly ferreting out its secrets and devising optimal strategies in the course of dying again and again and again. Even once you got really good, the difference between success and failure could still come down to sheer dumb luck, as “CRPG Addict” Chet Bolingbroke noted in <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2010/02/rogue-most-difficult-crpg-ive-played.html">his articles about the game</a>: “Sometimes you might find a two-handed sword +1 on the first level; other times, you’ll find three poison potions and a cursed dagger.” <em>Rogue</em>‘s own co-creator Glenn Wichman admits that he has never legitimately won it.</p>
<p><em>Rogue</em>, in other words, flagrantly violated almost all of the modern rules of progressive game design: it was unfair in countless ways and about as unwelcoming to newcomers as a game can be. It was a comedian telling jokes at the poor player’s expense, its later levels stocked with rust monsters that instantly destroyed her hard-won magical armor (until she learned to take it off before fighting them) and rattlesnakes that poisoned her (until she learned that the only practical way to combat them was to chunk whatever junk was to hand at them from a distance). And death was an irrevocable state. Although you could save a game of <em>Rogue</em> and come back to it later, this was intended only for the purpose of resuming an interrupted session: the save file was deleted as soon as you restored it. There were no second chances in <em>Rogue</em>; a single ill-considered move, or a single errant key press, or just a simple stroke of random bad luck, could and usually did erase hours of careful, steady progress.</p>
<p>And yet people found it strangely compelling. This was doubtless partially down to the times; there weren’t a lot of games available to play, which meant that the amount of time and energy required to get good at this one could seem more like an advantage than a disadvantage. But there was also more to it than that, as is indicated by the survival of the roguelike sub-genre right down to the present day, with all of its legendary difficulty intact. <em>Rogue</em> seemed to scratch a different itch than most games, a rash from which hackers seemed particularly prone to suffer. Very few successfully retrieved the Amulet of Yendor, but that only made the prospect of doing so that much more tempting. In the hyper-competitive culture of hackerdom, beating <em>Rogue</em> became a badge of honor almost on a par with writing some super-useful, super-elegant program that made everyone else jealous.</p>
<p>All of this didn’t happen instantly. Like most games on the big institutional computers, <em>Rogue</em> was a work in progress for years after the first version of it went up at UC Santa Cruz, probably in 1980. In 1982, Michael Toy got kicked out of the university for spending too much time tinkering with <em>Rogue</em> and not enough keeping up with his classwork. He took a job in UC Berkeley’s computer lab instead, splintering the partnership that had taken <em>Rogue</em> this far. Wichman now dropped off the scene, to be replaced at Berkeley by, of all people, Ken Arnold, the very hacker whose curses library had inspired the initial creation of <em>Rogue</em>. Toy and Arnold continued to expand and refine the game until they left Berkeley in 1984.</p>
<p>It was during this period that <em>Rogue</em> got <em>really</em> popular, spreading far and wide with the Unix operating system on which it ran, by now the overwhelming hacker favorite. <em>Rogue</em> became an almost equivalent touchstone of hacker culture, being played obsessively everywhere from Bell Labs to the Nevada National Security Site. The game’s creators were thrilled when they learned that both Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie — living gods among hackers, the creators of Unix itself — were major fans of the game; Ritchie jokingly called it the biggest single waster of CPU cycles in computing history. When Toy attempted to commercialize <em>Rogue</em> in 1984 by releasing an MS-DOS port through the publisher Epyx, he felt justified in advertising it as “the most popular game running on Unix” and “the most popular game on college campuses.”</p>
<p>By the time <em>Rogue</em> hit microcomputers, its partial inspiration <em>Adventure</em> had spawned its own thriving corner of the home-computer-games market, where companies like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/tag/infocom/?order=asc">Infocom</a> sold hundreds of thousands of slickly packaged parser-driven text adventures. But home users proved markedly less receptive to <em>Rogue</em> after its belated arrival. Even after Wichman came back on the scene to help Toy make prettier, semi-graphical versions of the game for the Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga, <em>Rogue</em> didn’t sell all that many copies. Wichman could only conclude that the audience that had made it such a hit on the big computers “wasn’t the audience that was looking for games in software stores.” It was a fair assessment: roguelikes would remain staples of hacker culture, but would never make inroads into the flashier commercial-games market.</p>

Small wonder that <em>Rogue</em> seemed to get lost in the marketing shuffle.</p></div>

<p>In this as in so many other respects, <em>Rogue</em> laid down the template for all of the roguelikes to come as thoroughly as <em>Adventure</em> did for its progeny. But there was one important exception, albeit one external to the game itself: Toy, Wichman, and Arnold didn’t release their source code to the public, clinging to the role of the high priests of a cathedral rather than embracing the bazaar model of software development. “In retrospect, it would have been better to share,” admits Arnold. Yet it isn’t that surprising that they didn’t. Open source had yet to become an ideological movement, even among the hardcore hacker contingent to which&nbsp;<em>Rogue</em>‘s fathers belonged. And they did, after all, have hopes of commercializing the game, even if those hopes ultimately failed to come to complete fruition.</p>
<p>As it was, the lack of source code meant that those who dreamed of building a better <em>Rogue</em> had no choice but to start from scratch. Among the first to do so was a group of boys who hung out together in the computer lab at Lincoln-Sudbury High School in Sudbury, Massachusetts, at the dawn of the 1980s. The school’s single modest DEC PDP-11 minicomputer wasn’t wired to the Internet, but the gang nevertheless encountered <em>Rogue</em> early in its history: in the summer of 1981, when their mentor, a young teacher named Brian Harvey, finagled an invitation for them to go out to Berkeley for a few weeks, to see what life was like in the big leagues of institutional computing. One of the kids who went was named Jay Fenlason. He fell in love with <em>Rogue</em> at first sight, managing to play it for about eight hours by his own estimate during the visit. He returned to Massachusetts determined to make a game just like it. He corralled his buddies into an unlikely game-development team, and over the course of the next year they made <em>Hack</em>, working strictly from their memories of the game they had seen at Berkeley.</p>
<p>That initial version of <em>Hack</em> has been lost, leaving behind only scattered anecdotes. However, all indications are that it wasn’t any remarkable advance over <em>Rogue</em> in itself. What made it important — indeed, what changed everything for the nascent roguelike sub-genre — was the decision Fenlason and his friends made to give away not just their executable but their source code as well.</p>
<p>To celebrate their graduation in 1982, the computer-lab gang packaged up the source code to all of the programs they had written, <em>Hack</em> among them, and sent it to an organization called USENIX, a computing-research nonprofit that maintained a file archive for its members. The source bore a simple notice at the top, saying that anyone who wished to was free to make improvements to the software and distribute them, as long as due credit was given to the original creators as well and as long as they shared the updated source. Having done that, the youngsters who had made <em>Hack</em> went their separate ways, having no idea what the game they had loosed upon the world would someday grow into.</p>
<p>At first, their lack of expectations seemed more than justified; while <em>Rogue</em> went everywhere in hackerdom, <em>Hack</em> went nowhere. Then, in early 1984, a thirty-something Dutch mathematician and programmer named Andries Brouwer, who worked at the Amsterdam research center Mathematisch Centrum, chanced to troll through USENIX’s file archive, looking for interesting software. Just as <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/06/the-completed-adventure-part-1">Don Woods</a> had rescued <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/05/will-crowthers-adventure-part-1">Will Crowther’s</a> incomplete game of <em>Adventure</em> from oblivion back in 1977, Brouwer now stumbled across <em>Hack</em> and did it the same service. He tightened up the code and the gameplay, and then started adding new features, which he tested on his colleagues at Mathematisch Centrum, most of whom became certifiable <em>Hack</em> addicts. Beginning on December 17, 1984, he uploaded each new version to the Internet as well.</p>
<p>Brouwer added the concept of character classes to the game, introducing six of them; no rogue was to be found among them, but they did include the likes of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/07/discworld-on-page-and-screen-part-1-serious-comedy">a tourist</a> and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/09/indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis-or-of-movies-and-games-and-whether-the-twain-shall-meet">an archeologist</a>, evidence of a quirky sense of humor that would continue to mark the game forevermore. He added shops in the dungeon for buying and selling equipment, and made the dungeon deeper; it now went down 40 levels, the last ten a special region called Hell that demanded magical protection from fire and a teleport spell to even enter. No longer did you find the Amulet of Yendor just lying around somewhere down there in the depths; now you had to defeat a Wizard of Yendor to get your mitts on it. To these big enhancements he added a wealth of smaller details that were likewise destined to remain indelible parts of the game, such as a dog or cat companion to accompany you on your expedition and the ability to write messages on the floor for various purposes.</p>
<p>For years, players of <em>Rogue</em> had been sharing their tips and travails on the <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/05/a-web-around-the-world-part-10-a-web-of-associations">Usenet</a> group net.games.rogue. It was here that Brouwer now announced his new roguelike. The community there pounced upon <em>Hack</em>, which, if not clearly better than <em>Rogue</em>, did have the virtue of being subtly different from a game which most of them had already played to death. The volume of <em>Hack</em>-related traffic grew so extreme that, just one month after Brouwer had uploaded his game for the first time, the group net.games.hack came into being to accommodate it. “Please stop posting articles about <em>Hack</em> to net.games.rogue and use this new group instead,” wrote a Usenet administrator pointedly.</p>
<p>Brouwer kept his fire hose of additions and improvements spurting until July of 1985, when he pronounced himself satisfied with the game and moved on to other things. But, thanks to the fact that he had honored the wishes of Jay Fenlason and company and publicly released his source code, <em>Hack</em> could continue to morph and grow after his departure in a way that <em>Rogue</em> had not been able to after Michael Toy and Ken Arnold left Berkeley. Ports and modified versions were soon popping up everywhere. It was exciting in a way, but it became a bit <em>too</em> much like the babble of a bazaar. Three hackers, by the names of Mike Stephenson, Izchak Miller, and Janet Walz, decided that a little bureaucracy wouldn’t be amiss. They decided to create a sort of curated version of the game, incorporating changes from anyone who wished to contribute to the project, as long as they were well-coded, worthwhile, and not game-breaking. Because their home base was net.games.hack, they named their version of the game <em>NetHack</em>. Its first official release came in July of 1987; its most recent one as of this writing came out in February of 2023. I suspect that there will be many, many more before <em>NetHack</em>‘s full history can be written.</p>
<div id="attachment_5494"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/07/going-rogue/nethack1/" rel="attachment wp-att-5494"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5494" decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nethack1-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nethack1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nethack1.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-5494"><em>NetHack</em> is an answer for every player of traditional adventure games who has ever asked why she can’t just bash a door open instead of searching hither and yon for the key.</p></div>
<p>The semi-anonymous wizards behind the <em>NetHack</em> curtain are known simply as the DevTeam. For 36 years, this rotating cast of characters has maintained and added to the game, making it one of if not the most systemically complex ever created, even as it retains in its canonical version an entirely textual display focused around a little wandering at-sign. Experienced players delight in ferreting out the emergent possibilities provided by the sheer depth of <em>NetHack</em>‘s systems. “The DevTeam thinks of <em>everything</em>,” goes a saying among players.</p>
<p>To wit: use a pair of gloves to pick up a dead cockatrice, a creature which turns any living thing it touches to stone, then bash your enemies with it to turn <em>them</em> to stone. (This technique is known among the <em>NetHack</em> cognoscenti as “wielding the rubber chicken.”) Of course, you’ll need to use a pick axe afterward to separate the statues of your enemies that are left behind from the loot they were carrying…</p>
<p>Or combine a Wand of Polymorph with a Ring of Polymorph Control to eliminate the middleman, as it were, turning yourself into a cockatrice. You can lay eggs in this form, which you can pick up and carry around once you revert to your natural form, throwing them at your enemies like grenades while you gleefully sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm-po_FUmvM">“Rainy Day Women #12 and 35.”</a></p>
<p>The possibilities are endless. <em>NetHack</em> even keeps track of the phases of the moon in the real world and uses them to influence your luck; this leads to devotees clearing their calendars once per month in order to maximize their chances when the moon is full.</p>
<p><em>NetHack</em> has become an institution of old-school hacker culture, and with it an icon of the open-source movement. None other than Eric Raymond was the first to create an optional graphical skin for the game (a move that prompted considerable controversy). And well before he wrote <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em>, he wrote the first manual for <em>NetHack</em>. Small wonder that it joined <em>Rogue</em> and <em>Adventure</em> as one of the very few games memorialized in 1996’s <em>New Hacker’s Dictionary</em> — compiled by, you guessed it, Eric S. Raymond. DevTeam founding member Mike Stephenson has no doubts about <em>NetHack</em>‘s importance, not only as a standalone game but as a model for software development: “We predated open source [as a movement], but I do think we helped to promote the idea of making software available for public use without cost. I think the other thing that really contributed to the concept of open source is that <em>NetHack</em> has, and still does, accept bug reports and feature ideas from anyone.”</p>
<p><em>NetHack</em> became the standard bearer of the roguelike sub-genre almost from the moment of its first release, and has never had its status in this regard seriously challenged. That said, hundreds of other roguelikes were made after it, and some even before it. The most important among them are arguably <em>Moria</em> and <em>Angband</em>. The former arrived at a complete form already in 1983, when it became the first game of this type to offer an above-ground town to serve as a base for your dungeon expeditions; this gave it a significantly different feel, more like, to put things in the terms of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, an ongoing campaign than a single adventure module. <em>Moria</em> directly inspired 1990’s <em>Angband</em>, a much more complex implementation of the same approach, which, like <em>NetHack</em>, is still in active development today. Some players prefer <em>NetHack</em>‘s relentlessly escalating challenge, others <em>Angband</em>‘s somewhat more relaxed pacing and more free-form structure — but make no mistake, <em>Angband</em> too will kill you in a heartbeat if you let your guard down. And in it as well, dead is dead, permanently.</p>
<div id="attachment_5499"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/07/going-rogue/roguetree2/" rel="attachment wp-att-5499"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5499" decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Roguetree2-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="400" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Roguetree2-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Roguetree2-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Roguetree2-768x1071.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Roguetree2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-5499">This roguelike “family tree” shows how the most historically and currently popular games in the sub-genre relate to one another.</p></div>
<p>This brings us back around to a statement I made at the outset: that roguelikes are the exception that proves the rule of open-source game development — and just possibly of open-source software development in general. The cast of thousands who contribute to them do so in order to make exactly the games that they want to play, which in the abstract is the best of all possible reasons to make a game. The experience they end up with is, unsurprisingly, much like high-wire programming at its most advanced, presenting players with an immense, multi-faceted system to be explored and mastered. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>Still, it does seem to me that roguelikes tend to bring out some of the worst as well as the best of the hacker ethic, what with their insistence that they’re only for the “hardcore” and their lack of empathy for the newcomer. Few things in this world are less attractive than a nerd beating his chest. Robert Koeneke, the creator of <em>Moria</em>, admits that while he was working on it, “if anyone managed to win, I immediately found out how, and ‘enhanced’ the game to make it harder.” Likewise, for every cool interaction to be discovered in <em>NetHack</em>, there’s a cheap, heartless death in store, like stumbling down a staircase whilst carrying a cockatrice and turning yourself to stone, or missing a stirrup whilst trying to mount a horse and breaking your neck, or incinerating yourself by firing off your Wand of Lightning too close to a wall, or getting killed by your own pet dog when you attempt to use your Ring of Conflict to get that nearby band of orcs fighting one another. <em>NetHack</em> is the sort of game that likes to give you a fake Amulet of Yendor, than laugh at you when you scurry all the way back to the surface with it and think you’re about to win.</p>
<p>As with so much in life, one’s relationship to roguelikes comes down to questions of priorities. As someone who likes to play a variety of games, I’ve never done more than dabble in these ones. For the time required to get even minimally competent at them is more than I’m willing to invest in any single game — or that I <em>can</em> invest, if I want to keep doing what I do on this site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the amount of time and effort required to get <em>good</em> at a game like <em>NetHack</em> is staggering, even if you’re far smarter and more diligent than I am. It took Chet Bolingbroke 262 hours of trying to win at <em>NetHack</em> for the first time — and that was playing in a fashion that many purists would consider illegitimate, by looking up spoilers on the game’s many interconnected components rather than learning strictly through experience, not to mention playing an old version that is much less complex than the current ones. Was it worth the time investment? He has his doubts. “Permadeath just sucks,” he concludes. Even Eric Raymond feels today that <em>NetHack</em> may have gone too far: “There was a natural tendency for the devs to see the game from the point of view of someone who played it constantly and obsessively. Thus, over time, their notion of not making it ‘too easy’ gradually ratcheted up the difficulty level to the point where you really couldn’t enjoy it casually anymore.” <em>NetHack</em> displays, in other words, open-source software’s usual Achilles heel, its developers’ inability to put themselves in the shoes of people who aren’t just like them.</p>
<p>Then again, it isn’t as if this represents some deep moral failing; there’s nothing wrong with being niche. Many or most lovers of <em>NetHack</em> and other roguelikes have never won them and quite probably never will, finding satisfaction merely in the trying, in hoping to get a little further than last time and walk away with some entertaining stories to share. Far be it from me to begrudge them their pleasures. Although I doubt that I will ever become a big fan of roguelikes, I do derive a quiet sort of satisfaction from knowing that things so implacably committed to being their own idiosyncratic selves exist in this world.</p>
<p>And if roguelikes will never go mainstream, that doesn’t mean they haven’t <em>influenced</em> the mainstream. Next time, we’ll learn how one of the most popular of all the slick commercial games of the late 1990s grew out of this odd little corner of hackerdom…</p>

<p>Depending on where you live, your Amazon order may have been delivered by one of the company's striking-looking Rivian electric delivery vans. Made by the same company that builds highly capable electric <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/">trucks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/">SUVs</a> for the affluent tech crowd, Rivian has now built more than 5,000 delivery vans for the online retailing giant. The vans have delivered more than 150 million packages to date.</p>
<p>Amazon and Rivian <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/electric-truck-startup-announces-700-million-funding-round-led-by-amazon/">made news together in 2019</a> when the former led a $700 million investment round into the EV startup. A few months later, Amazon announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/amazon-orders-100000-electric-trucks-to-fight-climate-change/">an order of 100,000 electric vans from Rivian</a>. At the time, Amazon's then-CEO Jeff Bezos said all 100,000 vehicles would be deployed by 2024—a timeline that even pre-pandemic appeared extremely optimistic; the official press release gave a more circumspect 2030 deadline. The vans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/amazon-begins-delivering-packages-with-prototype-electric-trucks/">began delivering packages in 2021</a>.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-scaled.jpg" data-height="1708" data-width="2560" alt="No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay."><img alt="No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-980x654.jpg" width="980" height="654"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-scaled.jpg" data-height="1708" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay.</p><p>Amazon</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/our-first-impressions-after-driving-fedexs-new-electric-delivery-van/">BrightDrop Zevo 600</a>, the Rivian van is a clean-sheet design, optimized specifically for Amazon's logistics workflow. It's equipped with a full suite of advanced driver assistance systems, and the cab design minimizes blind spots. It even has a charming appearance, much like Rivian's R1 series, thanks to friendly round daytime running lights.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Here in Washington, DC, I've yet to see any Amazon Rivians on the road, but on a recent trip to Northern California they were thick on the ground—I counted at least four over the course of an hour.</p>
<p>In fact, the Rivian vans are at work in "more than 800 regions and cities" in the US, according to Amazon. These include Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Grand Rapids, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Madison, Nashville, New York, Newark, Oakland, Omaha, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Provo, Rochester, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, and Toledo. Amazon says Alpharetta, Charlotte, Miami, and Orlando are next.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV11-scaled.jpg" data-height="1708" data-width="2560" alt="By 2030, Amazon says it will have 100,000 of these vans in service."><img alt="By 2030, Amazon says it will have 100,000 of these vans in service." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV11-980x654.jpg" width="980" height="654"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV11-scaled.jpg" data-height="1708" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> By 2030, Amazon says it will have 100,000 of these vans in service.</p><p>Amazon</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can also add the German cities of Berlin, Dusseldorf, and Munich to that list. Earlier this week, Amazon also announced that it will send some of its Rivians across the Atlantic, where they will join an existing German fleet of more than 1,000 electric delivery vehicles.</p>
<p>Ars hasn't <em>quite</em> persuaded Rivian and Amazon that they should let us test one of their vans yet. But I'm working on it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="GRvIw3">In late May, Sarasota County, Florida, health officials confirmed they had identified a case of locally transmitted malaria. In <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/healthcare/2023/06/20/health-officials-confirm-second-case-of-malaria-in-sarasota-manatee/70337207007/">mid-June</a>, they confirmed the second. On June 26, after an additional two cases were confirmed, Florida health officials issued a statewide <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/statewide-mosquito-borne-illness-advisory-issued-for-more-reported-malaria-cases-florida-health-officials">mosquito-borne illness advisory</a> — and in early July, two more cases were <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/sarasota/2023/07/06/florida-health-dept-reports-two-more-malaria-cases-in-sarasota-county/70387494007/">confirmed</a>.</p>
<p id="sIaID9">Meanwhile,<strong> </strong>Texas joined in: On June 23, its state health department <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-advisory-locally-acquired-malaria-case">announced</a> it had confirmed a case of local malaria transmission in Cameron County.</p>
<p id="gqPIgJ">That’s a total of seven cases in the past month.<strong> </strong>This is all highly unusual: Until now, the US hadn’t documented a locally acquired malaria case in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5238a3.htm">20 years</a>. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.asp">nationwide advisory</a> to alert health care providers and public health authorities about the possibility of locally acquired malaria in people with fevers of unclear origin.</p>
<p id="UtnilU">Although about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/cdc_malaria_program_2022.html">2,000</a> people infected with malaria turn up in the US health care system every year, those cases are all linked to travel outside the US. Neither those involved in the Florida cases nor the Texas case had traveled. That means in both states, the infection was acquired within US borders. </p>
<p id="oJbNXS">Experts say the cases shouldn’t warrant panic about widespread malaria transmission in the US. But it does warrant asking some questions, and being wary of the threat of more local transmission. Mosquitoes can infect multiple people before a full-on outbreak is even identified — so more cases could be out there.</p>
<p id="IFoDF6">Even if this turns out not to be widespread, it’s a good reminder: Malaria could make a comeback in the US, and we — and our <a href="https://www.vox.com/public-health" data-source="encore">public health</a> infrastructure — ought to be prepared. This is especially true as a changing climate and shifting weather patterns increasingly drive <a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/news-stories/stories/explainer-how-climate-change-amplifying-mosquito-borne-diseases">mosquito migration</a> into new places worldwide, allowing malaria to settle in where it hasn’t before.</p>
<h3 id="68zSPj">These cases are not the worst form of the disease — but they’re not benign</h3>
<p id="52x3T7">Malaria comes in a variety of flavors, all in the genus Plasmodium<em>,</em> and all parasites that infect and kill red blood cells. The anemia that results is the major cause of most of the bodily havoc that follows.</p>
<p id="5SbXcK">The species that has been identified in both Florida and Texas is P. vivax<em>. </em>It’s not the worst of the malaria species: P. falciparum<em>, </em>the most severe form of malaria, is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/1/1/ofu034/2280699">10 times more deadly than vivax</a>, according to a study of Americans diagnosed between 1985 and 2011. But vivax is no cakewalk. People with this infection can develop life-threatening brain swelling, lung congestion, and kidney failure. </p>
<p id="eLgogD">The infection causes fevers that come and go, along with a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003890">wide range of symptoms</a> that can be mistaken for flu, a stomach bug, or liver disease. </p>
<p id="k5i4fS">Vivax malaria is sneakier than some of its counterparts: The parasite can hang out dormant in the liver for years after the initial infection, rearing its head long after an exposure. (<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922%2820%2930074-X">Worldwide</a>, most vivax malaria infections occur in East Africa, South Asia, and the northern parts of South America.)</p>
<p id="fObd8b">Malaria was a huge problem in the US until it was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html">eliminated in the 1950s</a>, largely by spraying the insecticide DDT in homes and environmental areas to kill the mosquitoes that spread it. (All forms of malaria are spread by mosquitoes in the Anopheles<em> </em>genus, and the US still has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/mosquitoes-in-the-us.html">lots</a> of them.)</p>
<p id="7Dj9wu">Also keeping malaria at bay: The mosquitoes that transmit the disease like to bite at night — and as American homes have increasingly incorporated window screens and air conditioning, the people inside them have been better protected from being food for this particular genus.</p>
<p id="6iRfnZ">So malaria is not something you’d expect to catch in the US anymore. But when things line up just right, all the ingredients are there for malaria transmission to happen in the US. </p>
<h3 id="KoxJAG">What does it take for malaria transmission to happen in the US?</h3>
<p id="BKbVMk">One big unanswered question right now is: Why are two geographically distant parts of the US seeing local transmission of malaria right now — especially after so many years without it?</p>
<p id="hSsvpq">Although both states see many travel-related malaria cases each year, those cases don’t usually lead to local spread. Is something different this year? Or is this just a coincidence?</p>
<p id="ZHjVq4">To think through the possibilities, it’s helpful to understand how malaria spreads. </p>
<p id="5c1mzU">Malaria gets transmitted when a female Anopheles mosquito <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/faqs.html#:~:text=How%20is%20malaria%20transmitted%3F,taken%20from%20an%20infected%20person.">bites an infected person</a> and then, a week later, bites an uninfected person. In between bites, the mosquito does mosquito business in warm, stagnant water — but it’s fussy about the water it prefers. These malaria-spreading mosquitoes generally like to breed in bodies of water with vegetation growth along the banks, wrote Wade Brennan, a Sarasota County mosquito manager, in an email. In other words, it prefers the forest to puddles of water near human habitation, like the ones you might find in an empty bucket or garbage can outside your house.</p>
<p id="uzHvb7">To kick off local transmission, a person who’s acquired P. vivax<em> </em>malaria overseas needs to get close enough to an Anopheline mosquito’s habitat to get bitten<em>. </em>For the next few days, the vivax infection brews in the mosquito’s gut. About a week later, it’s ready to infect another person. When the mosquito bites its next victim, particles in its saliva mix with the person’s blood — and before the mosquito lets go, some of those particles get injected into the person. </p>
<p id="ejodmT">A few weeks later, that second person gets sick. Meanwhile, the mosquito still has a few weeks to live — and in that time, it’s still feeding on other people, potentially infecting them, too. But even if it dies, its friends might be biting this newly infected person and transmitting the infection onward.</p>
<p id="9HrKJQ">So: The basic elements of malaria transmission are a source (the infected returned traveler), a vector (the mosquito), an uninfected target (the newly identified cases), and an environment that allows them to come in contact. Increasing any of these elements could make local transmission more likely.</p>
<h3 id="dLNbz3">A robust public health system helps understand the causes in cases like this and is critical to the response</h3>
<p id="H04SXu">It’s not yet clear whether any changes in mosquito populations or in human behavior are the reason for this current spate of locally acquired cases. But public health investigations in both states have already identified risk factors for the people who’ve been infected — and environmental reservoirs of the infection.</p>
<p id="o7xlgA">In an interview on June 23,<strong> </strong>Michael Drennon, a Sarasota County health department epidemiologist, couldn’t share demographic or location information about the two locally infected people who had been identified at that time. However, he noted both were adults who spend a significant amount of time outside at night, and they hadn’t traveled anywhere outside the US. </p>
<p id="PXkRxG">The Texas case occurred in a southern Texas county that borders Mexico and the person been <a href="https://www.krgv.com/videos/national-guardsman-identified-as-individual-who-tested-positive-for-malaria/">identified</a> as a National Guardsman who was working on a border security assignment shortly before his symptoms started. Although vivax malaria is present in parts of Mexico, the infection is <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/itineraries/mexico">not typically found</a> in the northern part of the country that abuts Texas.</p>
<p id="1EyIAI">Brennan said his Sarasota County mosquito management team had found malaria-infected mosquitoes in an area swamp and had focused prevention efforts there, applying insecticides that kill both adult and juvenile forms of the mosquito. “We have been able to make sure the mosquito population in that area is extremely low,” he wrote.</p>
<p id="k764w5">It’s unclear whether more Anopheline mosquitoes than usual are circulating in either state. More mosquitoes would increase the chances that an infected person’s parasites could spread to an uninfected person — and would make the disease harder to eradicate.</p>
<p id="HTEarv">Overall, the environment of the US is growing more conducive to growing populations of mosquitoes, which may raise the risk of malaria transmission. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/28/707604928/chart-where-disease-carrying-mosquitoes-will-go-in-the-future">Climate change</a> is “definitely playing a role in vector-borne disease” broadly throughout the United States, said Estelle Martin, an entomologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who researches mosquito-borne diseases. Over the last two decades, increasing temperatures and extreme weather have favored mosquito replication — and they also favor the replication of malaria parasites. But it’s not clear exactly what role that dynamic is playing in these three cases.</p>
<p id="3ulobr">Colin Carlson, a global change biologist at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security who has led <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0365">research</a> on the rapidly expanding reach of malaria-spreading mosquitoes in Africa, <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinJCarlson/status/1672993700866056198">tweeted</a> about the cases over the weekend. Climate change may contribute to malaria risk by increasing the size of mosquito populations, he noted — however, “we know very little, climate evidence is weak, and epidemiological impacts would be tricky to guess.”</p>
<p id="BRduHT">A CDC spokesperson wrote in an email to Vox on Friday, “Though we know in general that climate can be one of many factors that can impact vector-borne diseases, in this situation, there is no compelling reason to think so.” More likely at play, said the agency, were the forces of migration: “Today, global travel and trade allow vector-borne diseases to be moved around the world and transmitted by local mosquitoes or ticks, especially in places where those diseases may have once been common.”</p>
<h3 id="3x81JN">It’s not time to panic, but it is time to protect yourself</h3>
<p id="2DoWsg">Even if several people have been infected and there are some mosquitoes out there with the parasite in their bellies, it doesn’t mean the US is headed for an explosive malaria outbreak. “It’s always worrisome that you have local transmission in an area,” said Martin, but added that there’s no need to panic. And there’s a lot people can do to protect themselves. </p>
<p id="NSNYHu">It’s important for people to do their best to avoid mosquito bites, said Drennon. He advises people to wear long sleeves and cover their legs — which he acknowledges is challenging in the Florida heat — and to use mosquito repellent. </p>
<p id="ltzJAJ">Eliminating mosquito hangout spots is also very important: Although Anopheline mosquitoes typically don’t congregate near houses, he advises people to drain any standing water and eliminate places where water can accumulate, as other mosquitoes that spread <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/outdoor/mosquito-borne/default.html">other infections</a> can breed there. “It’s not uncommon to see dengue here,” he said; during the Zika outbreak in 2016-17, the state was also one of two US locations where that virus was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html">transmitted locally</a>.</p>
<p id="NEyrXt">It’s also important for local health care providers to be aware of the local risk for malaria. Mosquitoes can infect multiple people before the outbreak is even identified. So once one case is found, public health officials need to snap into action, alerting health care workers, educating the public on prevention, and coordinating mosquito seek-and-destroy missions.</p>
<p id="Of7rv8">Sarasota County’s first case was initially diagnosed while the patient was being evaluated for a fever; blood test abnormalities prompted further testing, said Drennon. Area health care providers were alerted to the case, and the second case was reported not long after. </p>
<p id="SK23kG">Even if these outbreaks prove to be a blip, the threat of malaria taking a stronger hold in the US remains. “We know that we have individuals who travel all over the world who can wind up here with malaria,” Drennon said. “And we know that we have the vector species here that can transmit it.” It’s critical for the public “to take precautions to prevent not<strong> </strong>only malaria but other mosquito-borne diseases that we have in Florida.” </p>

      Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.
<br>
First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.
<br>
Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. And we can’t do that if we have a paywall. 
<br>
It’s important that we have several ways we make money, just like it’s important for you to have a diversified retirement portfolio to weather the ups and downs of the stock market. That’s why, even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants and reader support. (And no matter how our work is funded, we have strict guidelines on editorial independence.)

   <p>Fueled by rage over the police killing of a teenager during a routine traffic stop June, throngs of young people in France have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/02/1185705977/france-protests-police-shooting-nahel-paris-marseille">lashing out</a> against alleged racial profiling and calling for greater police accountability. </p>   <p>Over the last week, protesters have lit thousands of cars on fire, attacked schools, town halls, police stations, banks and businesses, and set nearly a thousand buildings ablaze. Some in the Paris suburb of L'Hay-les-Roses rammed a burning car into the mayor's home. Estimates of the damage have been projected to be about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/04/business/france-riots-businesses-cost/index.html#:~:text=Just%20weeks%20after%20hugely%20disruptive,from%20a%20week%20of%20rioting.">$1.1 billion.</a> As a result, thousands of young people have been arrested since the rioting began in the days after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1185652168/france-protests-nahel-funeral-nanterre-police">17-year-old Nahel M.</a> was killed on June 27. According to France's Interior Ministry, the average age of those arrested is 17.</p>   <p>The crisis has exposed deep rancor within marginalized and often low-income communities over discrimination —  Nahel is of North African descent<strong> </strong>— and a general lack of opportunity. </p>

   <p>President Emmanuel Macron has mostly blamed social media for the devastation, but he has also claimed that video games have inspired copycat violence and vandalism. </p>   <p>"It sometimes feels like some of them are experiencing, on the streets, the video games that have intoxicated them," Macron <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZM3PcMsIFY">said </a>in a press conference on July 1. </p>   <p>He added that protesters are using Snapchat and TikTok to organize themselves and spread "a mimicking of violence, which for the youngest leads to a kind of disconnect from reality."</p>   <h3>World leaders turn to an outdated explanation </h3>   <p>Concerns that video games promote shootings, massacres or rioting are now about half a century old; it has been traced back to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/28/archives/death-race-game-gains-favor-but-not-with-the-safety-council.html">1976 release of Death Race,</a> an arcade video game which put players behind the wheel of a car to mow down humanoid figures for points. The argument gained renewed traction in the 1990s with the release of much more realistic first-person shooter games.</p>   <p>It is an old bogeyman that <a href="https://ncac.org/resource/a-timeline-of-video-game-controversies">politicians have latched onto</a> in the wake of horrific tragedies.<strong> </strong>But it has become less common as troves of studies have largely concluded there is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0031-7">no causal link between video games and violent behavior</a>.</p>   <p>Still, that hasn't stopped world leaders from attempting to draw a correlation between the two. Just three months ago, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva blasted video games for "teaching kids to kill." </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186401441" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I doubt there is a kid of eight, nine, 10, 12 years old, who is not used to spending a great deal of time playing this rubbish," he said at a conference to address hate speech on social networks. (His<strong> </strong>son later apologized for his father's remarks, saying neither he or his siblings had become violent as a result of playing video games.)</p>   <p>In 2019, following <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748190808/trump-calls-for-strong-background-checks-following-el-paso-and-dayton-shootings">two mass shootings</a> that happened<strong> </strong>just days apart — one in Dayton, Ohio and another in El Paso, Texas — President Donald Trump told America that "we must stop the glorification of violence in our society."</p>   
   <p>He added, "This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace."</p>   <h3>Experts stress that video games don't cause violent crime</h3>   <p>Christopher Ferguson, a professor at Stetson University in Florida who has studied the impact of such games on the public, said he is surprised at<strong> </strong>Macron's comments. The president is 45 years old and belongs to a generation raised with video games, so "seeing him mention this is almost anachronistic," Ferguson said, sounding perplexed. </p>   <p>"The evidence is very clear. Whatever may be going on in France, whatever violence is occurring, it certainly is not due to violence in video games."</p>   <p>Decades of research, especially long-term experiments spanning decades, have consistently found "that playing violent video games, do not cause even prank-level aggressive behaviors, let alone violent crimes," Ferguson said. </p>   <p>He also noted that the overall violent crime in the U.S. dropped significantly between 1993 and 2020, the same period during which violent video games soared in popularity. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186402087" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>And it's not just in the United States. A <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.171474">2019 study</a> out of Oxford University determined that early violent video game playing among<strong> </strong>British teenagers does not predict serious or violent criminal behavior later in life.</p>   <p>According to Ferguson, if video games were the cause of rampant violence, then countries like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, which consume more violent video games per capita, would be rife with bloodshed.</p>   <p>"Instead, they're three of the most peaceful countries on the planet in terms of violent crime," he said. </p>   <p>Ferguson explained that factors that can predict violent behaviors tend to be difficult family environments in which there is abuse or neglect, poverty and mental health disorders. "Just being in a bad neighborhood where your opportunities to get ahead and have an equal chance in society seem pretty remote," he said. </p>   <p>They are the sort of issues that require a deep policy and societal changes, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186403353" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"You could wave a magic wand and take all these people's video games away, and that's not going to have any effect in any way going to help their lives and reduce their aggression," Ferguson said. </p>   <p>So why do politicians turn to the familiar refrain? Ferguson said it is a way for elected leaders to shift the blame away from failing government policies. </p>   <p>"It gets people talking about the wrong thing. They're thinking about video games. They're not thinking about gun control or whatever inequalities are happening in France," Ferguson said. </p>

Fedora&nbsp;40 change proposal</a> to add limited, opt-out telemetry to the
workstation edition.  The proposal is detailed; it is clear that the
developers involved understand that this will be a hard sell in that
community.
</p><blockquote>
	We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited
	aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big
	data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in
	the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable
	data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service
	will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not
	depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party
	services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating
	systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private
	metrics server instead of Fedora's to see precisely what data is
	being collected from you, because the server components are open
	source too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">File this one under inevitable but hilarious. Mechanical Turk is a service that from its earliest days seemed to invite shenanigans, and indeed researchers show that nearly half of its “turkers” appear to be using AI to do tasks that were specifically intended to be done by humans because AI couldn’t. We’ve closed the loop on this one; great job everybody!</p>
<p>Amazon’s Mechanical Turk let users divide simple tasks into any number of small subtasks that take only a few seconds to do, and which pay pennies — but dedicated piecemeal workers would perform thousands and thereby earn a modest but reliable wage. It was, as Jeff Bezos memorably put it back then, “artificial artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>These were usually tasks that were then difficult to automate — like a CAPTCHA, or identifying the sentiment of a sentence, or a simple “draw a circle around the cat in this image,” things that people could do quickly and reliably. It was used liberally by people labeling relatively complex data and researchers aiming to get human evaluations or decisions at scale.</p>
<p>It’s named after the famous chess-playing “automaton” that actually used a human hiding in its base to make its plays — <a href="https://www.eapoe.org/works/essays/maelzel.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poe wrote a great contemporary takedown of it</a>. Sometimes automation is difficult or impossible, but in such cases you can make a sort of machine out of humanity. One has to be careful about it, but it has proven useful over the years.</p>
<p>But a study from researchers at EPFL in Switzerland shows that Mechanical Turk workers are automating their work using large language models like ChatGPT: A snake biting its own tail or perhaps swallowing itself entirely.</p>
<p>The question emerged when they considered using a service like MTurk as a “human in the loop” to improve or fact-check LLM responses, which are basically untrustable:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is tempting to rely on crowdsourcing to validate LLM outputs or to create human gold-standard data for comparison. But what if crowd workers themselves are using LLMs, e.g., in order to increase their productivity, and thus their income, on crowdsourcing platforms?</p></blockquote>
<p>To get a general sense of the problem, they assigned an “abstract summarization” task to be completed by turkers. By various analyses described <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the paper (still not published or peer-reviewed)</a> they “estimate that 33%-46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task.”</p>
<p>To some, this will come as no surprise. Some level of automation has likely existed in turking ever since the platform started. Speed and reliability are incentivized, and if you could write a script that handled certain requests with 90% accuracy, you stood to make a fair amount of money. With so little oversight of individual contributors’ processes, it was inevitable that some of these tasks would not actually be performed by humans, as advertised. Integrity has never been Amazon’s strong suit so there was no sense relying on them.</p>
<p>But to see it laid out like this, and for a task that until recently seemed like one only a human could do — adequately summarize a paper’s abstract — it questions not just the value of Mechanical Turk but exposes another front in the imminent crisis of “AI training on AI-generated data” in yet another Ouroboros-esque predicament.</p>
<p>The researchers (Veniamin Veselovsky, Manoel Horta Ribeiro and Robert West) caution that this task is, as of the advent of modern LLMs, one particularly suited to surreptitious automation, and thus particularly likely to fall victim to these methods. But the state of the art is steadily advancing:</p>
<blockquote><p>LLMs are becoming more popular by the day, and multimodal models, supporting not only text, but also image and video input and output, are on the rise. With this, our results should be considered the ‘canary in the coal mine’ that should remind platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human.</p></blockquote>
<p>The threat of AI eating itself has been theorized for many years and became a reality almost instantly upon widespread deployment of LLMs: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/ai-is-eating-itself-bings-ai-quotes-covid-disinfo-sourced-from-chatgpt/">Bing’s pet ChatGPT quoted its own misinformation</a> as support for new misinformation about a COVID conspiracy.</p>
<p>If you can’t be 100% sure something was done by a human, you’re probably better off assuming it wasn’t. That’s a depressing principle to have to adhere to, but here we are.</p>

<p>Every person on the planet should have their own website, on their own domain name, and blog about whatever they want. </p>



<p>I’ve had my own website since I was 13. I will not tell you the domain name because it contained some cringe ass shit that’s still visible on archive.org. But that’s not the point, at least I was playing around, unrestricted. I registered a domain name with shared hosting.</p>



<p>Everyone should be writing in public. It may be about work, family, a lifelong obsession with a certain subject, random observations, photo albums, music you produced, your favorite quotes, etc. </p>



<p>It will be safely kept in archive.org for your ancestors to investigate and ponder on.</p>



<p>And they will. Even if most of your future offspring are normies, at some point, it’s nearly guaranteed that someone will discover your old blog and share it with the family.</p>



<p>“Hey, I have a crazy story. I found this website today. There used to be this person who did this and that. And he’s our grand-grand-grand-father!”</p>







<p>Now imagine if you had access to interesting details about your great-grandmother’s sister, or brother, or whatever. Wouldn’t you want to, at least for once, look into, and share the highlights with your family? </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://projecteink.com/pages/about">https://projecteink.com/pages/about</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36629085">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><div id="shopify-section-template--17287663419706__main">
      <h3>A&nbsp;$2500 e ink art&nbsp;piece that displays daily newspapers on your wall.</h3>
<p>I'm a&nbsp;news junkie, and the power and allure of a newspaper's front page have always fascinated me. So, when I stumbled upon <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">an article</a> written by a Google engineer who had built an e ink device with the front page of his favorite daily newspaper prominently displayed on his wall, I was jealous. So I built one as well, using off-the-shelf hardware. The project became a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25063726">small hit on Hackernews</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0665/5754/2714/files/Project_E-Ink-_Presskit-13_600x600.jpg?v=1675346217"></p>
<p>Since then my mailbox gets bombarded with people that want one as well. And now you can :). We're calling it: Project E Ink. A huge e ink screen, for on your wall, that allows you to&nbsp;read the front page of your favorite newspaper every day. It's beautiful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As more and more connected devices arrive in our homes, it is a good time to remember the principles of <a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</a>, first formulated at Xerox PARC in 1995. They talk about how technology should respect our attention and remain in the background most of the time, how relevant information should be presented calmly and make use of the periphery", <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">writes Max Braun</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>E ink is the perfect technology for wall art</h2>
<p>E ink screens, with no backlight and a slow refresh rate, induce a sense of calm. In addition, due to their low power consumption, the batteries on e-ink screens can easily last for weeks or even months.</p>
<p>This is why e ink screens are uniquely suited for displaying wall art. The screen allows for the display of dynamic content, making it possible to display ever-changing front pages. The absence of a backlight makes it less distracting than an LCD screen.</p>
<h2>Finding the right hardware ✔</h2>
<p>In my search for vendors of e ink devices, I came across the Slovenian company <a href="https://www.visionect.com/">Visionect</a>, which sells e ink screens for corporate use. Known for their <a href="https://getjoan.com/">Joan</a> office screens that display the availability of a meeting room, they also sell <a href="https://www.visionect.com/product/place-and-play-32/">larger screens</a> for use in, for example, airports (to display flight times) and hotels (to provide conference room overviews).</p>
<p>It turns out that the dimensions of the screen they sell for corporate use are identical to those of an unfolded newspaper front page. The Place &amp; Play 32-inch screen is pricey (2300 euros ex VAT), but an exquisite piece of hardware. It is made of stainless steel with sharp edges and a glass panel on top. The USB ports are discretely concealed, and the device feels sturdy.</p>
<p>The device is equipped with Wi-Fi and a cloud-based content management system that allows you to load a webpage, for example <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/05/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf">the PDF of the New York Times frontpage</a>, making it easy to display. The CMS also allows you to configure the screen refresh rate (in my case, once daily was sufficient).</p>
<p>The screen has a convenient VESA mount on the back, making it super easy to hang on the wall with a standard TV mount and allowing it to blend seamlessly with existing décor.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2>
<span>Satisfied news junkie&nbsp;</span>✔</h2>
<p>The device has no buttons or touchscreen; it only displays the front page of newspapers. That is sufficient to understand what is happening in the world. And if I also want to continue reading an article that piqued my interest, I use the dedicated news app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every morning, I wake up to a fresh newspaper edition on my wall. I find it wonderful to hover with a cup of coffee, scan the headlines, or peruse an article. Mission accomplished, and I am one satisfied news junkie.</p>

In this guide, we show you all the best practices, workflows, and tools to make Jupyter Notebooks play nicely with Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket.</p><h2>Git ↔ Jupyter Challenges</h2><p>Let's briefly list down the challenges of using Git with Jupyter Notebooks -</p><ul role="list"><li>Notebook Git diffs are hard to review</li><li>Resolving notebook merge conflict is painful</li><li>Large notebooks fail to render on GitHub</li><li>Notebook code reviews &amp;&nbsp;collaboration is tough</li></ul><p>In this article, we'll look at each of these problems &amp;&nbsp;suggest optimal solution for each.</p><h2>Using Git with Jupyter</h2><p>First, let's get the basics out of the way. There are 2 main ways to perform Git operations (<em>clone / pull / push</em>) for Jupyter Notebooks -</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/" target="_blank">Use JupyterLab Git extension</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-jupyter-notebook/" target="_blank">Use command line to run Git commands for Notebooks</a></li></ol><p>If you're new to Git, the above articles would give you step-by-step guide to version control notebooks on GitHub. If you're an experienced Git user, just note that the basic Git commands remain the same regardless of notebook's <sup>.ipynb</sup> file type.</p><h2>Git Diffs for Jupyter Notebooks</h2><p>We use Git diff to see the difference between two versions of the same file. This could be:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Local Notebook Diff:</strong> To review the changes you’ve made on your local machine before committing your work and sharing it with others.</li><li><strong>Commit &amp; PR Diff:</strong> To review the changes already pushed upstream in the context of a pull request or commit</li></ol><h3>1. Local Notebook Diff</h3><p>You can use the <sup>git diff</sup> command to view the difference between the current state of the file you are working on and the most recently checked-in version of the same file. You might use Git diffs to review the changes before committing or to compare different versions of notebook.</p><p>A general Git diff will show you textual diff for all changed files:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c38344833c0b5d9297b77_git_diff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Terminal Git diff Output</figcaption></figure><p>Some issues with <sup>git diff</sup> output for Jupyter Notebooks:</p><ul role="list"><li>Notebooks are JSON under the hood, <sup>git diff</sup> shows raw JSON changes without any markdown or output rendering, code syntax highlighting etc.</li><li>Rich output (images, plots, widgets) raw diffs are impossible to review e.g. see the encoded <sup>image/png</sup> data in the above diff.</li><li>Notebook diffs have a lot of noise due to unintended metadata changes which you might not care about (e.g. <sup>execution_count</sup>).</li></ul><h3>Solution → nbdime</h3><p>You always want to review local notebook diffs <strong>before</strong> pushing the changes. But as we saw above, it's quite painful to review notebook diffs with plain <sup>git diff</sup> on command line.</p><p>One tool that solves this is <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">nbdime</a>. It's a dedicated diff &amp; merge library for Jupyter Notebooks. You can <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html" target="_blank">install nbdime</a> and review your local notebook changes in a rich rendered diff format as shown below -</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c4642afe9f6a54ef88a28_nbdime_gitdiff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook diff via nbdime</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution → JupyterLab Git Extension</h3><p>Another option is to use <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/" target="_blank">JupyterLab Git extension</a> to review local notebook diffs. This extension uses the nbdime library underneath. But the key advantage is the ability to review local notebook diffs directly in the JupyterLab UI with a click of a button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c4d3a4c0f10df3fb58171_jupyterlab-git-commit.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook diff via JupyterLab Git extension</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Commits &amp; PR Diff</h3><p>nbdime is great for reviewing local changes but once you push the changes to a remote repository, your colleagues might want to review your notebook changes &amp; provide feedback. </p><p>This is where <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-03-01-feature-preview-rich-jupyter-notebook-diffs/" target="_blank">rich notebook diffs on GitHub</a> are super helpful. Your teammates can simply go to GitHub &amp;&nbsp;open the commit or pull request page to review the notebook changes. While useful, the rich notebook diffs on GitHub has some limitations -</p><ul role="list"><li>One <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/how-to-add-comments-to-notebook-diffs-github/#problem" target="_blank">can't write comments</a> on rich notebook diffs. So your teammates can't give feedback on your notebook changes.</li><li>GitHub rich diffs <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/large-notebook-diff-not-rendering/" target="_blank">fail on large notebooks</a>, even if the actual differences you are reviewing are small. So if your notebooks are large, the GitHub diffs won’t be of much use.</li><li>GitHub <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-not-rendering-interactive-notebook-widgets/" target="_blank">doesn’t display interactive widgets or plots</a>. So if your notebook includes interactive visualizations from Plotly or Bokeh, or an ipywidget, it won’t render on GitHub.</li></ul><h3>Solution → ReviewNB</h3><p>We saw limitations of GitHub's notebook rich diff support above. One way to solve it is to use <a href="https://www.reviewnb.com/" target="_blank" data-gatrack="Article,Click,ReviewNB-Link">ReviewNB</a>. It's a dedicated app for Jupyter Notebooks code reviews. It helps you review notebook pull requests on GitHub &amp; Bitbucket. </p><p>You can see rich diffs and write comments on any notebook cell as shown below. Unlike GitHub, ReviewNB offers in-line commenting on rich diffs, works with large notebooks, and renders interactive plots &amp;&nbsp;widgets.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/61fcd6a09c061c32de8cbb25_new_visual_diff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook code reviews on ReviewNB</figcaption></figure><h2>Handling Notebook Merge Conflicts</h2><p>A common Git workflow is:</p><ul role="list"><li>Create a new branch, usually from <sup>main</sup>,</li><li>Work in the branch.</li><li>When your work is ready (usually after a pull request reviewed by your colleagues), merge the new branch back into the <sup>main</sup> branch</li></ul><p>Sometimes during this process, you may encounter a merge conflict. Merge conflicts usually happen when the branch you are trying to merge back into has changed, causing a conflict that Git needs your input to resolve.</p><p>For Jupyter notebooks, merge conflicts can be caused by code changes, but they can also be caused by notebook metadata. Metadata conflicts can be particularly difficult to visualize and fix. You might first notice a merge conflict on a pull request page:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c65be20fce185e4e3d2b5_merge_conflict.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on GitHub PR page</figcaption></figure><p>Or on the command line following a merge attempt:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c66a3d2a19d7345839d25_merge_conflict_terminal.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on terminal</figcaption></figure><p>If you start Jupyter and try to open a notebook in this state, you’ll get an error message saying that the notebook is unreadable. It's because the Git conflict markers make the notebook JSON invalid.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c66efddf071ba70832e6e_error_message.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Solution → Text Editor</h3><p>Small notebook git merge conflicts can be resolved without any extra tooling, using either the GitHub UI or any text editor of your choice.</p><ul start="" role="list"><li>Use the git status command to check which files have merge conflicts. </li><li>Open the notebook in a text editor like Notepad, and you’ll see why Jupyter can’t read it: The notebook is no longer in standard JSON format because of the merge-conflict text.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6b1e47a6171c9438eac2_conflict_short.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on a text editor</figcaption></figure><ul start="" role="list"><li>To find the conflicts, search for the conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</li><li>Manually edit the JSON&nbsp;text to fix the conflict—you can choose the original version, the new version, or change the text to be some combination of both.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6dbc6fa313cc83cef490_text_editor_conflict_resolved.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict resolved</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Remove the conflict markers when you have fixed the conflicting contents.</li><li>Mark the conflict as resolved by committing the notebook</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6ce17cc69a36bfde3d5d_mark_conflict_resolution.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Mark conflict resolution</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution → nbdime / nbdev / JupyterLab Git Extension</h3><p>Small (1-2 line) conflicts can be resolved easily on a text editor but large conflicts are difficult. The biggest challenge is ensuring that the end state is a valid notebook JSON. Miss a comma or a double quote or a closing brace, and suddenly your notebook is not valid anymore.</p><p>If your merge conflict is more than a line or two, you would do better to use a tool like <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#merging" target="_blank">nbdime</a>, <a href="https://nbdev1.fast.ai/merge.html" target="_blank">nbdev</a>, or the JupyterLab Git extension. Here's a step-by-step guide on resolving merge conflicts using the JupyterLab Git extension -</p><ul role="list"><li>When we try to merge conflicting git branches in the JupyterLab Git extension, merge fails midway &amp;&nbsp;the offending notebook appear in the “Conflicted” section of the left-hand Git panel (e.g. see <sup>NASA_Sea_level.ipynb</sup> in the screenshot below).</li><li>Double-click on the notebook to view the conflict. You will see the three versions: <sup>Current</sup>, <sup>Incoming</sup> &amp; the <sup>Common Ancestor</sup> -</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648e93f7fa7bd074605539f8_jupyterlab-git-conflict-compare.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict resolution in JupyterLab Git Extension</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Change the bottom cell to manually resolve the conflict. Either choose one of the three versions above or some combination thereof. </li><li>Click on “Mark as resolved”. You will see the notebook file move from the “Conflicted” section to the “Staged” section. It’s ready to commit. Use the bottom commit box to create &amp; push the commit, and you’re done!</li></ul><h2>Large Notebook Rendering on GitHub</h2><p>GitHub correctly renders small Jupyter Notebook files &amp; diffs. Unfortunately, GitHub fails to render large notebooks showing errors like <strong>“Unable to render rich display”</strong> or <strong>“The notebook took too long to render”</strong>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/6491445bd9536cfdac20751c_too-big-to-render.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>GitHub fails to render large Notebooks &amp; Diffs</figcaption></figure><h3>Why notebook rendering fails on GitHub?</h3><p>There are 2 reasons for this -</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>GitHub rich diff functionality uses <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">nbdime</a> under the hood. And nbdime diffs can be very slow for large notebooks (as mentioned by others <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/issues/358">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/issues/540">here</a>).</li><li>For performance reasons, GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/issues/27#:~:text=GitHub%27s%20rich%20diff%20generator%20takes%20close%20to%205%20seconds%2C%20which%20is%20their%20internal%20timeout%20per%20discussions%20with%20GitHub%20Support" target="_blank">imposes a 5-second limitation</a> on rich diff rendering. So in cases where nbdime can’t render a diff in 5 seconds, GitHub won’t render it at all.</li></ol><p>This tells us why notebook diff rendering fails on GitHub. We assume similar reasons exist for the failure of rendering standalone notebooks. Bottom line is, at GitHub's scale, they don't want to wait tens of seconds for files to render on their platform. </p><h3>Solution → NBviewer</h3><p><a href="https://nbviewer.org/" target="_blank">NBviewer</a> is an online service provided by the Jupyter project that offers a free tool for rendering static Jupyter Notebooks from URLs. It allows you to explore the structure of a GitHub repository and select specific notebooks for viewing.</p><p>NBviewer requires your notebooks to be publicly accessible. If you're operating within a private GitHub repository, NBviewer cannot be used.</p><h3>Solution → Binder</h3><p><a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">Binder</a> is another Jupyter subproject that offers a free service enabling the sharing of executable notebooks on an online platform. To utilize Binder, simply provide the path to your repository, and it will generate a JupyterLab instance for you.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/64914cb78b5eab49d89d9668_binder.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Opening Jupyter Notebook on Binder</figcaption></figure><p>Binder is particularly advantageous when your notebook includes interactive elements like plots or widgets. GitHub's notebook viewer disables such interactivity for security reasons. Similar to nbviewer mentioned earlier, <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">mybinder.org</a> is also limited to public repositories exclusively. If you wish to access notebooks from private repositories, you will need to <a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/setup-binderhub.html" target="_blank">deploy your own BinderHub</a>.</p><h3>Solution → ReviewNB </h3><p><a href="https://www.reviewnb.com/" target="_blank" data-gatrack="Article,Click,ReviewNB-Link">ReviewNB</a> is a SaaS for Jupyter Notebook code reviews &amp;&nbsp;collaboration on GitHub &amp; Bitbucket. ReviewNB can render large notebook files that GitHub won't render natively. Below we see the ~30mb notebook that GitHub couldn’t render natively, rendering fine in ReviewNB —</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/64919b6cd366a419f0f4cebf_nbreview.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>ReviewNB can be used with both public and private repositories.

<p><span><span><span><strong>Today, <em>noyb </em>filed a complaint against TeleSign, a US company which profiled millions of phone users. TeleSign generates a “reputation score” and sells its services to various clients like TikTok, Microsoft or Salesforce. TeleSign secretly received the mobile phone data from BICS, a Belgian company that provides interconnection services for many mobile phone companies.</strong></span></span></span></p>

</ul><p><span><span><span><strong>BICS – the company connecting phone providers globally. </strong>BICS is a world leading communications service, that allows phone calls, roaming and data flows between different communications networks and services in different corners of the world. Instead of having direct agreements with each other, hundreds of mobile phone providers can connect their networks via BICS’ interconnection service. When processing phone customer data, BICS gets detailed information (e.g. the regularity of completed calls, call duration, long-term inactivity, range activity, or successful incoming traffic) about half of the worldwide mobile phone users.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>TeleSign generates “reputation scores” from BICS data. </strong>In March 2022, the <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/431389/article/2022-03-22/les-transferts-de-donnees-boiteux-de-proximus-sa-filiale-americaine-telesign">Belgian newspaper “Le Soir” first revealed</a> that the US company TeleSign was getting this data from BICS and was profiling millions of phone users across the globe. TeleSign gave every mobile phone user a “trust score” between 0 and 300 points. Based on this score, TeleSign’s clients (e.g. TikTok, Salesforce and Microsoft) could then decide to allow users to sign up to a platform or for example require an SMS verification first. TeleSign verifies over five billion unique phone numbers per month, representing half of the world’s mobile users.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Max Schrems: “<em>Your phone provider likely forwards data to BICS who then forwards it to TeleSign. TeleSign generates a ‘trust score’ about you and sells phone data to third parties like Microsoft, Salesforce or TikTok&nbsp; – without anyone being informed or giving consent.</em>”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>User copy shows extent of TeleSign surveillance.</strong> Curious to know what was done with their data, several mobile users used their right under the GDPR to get a copy of their data from TeleSign, BICS and their national mobile provider. The answers were quite surprising: none of the mobile operator listed TeleSign as a recipient or knew that user data was sent to TeleSign. At the same time, TeleSign confirmed that it had the phone number and communicated the “trust score” assigned to their number, such as “medium-low”:</span></span></span></p>

    <div>
          
                    <p><span><span><span><strong>AI to score people &amp; data transfers to the US.</strong> On its website TeleSign claims it is using artificial intelligence models to analyse the enormous amount of data received from BICS and to generate a “trust score” on each phone number<em>.</em> All of this happens in the United States, where US authorities also can access personal data from TeleSign.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Processing unlawful, potentially huge fine. </strong>While there are some situations where personal data can be used for security purposes without consent, the secret use of telecommunication data on the majority of all global mobile phone users is not in line with EU and national data protection law. Besides being ordered to stop the transfer of data to TeleSign,<strong> </strong>the Belgian DPA can issue a fine up to € 236 million, which is 4 % of the global turnover of the Proximus group, the owner of BICS and TeleSign.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Max Schrems: “<em>The responses received by BICS and TeleSign suggest that this business model is not complying with EU privacy laws. We have therefore filed a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority, who is competent for Proximus,&nbsp; BICS and TeleSign.</em>”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Is your number processed by TeleSign? Easy to find out!</strong> Companies holding data about you have the obligation under the GDPR to tell you whether they process information about you, but also where they received the data, for which purpose they use it, and with whom they shared it. If you want to know whether TeleSign has data on you, and assigned you a score like the complainants, <em>noyb </em>developed a <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/Access%20request%20Telesign.docx" title="Access%20request%20for%20PR.docx">template</a> that you can use to send an access request to TeleSign. </span></span></span></p>
