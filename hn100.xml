But the story starts much earlier, back in 2018.</span></p><p><span>At this time, I was working in Switzerland, refactoring a C++ legacy codebase. Together with my colleague and friend </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dchambon/" rel="">Damien Chambon</a><span>, we started evaluating Scala and </span><a href="https://akka.io/" rel="">Akka</a><span> (an actor model framework) for a potential rewrite. Why Scala and Akka, you may wonder? Well, back then I had mostly Java/JVM experience, and I was intrigued by the promises of the actor model.</span></p><p>But things were… definitely not simple. First off, it was a whole new language to learn. Second, Akka is a beast. It takes time to ramp up, and we even had to hire an external consultant to help with the implementation. After months of work, we finally had our first PoC. And yet, neither my colleague nor I were really convinced.</p><p>So, we started looking at another language to counterbalance Scala. Maybe this new one wasn’t the sexiest language ever invented, but it looks promising, efficient, and much easier to ramp up with: Go.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png" width="249" height="93.10434782608695" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:129,&quot;width&quot;:345,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:249,&quot;bytes&quot;:7350,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Go logo.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Go logo." title="Go logo." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fd8a4ef-b1e0-4c68-a525-5d6b874dc670_345x129.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>After just a couple of weeks in Go, we were able to cover the same scope as our Scala/Akka PoC. And for me, </span><strong>that was the beginning of a love story with the Go programming language</strong><span>.</span></p><p>A few months passed, and I moved to another company and another country: the UK. I was back working in a Java ecosystem since my Go experience was still too limited to land a proper job. Plus, given the international move, the company itself mattered more to me than the tech stack.</p><p>That experience turned out to be horrendous. It was full of politics, and I hated every aspect of my job. But in the evenings, I kept working on personal projects in Go. After just three months, I decided to stop the bleeding and move on to another company.</p><p>This time, I was determined to get a Go job. It was May 2019. I signed to a new company, and finally, I could develop in Go all day long.</p><p>After four months in this new company, I noticed that some of my colleagues were making the same mistakes I made when I was working in Switzerland.</p><p><span>So, I decided to write a blog post listing common mistakes in Go called </span><em><a href="https://itnext.io/the-top-10-most-common-mistakes-ive-seen-in-go-projects-4b79d4f6cd65" rel="">The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects</a></em><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png" width="598" height="168.43666666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:338,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:598,&quot;bytes&quot;:65049,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot of the blog post titled “The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects” by Teiva Harsanyi, published on Medium.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Screenshot of the blog post titled “The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects” by Teiva Harsanyi, published on Medium." title="Screenshot of the blog post titled “The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects” by Teiva Harsanyi, published on Medium." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a5d38a-8a8d-45d6-8b98-bbd93bfa6afc_1200x338.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Let’s be honest: the title was way more ambitious than my actual experience.

In this email, I was saying, “</span><em>I’m at 80%</em><span>” because for most of the mistakes, I already had some content written:</span></p><ul><li><p>The mistake itself</p></li><li><p>A surrounding example</p></li><li><p>And various solutions to fix the mistake</p></li></ul><p>So, in my head, the hardest part was already done.</p><p><strong>I haven’t been more wrong in my entire life.</strong></p><p>The next day, I got a reply from someone at Manning with the title of acquisition editor. If you’re not familiar with that role, an acquisition editor is someone who evaluates and signs new book projects for publication. Basically, a scout. Throughout my writing journey, he was my main contact at Manning, and as you will see, he helped me at a critical moment later in the process.</p><p>We had a first meeting to briefly discuss my idea, and Manning was on board to move to the next step: filling out a proposal. This proposal was a document with 21 questions to frame the project, including things like:</p><ul><li><p>Speaking about yourself</p></li><li><p>A summary of the book</p></li><li><p>Describing your target reader</p></li><li><p>A table of contents</p></li></ul><p><span>This document was then sent by Manning to external reviewers, all with Go experience, who wrote their own evaluations of the proposal. Funny enough, my mate </span><a href="https://x.com/val_deleplace" rel="">Valentin Deleplace</a><span>, who would become my colleague a few years later, was actually the first reviewer of the book.</span></p><p>As a potential author, I had access to all the reviews. And while it’s obviously essential for a publisher to judge the technical quality of a project, it was also super valuable for me. It helped me see whether the idea only sounded good in my own head or if it could actually be interesting to others, too.</p><p>I received a total of seven reviews, and all of them were positive. Some included constructive feedback on how to improve certain aspects (like the table of contents, for example), but the overall tone was fully supportive.</p><p><span>It was December 7, 2020, roughly two weeks after I sent my first email, and </span><strong>I received an offer from Manning</strong><span>:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png" width="1164" height="405" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;width&quot;:1164,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:289710,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot of the email from Manning offering the author a publishing contract for 100 Go Mistakes, outlining the review and editing process involved.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Screenshot of the email from Manning offering the author a publishing contract for 100 Go Mistakes, outlining the review and editing process involved." title="Screenshot of the email from Manning offering the author a publishing contract for 100 Go Mistakes, outlining the review and editing process involved." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5c4f7f8-39d2-4c7f-89c6-9c2639a32efd_1164x405.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Let’s talk about one of the aspects people ask about the most: my contract.</p><p><strong>In terms of royalties, I got paid 10% on all sales</strong><span>.

If I had written the book completely on my own, I can guarantee the quality would have been way lower.</p></li><li><p>Second, in terms of visibility, going with a publisher helps a lot, especially if, like me back then, you had around 400 followers on Twitter. Sure, content can still go viral without a big audience, but it’s a lot less likely.</p></li></ul><p>When I signed the contract, I also received an advance: $2,000 upfront, and $2,000 after delivering one-third of the book.</p><p>The contract also included deadlines:</p><ul><li><p>One-third of the book will be delivered by February 15, 2021</p></li><li><p>Two-thirds by April 15, 2021</p></li><li><p>A full draft of the complete manuscript by July 2021</p></li></ul><p>As the book was eventually published in August 2022, you can imagine I was slightly late. But when I spoke with people at Manning, they told me most technical books are late. We all know that in tech, we’re not great at planning. So why would it be any different when we start writing books? 🙂</p><p>Jokes aside, at that stage, I didn’t fully realize how much work was ahead of me, so July 2021 seemed doable.</p><p>At the very beginning, Manning asked me to think deeply about what they call the MQR: Minimum Qualified Reader. In a nutshell, what’s the minimum level of knowledge or experience someone needs to read your book?</p><p>That may sound like a basic question, but at that point, I hadn’t even considered it. Over the next few weeks, I refined my MQR to target someone who already knows the Go language. That meant about 15% of my content could go directly into the nearest trash can as it was just too basic.</p><p><span>Around the same time, </span><strong>I met the person who probably had the biggest impact on the book: my development editor (DE)</strong><span>.</span></p><p>A DE helps refine the structure, content, and flow of a manuscript to improve things like clarity, coherence, and how well ideas are conveyed. Note that a DE doesn’t need to be a technical person. Mine had some experience in computer science but absolutely none in Go, and that was perfectly fine. We don’t expect technical reviews from a DE but instead, a valuable contribution to the quality of the writing.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong><span>: </span><em><span>This was the person who taught me the key lessons I shared in </span><a href="https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/10-technical-writing-rules" rel="">10 Rules I Learned About Technical Writing</a></em><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>I learned a ton from my DE. Like, really, a ton. Before that, I had been writing on various blogs for about a decade, but writing online is all about being direct because most people don’t have time. With a book, it’s different. People made a deliberate decision to buy your book. Now, it’s your job to bring them somewhere valuable. And if that takes time (meaning more words), so be it.</p><p><span>For example, here’s how I introduced one mistake in </span><em>The Top 10 Most Common Mistakes I’ve Seen in Go Projects</em><span>

It’s about making sure the flow works well, that readers know where you’re going, and that they can follow you all the way. There’s a huge gap between writing a blog post and writing a book.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong><em>: In my newsletter, I try not to keep that gap too big. I feel like someone who deliberately shared their email is also making a clear statement: “I’m interested in your content”. I don’t take as much time as I do in the book, but I definitely take more than I did in my older blog posts.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is just one example, but my DE helped me massively. I absolutely loved every single bit of his feedback. To be honest, at the beginning of our collaboration, he had a lot of comments. Some things I picked up quickly, but others were much more difficult for me. Yet, over the next months, I will significantly improve my writing.</p><p>I wanted to talk a little bit about my mindset when I started writing the content of my book, chapter after chapter, mistake after mistake.</p><p><span>At this stage, my mindset was simple: </span><strong>I wanted to make the best Go book. Period.</strong></p><p><span>Let me clarify, though, just to make sure I don’t come across as someone full of ego, as there’s an important nuance here. I wasn’t thinking, “</span><em>My book is going to be the best.</em><span>” Instead, I was thinking, “</span><em>I will give everything I have to bring it to a level where it could be considered the best.</em><span>”</span></p><p>I already knew at that point that it would probably be my first and last book. So, if I was going to write one, I might as well give everything I had to make sure that what’s going to sit on my shelf for the rest of my life is something I will be proud of.</p><p><span>Also, having this mindset was a commitment to future readers: you bought my book, I don’t know if you’ll love it, </span><strong>but I promise it’s the best version I could have made</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>1P stands for </span><em>first part</em><span>. Basically, the process that starts once one-third of the book is written and accepted by the DE (which happened for me after a lot of back and forth to be honest).</span></p><p>For each third of the book (1P, 2P, and then 3P), the process is similar: the manuscript is sent to external reviewers who can leave comments directly on your text but also fill out a detailed document with questions like:</p><ul><li><p>Is the writing interesting? Does it hold your attention?</p></li><li><p>Are the examples good and applicable in the real world? Are there enough of them?</p></li><li><p>What do you think of the overall concept of the book and the approach toward the</p><p>intended audience?</p></li></ul><p>This document is very thorough. These reviews are invaluable for an author. While you can be confident that the writing itself is fairly solid thanks to the work you were doing with your DE, from a technical standpoint, this is really the first time your content is being confronted by other technical people.</p><p><span>We got the results for 1P in April 2021. In total, I received 13 reviews, with </span><strong>an average star rating of 4.10 out of 5</strong><span>. Not a fantastic score, but at that point, it was OK. I wasn’t too disappointed.</span></p><p>Of course, some of the feedback you receive as an author can hurt:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png" width="1216" height="208" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:208,&quot;width&quot;:1216,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:39244,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Excerpt of reviewer feedback highlighting a concern that some statements in the manuscript lack sufficient background or justification to confidently earn a 5-star rating.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Excerpt of reviewer feedback highlighting a concern that some statements in the manuscript lack sufficient background or justification to confidently earn a 5-star rating." title="Excerpt of reviewer feedback highlighting a concern that some statements in the manuscript lack sufficient background or justification to confidently earn a 5-star rating." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48813f57-6567-48a6-8fea-16b59cbf999a_1216x208.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But if it hurts, it probably means there’s some truth behind it. You have to accept it and improve your book.</p><p><span>During that period, Manning offered to connect me with another author, </span><a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/instructors/bill-kennedy/" rel="">Bill Kennedy</a><span>, who also wrote a book with them called </span><em><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action" rel="">Go in Action</a></em><span>. Beyond the fact that I have immense respect for him (he’s one of the people who contributes the most to the Go ecosystem), Bill taught me something crucial:</span></p><p>If you get one comment, you must address it, even if it doesn’t seem important to you. If one person raised it, imagine when thousands of people read your book.</p><p>That was golden advice. Thanks to Bill, I gave my best to address (almost) every single comment, from changing a single word to fully rewriting how a mistake was explained.</p><p>It’s time to talk about my first hiccup with Manning (there will be two).</p><p>I already explained how crucial my development editor (DE) was in the process. However, I was also supposed to be accompanied by another person: a technical development editor (TDE).</p><p>While external reviewers only come in at each third of the book, the TDE is supposed to work more closely with the author throughout the entire process, helping shape the content, the overall structure, how chapters are divided, and so on.</p><p>This isn’t a personal criticism, but my TDE simply wasn’t an MQR. This means he didn’t have the basic Go knowledge expected from someone reading the book. Of course, I wasn’t expecting the world’s top Go expert as a TDE, but I did expect someone who at least matched the Minimum Qualified Reader profile, a concept introduced by Manning themselves. That felt like the bare minimum.</p><p>I raised this issue with Manning after 1P, but unfortunately, they didn’t really listen and kept the same TDE on the project. I was a bit annoyed, to be honest, but I had to move on.</p><p>Until 1P, the book is in a kind of trial phase, meaning that either Manning or the author can still decide to stop the collaboration. Apparently, a certain percentage of books fail at 1P when Manning realizes that external reviewers aren’t convinced by how the initial idea is being executed.</p><p><span>After 1P, Manning launches their </span><em>Manning Early Access Program</em><span> (MEAP), which allows people to buy the book and access it while it’s still being written. For the author, it becomes an additional source of feedback, as readers can leave comments on an online platform.</span></p><p><span>When we say people can start buying your book, </span><strong>it also means a shift for Manning: it’s time to sell it.</strong></p><p>That brings a few new responsibilities, like keeping the content regularly updated for those who already paid, writing a welcome letter for MEAP readers, and starting to work with the marketing team on how to promote the book and raise awareness about it.</p><p>On that last point, Manning asked me several times during this period to promote the book at public events (meetups, conferences, etc.), but I always declined. Writing was already taking up so much time and energy that I didn’t feel like adding one more thing to my plate by preparing talks.</p><p><span>The only “promotion” I did during that time was joining a podcast since it required less preparation.

So I went from 4.10 to 4.15, and honestly, at that point, I was starting to feel a bit disappointed.</span></p><p><span>I’m a regular user of </span><a href="https://goodreads.com/" rel="">Goodreads</a><span>. On that platform, books are also rated out of 5 stars; in my mind, a “great” book starts at 4.5 and up. Why 4.5? No idea. But that was definitely my goal.</span></p><p><span>4.15 isn’t bad, but it’s still far from 4.5. So yes, I was disappointed but not dejected. Once again, I went through all the reviews, and </span><strong>I just kept improving the book over and over</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>To give you a sense of what I mean by improving the book “</span><em>over and over</em><span>“, keep in mind that between feedback from my DE, external reviewers, and others, there are parts of the book that I rewrote more than ten times. I don’t know if that’s common, to be honest. Maybe it’s because I was terrible at the beginning. Maybe it’s because I’m literally obsessed with details. Or maybe it’s both.</span></p><p><span>From 2P to 3P is almost a blackout for me. This time, the period lasted five months, during which </span><strong>I wrote the last third of the book and completely rewrote the first few chapters</strong><span>. Indeed, once I reached the end of the book, I reread the first part and thought: </span><em>“This is awful; I can’t publish that.”</em></p><p>That’s more proof that going through the long, demanding process of writing a book really did improve my writing skills. Some parts that felt fine in the beginning ended up being terrible once I had more experience.</p><p>From those five months, I only clearly remember one week of "holiday" that I spent working on my book. And by week, I don’t mean a peaceful 40-hour work week. I mean waking up at 3 p.m., working 14 to 15 hours straight, and going to bed around 8 a.m.</p><p><span>Funny enough, I didn’t hate that week. In my mind, it was </span><em>my</em><span> author week. If I had crossed a stranger on the street and they had asked what I did for a living, I would’ve proudly said: “</span><em>I’m an author!</em><span>”</span></p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t speak to anyone that week. Except my janitor.</p><p>But during that week, I made a lot of progress. I managed to write the first draft of the last chapter. I’m sharing this to give you an idea of the pace. The book had 12 chapters, and the one that went the fastest still took me about 100 hours to write. You can imagine how long the rest took. And that’s not even counting the endless rewrites after all the feedback from my DE and the reviewers.</p><p><span>During that period, I also worked on my inside cover. I’m a big fan of </span><em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em><span> by </span></p><p><span>. His book is full of beautiful visual maps like this one:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

If you want a simple anecdote to understand Tim’s importance was for this book: during 3P, I received feedback from 15 reviewers. Yet I think Tim’s single review was possibly as valuable as all the others combined. The guy is an absolute rockstar; my book wouldn’t have been the same without him. Thanks again, Tim. 🙇‍♂️</span></p><p>One more month of work to take all the reviews into account, and…</p><p>We’re at the end of February 2022, and the book officially moves from the development stage to production. At this stage, only a few steps remain, and they are mostly handled by the publisher:</p><ul><li><p>Copyediting to refine grammar, style, and consistency</p></li><li><p>Proofreading to catch spelling, punctuation, and formatting errors</p></li><li><p>Typesetting to arrange the text, code, and images for publication</p></li><li><p>Indexing to compile a list of key terms and topics with page references</p></li></ul><p>One thing to note: from an author’s standpoint, the book is more or less complete at this stage. You can still add minor things, but the publisher wants to lock in a first version. That’s because adding even a single new paragraph means going through the process again for that section. That’s why publishers insist on fixing the version.</p><p>Reaching that point is a big milestone. To express what I felt at the time, there’s a great quote by Gene Fowler:</p><p>A book is never finished; it's abandoned.</p><p><span>Real question: how can you say a book is finished? For example, I could have improved a figure here, tweaked an example there, rephrased a sentence, or refined a conclusion. But that loop could have lasted forever. At some point, you just have to consider this version final, move to the next stage, and, in a way, </span><strong>abandon your book</strong><span>.</span></p><p>It’s a tough feeling, but that’s how it goes.</p><p><span>That being said, finishing a book calls for a celebration. I remember having a drink one evening with my girlfriend, and we toasted to “</span><em>the end of the book.</em><span>” 🥂</span></p><p>Once again, I was way too naive.</p><p>It’s now time to talk about my second hiccup with Manning, but this time, it was way more serious.</p><p>We started the copyediting process, which is meant to refine grammar, style, and consistency. I don’t know about you, but I imagined the author’s involvement at this stage would be pretty lightweight, right? Absolutely not. At least, not for my book.</p><p><strong>First, the review process was an exercise in frustration and inefficiency.</strong></p><p><span>During the development phase, I wrote everything in </span><a href="https://asciidoc.org/" rel="">AsciiDoc</a><span>, generated content, and got feedback either as PDF comments from the DE or through the Manning website from reviewers.</span></p><p>But copyediting was different. The copyeditor was directly editing my content and leaving questions in the source itself.</p><p>To clarify, my content was stored in a Git repository. Instead of going through a classic pull request (PR) workflow, the copyeditor was directly modifying the source files and adding comments on top of that.</p><p>For example, here is my original sentence:</p><pre><code>Throughout this section we also used an example with errors because ...</code></pre><p>And here’s what it looked like after her changes:</p><pre><code>// AQ: please clarify leading to this error. Which error?
In this section, we used an example with errors because ...</code></pre><p>So she was:</p><ul><li><p>Modifying the content directly</p></li><li><p>Adding comments in the source code itself (🤯)</p></li></ul><p>I tried to explain how review workflows work in a PR-based setup, and gave concrete suggestions for how we could improve the process. But they didn’t want to try it. That might sound like a small thing, but at that stage, all I wanted was a smooth and efficient collaboration process. The easier it was for me to track changes, the better.</p><p>But if that were the only problem, it would have been fine. Unfortunately, it was way more than that.</p><p><span>To put it simply, </span><strong>my experience with the copyeditor was catastrophic</strong><span>. She completely wrecked the content and introduced countless typos and mistakes.</span></p><p>For example, many of the issues came from her confusing the programming language Go with the verb to go. That led to many sentences that made absolutely no sense anymore.</p><p>Let me be clear: it’s totally fine if a copyeditor introduces a few mistakes. It’s supposed to be a collaborative process: they adapt the content, we go back and forth, and we improve it together.</p><p>But in this case, the number of mistakes was absurd. In just one chapter, she introduced 23 errors. I don’t mean things that could be improved; I mean factual errors. Now multiply that by 12 chapters.</p><p><span>And it wasn’t just about errors. When I asked questions like, “</span><em>Why did you remove this sentence? I think it’s an important transition, and we should keep it</em><span>”, she would sometimes just delete my comment. Such a great collaboration, right?</span></p><p>Eventually, when I raised more and more concerns, what was her response?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png" width="725.1500244140625" height="194.36206251787036" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:249,&quot;width&quot;:929,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:725.1500244140625,&quot;bytes&quot;:487151,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot of an email from the copyeditor stating \&quot;Chapters 1–5 are ready for indexing,\&quot; sent without the author's approval after major issues were raised.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Screenshot of an email from the copyeditor stating &quot;Chapters 1–5 are ready for indexing,&quot; sent without the author's approval after major issues were raised." title="Screenshot of an email from the copyeditor stating &quot;Chapters 1–5 are ready for indexing,&quot; sent without the author's approval after major issues were raised." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb8075a8-e04a-4965-9cdb-60adbf7e783b_929x249.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>She basically said chapters 1 to 5 were ready to move to the next phase without even letting me fix the mistakes she introduced.</p><p>Let me try to put you in my shoes so you understand how I felt.</p><p><span>You’ve spent 15 months writing your book. You’ve done countless iterations to carefully improve every single one of the 100 mistakes. You’ve spent more hours than you can count. You’ve carefully processed hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of feedback. You even took dedicated holidays just to make progress on it. And then, all of a sudden, someone jumps into your book, completely butchers it, and says, “</span><em>These chapters are ready!</em><span>”</span></p><p><strong>How would you feel?</strong></p><p>Well, that’s exactly how I felt. And to be honest, it was too much for me. I wrote an escalation email (which I won’t share here as it was way too salty) explaining that until this was resolved (meaning she had to leave), I would stop working on my own book.</p><p>To be fair to Manning, the situation was handled fairly quickly. Especially by one person: my acquisition editor (the scout). I really think that he saved the book. Because at that point, I swear that I was ready to give up everything.</p><p>In March 2022, the copyeditor stopped working on my book (she was external to Manning), and I was assigned someone new. That change was a huge relief.</p><p>Unfortunately, it meant going through everything again. I had to fix myself every single error she had introduced in the first five chapters, which delayed the book and cost me way more time and energy than I had anticipated.</p><p>Finally, at the end of July 2022, after six months of work after I thought the book was "finished", we reached the end. And this time, for real.</p><p><span>Did I try to celebrate again with my girlfriend? Yes. What did she reply? “</span><em>I can’t trust you anymore with your book.</em><span>”</span></p><p>A few months later, I received a box in the mail. I opened it, and inside were copies of my own book, sent by Manning. As you can imagine, I must have felt a mix of pride and extreme happiness, right? Nope.</p><p><span>I just couldn’t feel anything. I remember holding my own book in my hands and thinking, “</span><em>What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just be happy?</em><span>”</span></p><p><span>This feeling isn’t that uncommon and is often referred to as </span><strong>post-publication depression</strong><span>.</span></p><p>It’s incredibly hard to put words to what I was feeling. It was around August 2022 and I had started working on the content back in July 2019. That’s almost three years of work. It had been such an intense period, and suddenly it was over.</p><p><span>It wasn’t really sadness. </span><strong>Just… emptiness, I would say.</strong></p><p>Over the following months, I slowly started to recover and eventually became very positive about the whole experience. But that moment really changed the way I look at other people’s work.</p><p>When we evaluate something, a coding project, a book, or an illustration, we often forget how much time, energy, and emotion someone may have poured into it. We have no idea what that work cost them.</p><p>So, the book is released, and everyone can buy it.

People who can’t or just don’t want to buy the book can still visit </span><a href="https://100go.co/" rel="">100go.co</a><span> and access a significant part of the content for free. The traffic ended up being quite strong for such a specialized website: 150k views in 2024.</span></p><p><span>I discussed </span><a href="https://100go.co/" rel="">100go.co</a><span> with Manning, and they said it was a “</span><em>brilliant idea</em><span>”. They even offered me a paid role to help other authors promote their content.</span></p><p>In all honesty, I think they overestimate my sales skills. I haven’t done a lot in that area. For example, last year, I gave a talk at a public conference, and I didn’t even mention that I had written a book. Not because I hate promotion. Well, I do, but that wasn’t the main reason. The real reason was that mentioning my book wouldn’t have improved this talk in any way. So I just didn’t say anything.</p><p>What about Manning’s offer to help other authors? I didn’t take it.</p><p>If it were up to me, people would still have the option to buy my book physically, but the whole content would be available online for free, with no login required.</p><p><span>I’ve considered talking to Manning about that. We will see if they still believe I have “</span><em>brilliant</em><span>” ideas. 😅</span></p><p>At the end of 2022, Manning informed me they had secured licensing deals for four translations. For each of them, I received a fixed payment along with royalties. For example, I earned $4,000 and 6% royalties for the Japanese translation.</p><p><span>As of the end of September 2024, </span><strong>the English version had sold 10,494 copies</strong><span>. I don’t have the sales figures for the translations, but someone at Manning told me that usually, the combined sales of all translated versions may match the English copies sold.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong><span>: My book also started a new Manning </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amanning.com+%22100%22+%22mistakes+and+how+to+avoid+them" rel="">series</a><span> called </span><em>100 … Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</em><span>, with editions in Java, C++, and SQL Server, for instance.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>To this day, </span><strong>I’ve earned around $47,000 from the book</strong><span> (before taxes). If I consider the time spent, using a conservative lower bound of 2,000 hours, that comes out to about $23 per hour.</span></p><p>There are two ways to look at that hourly rate.</p><p>One could say it’s pretty low compared to what a software engineer could earn. I could have invested 2,000 hours into some paid technical work and probably made a lot more.</p><p><span>The other way to approach it is not to care too much about it. Sure, the money I earned isn’t negligible (it paid for quite a few holidays, to be honest), but my main message is this: </span><strong>if you’re a new author, don’t think about writing your book to become rich</strong><span>.</span></p><p>I’m sure there are well-known authors like Robert Martin who can make significant income from pretty much any book they release. But for the rest of us, the “normal” authors, we can’t and shouldn’t aim to get rich, especially from a single book.</p><p>For me, the money I earned from this book was never the goal. I’m happy with it, of course, but that’s not where my main motivation was.</p><p>It was somewhere else.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png" width="1200" height="600.8241758241758" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:729,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:2900993,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A lot of messages saying things like: thank you for your book.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thecoder.cafe/i/160360907?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="A lot of messages saying things like: thank you for your book." title="A lot of messages saying things like: thank you for your book." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F219ae5e9-b5e1-47c2-8b39-70fe14eab405_3204x1604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So, did I reach my secret goal of getting a rating over 4.5?

<h2><a href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP introduces template strings for custom string processing.</p>
<p>Template strings are a generalization of f-strings, using a <code><span>t</span></code> in place of
the <code><span>f</span></code> prefix. Instead of evaluating to <code><span>str</span></code>, t-strings evaluate to a new
type, <code><span>Template</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>template</span><span>:</span> <span>Template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Templates provide developers with access to the string and its interpolated
values <em>before</em> they are combined. This brings native flexible string
processing to the Python language and enables safety checks, web templating,
domain-specific languages, and more.</p>
</section>
<section id="relationship-with-other-peps">
<h2><a href="#relationship-with-other-peps" role="doc-backlink">Relationship With Other PEPs</a></h2>
<p>Python introduced f-strings in Python 3.6 with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/" title="PEP 498 – Literal String Interpolation">PEP 498</a>. The grammar was
then formalized in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/" title="PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings">PEP 701</a> which also lifted some restrictions. This PEP
is based on PEP 701.</p>
<p>At nearly the same time PEP 498 arrived, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0501/" title="PEP 501 – General purpose template literal strings">PEP 501</a> was written to provide
“i-strings” – that is, “interpolation template strings”. The PEP was
deferred pending further experience with f-strings. Work on this PEP was
resumed by a different author in March 2023, introducing “t-strings” as template
literal strings, and built atop PEP 701.</p>
<p>The authors of this PEP consider it to be a generalization and simplification
of the updated work in PEP 501. (That PEP has also recently been updated to
reflect the new ideas in this PEP.)</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation">
<h2><a href="#motivation" role="doc-backlink">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Python f-strings are easy to use and very popular. Over time, however, developers
have encountered limitations that make them
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/utils/#django.utils.html.format_html">unsuitable for certain use cases</a>.
In particular, f-strings provide no way to intercept and transform interpolated
values before they are combined into a final string.</p>
<p>As a result, incautious use of f-strings can lead to security vulnerabilities.
For example, a user executing a SQL query with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>sqlite3</span></code></a>
may be tempted to use an f-string to embed values into their SQL expression,
which could lead to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection attack</a>.
Or, a developer building HTML may include unescaped user input in the string,
leading to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting (XSS)</a>
vulnerability.</p>
<p>More broadly, the inability to transform interpolated values before they are
combined into a final string limits the utility of f-strings in more complex
string processing tasks.</p>
<p>Template strings address these problems by providing
developers with access to the string and its interpolated values.</p>
<p>For example, imagine we want to generate some HTML. Using template strings,
we can define an <code><span>html()</span></code> function that allows us to automatically sanitize
content:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>evil</span> <span>=</span> <span>"&lt;script&gt;alert('evil')&lt;/script&gt;"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;p&gt;</span><span>{evil}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('evil')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Likewise, our hypothetical <code><span>html()</span></code> function can make it easy for developers
to add attributes to HTML elements using a dictionary:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>attributes</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"src"</span><span>:</span> <span>"shrubbery.jpg"</span><span>,</span> <span>"alt"</span><span>:</span> <span>"looks nice"</span><span>}</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;img </span><span>{attributes}</span><span> /&gt;"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'&lt;img src="shrubbery.jpg" alt="looks nice" /&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Neither of these examples is possible with f-strings. By providing a
mechanism to intercept and transform interpolated values, template strings
enable a wide range of string processing use cases.</p>

<h3><a href="#template-string-literals" role="doc-backlink">Template String Literals</a></h3>
<p>This PEP introduces a new string prefix, <code><span>t</span></code>, to define template string literals.
These literals resolve to a new type, <code><span>Template</span></code>, found in the standard library
module <code><span>string.templatelib</span></code>.</p>
<p>The following code creates a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Template string literals support the full syntax of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/" title="PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings">PEP 701</a>. This includes
the ability to nest template strings within interpolations, as well as the ability
to use all valid quote marks (<code><span>'</span></code>, <code><span>"</span></code>, <code><span>'''</span></code>, and <code><span>"""</span></code>). Like other string
prefixes, the <code><span>t</span></code> prefix must immediately precede the quote. Like f-strings,
both lowercase <code><span>t</span></code> and uppercase <code><span>T</span></code> prefixes are supported. Like
f-strings, t-strings may not be combined with <code><span>u</span></code> or the <code><span>b</span></code> prefix.</p>
<p>Additionally, f-strings and t-strings cannot be combined, so the <code><span>ft</span></code>
prefix is invalid. t-strings <em>may</em> be combined with the <code><span>r</span></code> prefix;

<h3><a href="#the-interpolation-type" role="doc-backlink">The <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> Type</a></h3>
<p>The <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type represents an expression inside a template string.

    <span>):</span>
        <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type is shallow immutable. Its attributes
cannot be reassigned.</p>
<p>The <code><span>value</span></code> attribute is the evaluated result of the interpolation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>expression</span></code> attribute is the <em>original text</em> of the interpolation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>expression</span> <span>==</span> <span>"name"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We expect that the <code><span>expression</span></code> attribute will not be used in most template
processing code. It is provided for completeness and for use in debugging and
introspection. See both the <a href="#common-patterns-seen-in-processing-templates">Common Patterns Seen in Processing Templates</a>
section and the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section for more information on how to process
template strings.</p>
<p>The <code><span>conversion</span></code> attribute is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" title="(in Python v3.13)"><span>optional conversion</span></a>
to be used, one of <code><span>r</span></code>, <code><span>s</span></code>, and <code><span>a</span></code>, corresponding to <code><span>repr()</span></code>,
<code><span>str()</span></code>, and <code><span>ascii()</span></code> conversions. As with f-strings, no other conversions
are supported:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name!r}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>conversion</span> <span>==</span> <span>"r"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If no conversion is provided, <code><span>conversion</span></code> is <code><span>None</span></code>.</p>
<p>The <code><span>format_spec</span></code> attribute is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec" title="(in Python v3.13)"><span>format specification</span></a>.
As with f-strings, this is an arbitrary string that defines how to present the value:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Value: </span><span>{value:.2f}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Format specifications in f-strings can themselves contain interpolations. This
is permitted in template strings as well; <code><span>format_spec</span></code> is set to the eagerly
evaluated result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>precision</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Value: {value:.</span><span>{precision}</span><span>f}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If no format specification is provided, <code><span>format_spec</span></code> defaults to an empty
string (<code><span>""</span></code>). This matches the <code><span>format_spec</span></code> parameter of Python’s
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>format()</span></code></a> built-in.</p>
<p>Unlike f-strings, it is up to code that processes the template to determine how to
interpret the <code><span>conversion</span></code> and <code><span>format_spec</span></code> attributes.
Such code is not required to use these attributes, but when present they should
be respected, and to the extent possible match the behavior of f-strings.
It would be surprising if, for example, a template string that uses <code><span>{value:.2f}</span></code>
did not round the value to two decimal places when processed.</p>

<section id="template-string-concatenation">
<h3><a href="#template-string-concatenation" role="doc-backlink">Template String Concatenation</a></h3>

</pre></div>
<p>Concatenation of templates is “viral”: the concatenation of a <code><span>Template</span></code> and
a <code><span>str</span></code> always results in a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance.</p>
<p>Python’s implicit concatenation syntax is also supported. The following code
will work as expected:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>t</span><span>"Hello "</span> <span>t</span><span>"World"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span> <span>==</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>,)</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>Template</span></code> type supports the <code><span>__add__()</span></code> and <code><span>__radd__()</span></code> methods
between two <code><span>Template</span></code> instances and between a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance and a
<code><span>str</span></code>.</p>

<p>The <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> types do not support ordering. This is
unlike all other string literal types in Python, which support lexicographic
ordering. Because interpolations can contain arbitrary values, there is no

<p>Raw template strings are supported using the <code><span>rt</span></code> (or <code><span>tr</span></code>) prefix:</p>

<p>In this example, the <code><span>\n</span></code> is treated as two separate characters
(a backslash followed by ‘n’) rather than a newline character. This is
consistent with Python’s raw string behavior.</p>
<p>As with regular template strings, interpolations in raw template strings are
processed normally, allowing for the combination of raw string behavior and
dynamic content.</p>

<p>The expressions that are extracted from the string are evaluated in the context

<p>It is easy to “implement” f-strings using t-strings. That is, we can
write a function <code><span>f(template:</span> <span>Template)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span></code> that processes a <code><span>Template</span></code>
in much the same way as an f-string literal, returning the same result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>

<h3><a href="#example-structured-logging" role="doc-backlink">Example: Structured Logging</a></h3>
<p>Structured logging allows developers to log data in machine-readable
formats like JSON. With t-strings, developers can easily log structured data
alongside human-readable messages using just a single log statement.</p>
<p>We present two different approaches to implementing structured logging with
template strings.</p>
<section id="approach-1-custom-log-messages">
<h4><a href="#approach-1-custom-log-messages" role="doc-backlink">Approach 1: Custom Log Messages</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook" title="(in Python v3.13)"><span>Python Logging Cookbook</span></a>
has a short section on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#implementing-structured-logging">how to implement structured logging</a>.</p>
<p>The logging cookbook suggests creating a new “message” class, <code><span>StructuredMessage</span></code>,
that is constructed with a simple text message and a separate dictionary of values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>StructuredMessage</span><span>(</span><span>"user action"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"action"</span><span>:</span> <span>"traded"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"amount"</span><span>:</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"item"</span><span>:</span> <span>"shrubs"</span>
<span>})</span>
<span>logging</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>

<span># Outputs:</span>
<span># user action &gt;&gt;&gt; {"action": "traded", "amount": 42, "item": "shrubs"}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>StructuredMessage.__str__()</span></code> method formats both the human-readable
message <em>and</em> the values, combining them into a final string. (See the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#implementing-structured-logging">logging cookbook</a>
for its full example.)</p>
<p>We can implement an improved version of <code><span>StructuredMessage</span></code> using template strings:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>string.templatelib</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>Interpolation</span><span>,</span> <span>Template</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Template strings give us a more elegant way to define the custom message
class. With template strings it is no longer necessary for developers to make
sure that their format string and values dictionary are kept in sync; a single
template string literal is all that is needed. The <code><span>TemplateMessage</span></code>
implementation can automatically extract structured keys and values from
the <code><span>Interpolation.expression</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation.value</span></code> attributes,
respectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="approach-2-custom-formatters">
<h4><a href="#approach-2-custom-formatters" role="doc-backlink">Approach 2: Custom Formatters</a></h4>
<p>Custom messages are a reasonable approach to structured logging but can be a
little awkward. To use them, developers must wrap every log message they write
in a custom class. This can be easy to forget.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to define custom <code><span>logging.Formatter</span></code> classes. This
approach is more flexible and allows for more control over the final output. In
particular, it’s possible to take a single template string and output it in
multiple formats (human-readable and JSON) to separate log streams.</p>
<p>We define two simple formatters, a <code><span>MessageFormatter</span></code> for human-readable output
and a <code><span>ValuesFormatter</span></code> for JSON output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>json</span>

<p>We can then use these formatters when configuring our logger:</p>

<span># Outputs to sys.stdout:</span>
<span># User traded: 42.00 shrubs</span>

<span># At the same time, outputs to sys.stderr:</span>
<span># {"action": "traded", "amount": 42, "item": "shrubs"}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This approach has a couple advantages over the custom message approach to structured
logging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers can log a t-string directly without wrapping it in a custom class.</li>
<li>Human-readable and structured output can be sent to separate log streams. This
is useful for log aggregation systems that process structured data independently
from human-readable data.</li>

<section id="how-to-teach-this">
<h2><a href="#how-to-teach-this" role="doc-backlink">How To Teach This</a></h2>
<p>Template strings have several audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers using template strings and processing functions</li>
<li>Authors of template processing code</li>
<li>Framework authors who build interesting machinery with template strings</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that teaching developers will be straightforward. At a glance,
template strings look just like f-strings. Their syntax is familiar and the
scoping rules remain the same.</p>
<p>The first thing developers must learn is that template string literals don’t
evaluate to strings; instead, they evaluate to a new type, <code><span>Template</span></code>. This
is a simple type intended to be used by template processing code. It’s not until
developers call a processing function that they get the result they want:
typically, a string, although processing code can of course return any arbitrary
type.</p>
<p>Developers will also want to understand how template strings relate to other
string formatting methods like f-strings and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a>. They will need
to decide when to use each method. If a simple string is all that is needed, and
there are no security implications, f-strings are likely the best choice. For
most cases where a format string is used, it can be replaced with a function
wrapping the creation of a template string. In cases where the format string is
obtained from user input, the filesystem, or databases, it is possible to write
code to convert it into a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance if desired.</p>
<p>Because developers will learn that t-strings are nearly always used in tandem
with processing functions, they don’t necessarily need to understand the details
of the <code><span>Template</span></code> type. As with descriptors and decorators, we expect many more
developers will use t-strings than write t-string processing functions.</p>
<p>Over time, a small number of more advanced developers <em>will</em> wish to author their
own template processing code. Writing processing code often requires thinking
in terms of formal grammars. Developers will need to learn how to work with the
<code><span>strings</span></code> and <code><span>interpolation</span></code> attributes of a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance and how
to process interpolations in a context-sensitive fashion. More sophisticated
grammars will likely require parsing to intermediate representations like an
abstract syntax tree (AST). Great template processing code will handle format
specifiers and conversions when appropriate. Writing production-grade template
processing code – for instance, to support HTML templates – can be a large
undertaking.</p>
<p>We expect that template strings will provide framework authors with a powerful
new tool in their toolbox. While the functionality of template strings overlaps
with existing tools like template engines, t-strings move that logic into
the language itself. Bringing the full power and generality of Python to bear on
string processing tasks opens new possibilities for framework authors.</p>

<section id="why-another-templating-approach">
<h2><a href="#why-another-templating-approach" role="doc-backlink">Why another templating approach?</a></h2>
<p>The world of Python already has mature templating languages with wide adoption,
such as Jinja. Why build support for creating new templating systems?</p>
<p>Projects such as Jinja are still needed in cases where the template is less part
of the software by the developers, and more part of customization by designers
or even content created by users, for example in a CMS.</p>
<p>The trends in frontend development have treated templating as part of the
software and written by developers. They want modern language features and a
good tooling experience. PEP 750 envisions DSLs where the non-static parts are
Python: same scope rules, typing, expression syntax, and the like.</p>

<section id="memoizing">
<h3><a href="#memoizing" role="doc-backlink">Memoizing</a></h3>
<p>Template functions can efficiently process both static and dynamic parts of templates.
The structure of <code><span>Template</span></code> objects allows for effective memoization:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>strings</span> <span>=</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span>  <span># Static string parts</span>
<span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>values</span>  <span># Dynamic interpolated values</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This separation enables caching of processed static parts while dynamic parts
can be inserted as needed. Authors of template processing code can use the static
<code><span>strings</span></code> as cache keys, leading to significant performance improvements when
similar templates are used repeatedly.</p>
</section>
<section id="parsing-to-intermediate-representations">
<h3><a href="#parsing-to-intermediate-representations" role="doc-backlink">Parsing to Intermediate Representations</a></h3>
<p>Code that processes templates can parse the template string into intermediate
representations, like an AST. We expect that many template processing libraries
will use this approach.</p>
<p>For instance, rather than returning a <code><span>str</span></code>, our theoretical <code><span>html()</span></code> function
(see the <a href="#motivation">Motivation</a> section) could return an HTML <code><span>Element</span></code> defined in the
same package:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>@dataclass</span><span>(</span><span>frozen</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Element</span><span>:</span>
    <span>tag</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>attributes</span><span>:</span> <span>Mapping</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>bool</span><span>]</span>
    <span>children</span><span>:</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>[</span><span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Element</span><span>]</span>

    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>__str__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>

    <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Calling <code><span>str(element)</span></code> would then render the HTML but, in the meantime, the
<code><span>Element</span></code> could be manipulated in a variety of ways.</p>
</section>
<section id="context-sensitive-processing-of-interpolations">
<h3><a href="#context-sensitive-processing-of-interpolations" role="doc-backlink">Context-sensitive Processing of Interpolations</a></h3>
<p>Continuing with our hypothetical <code><span>html()</span></code> function, it could be made
context-sensitive. Interpolations could be processed differently depending
on where they appear in the template.</p>
<p>For example, our <code><span>html()</span></code> function could support multiple kinds of
interpolations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>attributes</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"main"</span><span>}</span>
<span>attribute_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>"shrubbery"</span>
<span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hello"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;div </span><span>{attributes}</span><span> data-value=</span><span>{attribute_value}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{content}</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;"</span>
<span>element</span> <span>=</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'&lt;div id="main" data-value="shrubbery"&gt;hello&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because the <code><span>{attributes}</span></code> interpolation occurs in the context of an HTML tag,
and because there is no corresponding attribute name, it is treated as a dictionary
of attributes. The <code><span>{attribute_value}</span></code> interpolation is treated as a simple
string value and is quoted before inclusion in the final string. The
<code><span>{content}</span></code> interpolation is treated as potentially unsafe content and is
escaped before inclusion in the final string.</p>
</section>
<section id="nested-template-strings">
<h3><a href="#nested-template-strings" role="doc-backlink">Nested Template Strings</a></h3>
<p>Going a step further with our <code><span>html()</span></code> function, we could support nested
template strings. This would allow for more complex HTML structures to be
built up from simpler templates:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>"&lt;p&gt;Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;"</span><span>)</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"&lt;div&gt;</span><span>{content}</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;"</span>
<span>element</span> <span>=</span> <span>html</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because the <code><span>{content}</span></code> interpolation is an <code><span>Element</span></code> instance, it does
not need to be escaped before inclusion in the final string.</p>
<p>One could imagine a nice simplification: if the <code><span>html()</span></code> function is passed
a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance, it could automatically convert it to an <code><span>Element</span></code>
by recursively calling itself on the nested template.</p>
<p>We expect that nesting and composition of templates will be a common pattern
in template processing code and, where appropriate, used in preference to
simple string concatenation.</p>
</section>
<section id="approaches-to-lazy-evaluation">
<h3><a href="#approaches-to-lazy-evaluation" role="doc-backlink">Approaches to Lazy Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Like f-strings, interpolations in t-string literals are eagerly evaluated. However,
there are cases where lazy evaluation may be desirable.</p>
<p>If a single interpolation is expensive to evaluate, it can be explicitly wrapped
in a <code><span>lambda</span></code> in the template string literal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello {(lambda: name)}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>callable</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>"World"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes, of course, that template processing code anticipates and handles
callable interpolation values. (One could imagine also supporting iterators,
awaitables, etc.) This is not a requirement of the PEP, but it is a common
pattern in template processing code.</p>
<p>In general, we hope that the community will develop best practices for lazy
evaluation of interpolations in template strings and that, when it makes sense,
common libraries will provide support for callable or awaitable values in
their template processing code.</p>
</section>
<section id="approaches-to-asynchronous-evaluation">
<h3><a href="#approaches-to-asynchronous-evaluation" role="doc-backlink">Approaches to Asynchronous Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Closely related to lazy evaluation is asynchronous evaluation.</p>
<p>As with f-strings, the <code><span>await</span></code> keyword is allowed in interpolations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>example</span><span>():</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_name</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Sleepy"</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello {await get_name()}"</span>
    <span># Use the f() function from the f-string example, above</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Hello Sleepy"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>More sophisticated template processing code can take advantage of this to
perform asynchronous operations in interpolations. For example, a “smart”
processing function could anticipate that an interpolation is an awaitable
and await it before processing the template string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>example</span><span>():</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_name</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Sleepy"</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{get_name}</span><span>"</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>await</span> <span>async_f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Hello Sleepy"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that the template processing code in <code><span>async_f()</span></code> is asynchronous
and is able to <code><span>await</span></code> an interpolation’s value.</p>

<section id="approaches-to-template-reuse">
<h3><a href="#approaches-to-template-reuse" role="doc-backlink">Approaches to Template Reuse</a></h3>
<p>If developers wish to reuse template strings multiple times with different
values, they can write a function to return a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>

</section>
<section id="relation-to-format-strings">
<h3><a href="#relation-to-format-strings" role="doc-backlink">Relation to Format Strings</a></h3>
<p>The venerable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a> method accepts format strings that can later
be used to format values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>alas_fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>"We're all out of </span><span>{cheese}</span><span>."</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>alas_fmt</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>cheese</span><span>=</span><span>"Red Leicester"</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"We're all out of Red Leicester."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If one squints, one can think of format strings as a kind of function definition.
The <em>call</em> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a> can be seen as a kind of function call. The
t-string equivalent is to simply define a standard Python function that returns
a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>make_template</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>cheese</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Template</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>t</span><span>"We're all out of </span><span>{cheese}</span><span>."</span>

<span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>make_template</span><span>(</span><span>cheese</span><span>=</span><span>"Red Leicester"</span><span>)</span>
<span># Using the f() function from the f-string example, above</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"We're all out of Red Leicester."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code><span>make_template()</span></code> function itself can be thought of as analogous to the
format string. The call to <code><span>make_template()</span></code> is analogous to the call to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>str.format()</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it is common to load format strings from external sources like a
filesystem or database. Thankfully, because <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>
are simple Python types, it is possible to write a function that takes an
old-style format string and returns an equivalent <code><span>Template</span></code> instance:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>from_format</span><span>(</span><span>fmt</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>/</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>:</span> <span>object</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Template</span><span>:</span>
<span>     </span><span>"""Parse `fmt` and return a `Template` instance."""</span>
     <span>...</span>

 <span># Load this from a file, database, etc.</span>
 <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>"We're all out of </span><span>{cheese}</span><span>."</span>
 <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_format</span><span>(</span><span>fmt</span><span>,</span> <span>cheese</span><span>=</span><span>"Red Leicester"</span><span>)</span>
 <span># Using the f() function from the f-string example, above</span>
 <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>template</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>"We're all out of Red Leicester."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is a powerful pattern that allows developers to use template strings in
places where they might have previously used format strings. A full implementation
of <code><span>from_format()</span></code> is available in the examples repository,
which supports the full grammar of format strings.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">JavaScript tagged template literals</a>,
an earlier version of this PEP allowed for arbitrary “tag” prefixes in front
of literal strings:</p>

<p>The prefix was a special callable called a “tag function”. Tag functions
received the parts of the template string in an argument list. They could then
process the string and return an arbitrary value:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>my_tag</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Interpolation</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Any</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This approach was rejected for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was deemed too complex to build in full generality. JavaScript allows for
arbitrary expressions to precede a template string, which is a significant
challenge to implement in Python.</li>
<li>It precluded future introduction of new string prefixes.</li>
<li>It seemed to needlessly pollute the namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of a single <code><span>t</span></code> prefix was chosen as a simpler, more Pythonic approach and
more in keeping with template strings’ role as a generalization of f-strings.</p>

<section id="delayed-evaluation-of-interpolations">
<h3><a href="#delayed-evaluation-of-interpolations" role="doc-backlink">Delayed Evaluation of Interpolations</a></h3>
<p>An early version of this PEP proposed that interpolations should be lazily
evaluated. All interpolations were “wrapped” in implicit lambdas. Instead of
having an eagerly evaluated <code><span>value</span></code> attribute, interpolations had a
<code><span>getvalue()</span></code> method that would resolve the value of the interpolation:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Interpolation</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>_value</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[],</span> <span>object</span><span>]</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_value</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This was rejected for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overwhelming majority of use cases for template strings naturally call
for immediate evaluation.</li>
<li>Delayed evaluation would be a significant departure from the behavior of
f-strings.</li>
<li>Implicit lambda wrapping leads to difficulties with type hints and
static analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, there are viable (if imperfect) alternatives to implicit
lambda wrapping in many cases where lazy evaluation is desired. See the section

<p>Earlier versions of this PEP proposed that the <code><span>Template</span></code> and <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>
types should have their own implementations of <code><span>__eq__</span></code> and <code><span>__hash__</span></code>.</p>

<code><span>expression</span></code>, <code><span>conversion</span></code>, and <code><span>format_spec</span></code> were equal. Interpolation
hashing was similar to tuple hashing: an <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> was hashable if and
only if its <code><span>value</span></code> was hashable.</p>
<p>This was rejected because <code><span>Template.__hash__</span></code> so defined was not useful as a
cache key in template processing code; we were concerned that it would be

<p>Previous versions of this PEP proposed placing the <code><span>Template</span></code> and

<section id="enable-full-reconstruction-of-original-template-literal">
<h3><a href="#enable-full-reconstruction-of-original-template-literal" role="doc-backlink">Enable Full Reconstruction of Original Template Literal</a></h3>
<p>Earlier versions of this PEP attempted to make it possible to fully reconstruct
the text of the original template string from a <code><span>Template</span></code> instance. This was
rejected as being overly complex. The mapping between template literal source
and the underlying AST is not one-to-one and there are several limitations with
respect to round-tripping to the original source text.</p>
<p>First, <code><span>Interpolation.format_spec</span></code> defaults to <code><span>""</span></code> if not provided:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>template1</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{value}</span><span>"</span>
<span>template2</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{value:}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>""</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>""</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next, the debug specifier, <code><span>=</span></code>, is treated as a special case and is processed
before the AST is created. It is therefore not possible to distinguish
<code><span>t"{value=}"</span></code> from <code><span>t"value={value!r}"</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>template1</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"{value=}"</span>
<span>template2</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"value=</span><span>{value!r}</span><span>"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value="</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>expression</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>conversion</span> <span>==</span> <span>"r"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>strings</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value="</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>expression</span> <span>==</span> <span>"value"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>conversion</span> <span>==</span> <span>"r"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, format specifiers in f-strings allow arbitrary nesting. In this PEP
and in the reference implementation, the specifier is eagerly evaluated to
set the <code><span>format_spec</span></code> in the <code><span>Interpolation</span></code>, thereby losing the original
expressions. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
<span>precision</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>template1</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"</span><span>{value:.2f}</span><span>"</span>
<span>template2</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>"{value:.</span><span>{precision}</span><span>f}"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template1</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>template2</span><span>.</span><span>interpolations</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>format_spec</span> <span>==</span> <span>".2f"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We do not anticipate that these limitations will be a significant issue in practice.
Developers who need to obtain the original template string literal can always
use <code><span>inspect.getsource()</span></code> or similar tools.</p>
</section>
<section id="disallowing-string-concatenation">
<h3><a href="#disallowing-string-concatenation" role="doc-backlink">Disallowing String Concatenation</a></h3>
<p>Earlier versions of this PEP proposed that template strings should not support
concatenation. This was rejected in favor of allowing concatenation.</p>
<p>There are reasonable arguments in favor of rejecting one or all forms of
concatenation: namely, that it cuts off a class of potential bugs, particularly
when one takes the view that template strings will often contain complex grammars
for which concatenation doesn’t always have the same meaning (or any meaning).</p>
<p>Moreover, the earliest versions of this PEP proposed a syntax closer to
JavaScript’s tagged template literals, where an arbitrary callable could be used
as a prefix to a string literal. There was no guarantee that the callable would
return a type that supported concatenation.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided that the surprise to developers of a new string type
<em>not</em> supporting concatenation was likely to be greater than the theoretical
harm caused by supporting it. (Developers concatenate f-strings all the time,
after all, and while we are sure there are cases where this introduces bugs,
it’s not clear that those bugs outweigh the benefits of supporting concatenation.)</p>
<p>While concatenation is supported, we expect that code that uses template strings
will more commonly build up larger templates through nesting and composition
rather than concatenation.</p>
</section>
<section id="arbitrary-conversion-values">
<h3><a href="#arbitrary-conversion-values" role="doc-backlink">Arbitrary Conversion Values</a></h3>
<p>Python allows only <code><span>r</span></code>, <code><span>s</span></code>, or <code><span>a</span></code> as possible conversion type values.
Trying to assign a different value results in <code><span>SyntaxError</span></code>.</p>
<p>In theory, template functions could choose to handle other conversion types. But this
PEP adheres closely to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/" title="PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings">PEP 701</a>. Any changes to allowed values should be in a
separate PEP.</p>
</section>
<section id="removing-conversion-from-interpolation">
<h3><a href="#removing-conversion-from-interpolation" role="doc-backlink">Removing <code><span>conversion</span></code> From <code><span>Interpolation</span></code></a></h3>
<p>While drafting this PEP, we considered removing the <code><span>conversion</span></code>
attribute from <code><span>Interpolation</span></code> and specifying that the conversion should be
performed eagerly, before <code><span>Interpolation.value</span></code> is set.</p>
<p>This was done to simplify the work of writing template processing code. The
<code><span>conversion</span></code> attribute is of limited extensibility (it is typed as
<code><span>Literal["r",</span> <span>"s",</span> <span>"a"]</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span></code>). It is not clear that it adds significant
value or flexibility to template strings that couldn’t better be achieved with
custom format specifiers. Unlike with format specifiers, there is no
equivalent to Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" title="(in Python v3.13)"><code><span>format()</span></code></a> built-in. (Instead, we include a
sample implementation of <code><span>convert()</span></code> in the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section.)</p>
<p>Ultimately we decided to keep the <code><span>conversion</span></code> attribute in the
<code><span>Interpolation</span></code> type to maintain compatibility with f-strings and to allow
for future extensibility.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternate-interpolation-symbols">
<h3><a href="#alternate-interpolation-symbols" role="doc-backlink">Alternate Interpolation Symbols</a></h3>
<p>In the early stages of this PEP, we considered allowing alternate symbols for
interpolations in template strings. For example, we considered allowing
<code><span>${name}</span></code> as an alternative to <code><span>{name}</span></code> with the idea that it might be useful
for i18n or other purposes. See the
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-750-tag-strings-for-writing-domain-specific-languages/60408/122">Discourse thread</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>This was rejected in favor of keeping t-string syntax as close to f-string syntax
as possible.</p>
</section>
<section id="alternate-layouts-for-template">
<h3><a href="#alternate-layouts-for-template" role="doc-backlink">Alternate Layouts for <code><span>Template</span></code></a></h3>
<p>During the development of this PEP, we considered several alternate layouts for
the <code><span>Template</span></code> type. Many focused on a single <code><span>args</span></code> tuple that contained
both strings and interpolations. Variants included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span>args</span></code> was a <code><span>tuple[str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Interpolation,</span> <span>...]`</span></code> with the promise that
its first and last items were strings and that strings and interpolations
always alternated. This implied that <code><span>args</span></code> was always non-empty and that
empty strings would be inserted between neighboring interpolations. This was
rejected because alternation could not be captured by the type system and was
not a guarantee we wished to make.</li>
<li><code><span>args</span></code> remained a <code><span>tuple[str</span> <span>|</span> <span>Interpolation,</span> <span>...]</span></code> but did not support
interleaving. As a result, empty strings were not added to the sequence. It
was no longer possible to obtain static strings with <code><span>args[::2]</span></code>; instead,
instance checks or structural pattern matching had to be used to distinguish
between strings and interpolations. This approach was rejected as offering
less future opportunity for performance optimization.</li>
<li><code><span>args</span></code> was typed as a <code><span>Sequence[tuple[str,</span> <span>Interpolation</span> <span>|</span> <span>None]]</span></code>. Each
static string was paired with is neighboring interpolation. The final
string part had no corresponding interpolation. This was rejected as being
overly complex.</li>
</ul>

<section id="mechanism-to-describe-the-kind-of-template">
<h3><a href="#mechanism-to-describe-the-kind-of-template" role="doc-backlink">Mechanism to Describe the “Kind” of Template</a></h3>
<p>If t-strings prove popular, it may be useful to have a way to describe the
“kind” of content found in a template string: “sql”, “html”, “css”, etc.
This could enable powerful new features in tools such as linters, formatters,
type checkers, and IDEs. (Imagine, for example, <code><span>black</span></code> formatting HTML in
t-strings, or <code><span>mypy</span></code> checking whether a given attribute is valid for an HTML
tag.) While exciting, this PEP does not propose any specific mechanism. It is
our hope that, over time, the community will develop conventions for this purpose.</p>
</section>
<section id="binary-template-strings">
<h3><a href="#binary-template-strings" role="doc-backlink">Binary Template Strings</a></h3>
<p>The combination of t-strings and bytes (<code><span>tb</span></code>) is considered out of scope for
this PEP. However, unlike f-strings, there is no fundamental reason why t-strings
and bytes cannot be combined. Support could be considered in a future PEP.</p>

Armed with a small metal hammer, these specialized “drummers” tap every wheel after the minimum aging period of 12 months, and within 6-7 seconds they can detect if there are any defects, based purely on the sounds they hear.</p>

  <p>I had the privilege of spending the morning with two of these maestros on the job in Emilia-Romagna: Alessandro Stocchi, a dynamic 37-year-old native of Reggio Emilia who began training to become a battitore in 2014, and his mentor, Renato Giudici, who at 81 years old, embodies a lifetime of passion for Parmigiano Reggiano.&nbsp;Renato is a former cheesemaker who made Parmigiano Reggiano for many years, and rather than retire, he chose to become a guardian of the King of Cheeses as a <em>battitore.</em></p><p>There’s no course to learn the niche skills and nuances of this trade; Alessandro accompanied and apprenticed with Renato and other experts for about 3 years, learning through firsthand experience how to assess each wheel.</p><p>“The particularity of this profession to me is that it’s like it was 200 years ago, and it’s a skill that’s handed down from generation to generation. You go around with the most expert, most experienced battitori, and you watch and listen to them, and slowly they start to give you the hammer. You try with them next to you, piano piano, and gradually, you begin to do more on your own,” explained Stocchi. “It’s a big responsibility, you have to be really capable of doing it, you can’t damage the cheese.”</p>

  <p>Renato showed me the ideal setup, with a wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano flat on a stool underneath the one that is being evaluated, so there is no extraneous noise. If the sound is homogeneous throughout the tapping, there are no defects.</p><p>“We hit all of the surfaces of the cheese, and from the sound of the hammer against the surface we can imagine in our mind an Xray of the wheel and how it is internally. For a perfect wheel with no defects, the paste is completely compact, no empty space. If there are structural defects, such as little fissures or cavities, we can hear that the sound of the hammer is different,” explained Stocchi.</p>

  <p>“Sometimes when I do events and find a defect while I’m tapping a wheel, people who are watching turn their noses up. But to me it’s a beautiful thing that there are defects, and I’m not just saying it because if there aren’t any, I lose my job,” says Stocchi, laughing. “But the fact that there are defects indicates even more the artisanal quality of our product—we work with raw milk, without preservatives, each year there are many variations. Anyone who works with something in nature knows that not everything always goes how we would want or expect. I always say the day when we have 100% perfect Parmigiano Reggiano, we’d have to ask ourselves some questions, because it’s not an industrial product, so it’s normal that sometimes there are flaws.”</p><p>The number of wheels with defects remains low; in recent years, approximately 10% fell into the second category, and only about 1.5% were classified as third category.</p><p>“To do this job requires great passion, respect, and humility. My elder colleagues tell me you never stop learning, even after 50 years of doing it,” recounted Stocchi. “The day you think you’ve learned everything is the day you’ll start making errors.”</p>

<p>Arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence may be one of the major top­ics of our his­tor­i­cal moment, but it can be sur­pris­ing­ly tricky to define. In <a href="https://youtu.be/gGib6vIuVds">the more than 30-year-old inter­view clip above</a>, Isaac Asi­mov describes arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence as “a phrase that we use for any device that does things which, in the past, we have asso­ci­at­ed only with human intel­li­gence.” At one time, not so very long before, “only human beings could alpha­bet­ize cards”; in the machines that could even then do it in a frac­tion of a sec­ond, “you’ve got an exam­ple of arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence.” Not that humans were ever espe­cial­ly good at card alpha­bet­i­za­tion, nor at arith­metic: “the cheap­est com­put­er in the world can mul­ti­ply and divide more accu­rate­ly than we can.”</p>
<p>You could see arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence as a kind of fron­tier, then, which moves for­ward as com­put­er­ized machines take over the tasks humans pre­vi­ous­ly had to do them­selves. “Every indus­try, the gov­ern­ment itself, tax-col­lect­ing agen­cies, air­planes: every­thing depends on com­put­ers. We have per­son­al com­put­ers in the home, and they are con­stant­ly get­ting bet­ter, cheap­er, more ver­sa­tile, capa­ble of doing more things, so that we can look into the future, when, for the first time, human­i­ty in gen­er­al will be freed from all kinds of work that’s real­ly an insult to the human brain.” Such work “requires no great thought, no great cre­ativ­i­ty. Leave all that to the com­put­er, and we can leave to our­selves those things that com­put­ers can’t do.”</p>


<p>This inter­view was shot for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Ux83nJC0U"><em>Isaac Asi­mov’s Visions of the Future</em></a>, a tele­vi­sion doc­u­men­tary that aired in 1992, the last year of its sub­jec­t’s life. One won­ders what Asi­mov would make of the world of 2025, and whether he’d still see arti­fi­cial and nat­ur­al intel­li­gence as com­ple­men­tary, rather than in com­pe­ti­tion. “They work togeth­er,” he argues. “Each sup­plies the lack of the oth­er. And in coop­er­a­tion, they can advance far more rapid­ly than either could by itself.” But as a sci­ence-fic­tion nov­el­ist, he could hard­ly fail to acknowl­edge that tech­no­log­i­cal progress does­n’t come easy: “Will there be dif­fi­cul­ties? Undoubt­ed­ly. Will there be things that we won’t like? Undoubt­ed­ly. But we’ve got to think about it now, so as to be pre­pared for pos­si­ble unpleas­ant­ness and try to guard against it before it’s too late.”</p>
<p>These are fair points, though it’s what comes next that most stands out to the twen­ty-first-cen­tu­ry mind. “It’s like in the old days, when the auto­mo­bile was invent­ed,” Asi­mov says. “It would’ve been so much bet­ter if we had built our cities with the auto­mo­bile in mind, instead of build­ing cities for a pre-auto­mo­bile age and find­ing we can hard­ly find any place to put the auto­mo­biles or allow them to dri­ve.” Yet the cities we most enjoy today aren’t the new metrop­o­lis­es built or great­ly expand­ed in the car-ori­ent­ed decades after the Sec­ond World War, but pre­cise­ly those old ones whose streets were built to the seem­ing­ly obso­lete scale of human beings on foot. Per­haps, upon reflec­tion, we’d do best by future gen­er­a­tions to keep as many ele­ments of the pre-AI world around as we pos­si­bly can.</p>

<p>I’ve found a way to configure private, custom domains for web-apps I have running on my computer. So instead of having to remember and type “localhost:4333”, I can simply navigate to “appname.localhost”. I love it! </p><p>Here’s how the system works:</p><ol><li><p>Each app is set up as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd" title="">launchd</a> daemon listening on a unique port. <a href="https://gist.github.com/charlesetc/af42b15d3e5e3a64c1aeddaa54b8f1fd" title="">Here’s an example</a> plist.</p></li><li><p>I configure <a href="https://claude.ai/share/d62b8bdb-622b-4e97-b614-06b6f16ff3e5" title="">/etc/hosts</a> to redirect traffic to these domains to 127.0.0.1 instead.</p></li><li><p>I then run and configure <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/" title="">Caddy</a> to redirect traffic from 127.0.0.1 to the right port for the domain.</p></li></ol><p>So, if I’m running an app on port 5050, I will have a corresponding entry in /etc/host:</p><pre><code>127.0.0.1 inclouds.localhost</code></pre><p>and a section in my Caddyfile like this:</p><pre><code>inclouds.localhost {</code></pre><pre><code>    reverse_proxy localhost:5050</code></pre><pre><code>    tls internal</code></pre><pre><code>    encode gzip zstd</code></pre><pre><code>}</code></pre><pre><code><br></code></pre><p>This is working well but I’d really like to see this process simplified. How cool would it be to install or uninstall apps to .localhost domains with a single command, instead of manually editing three files? But that’s a project for another day. </p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>Update: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arquipelago.org" title="">cristóbal</a> came up with <a href="https://github.com/tobyshooters/localhost" title="">a command</a> using dnsmasq that makes this even better!</p>

<p>I work at Red Hat on <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection</a>. I spent most of the past year working on how GCC emits diagnostics (errors and warnings) in the hope of making it easier to use. Let's take a look at 6 improvements to look forward to in the upcoming GCC 15.</p><h2>1. Prettier execution paths</h2><p>I added a <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/03/26/static-analysis-in-gcc-10">static analyzer to GCC in GCC 10</a> that prints visualizations of predicted paths of execution through the user's code, demonstrating each problem it predicts.</p><p>Here's an example that shows some of the improvements I've made to this in GCC 15:</p><pre><code>infinite-loop-linked-list.c: In function ‘while_loop_missing_next’:

   30 |   while (n)

      |          |
      |          (1) ⚠️  infinite loop here

      |                                                                         │

      |└────────&gt;(5) ...to here
	</code></pre><p>I've added a warning emoji (⚠️) to the event in the path where the problem occurs (event 1 in the above), and I've added "ASCII art" to show control flow, such as the lines connecting events 2 and 3, and those connecting events 4 and 5 (compare with the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/04/03/improvements-static-analysis-gcc-14-compiler#solving_the_halting_problem_">GCC 14 output seen here</a>).</p><p>Another example of an execution path can be seen in this new <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html"><code>-fanalyzer</code></a> warning <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-undefined-behavior-ptrdiff"><code>-Wanalyzer-undefined-behavior-ptrdiff</code></a>, which warns about pointer subtractions involving different chunks of memory:</p><pre><code>demo.c: In function ‘test_invalid_calc_of_array_size’:

    </code></pre><p>There's a line on the left-hand side that visualizes the stack depth to highlight calls and returns. &nbsp;As of GCC 15 this now uses unicode box-drawing characters (where the locale supports this), and for purely intraprocedual cases like the &nbsp;<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html#index-Wanalyzer-infinite-loop"><code>-Wanalyzer-infinite-loop</code></a> example above, we now omit it altogether, which saves some visual "noise."</p><h2>2. A new look for C++ template errors</h2><p>Compiler errors involving C++ templates are notoriously difficult to read.</p><p>Consider this invalid C++ code:</p><pre><code>struct widget {};
void draw (widget &amp;);

struct diagram {};
void draw (diagram &amp;);

template &lt;class W&gt;
concept drawable = requires(W w) { w.draw (); };

template &lt;drawable T&gt;
void draw(T);

int main ()
{
  draw (widget ());
}</code></pre><p>Attempting to <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5GqYnqd6E">compile it with GCC 14</a> with <code>-fconcepts -fconcepts-diagnostics-depth=2</code> gives 34 lines of output, which is relatively simple as far as these go, and even this can be hard to decipher. I'll post it here for reference, but I confess that my eyes tend to glaze over when I try to read it:</p><pre><code>&lt;source&gt;: In function 'int main()':

</code></pre><p>This presentation of the errors uses indentation and nested bullet points to show the logical structure of what the compiler is doing, eliminates redundant "visual noise" where it can, and clarifies the wording to state clearly that the compiler tried 3 different candidates for the function call, and spells out why each candidate was unsuitable.&nbsp;</p><p>I've tried turning this on for my day-to-day C++ work and it feels like a huge improvement. I hope we'll be able to turn it on by default in GCC 16; you can try it yourself <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/381oT3bxj">here</a>.</p><h2>3. Machine-readable diagnostics</h2><p><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SARIF">SARIF</a> is a file format intended for storing the results of static analysis tools in a machine-readable, interchangeable format; as such, it's a great fit for compiler diagnostics. I added support in GCC 13 for writing out GCC's diagnostics in SARIF form, but it was an all-or-nothing deal: you could choose either GCC's classic text output on stderr, or SARIF, but not both.&nbsp;</p><p>For GCC 15, I've reworked the insides of how we handle diagnostics so that there can be multiple "output sinks," and added a new command-line option <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Message-Formatting-Options.html#index-fdiagnostics-add-output"><code>-fdiagnostics-add-output=ARGS</code></a> for adding new sinks. For example, using <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Message-Formatting-Options.html#index-fdiagnostics-add-output"><code>-fdiagnostics-add-output=sarif</code></a> will get you diagnostics emitted both as text on stderr and in SARIF form to a file.&nbsp;</p><p>Various sub-options are available; for example, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Message-Formatting-Options.html#index-fdiagnostics-add-output"><code>-fdiagnostics-add-output=sarif:version=2.2-prerelease</code></a> will select SARIF 2.2 output for that sink (though given that we're still working on the SARIF 2.2 specification, it uses an unofficial draft of the specification, and is subject to change).</p><p>I've also improved the SARIF that GCC emits. The output now captures all locations and labeled source ranges associated with a diagnostic. For example, for:</p><pre><code>PATH/missing-semicolon.c: In function 'missing_semicolon':
PATH/missing-semicolon.c:9:12: error: expected ';' before '}' token
    9 |   return 42
      |            ^
      |            ;
   10 | }
      | ~
</code></pre><p>the GCC SARIF output now captures the secondary location (that of the trailing close brace), as well as that of the missing semicolon. Similarly, for:</p><pre><code>bad-binary-ops.c: In function ‘bad_plus’:
bad-binary-ops.c:64:23: error: invalid operands to binary + (have ‘S’ {aka ‘struct s’} and ‘T’ {aka ‘struct t’})
  64 |   return callee_4a () + callee_4b ();
     |          ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
     |          |              |
     |          |              T {aka struct t}
     |          S {aka struct s}
</code></pre><p>the SARIF output captures those underlined ranges and their labels.&nbsp;</p><p>GCC's SARIF output now captures the command-line arguments (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790819">§3.20.2</a>), timestamps for the start and end of compilation (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790824">§§3.20.7-8</a>), and the working directory (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790836">§3.20.19</a>). It also now sets the <code>roles</code> property for SARIF <code>artifact</code> objects (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790867">§3.24.6</a>), captures any embedded URLs in the text of messages (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790717">§3.11.6</a>). For diagnostics relating to header files, the SARIF output now captures the chain of <code>#include</code> directives that led to the diagnostic's location (using SARIF <code>locationRelationship</code> objects, <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790978">§3.34</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>As well as improving the SARIF that GCC produces, I've added a tool to GCC 15 for <strong>consuming</strong> SARIF: <code>sarif-replay</code>. This is a simple command-line tool for viewing <code>.sarif</code> files, showing ("replaying") any diagnostics found in the <code>.sarif</code> files in text form as if they were GCC diagnostics, with support for details such as quoting source code, underlined ranges, fix-it hints, and diagnostic paths.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, here's a replay of a <code>.sarif</code> file emitted by GCC's <code>-fanalyzer</code> static analysis option:</p><pre><code>$ sarif-replay signal-warning.sarif

An easier transition to C23</h2><p>When compiling C code, GCC 14 and earlier defaulted to <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html#index-std-1"><code>-std=gnu17</code></a> (i.e., the "C17" version of the C standard, plus extensions). GCC 15 now defaults to <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html#index-std-1"><code>-std=gnu23</code></a> (based on C23), so if your build system isn't specifying which C version to use, you might run into <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-15/porting_to.html#c23">C17 versus C23 incompatibilities</a>.</p><p>I attempted to rebuild a large subset of Fedora with GCC 15 and thus defaulting to C23 to try to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/F42-gcc-15-mass-prebuild">shake out problems</a> that would arise, and in doing so found various diagnostics that needed improving. For example, <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code> are keywords in C23, so I've tweaked the error message that occurs on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/7W8fMT9zd">old code</a> such as:</p><pre><code>typedef int bool;</code></pre><p>so that you immediately know it's a C23 compatibility problem:</p><pre><code>&lt;source&gt;:1:13: error: 'bool' cannot be defined via 'typedef'
    1 | typedef int bool;
      |             ^~~~
&lt;source&gt;:1:13: note: 'bool' is a keyword with '-std=c23' onwards</code></pre><p>Similarly, C17 and C23 treat function declarations without parameters such as <code>int foo(); </code>differently. In C23, it's equivalent to <code>int foo(void);</code> whereas, in earlier versions of C, such a declaration plays fast and loose with the type system—essentially meaning, "we don't know how many parameters this function takes or their types; let's hope your code is correct!". In my tests, this led to lots of errors on old code, such as in <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/11hzWYEeK">this example</a>:</p><pre><code>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

void test()
{
  void (*handler)();
  handler = signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN);
}</code></pre><p>So I've clarified these error messages so that they tell you the types of the functions (or function pointers) and show you where the pertinent <code>typedef</code> is:</p><pre><code>&lt;source&gt;: In function 'test':
&lt;source&gt;:6:11: error: assignment to 'void (*)(void)' from incompatible pointer type '__sighandler_t' {aka 'void (*)(int)'} [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
    6 |   handler = signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN);
      |           ^
In file included from &lt;source&gt;:1:
/usr/include/signal.h:72:16: note: '__sighandler_t' declared here
   72 | typedef void (*__sighandler_t) (int);
      |                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre><p>Similarly, I've clarified the C front end's error messages for bad call sites:</p><pre><code>struct p { int (*bar)(); };
    
void baz() {
    struct p q;
    q.bar(1);
}</code></pre><pre><code>t.c: In function 'baz':
t.c:7:5: error: too many arguments to function 'q.bar'; expected 0, have 1
    7 |     q.bar(1);
      |     ^     ~
t.c:2:15: note: declared here
    2 |         int (*bar)();
      |               ^~~
   </code></pre><p>showing the expected parameter count versus the actual argument count, underlining the first extraneous argument at the call site, and showing the pertinent field declaration of the callback.</p><h2>5. A revamped color scheme</h2><p>GCC will use color when emitting its text messages on stderr at a suitably modern terminal, using a few colors that seem to work well in a number of different terminal themes—but the exact rules for choosing which color to use for each aspect of the output have been rather arbitrary.</p><p>For GCC 15, I've gone through C and C++'s errors, looking for places where two different things in the source are being contrasted, such as type mismatches. These diagnostics now use color to visually highlight and distinguish the differences.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, this error (Figure 1) shows a bogus attempt to use a binary <code>+</code> operator due to the two operands being structs (via <code>typedef</code>s <code>S</code> and <code>T</code>), rather than numeric types.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Figure 1: A new color scheme for errors in GCC 15.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two significant things here are the types, so GCC 15 uses two colors to consistently highlight the different types: in the message itself, in the quoted source, and the labels. Here, the left-hand type (<code>typedef struct s S;</code>) is shown throughout in green and the right-hand type (<code>typedef struct t T;</code>) in dark blue. I hope this approach better ties together the message's text with the source code and makes such errors a little easier to figure out.</p><h2>6. libgdiagnostics</h2><p>Figure 1 above shows off some of the features that GCC's diagnostics subsystem has: code for colorization, quoting source code, labelling ranges of source, fix-it hints, execution paths, SARIF output, and so on. Previously this code was hidden inside GCC and only usable by GCC itself.&nbsp;</p><p>For GCC 15, I've made this functionality available as a shared library for other projects to use: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/libgdiagnostics">libgdiagnostics</a>. There is a C API, along with C++ and Python bindings. For example, I was able to use the Python bindings to write a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=8d6de758cca6d16eb930ac1a7008ee54ec5489d9">"linting" script for our testsuite</a>, and "for free" got source quoting, colorization, and fix-it hints. Adding the ability to this script to output as SARIF would be a one-liner, rather than having to write lots of JSON-handling code.</p><h2>Try GCC 15</h2><p>We're still fixing bugs, but we hope that <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/changes.html">GCC 15</a> will be ready to officially release (as 15.1) sometime later this month. With my "downstream" hat on, we're already using the prerelease (GCC 15.0) within <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-40-beta/">Fedora 42 Beta</a>.</p><p>Finally, you can use the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/s18GhbdeM">excellent Compiler Explorer site</a> to play with the new compiler. Have fun!</p>

She wasn’t assuming — as many people do — that it’s a function mainly of the brain. She was just starting her lab and decided to throw the net wide, asking the question: if animals are sleep deprived, how long will it take until they die — and when they die, what is the specific cause?</p><p>She expected it would take years to answer these questions. But in six months, Rogulja’s postdoctoral assistant, Alexandra Vaccaro, found a tantalizing clue.</p><p>“We started looking at lifespan and saw that the moment when sleep-deprived animals would start dying was pretty much always the same,” Rogulja says. “When they lost about 90% of their sleep each night, they started dying within about ten days.” Those studies were in flies and mice — but the implications for other animals, including humans, was intriguing.</p><p>The average adult spends more than 20 years of their life sleeping, and the consequences of not getting enough are clearly harmful. But surprisingly little is known about why it’s necessary. That is, in part, because only in the past couple of decades have the tools become available to help scientists to understand the fundamental biological function of sleep. These include optogenetics, which involves directing laser light to specific neurons to wake a person or put them into deep sleep, and focused ultrasound, which has emerged in the past five years as a way to view the deep-brain neural oscillations that occur during sleep.</p><p>With the help of such tools, researchers are beginning to understand that sleep does more than just give our brains and bodies a respite from the rigours of the day. When we sleep, our genes, metabolism and hormones are regulated through increasing or slowing of their activity. </p><h2>Finding homeostasis</h2><p>What’s the most important function of the brain? It might be tempting to say a specific task, such as communicating, finding food or avoiding predators. But none of these roles is possible if the brain’s cellular machinery isn’t functioning reliably. Indeed, it is maintaining that reliability that might well be the main purpose of sleep, says Keith Hengen, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/ecfaibfjcd" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_50831532.jpg"><p>Nature Outlook: Sleep</p></a></article><p>“This was like a light bulb for me a long time ago,” Hengen says. In terms of machine learning, “if you have a deep-learning network, and you continue to let it learn, it’ll exhibit catastrophic forgetting — the wheels come off and the thing stops. It just fails.”</p><p>Biology has solved this problem of brain overload by resetting to a ‘critical point’ — a process that occurs mainly during sleep. During the day, the brain is consumed with the many things it has to do, such as learning, coordinating movement and recognizing faces. These tasks all change connections in the brain, essentially undermining the platform that is set up for that learning. Sleep, Hengen contends, allows the brain to reset. According to this hypothesis, the restoration, which occurs through a common biological process known as homeostasis, is the ‘set point’ at which the brain is able to maximize information-processing potential<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Hengen compares homeostasis to the familiar workings of a home heating system. A drop in a room’s temperature below the set point causes the heater to turn on, restoring the environment to the desired level of warmth.</p><p>Likewise, when the brain is further from its critical point, a person will feel more tired and need to fall asleep to reset. The closer the brain is to its critical point the more likely the person is to stay awake, because they will have plenty of capacity for doing and learning.</p><p>Sleep has several mechanisms that help the brain to reset after the stimulus and onslaught of information of each day. According to a 2024 study, parts of the hippocampus go silent during sleep, preparing its neurons for use again the next day<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. And a 2017 study<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> found that, in the brains of mice, sleep restores the balance of junctions between neurons called synapses, which grow during the day and shrink during sleep.</p><p>Rogulja’s team confirmed that sleep is indeed important for homeostasis, but that the organ in which this takes place is not the brain.</p><p>After determining the ten-day timeline for sleep deprivation and death in flies, Vaccaro, who had previously studied sleep deprivation and ageing, began looking for markers of ageing in these insects. She and her colleagues found that the concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the guts of flies were at their highest when the animals started dying. Small amounts of ROS are beneficial — they regulate the body’s immune response and help cells to defend against pathogens. But without sleep these molecules accumulate to toxic levels<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>“We looked at tissues all over the body,” Vaccaro says. “We looked at the brain and didn’t see anything. The one tissue that showed the most damage when the flies started to die was in the gut.”</p><p>The same happened in mice. When the animals were sleep deprived, then allowed to sleep for small periods, during that time, they stopped expressing genes for fat uptake. Organelles called mitochondria sense this nutrient deficiency and signal cellular enzymes to make ROS to stimulate the proliferation of cells in the gut that are better at absorption, Rogulja says. After just one day of restricting sleep in mice, Rogulja could see fats in the animals’ intestines that weren’t entering circulation. After five days, their guts were filled with fat although their bodies were starved of nutrients.</p><p>In rats, most genes seem to be upregulated while the animals are awake and downregulated during sleep. Genes that are upregulated during periods of sleep deprivation are responsible for functions such as energy metabolism, hormone reception and protein synthesis<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>. In a 2023 study, researchers in Brazil found that fruit flies that were sleep deprived showed overexpression mostly of genes that affected metabolism, glucose, triglyceride and levels of the hormone dopamine<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>.</p><h2>It’s brainwashing</h2><p>For decades, the main purpose of sleep was thought to be maintaining brain health. Babies and teenagers sleep for such long periods of time, according to this theory, because there is so much brain development going on at those stages.</p><p>It’s not just the amount of sleep we get that is important, however. Sleep quality, particularly the amount of deep sleep, might drastically improve memory consolidation. And researchers have found a way to artificially increase deep, or slow-wave, sleep in humans — by delivering acoustic stimulation in the form of soft pulses of ‘pink noise’ to a sleeping person through a headset. Unlike the familiar white noise, which contains equal parts of the sound spectrum, pink noise contains more low- than high-frequency sounds.</p><p>In a small study<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup>, half of the participants received pink-noise acoustic stimulation and the other half wore headsets playing a different sound pattern, as a control. Researchers monitored brain activity with an electroencephalogram and found that pink-noise recipients had increased slow-wave activity. Importantly, they also had increased memory retention the next day.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_50793218.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_50793218.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="Two women sitting at a table surrounded by laboratory equipment.

Overall, Zee says, those that had pink-noise stimulation performed almost 30% better on memory tests than did those who listened to the control sounds.</p><p>Sleep is thought to not only help memories to take root, but also clear the brain of anything superfluous. Neuroscientist Maiken Nedergaard at the University of Rochester in New York, has a theory of how that cleaning occurs.</p><p>In 2013, Nedergaard and her colleagues reported<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup> that one benefit of sleep might be the removal of neurotoxins from the brain. The brain’s glymphatic system is made up of what Nedergaard describes as a “doughnut-shaped tunnel” surrounding cerebral vessels that create a cell wall. In this tunnel, cerebrospinal fluid flows with interstitial fluid to remove proteins, including amyloid-β and tau, which are thought to have a role in Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>“What we showed is, every time the heart beats, you have the arteries expanding and moving the vessel wall and putting fluid into the brain,” she says. “It’s a very beautiful biological system.” The paper reported that the interstitial space in mice grew by about 60% when they were sleeping. This drastically increased the amount of exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid as well as the rate of clearance of amyloid-β.</p><p>This finding sent Nedergaard and her colleagues searching for the drivers of that fluid clearance. The heart is one way, but Nedergaard says it’s more likely to account for movement of fluid than its clearance. In February<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup>, she and her colleagues reported that norepinephrine, which induces vasoconstriction, is the main promoter of clearance through “spontaneous, rhythmic constriction and dilation of arteries”. And regular oscillations of norepinephrine levels in the brain occur during deep, slow-wave sleep.</p><p>“Sleep is the period where our brain doesn’t just rest, but it does all the housekeeping,” Nedergaard says. “The glial cells are the cleaning crew that come in when the brain is quiet and do the things that other organs do when we are awake. It’s a function of the brain that’s probably not compatible with wakefulness.”</p><p>Nedergaard’s theory about protein clearance during sleep has recently been disputed as an incomplete explanation, especially because it pertains to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00962-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00962-y" data-track-category="body text link">link between sleep and Alzheimer’s disease</a>. The most prominent challenge to her ideas has come from biophysicist Nick Franks at Imperial College London. In May 2024, Franks and his colleagues used a fluorescent tracer to show that brain clearance is actually reduced during sleep<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_50793224.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_50793224.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="Two white and yellow tubular structures with tentacles at the bottom, hang from a green plant" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_50793224.jpg"><figcaption><p><span>Even simple organisms such as <i>Hydra vulgaris</i> show a need for sleep.</span><span>Credit: Kim Taylor/naturepl.com</span></p></figcaption></picture></figure><p>Nedergaard defends her version of what happens during sleep. Franks, she contends, “misdefines brain clearance as the movement of a tracer from one location to another within the brain. In contrast, the correct definition of brain clearance is that the tracer must exit the brain entirely. This is akin to moving garbage from the kitchen to the bedroom and calling the house clean.”</p><p>Franks disputes this characterization and maintains that his results directly contradict Nedergaard’s. “We showed that tracer injected into the brain was retained at higher concentrations during sleep, compared to waking — in other words, less was cleared,” he says, adding that his data “cannot be reconciled with her conclusions about clearance during sleep”.</p><p>Moreover, Nedergaard says that her ideas about clearance align with a well-established theory about why people sleep — the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. This says, in essence, that sleep is the price that animals pay for brain plasticity. During the day, the brain consumes energy, takes in noise and other stimulus, and spends time learning. During sleep, brain activity is reduced, and cells are restored.</p><h2>It does a body good</h2><p>It’s intuitive to view sleep as a function of the central nervous system. But that can’t be entirely the case, because creatures without central nervous systems also show sleep-like behaviour.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/outlooks-1.16103" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00964-w/d41586-025-00964-w_16290238.jpg"><p>More from Nature Outlooks</p></a></article><p>In 2020, researchers found that hydra, a freshwater polyp with no brain, also enter a languid state at night<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup>. These creatures show a need for sleep homeostasis as well, resting longer the day after being sleep deprived.</p><p>There is other evidence that sleep’s function goes beyond the central nervous system. Sleep promotes the release of certain hormones, for example. This process has various physiological effects, including lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Inadequate sleep can slow production of beneficial hormones, including cortisol and growth hormone. And the hormone melatonin can suppress breast cancer cells’ ability to proliferate, survive, spread and develop resistance to drugs<sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup>.</p><p>Zee and her colleagues’ study on the impact of slow-wave sleep found that people who listened to pink noise had lower spikes in morning cortisol levels and improved parasympathetic activity — slowing of the heart rate and lowering of the blood pressure. During sleep, parasympathetic activity gives the cardiovascular system a much-needed break. “We know that if you don’t sleep well, your heart rate and blood pressure go up and you are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease,” Zee says.</p><p>Despite myriad studies, there is still no consensus on why sleep is needed for survival. But the consequences of not getting enough of this fundamental physical process bear out the importance of continuing to seek answers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My calendar is a true nightmare. I travel a lot, some of it for my job, some of it for fun, and some of it because I’ve been managing a long distance relationship for years. Traveling a lot means it’s always hard for your loved ones or coworkers to know what time zone you’re in or when you’re on a plane. Managing a relationship across timezones means having to do constant mental math that is way harder than it needs to be. And because I don’t have an assistant, I’ve become frustrated with double entry of flights, trains, blockers for boarding flights or traveling to the airport, and so on.</p>
<p>As someone who travels a lot, it’s also one of those things where statistically speaking, the chances of me being on a plane whenever some newsworthy event happens is higher than for the average person. I want my wife, friends, coworkers to know what flights I’m on and what cities I’m in. I’ve survived one terror attack, nearly dodged two others and a mass shooting. It’s one of those things where I want to make sure people who care about me can check in easily to see where I am.</p>
<p>The thing is, calendar systems suck. All of them. The standards are a holdover from two computing generations ago, the frontend ecosystem is a mess of rent-seeking monthly subscription mobile apps with dubious features, and the user experience for most systems is pretty much terrible. Just as an example: if I book a flight, my email provider makes a calendar entry, but it often misses the connection flight or gets the timezones wrong, and even if it doens’t fail, it doesn’t make me the organizer, meaning I can’t share or modify it. The entire calendar ecosystem is a nightmare.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that in the entire space there’s really two good products: Google Calendar has basically captured the market for diary entries, and Facebook Events would be an admirable tool if it wasn’t attached to a company and service fuelled with undistilled demon blood. I’m trying to break off of big tech as much as I can, so I needed some kind of solution.</p>
<p>So I built my own. Kind of. I intend this to be the first part of a long-running series of how I’m building my own tech to regain control of my data.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>My core requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow events to show up as blockers in my work calendar;</li>
<li>Allow my wife to subscribe to the calendar;</li>
<li>Enter events at most once;</li>
<li>Allow editing from multiple devices;</li>
<li>Fully control my own data;</li>
<li>Cannot solve problem by sharing work calendar with my wife.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import .ics attachments from email;</li>
<li>Import .ics over HTTP from my <a href="https://emilygorcenski.com/post/lingoda-review/">language school</a> calendar;</li>
<li>Import data automatically from my self-hosted flight tracker, <a href="https://github.com/johanohly/AirTrail/">Airtrail</a>;</li>
<li>Color code events in my work calendar;</li>
<li>Allow some events to be flagged as private for my work calendar;</li>
<li>Refresh frequently;</li>
<li>Use any front end.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="previous-solution">Previous solution</h2>
<p>The big problem with existing calendar sharing solutions is that they require everyone to be on a common platform, like the broader Gmail or Outlook.com ecosystems, or share accounts in the same environment, like an Exchange environment, in order to have full functionality. The two common workarounds for this is either to publish a calendar in a “read only” mode by serving iCal data over HTTP, or to email iCal .ics files to recipients over email.</p>
<p>For my beta version of this calendar system I chose the former: I would host an .ics file on my website under a public but secret and unguessable URL, or actually multiple URLs for different use cases. I could then share the link or subscribe to it with my work account. To populate the calendar, I started writing out events in YAML and would generate a URL for each person I wanted to share it with:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I’d take this YAML file and wrote a small script to re-serialize it as an ICS file in my CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>This worked for a while, but it got unweildly. Hand-writing YAML is fine for prototyping, but at scale it was too frequent that I would make mistakes, and this was a lot of work for what should be a fairly low-effort exercise. I needed a new solution.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>For my new solution, I knew I would need to move away from my static solution and would need to run something hosted. Even though that would cost me more, I’ve come to accept that moving off of big tech will eventually require me to host my own solutions for a variety of needs. So I decided to jump into the world of CalDAV.</p>
<p>CalDAV is an extension of the WebDAV distributed authoring specification with specific functionality relevant to calendar applications. WebDAV was an idea that emerged from the 90s, when web development was still very synchronous and web development felt more like software development. Nevertheless, it’s one of the few available solutions for running a self-hosted calendaring system.</p>
<p>Aside: This is an area begging for disruption. Just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CalDAV_and_CardDAV_implementations">this list of CalDAV and CardDAV implementations</a> on Wikipedia. It’s bleak out there, folks. No wonder why data aggregators under the guise of third party tools like Calendly and Doodle are so popular. The landscape is flat awful. Anyways.</p>
<p>With a CalDAV server, I can connect to it with frontend apps of my choosing from multiple devices. This will allow me to view and manage events from my laptop, phone, or whatever. But few CalDAV servers allow authentication-free subscriptions to the calendar with any ease. So I’ll need to have a script that regularly polls the server, extracts the events, and publishes them as an iCal file through my website.</p>
<p>Moreover, I’ll want to connect to various other data sources, some of which I control and others I do not. These include my flight tracker (self-hosted), my email (paid hosting), and my language school (external). The flow that I’ll build will look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>poll data sources for events</li>
<li>publish events programmatically to CalDAV</li>
<li>fetch all events from CalDAV and write to an .ics file</li>
<li>serve .ics file over HTTP</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, I’ve designed an architecture that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://emilygorcenski.com/photo-gallery/writing/cal-arch.png" alt="Calendar system architecture"></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-baïkal">Setting up Baïkal</h2>
<p>My tool of choice was <a href="https://sabre.io/baikal/">Baïkal</a>, a lightweight, self-hostable CalDAV (and CardDAV) server for managing calendars and contacts. Setting up the service was easy with Docker Compose:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span>services</span>:
  <span>baikal</span>:
    <span>image</span>: <span>ckulka/baikal:0.9.5</span>
    <span>restart</span>: <span>always</span>
    <span>ports</span>:
      - <span>"XXXX:80"</span>
    <span>volumes</span>:
      - <span>/mnt/baikal/data:/var/www/baikal/config</span>
      - <span>/mnt/baikal/data:/var/www/baikal/Specific</span>

<span>volumes</span>:
  <span>config</span>:
  <span>data</span>:
</code></pre></div><p>You can configure Baïkal to use MySQL, but it also works fine with SQLLite, and this simplifies its administration. Set the port and modify the local volume if you want and start this with a simple <code>docker compose up -d</code>.</p>
<p>To make this available to the web, I’m running an nginx reverse proxy with a pretty basic configuration:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>server {
    server_name MYDOMAIN;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:XXXX;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /.well-known/caldav {
       return 301 https://MYDOMAIN/dav.php;
    }

    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
}
</code></pre><p>Of course, I used Let’s Encrypt to get this served securely, but I omitted this for simplicity. If you want to do the same, replace <code>MYDOMAIN</code> with whatever your subdomain/domain is.</p>
<p>One note: you’ll notice the <code>location</code> directive that performs a 301 redirect to <code>dav.php</code>. This <code>/.well-known/caldav</code> redirect is needed if you want to add this calendar to your iPhone or Mac calendar apps. When eventually setting up your calendar on MacOS or iOS, you’ll want to use manual settings, not automatic (and not advanced—I’m not sure why I couldn’t get the advanced settings to work when the manual settings worked fine).</p>
<p>I set up DNS and used <code>certbot</code> to generate a Let’s Encrypt certificate for my domain and it updated the nginx config file automatically.</p>
<p>Once this is up and running, I was able to navigate to my domain in my browser to set up an admin account. From there, I configured a user for myself and created a calendar. Theoretically, I could create multiple calendars if I chose to, for instance if I wanted to have a special calendar for travel or whatnot. But I didn’t find that necessary, as my goal is at-most-once data entry. To get the URL for my calendar, I had to navigate through to my user page, click the “Calendars” button, and then found it under the little info icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://emilygorcenski.com/photo-gallery/writing/baikal.png" alt="Baikal admin page showing calendar icon"></p>
<p>I hooked this up to my iOS and MacOS default calendar apps and everything went swimmingly.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-event-taxonomy">Setting up an event taxonomy</h2>
<p>I’ll take a little detour here for another rant. The <a href="https://icalendar.org/RFC-Specifications/iCalendar-RFC-5545/">iCalendar specification</a> includes a provision for <a href="https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-1-2-categories.html">an optional <code>CATEGORIES</code> property</a> for the <code>EVENT</code> component. The intention of this property appears to be to provide the ability for a user to categorize an event, such as an appointment, meeting, etc. This would be a really useful feature in a calendar frontend; I could easily search for and find a doctor appointment in a busy week, for instance. However, most frontends and calendar apps simply do not implement this feature in any way. MacOS Calendar does not. iOS Calendar does not. Google Calendar does not. Every tool I’ve used has completely ignored this otherwise useful field.</p>
<p>I want to use this field.</p>
<p>But there’s an issue with free text taxonimization: it sucks. It’s really hard to keep it consistent. It’s really hard to make it contextual meaningful while also being unambiguous, let alone universally understandable. So I need to do something about this.</p>
<p>Since I’m going to need to write some python scripts to extract calendar events anyways, it makes sense that I could try to encode these event types in a data model. So I wrote a little data model for this using python enums, an excerpt of which is here, forgive the random German:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> enum <span>import</span> Enum

</code></pre></div><p>There’s no real reason for breaking things down like this, except that it helps conceptually organize the types of events. Moreover, I do implement a little bit of hidden business logic: double-digit enum values are private by default for my work calendar.</p>
<p>Building this taxonomy will help me to implement an <em>ad hoc</em> solution to the problem described before: it will help me make events more searchable or visible at a glance for front-ends that allow you to color code events.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-and-sharing-the-calendar">Compiling and sharing the calendar</h2>
<p>I’ve said a few times that I want to do “at most once” data entry. This means that there are many events I don’t want to have to enter data for at all, such as scheduled classes with my online language school (which hosts an ICS file of my classes) or events extracted from my email. But to automate getting this data I need to poll these endpoints, as they don’t really publish events when new ones are added or old ones are deleted. This means I’ll need to write a little python script and hook it up to a cron job.</p>
<p>The python script needs a few components:</p>
<ul>
<li>a component for fetching events from my email over IMAP;</li>
<li>a component for extracting events from my flight tracker’s API;</li>
<li>a component for fetching events from my language school’s hosted ICS files;</li>
<li>a component for pushing all of these events to Baïkal; and</li>
<li>a component for fetching all events from Baïkal and re-serializing them to one or more sharable ICS files published undiscoverably on the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IMAP part is really nice, this provides Google Calendar-like functionality to this system. If someone emails me a calendar invite, this script fetches it and adds it to my calendar automatically.</p>
<p>This is a lot of code, most of it ad hoc, I won’t share it here all but it’s not so hard to write. What I will share is the entrypoint script for the cron job:</p>

<h2 id="sharing-my-events-with-on-my-work-calendar">Sharing my events with on my work calendar</h2>
<p>The whole point of this exercise wasn’t just that <em>I</em> could see events, but also that any events I put in my calendar will block my work calendar and be visible to coworkers so they know if I’m on a flight or traveling in another city. To do that, I need to copy these events to my work calendar.</p>
<p>This is a bit of an irony, because this whole exercise started when I was trying to <em>reduce</em> my dependency on Google Calendar. However, in fairness, Google Calendar is a choice of my workplace, and it’s not something <em>I</em> depend on outside of work. I’m not thrilled to give the data to Google, but at least I can walk away from them easily if I choose to.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I’m using Google Script Engine and a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync">this open source script</a>. In all honesty, I struggle with how this Javascript code is organized, but it gets the job done with minimal difficulty. I did modify this to read from the calendar <code>CATEGORIES</code> property and color code my calendar. The result means it’s really easy to parse my calendar at a glance—obviously I’m only sharing a small snippet of non-sensitive information.</p>
<p><img src="https://emilygorcenski.com/photo-gallery/writing/cal-colors.png" alt="Color coded blocks on a calendar showing a conference in green, a meeting in blue, and a flight in lavender"></p>
<p>I have this Google Script running on 30 minute intervals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I’ve been hacking around with this system for the last 6 months or so and making small tweaks and additions here or there in the meanwhile. I have to say, it works really great. The lastest update I made was integrating Airtrail via API. Now, when I book a flight, I enter the data into my flight tracker and within 15 minutes it’s added to my calendar, and within the hour it’s automatically copied to my work calendar. This is a huge quality of life improvement that saves me a ton of time in logistics management with my complicated travel requirements.</p>
<p>The overall cost of this system is pretty minimal. I’d imagine you can set this up and run it easily from a NAS at home if you want, but I opt to keep my data safely protected in Switzerland, so I subscribe to about $100 monthly of server time to run my websites and all my integrations. That’s a bit overkill—I can definitely optimize these costs and will do so over time, but the ease of getting everything set up on a docker host in a VM instance on a hosting provider was worth the extra money. And I’m easily saving $100 monthly in time just for making managing my schedule easier.</p>
<p>It’s not a perfect solution, but damn if it’s better than anything else I’ve tried yet.</p>
<p>Let me know if you ever try something similar!</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 10 Apr 2025</p>
<p>
  One thing I love about Python is how it comes with its very own
  built-in zen.  In moments of tribulations, when I am wrestling with
  crooked code and tangled thoughts, I often find solace in its
  timeless wisdom.  Here's a glimpse of the clarity it provides:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>python3 -m this | grep e-</kbd>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Indeed, there is one and only one <em>obvious</em> way to write the
  number 1 in Python, like so:
</p>
<pre><samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>--(...==...)</kbd>
1</samp></pre>
<p>
  You may, quite naturally, place several ones adjacently to produce
  larger integers:
</p>
<pre><samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>--(...==...)--(...==...)</kbd>
2</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  And so on, ad infinitum, or until your heap collapses like a poorly
  made soufflé.  Now, the "pre-decrement operator" at the beginning is
  entirely optional, much like the plus sign when you write "+5
  biscuits" in a letter to your grandmother.  It's not wrong, but it
  is unnecessary and, frankly, a bit pretentious.  So unless you want
  to look peculiar to your colleagues, you would likely want to adopt
  a more conventional style, such as this:
</p>
<pre><samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)</kbd>
3</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Now, all computer programs are, in some sense, just a long, earnest
  stream of bits.  It is currently fashionable to bundle these bits
  into groups of eight and write them as integers.  Following this
  trend, we can compute absolutely anything that is computable as long
  as we know exactly what integers to write.  Now, I wouldn't want to
  bore you with the finer details of computer science – not in
  this day and age – fascinating as they may be.  I trust you
  are quite capable of drawing the rest of the
  f... well, <em>feathered</em>, nocturnal bird.  Once you've grasped
  the basics, a typical first Python program might look something like
  this:
</p>
<pre><code>exec('%c'*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))%(((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...))--(...==...),*(((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),)*((...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))**((...==...)--(...==...))--((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)),((...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))*((...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...)--(...==...))--(...==...)))</code></pre>

  Now you might be wondering if this is <em>really</em> the way one
  ought to write production Python code.  Isn't it too much trouble to
  type those dots over and over again?  Not if you remap your
  <kbd>tab</kbd> key to type three dots, of course.  But I understand
  not everyone likes to remap their keys like this.  In particular,
  there exists a peculiar species of mammal known to remap their
  <kbd>tab</kbd> key to parentheses.  They claim it leads to
  enlightenment.  Such enlightened living forms may find the following
  program more convenient to type:
</p>
<pre><code>exec('%c'*((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))%(((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--(()==()),*(((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),)*((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--(()==())))</code></pre>
<p>
  This program is functionally equivalent to the earlier one.  But
  Python isn't meant for enlightenment.  It's meant for getting things
  done.  And to get things done, code should be readable,
  maintainable, and ideally not resemble an ancient summoning ritual.
  That's why I personally prefer the earlier style, the one with the
  ellipses.  It gracefully avoids the disconcerting void that lurks
  within the parentheses.  After all, programs must be written for
  people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

  Finally, I must emphasise that you should never deploy code like
  this in production.  If you plan to use something like this for your
  production CGI scripts, I implore you to add some logging.  When
  dung inevitably collides with the fan, you'll be immensely glad you
  put some useful logs amidst your business logic.  With that little
  advice, I'll end this brief distraction from reading endless
  arguments on Internet forums.  Happy coding, and may your
  parentheses stay balanced (and may your ellipses be the punctuation
  that ...

  For the enlightened folks who are offended by the penultimate

Next it may slip into your bloodstream and flow into your heart, or past the blood-brain barrier. Most of us inhale some of these tiny particles every day. But inhaling enough can turn the act of breathing into an existential hazard, prompting or worsening asthma, COPD, respiratory infections, and permanent lung damage. In the heart, the specks can trigger heart disease, heart attacks, and most of the cardiovascular disorders you can think of. Air pollution is also associated with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5332196/">depression and </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4373600/">anxiety</a>, and with higher <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30626">rates</a> of suicide. It can trigger strokes and is linked to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2827124">dementia</a> or—even at average levels in this country—<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000207871">Parkinson’s disease</a>.</p></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These particles <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11654-3">can also cross the placenta</a>, where they can reduce an infant’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12199-021-00995-5">lung function</a> before birth. A pre-polluted baby is also more likely to arrive <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/pediatrics/divisions/environmental-pediatrics/research/policy-initiatives/air-pollution-preterm-births">prematurely</a>, and at a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935122014918">lower weight</a>. Exposure to bad air in utero is associated with a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP9509">higher risk of autism</a>, and exposure in childhood has been linked to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10248">behavioral</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32889949/">cognitive</a> problems, including lower IQ. A person’s lungs can develop until age 25, and as Alison Lee, a pulmonologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, put it to me, “once you’ve lost lung function, you can’t get it back.” Persistent exposure to air pollution can cause permanent harm, creating health problems for children and setting them up to become sicker adults.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It’s hard to picture a person dropping dead from air pollution, yet it happens all the time. In the United States, particulate matter is estimated to kill more than twice as many people as vehicular accidents do—in total, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/identifying-sources-deadly-air-pollution-us">some 100,000</a> to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/study-air-pollution-causes-200000-early-deaths-each-year-in-the-us-0829">200,000</a> people a year, as an underlying factor of chronic disease or by way of heart attacks, asthma attacks, and other sudden events. Even as air quality in America has improved, researchers have found that relatively low concentrations of particulate matter can cause major hazards.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">All of this stems from a toxic and mostly invisible danger, largely the product of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/as-wildfires-rage-the-pyrocene-age-is-upon-us?sref=OVk78rkt">burning things</a> for fuel and letting the remnant drift into the air and then into us—which is what happens unless the government regulates that process. The Trump administration, however, has shown little interest in doing so. Through new policies and aggressive cuts, the administration is taking steps that will encourage more pollution while muffling the science that shows the harms. The very air that Americans breathe will likely become less safe.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">So far, the EPA has announced that it will pursue <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history">a suite of rollbacks</a> of environmental rules, among them a Joe Biden–era update to standards <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-path-forward-national-air-quality-standards-particulate-matter">for particulate matter</a> that were meant to be fully in force by 2032 and that the Biden EPA <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-finalizes-stronger-standards-harmful-soot-pollution-significantly-increasing">projected</a> would, in that year alone, prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 cases of asthma, reaping up to $46 billion in health benefits. It also plans to reassess a rule limiting the amount of airborne mercury and arsenic that power plants can release. In a statement <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-path-forward-national-air-quality-standards-particulate-matter">announcing</a> one of these rollbacks, the EPA said that the U.S. has already made major gains in air quality, implying that these are enough. In response to a request for comment, an agency spokesperson told me that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s priority is “clean air, land, and water for EVERY American.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The air in the U.S. certainly is cleaner than it was when industrial air pollution billowed into the skies unmitigated. Over the past 25 years alone, particulate air pollution in the country has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2023/#introduction">dropped</a> by more than 30 percent. Yet at least one in three Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246729103/unhealthy-dangerous-air-hurts-130-million-americans">lives</a> in a place where the air is still a health hazard. The particulate-matter standard that Zeldin intends to roll back is still nearly twice as high as the limit the World Health Organization recommends to protect health.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Rolling back rules will take time, but America’s air quality could worsen in the interim. The EPA told businesses last month that they can simply <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/climate/epa-air-pollution-exemption-mercury-coal-ash.html">email the agency</a> if they want an exemption from certain pollution regulations and that “the president will make a decision.” However they address those pleas, this opens a back door. The recent cuts to EPA personnel almost certainly mean that enforcement will suffer too. Meanwhile, worsening wildfire seasons, fueled by climate warming, are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/02/air-pollution-life-cost-great-recession/677523/">reversing</a> decades of air-quality progress in this country. And ignoring and even stoking climate change, as Donald Trump’s administration is doing, will produce worse wildfire seasons. The country’s slide back toward its more polluted past “will become a steeper trajectory,” Joan Casey, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Washington whose work helped expose the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39585704/">connection</a> between wildfire smoke and dementia risk, told me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The administration’s cuts to scientific research mean, too, that the impact of its deregulation may never be fully understood. In recent months, the government has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-stops-reporting-air-quality-levels/">pulled down</a> some air-quality data and canceled grants; it also plans to dissolve a whole <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/climate/trump-eliminates-epa-science.html">EPA division</a> dedicated to studying how the environment affects public health. These actions create a sort of purposeful naivete: You can’t regulate what you can’t prove is harmful, and you can’t prove harm without research.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And you certainly can’t solve for what you don’t yet know is a problem. Newer findings about how air pollution may addle a body—by worsening mental health or triggering more cases of neurodegenerative disease, for example—haven’t yet been included in the EPA’s risk-benefit assessments of air-quality regulations, Casey added. “I think often we’re underestimating the true impact,” she said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I called Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, she had just learned that the Trump administration had canceled her grant to study how impacts of climate change, including air pollution, alter cognitive function in aging people. (Earlier this year, too, she was dismissed from her appointment to the EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, along with the rest of the panel.) Even so, the basics on air pollution have been studied enough that Kioumourtzoglou knows how current rollbacks will affect Americans: There will be “more heart attacks, more respiratory adverse health outcomes for sure,” she told me. “Our cognitive functions are going to be worse—the progression of Alzheimer’s, the progression of Parkinson’s.” Pollution-related depression and anxiety may go up. Even slightly increasing the risk or rate of any of these at the population level can diminish quality of life and, ultimately, productivity, she said. A sicker country is a poorer one.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Compared with smoking, for example, an individual’s risk of inhaling a dangerous amount of air pollution and then having their health affected because of it is relatively small, she told me—but “the problem is that few people smoke, and everybody breathes.” If a portion of the population’s cognitive function is diminished, even a little bit, the overall impact is enormous.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Kioumourtzoglou wonders, too, how much further the Trump administration will push the idea that air pollution should not be a concern to Americans. When the Heritage Foundation published a report in December that made the radical case that no definitive link exists between air pollution and poor public-health outcomes, she disregarded it. But after watching <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/trump-executive-orders-project-2025/">other Heritage Foundation goals</a> be enacted, she is concerned that its rationale could be taken seriously by the current administration. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.heritage.org/climate/report/air-quality-and-public-health-there-link">The Heritage report</a> attempts to cast doubt on the validity of decades of science by, in part, arguing that studies linking air pollution to health effects fail to prove causation, because they’re not randomized or controlled. (After this story was published, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the director of Heritage’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment, said that the report was intended to guide federal policies and that it showed that “no causal link between particulates and heart attacks and deaths.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This is an attack not just on air-pollution research but on an entire scientific approach. Most public-health research is observational by necessity, because exposing people to air pollution in a lab setting to see how sick they get, say, wouldn’t be ethical. Instead, scientists gather data from already-exposed populations and try to parse out how different variables affected people’s health. Over decades, researchers have developed biostatistical methods to determine causal relationships from large groups of studies.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When EPA scientists and regulators link a pollutant and a health outcome, “they’re not making that assessment on one or two or three studies. It’s decades of scientific publications,” Corwin Zigler, a biostatistician at Brown University who served on an EPA scientific advisory panel on air pollution under the Biden administration, told me. He wasn’t surprised by the logic behind the Heritage Foundation report: The leader of the previous Trump administration’s air-pollution advisory panel had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://revealnews.org/article/trumps-air-pollution-adviser-clean-air-saves-no-lives/">begun to sow doubt</a> about basic air-pollution research. In response, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine undertook a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26612/advancing-the-framework-for-assessing-causality-of-health-and-welfare-effects-to-inform-national-ambient-air-quality-standard-reviews">major review</a> of the way the EPA assesses causal relationships, and though it recommended that the EPA’s process be more transparent, it found its methods scientifically robust. Zigler said he has no doubt that particulate matter is causing harm at current levels in the United States: “That’s the scientific consensus. That takes very seriously all of the limitations of any given scientific study.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Studies about how entire populations are harmed by air pollution are framed in probabilities and percentages, but they represent a multitude of individuals for whom daily living has been made tangibly worse. For Lee, the Mount Sinai pulmonologist, work became personal a few years ago, when her son, now 5, began having asthma attacks that would send him to the emergency room. Asthma is a common-enough ailment that an attack might seem like a routine and manageable health issue. But anyone who’s had a severe one will tell you differently. Over years of reporting on air pollution, I’ve had asthma attacks described to me as feeling like someone is stepping with their full weight on your ribcage, or as though you are suddenly a fish out of water, suffocating on land. It’s a traumatic event. Lee, knowing what she does about air pollution, decided to move her family from New York City to the suburbs a year and a half ago; they haven’t been to the emergency room since.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Clearly, we know that where you live determines your health,” Lee told me, but few people can make a choice like she did, to upend their life to breathe cleaner air. The Trump administration is also cutting the programs intended to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/03/trump-environmental-justice/681958/">address exactly these geographic disparities, while working to make the air worse for everyone. </a>EPA Administrator Zeldin has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-path-forward-national-air-quality-standards-particulate-matter">said</a> these rollbacks are part of the administration’s plan to “unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.” But prosperity does not mean choking to death in one’s own home or depriving a child of cognitive capacity. Whatever wealth is promised here is narrowly disbursed at others’ expense.</p></section><div data-event-module="footer"><p><h3>About the Author</h3></p><div><address id="article-writer-0" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="1"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zoe-schlanger/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/u8S5JVOtiftKFSYJUPgPfsZK710=/468x9:2384x1925/120x120/media/img/authors/2023/10/Sten_SSENSE_ZoeSchlanger_18_hi_res_version/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zoe-schlanger/" data-label="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zoe-schlanger/" data-action="click author - name">Zoë Schlanger</a> is a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>.

<p>
  About three years ago, I set up a tiny <code>netcat</code> loop on
  one of my Debian servers to accept arbitrary connections from the
  Hacker News (HN) community.  The loop ran for 24 hours and did
  exactly three things whenever a client connected:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Send a simple <code>ok</code> message to the client.
  </li>
  <li>
    Close the connection immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make my terminal beep four times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  That's it!  It was a playful experiment in response to a thread
  about quirky, do-it-yourself alerting systems for friends and
  family.  See
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30146019#30146451">this
  HN thread</a> for the original discussion.  Here is the exact
  command I ran on my server:
</p>
<pre><code>while true; do (echo ok | nc -q 1 -vlp 8000 2&gt;&amp;1; echo; date -u) | tee -a beeper.log; for i in 1 2 3 4; do printf '\a'; sleep 1; done &amp; done</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code>nc</code> command closes the connection immediately after
  sending the <code>ok</code> message and runs an
  inner <code>for</code> loop in a background shell that
  asynchronously prints the bell character to the terminal four times.
  Meanwhile, the outer <code>while</code> command loops back quickly
  to run a new <code>nc</code> process, thus making this one-liner
  script instantly ready to accept the next incoming connection.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after I shared this, members of the HN community began
  connecting to the demo running on <code>susam.net:8000</code>.
  Anyone on the Internet could use any client of their choice to
  connect.  Here's how I explained it in the HN thread:
</p>
<blockquote>

    Now anytime someone connects to port 8000 of my system
    by <em>any</em> means, I will hear 4 beeps!  The other party can
    use <em>whatever client</em> they have to connect to port 8000 of
    my system, e.g., a web browser, <code>nc HOST
    8000</code>, <code>curl HOST:8000</code>, or even, <code>ssh HOST
    -p 8000</code>, <code>irssi -c HOST -p 8000</code>, etc.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the next 24 hours, I received over 4761 connections, each one
  triggering four beeps.  That's a total of 19044 terminal beeps
  echoing throughout the day!

  Now, 4761 isn't a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but it
  was still pretty cool to see people notice an obscure comment buried
  in a regular HN thread, act on it, and make my terminal beep
  thousands of time.

<p>
  At the end of the day, this was a fun experiment.  Pointless, but
  fun!  Computing isn't always about solving problems.  Sometimes,
  it's also about exploring quirky ideas.  The joy is in the
  exploration, and having others join in made it even more enjoyable.
  Activities like this keep computing fun for me!

The effects for this movie were originally being done at Richard Edlund's Boss films and nearly five months of miniature submarine construction was undertaken under the supervision of Greg Jein. The original methodology was to shoot all the models mounted on model movers with motion control and matte them into backgrounds shot separately. At some point during the testing phase, there was a falling out between the production and the visual effects facility over the look of the test shots and the entire project and the existing models were moved to ILM leaving them around three months to complete the 50 or so effects shots required to complete the movie.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr0fHNWqXQp5OhrONYtpTuF7WVoKGdGxA9Nvs03MDH8kxd5CdFw0fW-V6MPCmA1IN2vtIlZABS-8dhQRQjjrEsKr4v_LsE9PYoat4WBqzW-MeUgjMMHpQ-aBl-wPTgX0PN3WKA3j1cIyw/s1600/kg_red-october_002.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="1003" data-original-width="1455" height="440" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjr0fHNWqXQp5OhrONYtpTuF7WVoKGdGxA9Nvs03MDH8kxd5CdFw0fW-V6MPCmA1IN2vtIlZABS-8dhQRQjjrEsKr4v_LsE9PYoat4WBqzW-MeUgjMMHpQ-aBl-wPTgX0PN3WKA3j1cIyw/s640/kg_red-october_002.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

At ILM, due to the short deadline, it was decided to similarly shoot the models using motion control but for the most part in a smoke environment thus capturing the background at the same time. This was done to limit the amount of optical compositing that would otherwise be needed.</p><p>

The miniature submarine line up consisted of a 21 ft (6.4 m) and a 4 ft (1.2m) Red October model, a 9ft (2.7m) Kronolov sub, two 10ft (3m) dallas subs, a 2ft (0.6m) rescue submersible and a 6 ft (1.8m) torpedo.&nbsp; ILM then added an inbetween sized 11ft (3.3m) Red October, a bottom section of a 21ft Red October for some new shots that had been added and a 2ft (0,6m) torpedo.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh67vNFy8oxlGqKqEcR-dkGE5Ox8hMJ-YQhtpJXVjrTnquMhmOtHPAFcl8eQqwwfA8Z35eDQSsi104hWWsaaF3zVpJ1PIhRWtA1Xtz8xQUUmO60TWw5kUyfgVvSOpOEnOaXJkqzM7RDSIQ/s1600/Hunt_002.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="390" data-original-width="782" height="319" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh67vNFy8oxlGqKqEcR-dkGE5Ox8hMJ-YQhtpJXVjrTnquMhmOtHPAFcl8eQqwwfA8Z35eDQSsi104hWWsaaF3zVpJ1PIhRWtA1Xtz8xQUUmO60TWw5kUyfgVvSOpOEnOaXJkqzM7RDSIQ/s640/Hunt_002.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

Most of the time the larger red October model was mounted on a rigid pylon which allowed for motorised pitch and yaw action and was framed out of shot. The other models in shot were generally hung from a wire rig, developed by Tad Krzanowski originally for Batteries not included and also used for some of the submersible&nbsp; shots in the Abyss. This consisted of a 12 wires running down to one of 4 points on the model, 3 wires to each of the 4 mount points. The wires were controlled by something like the swash plate of a helicopter and allowed for yaw and pitch motion of the model. The 3 wires to each point plus gravity, effectively created a cross braced support and a relatively rigid structure. The models were hung from this rig which was mounted on a camera crane arm adapted for motion control that ran on a track that was atop a 25 foot (7.6m) long scaffold structure 12 ft high (3.6m). For a few shots the 250 pound (113kg) Red October model was also hung from this rig. The other relatively light weight models averaged 40 -45 pounds (18-20kg).</p><p>

A smaller 16ft long motion control track and crane was mounted on a mobile scaffold that could be re-positioned relatively easily. This was mostly used when a second submarine needed to be seen maneuvering in the background.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhc-XV08jteOqdhP2uPtpOAdl0uSBhtPIdpFH41xYUzVcHNbPkJ-1rl24XoVkud9p4zdBZZl2urhvidr29UdCxvr5e_jKcaRb_OyCXc3C2dPTte6CP09FUyYLt2Js6TdLzvrVrbakw2FAk/s1600/Hunt_003.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="390" data-original-width="768" height="325" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhc-XV08jteOqdhP2uPtpOAdl0uSBhtPIdpFH41xYUzVcHNbPkJ-1rl24XoVkud9p4zdBZZl2urhvidr29UdCxvr5e_jKcaRb_OyCXc3C2dPTte6CP09FUyYLt2Js6TdLzvrVrbakw2FAk/s640/Hunt_003.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

One of the tricks to getting the smoke to look like it was deep underwater was to light a curtain of smoke in the background. These lights were on dimmers and as the subs moved through the space the background lights would be slowly faded up and then down as they entered and left the frame. Without this the background density would be too bright. The lighting also had to be very soft and indirect as obvious delineated shafts of light would not be correct for the deep ocean. Each shot was a very difficult and time consuming choreography of moving models, camera and dimming lights. The camera framing had to ensure that all the lights and support rigs were out of frame or at least hidden in the smoky gloom. This meant that the output was around 1 shot per day.</p><p>

In order to achieve the really close passes on the model mirrors were used in a periscope like arrangement, where the bulky Vistavision camera body would have grazed the hull. Various grades of Super frost filters were used on the lenses to enhance the murky underwater effect.</p><p>

The smoke was generated using a cracker system which is a method of atomising mineral oil using compressed air. A sensor would turn on and off the smoke automatically to maintain the right density.</p><p>

About 40 miniature rock spires were built to represent an underwater trench. These ranged from 3 ft (1m) to 22 ft (6.7m) high and could be arranged in various formations to suit each shot in the sequence.</p><p>

The miniature work in the film and the simulation of the underwater environment is pretty convincing however in a few shots, the optical compositing, particularly the shots concerned with the counter measures and the torpedo trail, is less successful.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7FxJEdIHtphtTN4pS2raj-X60W2A9txXLVaUP_c8IO6-Fhs4e3le67gFIEMnfRxqD2V6a3pYN4BWP1bNxFcrUtqlaJnstIpm_riD9TlSdUiDkIJsHrHXOfyV33Svv-hvZvsro5KN9-KM/s1600/DSRV_2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7FxJEdIHtphtTN4pS2raj-X60W2A9txXLVaUP_c8IO6-Fhs4e3le67gFIEMnfRxqD2V6a3pYN4BWP1bNxFcrUtqlaJnstIpm_riD9TlSdUiDkIJsHrHXOfyV33Svv-hvZvsro5KN9-KM/s1600/DSRV_2.jpg"></a></p>

One other miniature of note is the Russian Bear bomber aircraft, seen in one really quick shot flying over the ocean. It looks to me as if it is supported at its tail which is just out of shot, and filmed against a real sky and ocean, possibly from the deck of a boat or a truck driving along a coast road.

Haiku, aimed at people who want to be able to write simple
programs to get stuff done, but never had anyone around teach them. Years ago,
I started teaching myself and am an active developer. It's my turn to give back.</p><p>All of these lessons are distributed under a Creative Commons license which

by all means <a href="https://discuss.haiku-os.org/users/darkwyrm/">contact me</a>.</p><p>If you're a fan of the lessons and want to show appreciation or to have a copy of it on your desk while you work your way through, now you have a chance to have a high quality copy, and if you've been sitting on the fence about it, read a lesson or two and then decide for yourself. A hard copy of all of these lessons, compiled and further polished, can be found at the link below. Enjoy!</p><p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/search/?adult_audience_rating=00&amp;contributor=Jon+Yoder">Learning to Program with Haiku at Lulu.com</a></p><h2>Lesson 1</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to learn to program for Haiku (or something else) but
never had the money or the chance? Has something else gotten in the way?
This is quite an opportunity for someone who wants to learn to code. To
kick things off, here's the first one.</p><h2>Lesson 2</h2><h2>Lesson 3</h2><p>In this lesson, we examine the different types of data we can use, a more
in-depth look at how to print to the screen, and more!</p><h2>Lesson 4: If, For, And, Not, Or</h2><p>Decision-making and repeating instructions are on the agenda for this one,
expanding the repetoire of basic skills for writing code.</p><h2>Lesson 5: Arrays, Strings, and Pointers</h2><p>This lesson marks the end of the first unit and is somewhere around
halfway from complete neophyte to writing -- and understanding -- our
first program for Haiku which uses windows and buttons.</p><h2>Unit Review: 1 - 5</h2><h2>Lesson 6: More Loops and Conditions</h2><p>Here marks the beginning of the second unit in my series, "Learning to
Program With Haiku." Lesson #6 expands on our knowledge of loops and
decision-making constructs.</p><h2>Lesson 7: Losing My Memory</h2><p>This one covers two major topics: memory management and binary math,
nothing terribly exciting, but really useful and necessary nonetheless</p><h2>Lesson 8</h2><h2>Lesson 9</h2><h2>Unit Review: 6 - 9</h2><h2>Lesson 10: More Pointers and the Command Line</h2><p>Now we're starting to tie up loose ends before moving on to just C++. In
this lesson, we learn more about pointers and kinda-sorta pointers called
references, and we examine the basics of getting information from the
command line.</p><h2>Lesson 11: More Data Structures and Types</h2><p>This time around, we will be examining some important kinds of data
structures and ways to create custom data types, a critical stepping
stone in getting to understanding the Haiku API. This is the last C / C++
lesson -- the rest will be C++ only. A couple more lessons and we'll
finally be ready to write GUI programs for Haiku!</p><h2>Lesson 12: OOPs I Did It Again!</h2><p>This lesson introduces us to the wonderful world of C++ and Object
Oriented Programming. It's not terribly code-heavy, so this might be a good
time to look over past lessons to make sure you understand concepts pretty
well -- it only gets bigger from here. :-)</p><h2>Lesson 13: Programming With Class(es)</h2><p>Today we'll be diving headlong into the murky depths of C++ programming:
classes and inheritance -- struct's with fancy tricks aplenty. It's also
our last lesson before writing our first windowed Haiku program, so get
ready and study well. Enjoy!</p><h2>Unit Review: 10 - 13</h2><h2>Lesson 14: Our First GUI Program</h2><p>It's about time: our first program which does more than print stuff to the
Terminal! Now the real fun begins!</p><h2>Lesson 15: The Haiku API at 10,000 Feet</h2><p>Lesson 15 delves further into what writing basic applications are all
about, looking at the API and its organization and focusing on an
essential: messaging. Also included in this lesson are the finished
sources for those who don't want to mess around with typing the project
out.</p><h2>Lesson 16: Locked and Overloaded</h2><p>This lesson takes a break from hacking the Haiku API to learn a few C++
language concepts needed to continue progress as an aspiring developer.
Function overloading and operator overloading are examined in detail.</p><h2>Lesson 17: What's on the Menu</h2><p>We are back to learning about hacking on the Haiku GUI after taking a short
C++ language break. Today's topic? Menus. Also in this lesson is some
expansion of what we know about messaging and BViews.</p><h2>Lesson 18: Working With Lists</h2><p>We're starting to get closer to the end of this Learning to Program series.
After toying with menus and interface colors in the last lesson, we apply
some of the concepts used with menus to get the hang of using list boxes
and discover along the way a few bizarre sports that really exist. Games
people play. Sheesh.</p><h2>Lesson 19: Resources and Pictures</h2><p>Ten years ago when I first started to learn to write code using BeOS, I had
a lot of questions that I couldn't any documentation to give me the
answers. Luckily, there was the Be Code Talk mailing list and kindhearted
members of the community, like David Sowsy (Animaxo, Vesa Accepted).
Resources are one of those things that eluded me. Eventually I figured them
out, but Lesson 19 lays some of it out in plain conversation.</p><h2>Lesson 20: All About Storage</h2><p>Moving on from exploring the Interface Kit, we turn our attention to the
Storage Kit in this lesson. We take a look at the kit from a broad
perspective and also begin using some of its many of the classes. We take
a break from writing GUI applications and, instead, write a console
directory-listing program using C++.</p><h2>Lesson 21: Reading and Writing Files</h2><p>This lesson continues with delving into the Storage Kit,
reading and writing files. We also start writing code for
the final project of the Learning to Program With Haiku
series which will be developed over the course of several lessons.</p><h2>Lesson 22: Designing a GUI</h2><p>Usability is one of my pet topics. Although less so now that in years past, it is all-too-often ignored or not given enough priority. This lesson scratches the surface from a developer's point of view. I'm no usability expert, but I do know a thing or two. This lesson is a must-read for any budding developer, and by the end of it, we will have a good real-world program to show off which is just shy of being ready for a release.</p><h2>Lesson 23: Polish and Packaging Our Project</h2><p>This lesson finishes up the project that the last two have been about:
HaikuFortune, a program which randomly chooses and displays a fortune in a
window. It's not a very complicated one, but it exemplifies a reasonably
well-coded real-world project. Although it was code complete as of the end
of Lesson 22, it was not finished, missing icons and other resources. This
concludes the project with adding resources, a basic discussion on source
code licensing, and packaging a program for Haiku.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This also concludes the Learning to Program With Haiku lesson series. It's
been a good run. Rest assured, though, that this is not the last lesson on
Haiku programming that I will write. This series has been intended to turn
a motivated power user into a developer using Haiku. It's been a lot of fun
and many people have encouraged me with their kind words regarding it.</p><p>Later this summer I will start another yet-to-b e-named series which will
continue where Learning to Program With Haiku is leaving off and introduce
novice and intermediate developers to real coding specifically for Haiku and
its nuances, such as multithreaded programming, add-on coding, queries and
attributes, Tracker and more.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
              

              
              <article>
                  <p><em>Little elephant company</em> — <em>7 people working out of a random house</em> — <em>2013</em></p>
<p>I know we haven’t paid you for 30 days, but would you be willing to float another month?</p>
<p>No, sorry, I’m out.</p>
<p>Ok, sad to see you are not loyal to the company.</p>
<p>No pay, no work</p>
<p>It was the end of 2013; I’d gone two paychecks without pay. The client still hadn’t paid, I wasn’t about to start working for free.</p>
<p>I resigned. I told my boss at the time: <em>“no pay, no work”</em>.</p>
<p>Walking away wasn’t easy. They gave me my first shot as a professional coder. I was genuinely sad to leave the office, going with my coworkers to the nearby Subway restaurant, and especially the cat that roamed our office/house workspace.</p>
<p>Before the payment drama, this had been an objectively awesome job for a 17 year-old. This was a company that did AR, and other super cool projects for the time. When I started, this company focused in a project for one of Mexico’s efforts for renewable energy. A page for companies to apply for their energy savings grants for commercial builders.</p>
<p>If companies met the requisites, they would be awarded money which had to be closely tracked with reciepts/invoices and other kinds of controls. This meant we had to do a lot of stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex business rules that changed frequently</li>
<li>Multi-stage application processes with interdependent fields</li>
<li>Calculation-heavy rebate formulas</li>
<li>Document verification workflows</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="domain-specific-languages-and-form-wizardry">Domain-Specific Languages and Form Wizardry</h2>
<p>Due to the complicated nature of these web controls, my manager developed a domain-specific language (DSL) for PHP. We’d encode business rules into this DSL, and the framework would automatically generate the appropriate web form fields. It was quite impressive to see a real-world example of meta-programming that I’d only read about in forums.</p>
<p>I’d then modify the forms with JavaScript to make it nicer to fill (add calendars, autohide if there are dependencies/constraints etc. some jQuery magic). I got hired to implement the magic toggles with jQuery/JavaScript, but you have to understand this is 2013 JavaScript. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq4FpMe6cRs">ECMAScript wasn’t even a thing back then, types, Typescript wasn’t yet invented. Zero. Zilch.</a> At that time we used Firefox and Firebug to test our code. &nbsp;I’d load the things with JavaScript/jQuery, and test them in an early incantation of the chrome debugging tools called Firebug. I’d augment the UI of the fields that were created with our business logic with some nice JavaScript on top.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$('#project_type').on('change', function() {
&nbsp; &nbsp; var selectedType = $(this).val();

&nbsp; &nbsp; if (selectedType === 'renewable') {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#solar_panels_section').show();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#efficiency_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (selectedType === 'efficiency') {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#solar_panels_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#efficiency_section').show();
&nbsp; &nbsp; } else {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#solar_panels_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $('#efficiency_section').hide();
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
</code></pre><p><em>Welcome to FUN kids. React or Angular didn’t exist.</em></p>
<p>We also did nice calculators/calculations for the rebates people would get in JavaScript (oh god, the horror). At that time, JQuery was the boom, it was amazing for not having to manage the DOM directly. I still remember the <code>$.on( "click")</code> monster functions I’d used to do. They still haunt me till this day.</p>
<p><img src="https://danielsada.tech/images/blog/career/firebug.png" alt="">
<em>Firebug: The developer’s best friend in 2013. CSS debugging had never been so… adequate.</em></p>
<p>Maybe advanced for its time, but for a kid that only had pushed through FTP his websites using version control with SVN was state of the art. The wonky part is that we coordinated which files people had checked out by literally yelling across the office: “Hey, I’m going to check out the rebate calculator, please don’t touch it, k thanks bye!”</p>
<p><em>No pull requests. No code reviews. No branches. Just a shared understanding that if someone yelled about a file, it was temporarily “theirs.” It wasn’t until years later that I understood how important proper version control workflows were for project success.</em></p>
<h2 id="mobile-first-the-promise-that-never-came-until-react-native">Mobile First? The promise that never came until React Native.</h2>
<p>This also got me to write my first android app in PhoneGap. Performance was terrible, and UI was clunky. Sadly, this would not be the last time I would face PhoneGap. There was so much attractiveness in writing your app once in a web server and then automatically reflect everything in an app. For people that don’t know PhoneGap ~was~ is a technology that allows creating a web server and setting up a cross platform app. It’s an early incantation of react native but really bad. There was so much attractiveness in the write-once-run-everywhere promise, but the reality was significantly more painful.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end?</h2>
<p>Despite the technical challenges and the somewhat chaotic development environment, I grew a lot. The small team meant I got exposure to the entire stack: backend PHP, frontend JavaScript, mobile development, and even some system administration.</p>
<p>But after several months, the cracks started to show. Our main client delayed payments, and the company started running out of cash. First, it was “payment might be a few days late.” Then, “We’ll pay you next week for sure.” Finally, “I know we haven’t paid you for 30 days, but would you be willing to float another month?”</p>
<p>That’s when I learned one of the most important lessons of my career: <strong>No pay, no work.</strong></p>
<p>The guilt trip about “loyalty” didn’t work on me, even at 17. I understood that employment is a two-way-deal. I provide value through my skills and time, and the company provides value through compensation. When one side stops fulfilling their end, the deal ends.</p>
<p>As I packed up my things and said goodbye to the office cat, I wasn’t bitter. I was grateful for the experience and the lessons learned. And for getting the chance to work for an actual development shop at 17.</p>
<p>Thank you, little elephant company.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a “No pay, no work moment?” Comment below or in HN.</p>

<h3><strong>Train models with high performance and reliability</strong></h3>
<p><span>Training workloads are highly synchronized jobs that run across thousands of nodes. A single degraded node has the potential to disrupt an entire job, resulting in longer time-to-market and higher costs. To provision a cluster quickly you need VMs tuned for specific model architectures located in close proximity. You also need the ability to predict and troubleshoot node failures quickly and ensure workload continuity in the event of a failure.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cluster Director for GKE and Cluster Director for Slurm. </strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/hypercompute-cluster"><span>Cluster Director</span></a><span> (formerly Hypercompute Cluster)</span><strong> </strong><span>lets you deploy and manage a group of accelerators as a single unit with physically colocated VMs, targeted workload placement, advanced cluster maintenance controls, and topology-aware scheduling. Today we are announcing new updates for Cluster Director, coming later this year:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cluster Director for Slurm, </strong><span>a fully-managed Slurm offering with simplified UI and APIs to provision and operate Slurm clusters, including blueprints for common workloads with pre-configured software to make deployments reliable and repeatable.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>360</strong><strong><span>°</span></strong><strong> observability features </strong><span>including dashboards for visibility over cluster utilization, health, and performance, plus advanced features like AI Health Predictor and Straggler Detection to proactively detect and remediate failures, down to individual nodes.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job continuity capabilities </strong><span>like</span><strong> </strong><span>end-to-end automated health checks that continuously monitor the fleet and preemptively replace unhealthy nodes. The result is uninterrupted training even in degraded clusters, with multi-tier checkpointing for faster save and retrieval.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Cluster Director for GKE will natively support new Cluster Director features as they become available.</span><span> Cluster Director for Slurm will be available in the coming months, including support for both GPUs and TPUs. </span><a href="https://forms.gle/RESDPyrFmRajQQym7" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Register</span></a><span> for early access</span><span>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Run inference workloads efficiently at any scale</strong></h3>
<p><span>AI inference has evolved rapidly over the last year. Longer and highly variable context windows are resulting in more sophisticated interactions; reasoning and multi-step inferencing is shifting the incremental demand for compute — and therefore cost — from training to inference time (test-time scaling). To enable useful AI applications for end-users, you need software that can efficiently serve today’s and tomorrow’s interactions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Announcing AI inference capabilities in GKE: </strong><span>Inference Gateway and Inference Quickstart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GKE Inference Gateway </strong><span>offers intelligent scaling and load-balancing capabilities,</span><strong> </strong><span>helping you handle request scheduling and routing with gen AI model-aware scaling and load-balancing techniques. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>With </span><strong>GKE Inference Quickstart</strong><span>, you can choose an AI model and your desired performance, and GKE will configure the right infrastructure, accelerators, and Kubernetes resources to match.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Both features are available in preview today, together reducing serving costs by over 30%, tail latency by 60%, and increasing throughput by up to 40% compared to other managed and open-source Kubernetes offerings.</span></p>
<p><strong>vLLM support for TPUs: </strong><a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>vLLM</span></a><span> is well known for being a fast and efficient library for inference. Starting today, you can easily run inference on TPUs with vLLM and get their price-performance benefits without changing your software stack, with only a few configuration changes. vLLM is supported in Compute Engine, GKE, Vertex AI, and Dataflow. And with GKE </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/about-custom-compute-classes"><span>custom compute classes</span></a><span>, you can use TPUs and GPUs in tandem within the same vLLM deployment. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Making consumption even more flexible</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/provisioningrequest"><strong>Dynamic Workload Scheduler</strong></a><span> (DWS) is a resource management and job scheduling platform that helps you get easy and affordable access to accelerators. Today we’re announcing expanded accelerator support in DWS, including for TPU v5e, Trillium, A3 Ultra (NVIDIA H200), and A4 (NVIDIA B200) VMs in preview via Flex Start mode, with Calendar mode support for TPUs coming later this month. Additionally, Flex Start mode now supports a new provisioning method in which resources can be provisioned immediately and scaled dynamically, making it suitable for long-running inference workloads and a wider range of training workloads. This is in addition to the queued provisioning method of Flex Start mode that requires all nodes to be provisioned simultaneously.</span></p>
