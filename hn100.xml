He is pale and has no hair.</p><p>"I am seven years old and I have cancer," he says. "Please save my life and help me."</p><p>Khalil - who is pictured above in a still from the film - didn't want to record this, says his mother Aljin. She had been asked to shave his head, and then a film crew hooked him up to a fake drip, and asked his family to pretend it was his birthday. They had given him a script to learn and recite in English.</p><p>And he didn't like it, says Aljin, when chopped onions were placed next to him, and menthol put under his eyes, to make him cry.</p><p>Aljin agreed to it because, although the set-up was fake, Khalil really did have cancer. She was told this video would help crowdfund money for better treatment. And it did raise funds - $27,000 (£20,204), according to a campaign we found in Khalil's name.</p><p>But Aljin was told the campaign had failed, and says she received none of this money - just a $700 (£524) filming fee on the day. One year later, Khalil died.</p><p>Across the world, desperate parents of sick or dying children are being exploited by online scam campaigns, the BBC World Service has discovered. The public have given money to the campaigns, which claim to be fundraising for life-saving treatment. We have identified 15 families who say they got little to nothing of the funds raised and often had no idea the campaigns had even been published, despite undergoing harrowing filming.</p><p>Nine families we spoke to - whose campaigns appear to be products of the same scam network - say they never received anything at all of the $4m (£2.9m) apparently raised in their names.</p><p>A whistleblower from this network told us they had looked for "beautiful children" who "had to be three to nine years old… without hair".</p><p>We have identified a key player in the scam as an Israeli man living in Canada called Erez Hadari. </p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Watch how three children, including Ana from Colombia, appeared in campaign videos</figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Our investigation began in October 2023, when a distressing YouTube advert caught our attention. "I don't want to die," a girl called Alexandra from Ghana sobbed. "My treatments cost a lot."</p><p>A crowdfunding campaign for her appeared to have raised nearly $700,000 (£523,797).</p><p>We saw more videos of sick children from around the world on YouTube, all strikingly similar - slickly produced, and seemingly having raised huge amounts of money. They all conveyed a sense of urgency, using emotive language.</p><p>We decided to investigate further.</p><p>The campaigns with the biggest apparent international reach were under the name of an organisation called Chance Letikva (Chance for Hope, in English) - registered in Israel and the US.</p><p>Identifying the children featured was difficult. We used geolocation, social media and facial recognition software to find their families, based as far apart as Colombia and the Philippines.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Chance Letikva A fundraising campaign page for Ana - it shows her crying, wearing a nasal tube, and the caption at the top of the page reads &quot;Two months to live&quot; with a heart emoji "><span>Chance Letikva</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>A Chance Letikva campaign for Ana in Colombia - falsely claiming she had two months to live </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>While it was difficult to know for sure if the campaign websites' cash totals were genuine, we donated small amounts to two of them and saw the totals increase by those amounts.</p><p>We also spoke to someone who says she gave $180 (£135) to Alexandra's campaign and was then inundated with requests for more, all written as if sent by Alexandra and her father.</p><p>In the Philippines, Aljin Tabasa told us her son Khalil had fallen ill just after his seventh birthday.</p><p>"When we found out it was cancer it felt like my whole world shattered," she says.</p><p>Aljin says treatment at their local hospital in the city of Cebu was slow, and she had messaged everyone she could think of for help.

We travelled to both, but found no sign of it.</p><p>And we discovered Chance Letikva seems to be one of many such organisations.</p><p>The man who filmed Viktoriia's campaign told our producer - who was posing as a friend of a sick child - that he works for other similar organisations.</p><p>"Each time, it's a different one," the man - who had introduced himself as "Oleh" - told her. "I hate to put it this way, but they work kind of like a conveyor belt."</p><p>"About a dozen similar companies" requested "material", he said, naming two of them - Saint Teresa and Little Angels, both registered in the US.</p><p>When we checked their registration documents, we once again found Erez Hadari's name.</p><p>What is not clear is where the money raised for the children has gone.</p><p>More than a year after Viktoriia's filming, her mother Olena rang Oleh, who seems to go by Alex Kohen online, to find out. Shortly afterwards, someone from Chance Letikva called to say the donations had paid for advertising, she says.</p><p>This is also what Mr Hadari told Aljin, Khalil's mother, when she confronted him over the phone.</p><p>"There is cost of advertising. So the company lost money," Mr Hadari told her, without giving any evidence to support this.</p><p>Charity experts told us advertising should not amount to more than 20% of the total raised by campaigns.</p><p>Someone previously employed to recruit children for Chance Letikva campaigns told us how those featured had been chosen.</p><p>They had been asked to visit oncology clinics, they said - speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>"They were always looking for beautiful children with white skin. The child had to be three to nine years old. They had to know how to speak well. They had to be without hair," they told us.</p><p>"They asked me for photos, to see if the child is right, and I would send it to Erez."</p><p>The whistleblower told us Mr Hadari would then send the photo on to someone else, in Israel, whose name they were never told.</p><p>As for Mr Hadari himself, we tried to reach him at two addresses in Canada but could not find him. He replied to one voice note we had sent him - asking about the money he had been apparently crowdfunding - by saying the organisation "has never been active", without specifying which one. He did not respond to a further voice note and letter laying out all our questions and allegations.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Erez Hadari Erez Hadari is shown sitting in a plane - in what looks like first or business class - with a blue top and grey trousers, and is smiling, holding headphones"><span>Erez Hadari</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Erez Hadari sent this photo of himself to Khalil's mum, Aljin </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Campaigns set up by Chance Letikva for two children who died - Khalil and a Mexican boy called Hector - still appear to be accepting money.</p><p>Chance Letikva's US branch appears to be linked to a new organisation called Saint Raphael, which has produced more campaigns - at least two of which seem to have been filmed in Angelholm clinic in Ukraine, as the clinic's distinctive wood panelling and staff uniforms can be seen.</p><p>Olena, Viktoriia's mother, says her daughter has been diagnosed with another brain tumour.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Welcome to Bonsai!</h2><a id="user-content-welcome-to-bonsai" aria-label="Permalink: Welcome to Bonsai!" href="#welcome-to-bonsai"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Bonsai is a voxel engine in a pot.  It's been tended to with love and
care over the years.  It started out as a learning excercise, and has taught me
the value of simplicity.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bonsai supports massive worlds.  The current version supports a maximum world
size of ~1 billion blocks, cubed.  At one block per meter, that's the distance
from earth to the moon, 2600 times, in every direction.  The view distance is
the entire world, all the time.  Yes, you read that right.  In Bonsai, you can
see in a straight line from Jupiter to the sun.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bonsai terrain generation is fully procedural, and user configurable.  Terrain
is generated on the GPU using regular glsl shaders.  Anything you can do in a
shader, you can do in a Bonsai terrain generator.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2.0.0-prealpha Note</h3><a id="user-content-200-prealpha-note" aria-label="Permalink: 2.0.0-prealpha Note" href="#200-prealpha-note"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The current version is 2.0.0-prealpha-rc0, which can be found by joining the
<a href="https://discord.gg/kmRpgXBh75" rel="nofollow">Discord</a>.  This version is a large rewrite of
several core systems, including the world generation, editor and parts of the
renderer.</p>
<p dir="auto">In its current state, the engine is effectively a terrain generator and editor.
For details on remaing work, see <a href="https://github.com/scallyw4g/bonsai/issues/82" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/scallyw4g/bonsai/issues/82/hovercard">Roadmap to v2.0.0</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Bonsai, and nearly all it's dependencies, are written completely from scratch.
One external dependency is the C runtime library for program startup. There is
a back-burner task to remove the CRT entirely, athough it's unclear when/if
anyone will ever get around to it.</p>
<p dir="auto">The only external requirements to build Bonsai are clang++ (&gt;= version 18.1)
and a few appropriate system headers.</p>

 <a href="https://www.erdosproblems.com/1026">Problem 1026 on the Erdős problem web site</a> recently got solved through an interesting combination of existing literature, online collaboration, and AI tools. The purpose of this blog post is to try to tell the story of this collaboration, and also to supply a complete proof.
</p><p>
The original problem of Erdős, <a href="https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1971-25.pdf">posed in 1975</a>, is rather ambiguous. Erdős starts by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">recalling his famous theorem with Szekeres</a> that says that given a sequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k^2+1}"> distinct real numbers, one can find a subsequence of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k+1}"> which is either increasing or decreasing; and that one cannot improve the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k^2+1}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k^2}">, by considering for instance a sequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k}"> blocks of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k}">, with the numbers in each block decreasing, but the blocks themselves increasing. He also noted a <a href="https://zbmath.org/0090.01302">result of Hanani</a> that every sequence of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28k%2B3%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28k%2B3%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28k%2B3%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k(k+3)/2}"> can be decomposed into the union of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{k}"> monotone sequences. He then wrote “As far as I know the following question is not yet settled.

This problem was added to the Erdős problem site on September 12, 2025, with a note that the problem was rather ambiguous. For any fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}">, this is an explicit piecewise linear function of the variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_1,\dots,x_n}"> that could be computed by a simple brute force algorithm, but Erdős was presumably seeking optimal bounds for this quantity under some natural constraint on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_i}">. The day the problem was posted, Desmond Weisenberg proposed studying the quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c(n)}">, defined as the largest constant such that </p><p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++S%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29+%5Cgeq+c%28n%29+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++S%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29+%5Cgeq+c%28n%29+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++S%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29+%5Cgeq+c%28n%29+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\displaystyle  S(x_1,\dots,x_n) \geq c(n) \sum_{i=1}^n x_i"></p><p>
 for all choices of (distinct) real numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_1,\dots,x_n}">. Desmond noted that for this formulation one could assume without loss of generality that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_i}"> were positive, since deleting negative or vanishing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_i}"> does not decrease the left-hand side and does not increase the right-hand side. By a limiting argument one could also allow collisions between the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_i}">, so long as one interpreted monotonicity in the weak sense.
</p><p>
Though not stated on the web site, one can formulate this problem in game theoretic terms. Suppose that Alice has a stack of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{N}"> coins for some large <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{N}">. She divides the coins into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}"> piles of consisting of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{x_1,\dots,x_n}"> coins each, so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i+%3D+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i+%3D+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+x_i+%3D+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = N}">.

 While the general pattern was not yet clear, this was enough data for Stijn to conjecture that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29%3D1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29%3D1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29%3D1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c(k^2)=1/k}">, which would also imply that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+c%28n%29+%5Crightarrow+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+c%28n%29+%5Crightarrow+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+c%28n%29+%5Crightarrow+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{\sqrt{n} c(n) \rightarrow 1}"> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n \rightarrow \infty}">. (EDIT: as later located by an AI deep research tool, this conjecture was also made in Section 12 of <a href="https://zbmath.org/0832.60012">this 1980 article of Steele</a>.) Stijn also described the extremizing sequences for this range of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}">, but did not continue the calculation further (a naive computation would take runtime exponential in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}">, due to the large number of possible subsequences to consider).  
</p><p>
The problem then lay dormant for almost two months, until December 7, 2025, in which Boris Alexeev, as part of a systematic sweep of the Erdős problems using the AI tool <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01346">Aristotle</a>, was able to get this tool to <a href="https://github.com/plby/lean-proofs/blob/main/src/v4.24.0/ErdosProblems/Erdos1026.lean">autonomously solve</a> this conjecture <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29%3D1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29%3D1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29%3D1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c(k^2)=1/k}"> in the proof assistant language Lean. The proof converted the problem to a rectangle-packing problem.

This was one further addition to a recent sequence of examples where an Erdős problem had been automatically solved in one fashion or another by an AI tool. Like the previous cases, the proof turned out to not be particularly novel. Within an hour, Koishi Chan gave an alternate proof deriving the required bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29+%5Cgeq+1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29+%5Cgeq+1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28k%5E2%29+%5Cgeq+1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c(k^2) \geq 1/k}"> from the original Erdős-Szekeres theorem by a standard “blow-up” argument which we can give here in the Alice-Bob formulation.

Once this proof was found, it was natural to try to see if it had already appeared in the literature. AI deep research tools have successfully located such prior literature in the past, but in this case they did not succeed, and a more “old-fashioned” Google Scholar job turned up some relevant references: a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04153">2016 paper by Tidor, Wang and Yang</a> contained this precise result, citing an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00471">earlier paper of Wagner</a> as inspiration for applying “blowup” to the Erdős-Szekeres theorem.

But the story does not end there!

This idea of using packing to prove Erdős-Szekeres type results goes back to a 1959 paper of <a href="https://zbmath.org/0085.15003">Seidenberg</a>, although it was a discrete rectangle-packing argument that was not phrased in such an elegantly geometric form.  It is possible that Aristotle was “aware” of the Seidenberg argument via its training data, as it had incorporated a version of this argument in its proof.

This proves the conjecture!

There just remained the issue of putting everything together. I did feed all of the above information into a large language model, which was able to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69373cfb-fa70-800e-af98-ade8926ca5e1">produce a coherent proof</a> of <a href="#conj">(1)</a> assuming the results of Baek-Koizumi-Ueoro and Praton. Of course, LLM outputs are prone to hallucination, so it would be preferable to formalize that argument in Lean, but this looks quite doable with current tools, and I expect this to be accomplished shortly. But I was also able to reproduce the arguments of Baek-Koizumi-Ueoro and Praton, which I include below for completeness.

One striking feature of this story for me is how important it was to have a diverse set of people, literature, and tools to attack this problem.  To be able to state and prove the precise formula for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{c(n)}"> required multiple observations, including some version of the following:
</p><ul>
<li> The sequence can be numerically computed as a sequence of rational numbers.
</li><li> When appropriately normalized and arranged, visible patterns in this sequence appear that allow one to conjecture the form of the sequence.
</li><li> This problem is a weighted version of the Erdős-Szekeres theorem.
</li><li> Among the many proofs of the Erdős-Szekeres theorem is the proof of Seidenberg in 1959, which can be interpreted as a discrete rectangle packing argument.
</li><li> This problem can be reinterpreted as a continuous square packing problem, and in fact is closely related to (a generalized axis-parallel form of) Erdős problem 106, which concerns such packings.
</li><li> The axis-parallel form of Erdős problem 106 was recently solved by Baek-Koizumi-Ueoro.
</li><li> The paper of Praton shows that Erdős Problem 106 implies the generalized version needed for this problem.  This implication specializes to the axis-parallel case.
</li></ul><p>
It was only through the combined efforts of all the contributors and their tools that all these key inputs were able to be assembled within 48 hours.  It seems plausible that a more traditional effort involving just one or two mathematicians and simpler programming and literature search tools may eventually have been able to put all these pieces together, but I believe this process would have taken much longer (on the order of weeks or even months).
</p><p>
Another key ingredient was the <a href="https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/">balanced AI policy</a> on the Erdős problem website, which encourages disclosed AI usage while strongly discouraging undisclosed use.  To quote from that policy: “Comments prepared with the assistance of AI are permitted, provided (a) this is disclosed, (b) the contents (including mathematics, code, numerical data, and the existence of relevant sources) have been carefully checked and verified by the user themselves without the assistance of AI, and (c) the comment is not unreasonably long.”</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25–34% and DISTS by 21–43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-rich-text"><p>A few weeks ago, I was wrestling with a major life decision. Like I've grown used to doing, I opened Claude and started thinking out loud-laying out the options, weighing the tradeoffs, asking for perspective.</p><p>Midway through the conversation, I paused. I realized how much I'd shared: not just this decision, but months of conversations-personal dilemmas, health questions, financial details, work frustrations, things I hadn't told anyone else. I'd developed a level of candor with my AI assistant that I don't have with most people in my life.</p><p>And then an uncomfortable thought: <em>what if someone was reading all of this?</em></p><p>The thought didn't let go. As a security researcher, I have the tools to answer that question.</p><h2>The Discovery</h2><p>We asked Wings, our agentic-AI risk engine, to scan for browser extensions with the capability to read and exfiltrate conversations from AI chat platforms. We expected to find a handful of obscure extensions-low install counts, sketchy publishers, the usual suspects.</p><p>The results came back with something else entirely.</p><p>Near the top of the list: Urban VPN Proxy. A Chrome extension with over 6 million users. A 4.7-star rating from 58,000 reviews. A "Featured" badge from Google, meaning it had passed manual review and met what Google describes as "a high standard of user experience and design."</p><p>A free VPN promising privacy and security. Exactly the kind of tool someone installs when they <em>want</em> to protect themselves online.</p><p>We decided to look closer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693ff195f1d7b63502effd1e_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20at%2013.31.18.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Featured by Google and trusted by </figcaption></figure><h2>What We Found</h2><p>Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms:</p><ul role="list"><li>ChatGPT</li><li>Claude</li><li>Gemini</li><li>Microsoft Copilot</li><li>Perplexity</li><li>DeepSeek</li><li>Grok (xAI)</li><li>Meta AI</li></ul><p>For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated "executor" script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension's configuration:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693fef0f1b7f857557a057d3_4ad668a3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.</p><h2>How It Works</h2><p>The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background.</p><p>Here's the technical breakdown:</p><p><strong>1. Script injection into AI platforms</strong></p><p>The extension monitors your browser tabs. When you visit any of the targeted AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), it injects an "executor" script directly into the page. Each platform has its own dedicated script - chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js, and so on.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693ff72f55ecbf372877dfb9_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20at%2013.53.14.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>2. Overriding native browser functions</strong></p><p>Once injected, the script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest - the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests. This is an aggressive technique. The script wraps the original functions so that every network request and response on that page passes through the extension's code first.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693fef0f1b7f857557a057d6_7434cbb2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means when Claude sends you a response, or when you submit a prompt to ChatGPT, the extension sees the raw API traffic before your browser even renders it.</p><p><strong>3. Parsing and packaging</strong></p><p>The injected script parses the intercepted API responses to extract conversation data - your prompts, the AI's responses, timestamps, conversation IDs. This data is packaged and sent via window.postMessage to the extension's content script, tagged with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693ff3a71f7146ad752378a6_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20at%2013.39.44.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>4. Exfiltration via background worker</strong></p><p>The content script forwards the data to the extension's background service worker, which handles the actual exfiltration. The data is compressed and transmitted to Urban VPN's servers at endpoints including analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693ff74713aa0b4d80bb93b1_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20at%2013.52.35.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>What gets captured:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Every prompt you send to the AI</li><li>Every response you receive</li><li>Conversation identifiers and timestamps</li><li>Session metadata</li><li>The specific AI platform and model used</li></ul><h2>The Timeline</h2><p>The AI conversation harvesting wasn't always there. Based on our analysis:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Before version 5.5.0</strong>: No AI harvesting functionality</li><li><strong>July 9, 2025</strong>: Version 5.5.0 released with AI harvesting enabled by default</li><li><strong>July 2025 - Present</strong>: All user conversations with targeted AI platforms captured and exfiltrated</li></ul><p>Chrome and Edge extensions auto-update by default. Users who installed Urban VPN for its stated purpose - VPN functionality - woke up one day with new code silently harvesting their AI conversations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/693ffff7ef3550b5233c6773_Screenshot%202025-12-15%20at%2014.32.32.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Koidex report for Urban VPN Proxy</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or the other targeted platforms while Urban VPN was installed after July 9, 2025 should assume those conversations are now on Urban VPN's servers and have been shared with third parties. Medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas - all of it, sold for "marketing analytics purposes."</p><h2>What "AI Protection" Actually Does</h2><p>Urban VPN's Chrome Web Store listing promotes "AI protection" as a feature:</p><p>"Advanced VPN Protection - Our VPN provides added security features to help shield your browsing experience from phishing attempts, malware, intrusive ads and AI protection which checks prompts for personal data (like an email or phone number), checks AI chat responses for suspicious or unsafe links and displays a warning before click or submit your prompt."</p><p>The framing suggests the AI monitoring exists to <em>protect</em> you-checking for sensitive data you might accidentally share, warning you about suspicious links in responses.</p><p>The code tells a different story. The data collection and the "protection" notifications operate independently. Enabling or disabling the warning feature has no effect on whether your conversations are captured and exfiltrated. The extension harvests everything regardless.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/689ad8c5d13f40cf59df0e0c/6940043002b9b0e7d938b3ac_1765802302699.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>"And that, Doctor, is why I have trust issues"</figcaption></figure><p>The protection feature shows occasional warnings about sharing sensitive data with AI companies. The harvesting feature sends that exact sensitive data - and everything else - to Urban VPN's own servers, where it's sold to advertisers. The extension warns you about sharing your email with ChatGPT while simultaneously exfiltrating your entire conversation to a data broker.</p><h2>It Gets Worse</h2><p>After documenting Urban VPN Proxy's behavior, we checked whether the same code existed elsewhere.</p><p>It did. The identical AI harvesting functionality appears in seven other extensions from the same publisher, across both Chrome and Edge:</p><p><strong>Chrome Web Store:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Urban VPN Proxy - 6,000,000 users</li><li>1ClickVPN Proxy - 600,000 users</li><li>Urban Browser Guard - 40,000 users</li><li>Urban Ad Blocker - 10,000 users</li></ul><p><strong>Microsoft Edge Add-ons:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Urban VPN Proxy - 1,323,622 users</li><li>1ClickVPN Proxy - 36,459 users</li><li>Urban Browser Guard - 12,624 users</li><li>Urban Ad Blocker - 6,476 users</li></ul><p><strong>Total affected users: Over 8 million.</strong></p><p>The extensions span different product categories, a VPN, an ad blocker, a "browser guard" security tool, but share the same surveillance backend. Users installing an ad blocker have no reason to expect their Claude conversations are being harvested.</p><p>All of these extensions carry "Featured" badges from their respective stores, except Urban Ad Blocker for Edge. These badges signal to users that the extensions have been reviewed and meet platform quality standards. For many users, a Featured badge is the difference between installing an extension and passing it by - it's an implicit endorsement from Google and Microsoft.</p><h2>Who's Behind This</h2><p>Urban VPN is operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with BiScience (B.I Science (2009) Ltd.), a data broker company.</p><p>This company has been on researchers' radar before. Security researchers <a href="https://palant.info/2025/01/13/biscience-collecting-browsing-history-under-false-pretenses/">Wladimir Palant</a> and John Tuckner at <a href="https://secureannex.com/blog/sclpfybn-moneitization-scheme/">Secure Annex</a> have previously documented BiScience's data collection practices. Their research established that:</p><ul role="list"><li>BiScience collects clickstream data (browsing history) from millions of users</li><li>Data is tied to persistent device identifiers, enabling re-identification</li><li>The company provides an SDK to third-party extension developers to collect and sell user data</li><li>BiScience sells this data through products like AdClarity and Clickstream OS</li></ul><p>Our finding represents an expansion of this operation. BiScience has moved from collecting browsing history to harvesting complete AI conversations-a significantly more sensitive category of data.</p><p>The privacy policy confirms the data flow:</p><p>"We share the Web Browsing Data with our affiliated company... BiScience that uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with Business Partners"</p><h2>The Disclosure Problem</h2><p>To be fair, Urban VPN does disclose some of this-if you know where to look.</p><p><strong>The consent prompt</strong> (shown during extension setup) mentions that the extension processes "ChatAI communication" along with "pages you visit" and "security signals." It states this is done "to provide these protections."</p><p>[Screenshot: Urban VPN consent prompt]</p><p><strong>The privacy policy</strong> goes further, buried deep in the document:</p><p>"AI Inputs and Outputs. As part of the Browsing Data, we will collect the prompts and outputs queried by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable."</p><p>And:</p><p>"We also disclose the AI prompts for marketing analytics purposes."</p><p><strong>However, the Chrome Web Store listing</strong>-the place where users actually decide whether to install-shows a different picture:</p><p>"This developer declares that your data is Not being sold to third parties, outside of the approved use cases"</p><p>The listing mentions the extension handles "Web history" and "Website content." It says nothing about AI conversations specifically.</p><p><strong>The contradictions are significant:</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>The consent prompt frames AI monitoring as protective. The privacy policy reveals the data is sold for marketing.</li><li>The store listing says data isn't sold to third parties. The privacy policy describes sharing with BiScience, "Business Partners," and use for "marketing analytics."</li><li>Users who installed before July 2025 never saw the updated consent prompt-the AI harvesting was added via silent update in version 5.5.0.</li><li>Even users who see the consent prompt have no granular control. You can't accept the VPN but decline the AI harvesting. It's all or nothing.</li><li>Nothing indicates to users that the data collection continues even when the VPN is disconnected and the AI protection feature is turned off. The harvesting runs silently in the background regardless of what features the user has enabled.</li></ol><h2>Google's Role</h2><p>Urban VPN Proxy carries Google's "Featured" badge on the Chrome Web Store. According to Google's documentation:</p><p>"Featured extensions follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design."</p><p>"Before it receives a Featured badge, the Chrome Web Store team must review each extension."</p><p>This means a human at Google reviewed Urban VPN Proxy and concluded it met their standards. Either the review didn't examine the code that harvests conversations from Google's own AI product (Gemini), or it did and didn't consider this a problem.</p><p>The Chrome Web Store's Limited Use policy explicitly prohibits "transferring or selling user data to third parties like advertising platforms, data brokers, or other information resellers." BiScience is, by its own description, a data broker.</p><p>The extension remains live and featured as of this writing.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Browser extensions occupy a unique position of trust. They run in the background, have broad access to your browsing activity, and auto-update without asking. When an extension promises privacy and security, users have little reason to suspect it's doing the opposite.</p><p>What makes this case notable isn't just the scale - 8 million users - or the sensitivity of the data - complete AI conversations. It's that these extensions passed review, earned Featured badges, and remained live for months while harvesting some of the most personal data users generate online. The marketplaces designed to protect users instead gave these extensions their stamp of approval.</p><p>If you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now. Assume any AI conversations you've had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.</p><p>This writeup was authored by the research team at Koi.</p><p>We built Koi to detect exactly these kinds of threats - extensions that slip past marketplace reviews and quietly exfiltrate sensitive data. Our risk engine, Wings, continuously monitors browser extensions to catch threats before they reach your team.</p><p><a href="https://www.koi.ai/get-a-demo"><strong>Book a demo</strong></a> to see how behavioral analysis catches what static review misses.</p><p>Stay safe out there.</p><h2>IOCs</h2><p><strong>Chrome:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Urban VPN Proxy: eppiocemhmnlbhjplcgkofciiegomcon</li><li>Urban Browser Guard: almalgbpmcfpdaopimbdchdliminoign</li><li>Urban Ad Blocker: feflcgofneboehfdeebcfglbodaceghj</li><li>1ClickVPN Proxy for Chrome: pphgdbgldlmicfdkhondlafkiomnelnk</li></ul><p><strong>Edge:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Urban VPN Proxy: nimlmejbmnecnaghgmbahmbaddhjbecg</li><li>Urban Browser Guard: jckkfbfmofganecnnpfndfjifnimpcel</li><li>Urban Ad Blocker: gcogpdjkkamgkakkjgeefgpcheonclca</li><li>1ClickVPN Proxy for Edge: deopfbighgnpgfmhjeccdifdmhcjckoe</li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

					<p>For half a decade we’ve been worrying that ideas are getting harder to find. In fact, they might just be harder to sell.</p>
				<div>
											<div><p>Fifty years ago, productivity growth in advanced economies began to slow down. Productivity growth — the component of GDP growth that is not due to increases in labor and capital — is the primary driver of rising incomes. When it slows, so does economic growth as a whole. This makes it an urgent trend to understand. Unfortunately, the most popular explanation for why it’s happening might be wrong.</p><p>The most widely endorsed reason productivity growth has faltered is that we are running out of good ideas. As this narrative has it, the many scientific and technology advances responsible for driving economic growth in the past were low-hanging fruit. Now the tree is more barren. Novel advances, we should expect, are harder to come by, and historical growth may thus be difficult to sustain. In the extreme, this may lead to the end of progress altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>This story began in 2020, with the publication of “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?,” by economists Nicholas Bloom and colleagues.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1"> -->
    <span id="fnref-1">

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 Bloom et al. looked across many sectors, from agriculture to medicine to computing. In each field, productivity measures have grown at the same rate as before. This sounds like good news, except that the number of researchers in each of these fields has exploded. In other words, each researcher produces much less than they used to — something you might expect if ideas really are getting harder to find.</p><p>The progress studies movement and the metascience community have risen, in part, in response to this challenge. Both seek ways to rethink how we do research: by making our research institutions more efficient or by increasing science funding.&nbsp;</p><p>But there's a growing body of evidence that suggests ideas are not, in fact, getting harder to find. Instead, the problem appears to be that markets have become less effective at translating breakthrough technologies into productivity gains. Researchers appear to be continuing to generate valuable innovations at historical rates. It’s just that these innovations face greater barriers to commercialization, and innovative firms thus fail to gain market share.&nbsp;</p><p>All this suggests that the constraint on growth isn’t in our universities or labs or R&amp;D departments, but in our markets.</p></div>

</p>
											<p>Historically, the task of growth theory has been to rationalize this graph:</p>

</div>
											<div><p>Through two world wars, the Great Depression, the global financial crisis, and the Cold War, US real GDP per capita has grown steadily at 2% per year. This consistency is remarkable, so much so that it has motivated economists to search for a near-immutable source of economic growth: something fundamental that drives growth across long sweeps of time. Sure, growth can be affected in the short run by policies and events of the day — tariffs, wars, demographic transitions, educational booms — but it would be an incredible coincidence if the combined impact of every economic policy and external event in history happened to net out as a constant growth rate! So what could this immutable mechanism be?</p><p>It took economists decades to understand how sustained exponential growth is even possible. Exponential growth requires <em>increasing returns to scale</em> — doubling all the inputs into production must more than double the scale of economic output. Why? Each year output has to be reinvested as capital to produce next year’s output. But there’s diminishing returns to capital alone, so each year a country would need to reinvest a larger fraction of its annual output to get the same growth rate. Eventually, it would need to reinvest more than 100% of its output, which is impossible. It is only through increasing returns to scale that we can counteract the diminishing returns to capital, allowing us to maintain exponential growth.</p><p>So it’s easy! We just posit increasing returns to scale in production, and we now have an explanation for why growth is exponential — decades of research not necessary. The problem is that increasing returns to scale violates our basic intuitions. Imagine you own a factory that produces 100 cars a day. You create an exact duplicate of this factory in another city, with the same employees, same equipment. How many cars would you expect from both factories combined? The intuitive assumption is 200. Increasing returns demands that we can somehow get more than double the cars from creating the second factory — which is hard to justify.&nbsp;</p><p>The economist Paul Romer won a Nobel Prize for resolving this puzzle: Increasing returns to scale comes from <em>ideas.</em> In his view, it is a mistake to think that the only inputs to the car factory are the workers and machines. There are also blueprints for the cars being produced, instructions for how the machines should be laid out, and the concept of an assembly line process to organize the workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Romer’s work elegantly solved the problem posed by our factory duplication thought experiment. In setting up the second factory, we needed only to duplicate the workers and the machines — we didn’t need to duplicate the designs or the idea of an assembly line. Once created, ideas can be used in perpetuity, which is how we can double the factory’s output while doubling only its physical inputs. This key property of ideas — that they can be used by everyone at the same time — has become the fundamental explanation for exponential growth. This is why it matters so much if ideas truly are getting harder to find: If idea production is slowing down, it threatens the foundation that allows growth to continue.</p></div>
											<p><h2>The simple argument for declining idea productivity</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>To test whether our research efforts are getting less bang for their buck today than they did decades ago, Bloom et al. use a key feature that descends from Romer’s original model — that productivity growth can be represented by the following equation:</p><p>Productivity growth = Research productivity * Number of researchers&nbsp;</p><p>Whether total factor productivity, or agricultural yields, or chip density, growth of any productivity measure should be a direct function of the number of researchers working in that sector and their research productivity. This means that if we observe productivity growth in any given sector, and we know the number of researchers working in that sector, we can infer research productivity.</p><p>Thus, the authors compile data on productivity growth and researcher counts across a number of different sectors to estimate whether research productivity has been falling, which according to the authors, means ideas must be getting harder to find.</p><p>Perhaps their most compelling evidence comes from Moore's Law, the famous observation that the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles roughly every two years. This doubling represents a constant 35% annual growth rate in chip density that has held for 50 years. On its face, Moore’s Law seems like a refutation of any diminishment in technological progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet maintaining the exponential growth in chip density has required exponential increases in effort. Bloom et al. compiled R&amp;D spending data from dozens of semiconductor firms over time and found that the effective number of researchers working to advance Moore's Law increased by a factor of 18 between 1971 and 2014. Meanwhile, the growth rate of chip density has stayed constant. Put differently, it takes 18 times as many researchers today to achieve the same rate of improvement in chip density as it did in the early 1970s. This implies that research productivity in semiconductors has fallen at an average rate of 7% per year.</p><p>Look at agricultural productivity and you see a similar pattern. The authors measure crop yield growth across major US crops. Between 1969 and 2009, yield growth for these crops averaged a steady 1.5% per year, but the research effort directed toward improving yields has grown by between sixfold and 24-fold, depending on the crop.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoom all the way out, and the pattern still holds. Across the economy as a whole, R&amp;D efforts have increased by a factor of 20 since the 1930s, yet productivity growth has become slower.</p></div>

											<p>These results are unambiguous. Research effort has gone up, yet productivity growth is not budging. This seems like clear evidence that <em>something </em>about productivity growth is getting harder. But whether the problem is a lack of new ideas is much less obvious.</p>
											<p><h2>Measuring idea productivity directly</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>The idea-based growth model is successful as a simple description of how exponential growth could occur. The problem is we’ve taken it too literally. Bloom et al. assume that idea production is the <em>only </em>factor behind productivity growth. For example, their agricultural case study uses crop yield growth as the sole variable for new ideas. This allows them to sidestep difficulties in defining ideas and measuring their impact, but it also rules out the possibility that factors other than ideas are the real reason yields are stagnating.</p><p>Imagine that agricultural R&amp;D spending <em>was</em> highly effective, and that in the past few decades it led to a stream of new seed varieties that were each higher-yield than the last. What if those seeds were not actually being purchased by farmers — maybe because farmers were unaware that they existed or because adopting a new seed is risky? We would observe crop yields stagnating despite R&amp;D spending effectively creating more productive crops.&nbsp;</p><p>Bloom et al.’s measure of "ideas" combines actual research innovations <em>with other necessary conditions</em> for research innovations to translate into higher output. After being invented, technologies have to be successfully commercialized, marketed, and adopted at scale before they can have large effects on economic output. What if we’re still just as good at producing ideas, but we’ve become much worse at capitalizing on them?&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly the argument made by Teresa Fort and colleagues in a paper from April of this year: “Growth Is Getting Harder to Find, Not Ideas.”<sup>

</sup>
 Fort et al. use the census of firms linked to US patent filings to capture economy-wide invention, rather than focusing on sector-specific case studies. Most importantly, they measure idea production more directly, by estimating the relationship between R&amp;D spending and new patents rather than inferring idea production from firm growth. Since patents represent technologies that are novel enough to be given intellectual property protection, and also economically valuable enough to be worth patenting, they serve as a more direct measure of “ideas.”</p><p>Fort et al. find that, across firms, research expenditure today continues to be associated with a proportional increase in patents similar to the 1980s. They use a variety of measures to get at this, but the most transparent one is to measure the ratio between patents and R&amp;D expenditures for each firm. Doing this, they find that the average firm’s patent-to-R&amp;D ratio has actually <em>increased</em> by 50% since 1977 — contrary to a story in which R&amp;D effort is becoming less effective. While there is enough variability in this ratio that Fort et al. can’t be confident that it has actually increased, we can certainly say that it hasn’t fallen in the way that Bloom et al. would predict.</p><p>The obvious question is whether these patents might represent less generative and useful ideas, something like more incremental advances than patents of the past. Maybe the low-hanging fruit really is gone, and new patents are capturing less useful ideas. Fort et al. address this issue by focusing on <em>breakthrough patents</em>, a measure of technological innovation defined by <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190499">Kelly et al.</a>,<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3"> -->
    <span id="fnref-3">
        3    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 and showing that their results still hold.</p><p>For a technology to count as a breakthrough, it must be generative — technologies that come after must build on it. This idea is the basis for Kelly et al.’s measurement of a patent’s significance. They score a patent as breakthrough if its text is different from patents that came before it but similar to the text of patents that came after it. Patents that scored in the top 5% on this measure included the elevator, the typewriter, the telephone, and frozen foods — giving us some assurance that this measure really selects high-quality technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Fort et al. show that their results are not simply coming from more incremental patents over time. Not only has the number of patents filed per R&amp;D dollar increased, but the number of breakthrough patents per R&amp;D dollar has also increased. Firms produce three times more breakthrough patents per R&amp;D dollar than they did in 1977.</p><p>This analysis suggests that Bloom et al. jumped the gun by attributing the slowdown in productivity growth to declining research productivity. If you infer research productivity only from output growth, it’s hard to find. But if you look at new idea production through the lens of patent data, we appear to be as generative as ever. So&nbsp; there must be some other failure in translating new technologies into productivity growth. What could that be?</p></div>
											<p><h2>The fault in our markets</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>We now have a puzzle — productivity growth is slowing down, yet the factor that we think of as the most important determinant of productivity growth is not. The way to resolve this is to let go of the view that ideas are the only factor that determine growth. Remember, the power of that view is its ability to explain growth in the <em>long run</em> — to generate the graph of steady 2% growth over one and a half centuries of war, changes in trade policy, and wide political shifts. Various factors <em>can</em> absolutely drag down growth rates over shorter periods: Growth was visibly lower during the Great Depression, only recovering because of catch-up growth in the boom that followed World War II. Our challenge is to explain the slower growth over a longer period. There is mounting evidence that a factor more obvious than “ideas are harder to find” is responsible: specifically, a decline in market efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>The first indication comes from Fort et al.’s analysis. In addition to focusing on breakthrough patents, Fort et al. consider a measure of patent value based on stock market returns from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/132/2/665/3076284">Kogan et al.</a><sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4"> -->

</sup>
 The authors estimate how much a (publicly traded) firm's stock price moves in response to a patent being granted and use this movement as a measure of how valuable the patent is. This measure is unique in that it doesn't capture only the value of the technology but also all factors that go into making a technology profitable for its inventors. So it is notable that contrary to their main results, Fort et al. find that the stock market value of the average patent has actually fallen over time. In other words, the market places lower commercial value on new technologies compared with before. Since the authors also show that the number of breakthrough patents per dollar has actually increased, this is puzzling — somehow, firms are making better technologies than before but getting smaller rewards.</p><p>This result gels with a broader view in the productivity literature — that the primary limitation on productivity growth is whether more productive firms can outcompete less productive firms. Intuitively, productivity across the economy is not just the simple average of each firm’s productivity; it’s the <em>market share-weighted</em> average of each firm’s productivity. This means that productivity growth across the economy relies not just on firms finding ways to produce new goods at lower costs (which is where “ideas” would help) — it relies on the best firms being able to gain market share, to increase their contribution to aggregate productivity. This ability for better firms to compete is known as <em>allocative efficiency</em>.</p><p>So has allocative efficiency decreased in advanced economies, and can that explain the productivity slowdown? <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017019pap.pdf">Decker et al.</a><sup>

 use the same census of US firms to show that it has. On average, each firm’s productivity has grown at the same rate as before, but less productive firms have actually <em>gained</em> market share over more productive firms. These two factors together can explain why productivity growth has slowed down. Firms have maintained their innovative capacity, but the market is much less rewarding of that innovative capacity than it has been in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same spirit, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57fa873e8419c230ca01eb5f/t/5cd4b2adeef1a1ea927999e5/1557443247932/AA_fin.pdf">Akcigit and Ates</a><sup>

 argue that the most important factor behind the fall in allocative efficiency<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7"> -->
    <span id="fnref-7">
        7    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->

 is a drop in the rate at which lagging firms catch up to leader firms in an industry.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8"> -->
    <span id="fnref-8">

</sup>
 They consider several possible factors that could influence how dynamic the economy is — corporate taxes, R&amp;D subsidies, entry costs, and catch-up rates for lagging firms — and analyze which of them is most responsible for falling allocative efficiency. They find that almost all of the decline in allocative efficiency is explained by lagging firms failing to catch up. This tells us that the problem of declining allocative efficiency has a rather specific form: Less productive firms stay on as market leaders, while more productive firms are unable to catch up.</p><p>This is a puzzle! Why would the market fail to reward innovative firms, or, conversely, why does it continue rewarding less innovative firms? Unfortunately, here we don’t have clear answers. It could be that incumbent firms leverage market power to prevent innovative competitors from gaining market share. Perhaps regulatory barriers make it harder for new entrants to compete with incumbents. Financial markets may also have become less effective at identifying and funding high-potential firms. Answering this question is going to be central to addressing the productivity slowdown and should be a major focus for progress studies.</p></div>
											<p><h2>Progress studies needs to go to market</h2>
</p>
											<div><p>The distinction between “ideas are getting harder to find” and “growth is getting harder to achieve” changes what we should focus on to accelerate progress. If the source of slowing growth was actually that each new scientific or technological breakthrough requires exponentially more effort, then progress-oriented thinkers would be right to focus on science funding, peer review, and the culture of scientific research.&nbsp;</p><p>However if ideas remain as discoverable as ever, but their economic impact is fading, then we need to look downstream from the laboratory. The decline in allocative efficiency should be more of a main focus — we need to throw more of our intellectual capital at understanding how to increase competitiveness and the market potential for innovative firms and technologies, in the same way that we've focused on understanding how to make better technologies.</p><p>The narrative that "ideas are getting harder to find" has profoundly shaped how economists and policymakers think about innovation and growth. It implies we're fighting against some fundamental law of diminishing returns in human creativity. But what we’re actually fighting against is a flaw in our markets that prevents that creativity from being rewarded economically. If we want to restore growth, we should stop worrying about whether we've picked all the low-hanging fruit and start taking that fruit to market.</p></div>

            <p>
                Before we get nerd sniped by the shiny engineering details, ask the only question that matters. 
                Why compute in orbit? Why should a watt or a flop 250 miles up be more valuable than one on the 
                surface? What advantage justifies moving something as mundane as matrix multiplication into LEO?
            </p>
            <p>
                That "why" is almost missing from the public conversation. People jump straight to hardware and 
                hand-wave the business case, as if the economics are self-evident. They aren't. A lot of the 
                energy here is FOMO and aesthetic futurism, not a grounded value proposition.

                <h3>Motivation and Framing</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I love space. I live and breathe it. I'm lucky enough to brush the heavens with my own metal and code, and I want nothing more than a booming orbital space economy that creates the flywheel that makes space just another location we all work and visit. I love AI and I subscribe to maximum, unbounded scale. I want to make the biggest bets. I grew up half-afraid we'd never get another Apollo or Manhattan. I truly want the BigThing.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is all to say that the current discourse is increasingly bothering me due to the lack of rigor; people are using back-of-the-envelope math, doing a terrible job of it, and only confirming whatever conclusion they already want. Calculating radiation and the cost of goods is not difficult. Run the numbers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Before we do the classic engineer thing and get nerd sniped by all the shiny technical problems, it's worth asking the only question that matters: why put compute in orbit at all? Why should a watt or a flop be more valuable 250 miles up than on the surface? What economic or strategic advantage justifies the effort required to run something as ordinary as matrix multiplication in low Earth orbit?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    That "why" is nearly missing from the public conversation. The "energy is cheaper, less regulations, infinite space" arguments just ring false compared to the mountains of challenges and brutal physics putting anything in space layers on. The discourse then skips straight to implementation, as if the business case is obvious.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Personal Positioning</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I'm not here to dunk on anyone building real hardware. Space is hard, and shipping flight systems is a credibility filter. I'm annoyed at everyone else. The conversation is full of confident claims built on one cherry-picked fact and zero arithmetic. This is a multivariable physics problem with closed-form constraints. If you're not doing the math, you're not contributing, you're adding noise and hyping for a future we all want instead of doing the hard work to actually drive reality forward.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Core Thesis</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The target I care about is simple: can you make space-based, commodity compute cost-competitive with the cheapest terrestrial alternative? That's the whole claim. Not "space is big." Not "the sun is huge." Not "launch will be cheap." Can you deliver useful watts and reject the waste heat at a price that beats a boring Crusoe-style tilt-wall datacenter tied into a 200–500 MW substation?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you can't beat that, the rest is just vibes. GPUs are pretty darn happy living on the ground. They like cheap electrons, mature supply chains, and technicians who can swap a dead server in five minutes. Orbit doesn't get points for being cool. Orbit has to win on cost, or it has to admit it's doing something else entirely. If it's an existential humanity play, that's cool too, but it's a slightly different game.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Analytical Lens</h3>
                
                <p>
                    So here's what I did. I built a simple model that reduces the debate to one parameter: cost per watt of usable power for compute. The infographic below lets you change the assumptions directly. If you disagree with the inputs, great. Move the sliders. But at least we'll be arguing over numbers that map to reality.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The model is deliberately boring. No secret sauce. Just publicly available numbers and first-principles physics: solar flux, cell efficiency, radiator performance, launch cost, hardware mass, and a terrestrial benchmark that represents the real alternative: a tilt-wall datacenter sitting on top of cheap power. The code is public, please go through everything. <a href="https://github.com/andrewmccalip/thoughts" target="_blank">github.com/andrewmccalip/thoughts</a>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Findings and Implications</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Here's the headline result: it's not obviously stupid, and it's not a sure thing. It's actually more reasonable than my intuition thought! If you run the numbers honestly, the physics doesn't immediately kill it, but the economics are savage. It only gets within striking distance under aggressive assumptions, and the list of organizations positioned to even try that is basically one.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    That "basically one" point matters. This isn't about talent. It's about integration. If you have to buy launch, buy buses, buy power hardware, buy deployment, and pay margin at every interface, you never get there. The margin stack and the mass tax eat you alive. Vertical integration isn't a nice-to-have. It's the whole ballgame.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Market and Incentives</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Which is why I trend positive on SpaceX here. If anyone can brute force a new industrial stack into existence, it's the team that can reduce $/kg and get as humanly close to free launch as possible. And they need to, because the economics are not close. This is not a 25% mismatch. It's 400%. Closing that is the whole job. Positive does not mean gullible. It needs measurable targets and painful reality checks.

                    If SpaceX ever goes public, this is exactly the kind of thing shareholders should demand: extreme, barely-achievable goalposts with clean measurement. Tesla did it with the options grant. Do the same here. Pay Elon a king's ransom if he delivers a new industrial primitive: cheap, sustained dollars per kilogram and dollars per watt in orbit, at real cadence, for years.

                <h3>Broader Interpretation</h3>
                
                <p>
                    On strict near-term unit economics, this might still be a mediocre use of capital. A tilt-wall datacenter in Oregon with cheap power, cheap cooling, and technicians on call is hard to beat. Crusoe can park compute on stranded natural gas and turn it into flops with a supply chain that already exists.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But the knock-on effects are why this keeps pulling at people. If you can industrialize power and operations in orbit at meaningful scale, you're not just running GPUs. You're building a new kind of infrastructure that makes it easier for humans to keep spreading out. Compute is just one of the first excuses to pay for the scaffolding. Even if this is a mediocre trade on strict near-term unit economics, the second-order effects could be enormous.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'll go one step further and say the quiet part out loud: we should be actively goading more billionaires into spending on irrational, high-variance projects that might actually advance civilization. I feel genuine secondhand embarrassment watching people torch their fortunes on yachts and status cosplay. No one cares about your Loro Piana. If you've built an empire, the best possible use of it is to burn its capital like a torch and light up a corner of the future. Fund the ugly middle. Pay for the iteration loops. Build the cathedrals. This is how we advance civilization.

                <h3>Overall Conclusion</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Even so, irrational ambition doesn't get to ignore physics. The point of this page is to make the constraints explicit, so we can argue about reality instead of vibes. If the numbers close, even barely, then it's worth running hard on the idea. If they don't, the honest move is to say so and move on. Either way, I think some version of this has a feeling of inevitability.

                    So scroll down, play with the sliders, and try to break it. Change launch cost. Change lifetime. Change specific power. Change hardware cost. The goal here isn't to "win" an argument. It's to drag the conversation back to first principles: assumptions you can point at, and outputs you can sanity-check. Check out the GitHub, run the code, find the errors, and I'll update it live.

                <p>
                    After that, we can do the fun part: thermal diagrams, radiator math, orbit beta angles, failure rates, comms geometry, all the shiny engineering details that make this topic so addicting. It's not obviously stupid, and it's not a sure thing. That's why it's worth doing the math.

                <h3>Technical Engineering Challenges</h3>
                
                <p>
                    The governing constraint for orbital compute is <strong>thermodynamics</strong>. Terrestrial datacenters leverage convective cooling—dumping waste heat into the atmosphere or water sources, effectively using the planet as an infinite cold reservoir. In the vacuum of space, convection is impossible. Heat rejection relies exclusively on radiation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every object in space settles to an equilibrium temperature where absorbed power equals radiated power. If heat generation exceeds radiative capacity, the temperature rises until the $T^4$ term in the Stefan-Boltzmann law balances the equation:
                </p><p>

                $$\dot{Q}_{\text{rad}} = \varepsilon \sigma A T^4$$

                </p><p>
                    The engineering challenge is ensuring this equilibrium temperature remains below the safe operating limits of silicon processors.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Energy Balance and Heat Rejection</h4>
                
                <p>
                    To dimension the radiator surface, we must account for the total thermal load managed by the satellite bus. In this model, based on a Starlink-style bifacial architecture (PV on front, radiator on back), the system must reject the aggregate energy of two distinct paths:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Incident Solar Flux:</strong> The sun delivers $G_{\text{sc}} = 1361\;\text{W/m}^2$ (AM0). With a solar absorptivity $\alpha = 0.92$, the panel absorbs approximately $\sim 1250\;\text{W/m}^2$.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Partitioning:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Electrical Path ($\sim$22%):</strong> High-efficiency cells convert $\sim 275\;\text{W/m}^2$ into electricity. This power drives the compute payload and is converted entirely back into heat by the processors. A liquid cooling loop collects this heat and returns it to the panel structure for rejection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thermal Absorption ($\sim$78%):</strong> The remaining $\sim 975\;\text{W/m}^2$ is not converted to electricity but is absorbed immediately as lattice heat (phonon generation) within the panel structure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Total Heat Load:</strong> The radiator must reject the sum of both the immediate thermal absorption and the returned electrical waste heat—effectively <strong>100% of the absorbed solar flux</strong>.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                        This imposes a strict area density limit. High-power compute requires large collection areas, which inherently absorb large amounts of solar heat. The radiator must be sized to reject this aggregate load while maintaining an operating temperature below the junction limit.
                    </p>

                <h4>Operating Temperature Limits</h4>
                
                <p>
                    Modern AI accelerators (H100/B200 class) typically throttle at junction temperatures $T_j &gt; 85\text{–}100\degree\text{C}$. To maintain a junction at 85°C, and accounting for the thermal gradient across cold plates and interface materials ($\Delta T \approx 10\degree\text{C}$), the radiator surface temperature $T_{\text{rad}}$ is constrained to approximately 75°C.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The model below calculates the equilibrium temperature for a bifacial array in a terminator orbit ($\beta = 90^\circ$). It accounts for solar flux, Earth IR ($\sim 237\;\text{W/m}^2$), and albedo. If the calculated equilibrium temperature $T_{\text{eq}}$ exceeds the target radiator temperature, the design fails.

The automaker will make hybrid versions of almost every vehicle in its lineup, the company says.</p><p>The company will no longer make a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-why-high-end-electric-cars-are-failing/">large all-electric truck</a>, Ford executives told reporters Monday, and will repurpose an electric vehicle plant in Tennessee to build gas-powered cars. The next generation of Ford’s all-electric F-150 Lighting will instead be an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV, a plug-in hybrid that uses an electric motor to power its wheels while a smaller gasoline engine recharges the battery. Ford says the tech, which <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/extended-range-electric-vehicles-erev/">automakers have touted in recent years as a middle-ground between battery-electric vehicles and gas-powered ones</a>, will give its truck extended towing capacity and a range of over 700 miles.</p><p>Ford still plans to produce a midsize electric pickup truck with a target starting price of about $30,000, to be available in 2027. That will be the first of the “affordable” electric vehicle models it’s currently designing at a skunkworks studio in California, which are slated to use a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fords-answer-to-china-a-completely-new-way-of-making-cars/">“universal” platform architecture that will make the vehicles cheaper to produce</a>.</p><p>The new plans leave Ford with a bunch of excess battery-making capacity, which the company says it will use by opening a whole new business: a battery energy-storage sideline. This new business will produce lower-cost and longer-living <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gms-final-ev-battery-strategy-copies-chinas-playbook-super-cheap-cells/">lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries</a> for customers in the public utility or data center industries.</p><p>“Ford is following the customer,” says Andrew Frick, the president of Ford Blue and Ford Model e, the automaker’s gas- and battery-powered vehicle businesses. US customer adoption of electric vehicles is not where the industry expected at decade’s start, he says. (Battery-electric vehicles currently make up about <a data-offer-url="https://www.spglobal.com/automotive-insights/en/blogs/2025/10/ev-adoption-rates-how-us-and-other-markets-compare-2025" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/automotive-insights/en/blogs/2025/10/ev-adoption-rates-how-us-and-other-markets-compare-2025&quot;}" href="https://www.spglobal.com/automotive-insights/en/blogs/2025/10/ev-adoption-rates-how-us-and-other-markets-compare-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">7.5 percent of US new car sales</a>.) Frick also cited changes in the regulatory environment, including the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/5-big-ev-takeaways-one-big-beautiful-bill/">Trump administration's rollback</a> of commercial and consumer tax incentives for electric vehicles.</p><p>The company has also canceled an all-electric commercial van planned for the European market.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>For years I treated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control">HDMI-CEC</a> like a house spirit: sometimes helpful, mostly temperamental, never fully understood. My living-room stack is straightforward: Samsung TV on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#ARC_and_eARC">ARC</a> (NOT eARC - story for another day), Denon AVR-X1700H hidden in a closet, Apple TV plus a bunch of consoles connected to the receiver, and a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> already doing <a href="https://homebridge.io/">Homebridge</a> duty. When it comes to CEC, the Apple TV handles it like a dream, but every console behaves like it missed the last week of CEC school. They wake the TV, switch the input, then leave the Denon asleep so I’m back to toggling audio outputs manually.</p><p><img src="https://johnlian.net/images/posts/hdmi-cec/media-closet.jpg" alt="My media closet where all the consoles are"></p><blockquote><p>I documented the <a href="https://johnlian.net/posts/media-closet/">media closet build-out</a> separately, so if you want the full wiring tour (and the before/after photos), start there.</p></blockquote><p>With the media closet, rewiring everything to the TV wasn’t an option and disabling CEC wasn’t viable (Apple TV works and it gets the most use). My first instinct was to lean on traditional automation stacks: HomeKit scenes to chain “TV on” into “receiver on” or wattage triggers via an <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-energy">Eve Energy</a> plug. This kind of worked, but every extra layer added 30 seconds of lag or more. The last stop on that journey was a <a href="https://github.com/electroflame/homebridge-cec-tv-control"><code>homebridge-cec-tv-control</code> plugin</a>, but while reading the README I realized I was about to pipe CEC messages through Node, Homebridge, and HomeKit before they hit the receiver. The Pi is wired into the rack already, so skipping those layers and going through <code>/dev/cec0</code> directly was clearly the faster path.</p><p>After an evening of struggling, the Pi now sits quietly on the HDMI bus, watching for consoles to announce themselves and issuing the single command Samsung + Denon should have exchanged on their own.</p><p>This post follows the structure of my notes: build a small mental model of CEC, monitor the bus, copy whatever Apple TV does right, wrap it in Python, then ship it as a <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a> unit.</p><h2 id="small-hdmi-cec-primer">Small HDMI-CEC primer</h2><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI">High-Definition Multimedia Interface</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control">Consumer Electronics Control</a></em>, much better known as <strong>HDMI-CEC</strong>, is a low-bandwidth side channel that rides alongside HDMI video/audio. Everyone on the bus speaks in <em>logical addresses</em> (<code>0x0</code> for TV, <code>0x5</code> for audio systems, <code>0x4/0x8/0xB</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for playback devices, etc.) and tiny <em>opcodes</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> such as <code>0x82</code> (<strong>Active Source</strong>) or <code>0x72</code> (<strong>Set System Audio Mode</strong>). Physical addresses are “lat/long” references inside the topology, so <code>3.0.0.0</code> can mean “AVR input source HDMI 3”.</p><p>CEC is <em>supposed to</em> help consumers control their electronics, so in a healthy system the flow goes like this: console wakes and declares itself active, the TV notices there’s an ARC partner, somebody sends “please be the audio system”, the receiver wakes up, and audio comes out of the big speakers. For me, that path only occurred when Apple TV was involved. Sadly, when I woke a console, the TV switched inputs but audio stayed on the tinny TV speakers.</p><p>To debug that mess I first wrote down how every device identified itself on the bus. Here are the specific CEC roles in my home theater:</p><ul><li><strong>TV</strong> – logical address <code>0x0</code></li><li><strong>Audio system (Denon AVR-X1700H)</strong> – logical address <code>0x5</code></li><li><strong>Playback devices</strong> – logical addresses <code>0x4</code>, <code>0x8</code>, <code>0xB</code> (Apple TV, PS5, Switch 2 and Xbox all competing for the three playback slots<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>)</li><li><strong>Broadcast</strong> – logical address <code>0xF</code> (messages to everyone)</li></ul><p>And the key opcodes we ended up caring about:</p><ul><li><code>0x82</code> – <strong>Active Source</strong> (“I am now the active input”)</li><li><code>0x84</code> – <strong>Report Physical Address</strong> (“this is where I live in the HDMI tree”)</li><li><code>0x70</code> – <strong>System Audio Mode Request</strong></li><li><code>0x72</code> – <strong>Set System Audio Mode</strong> (Denon’s “I am now the audio system” broadcast)</li></ul><h2 id="monitoring-the-cec-bus-with-cec-client">Monitoring the CEC bus with <code>cec-client</code></h2><p>The Raspberry Pi 4 I have exposes <code>/dev/cec0</code> interface on its micro-HDMI, and with a $7 micro-HDMI to HDMI cable plugged into HDMI input port on the receiver, it’s possible to monitor CEC traffic from <em>everything connected to the receiver</em>.</p><p><img src="https://johnlian.net/images/posts/hdmi-cec/raspberry-pi-hdmi.jpg" alt="Close-up photo of the Pi plugged into the TV’s ARC HDMI input, HDMI adapters visible"></p><p>I was initially hesitant because of some <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/support/product/sync-box/100010#How_do_I_know_if_I_have_a_sync_box_4K_or_8K">Hue Play Sync Box</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> trauma: every HDMI splitter or inline gadget I’ve tried in front of the TV caused weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data">EDID</a> breakage, troubles with HDR negotiation, or outright signal loss. But once I understood the Pi <em>never sits in the middle</em> of the HDMI handshake my concerns went away. By plugging it into an unused HDMI input on the AVR, it behaves like just another participant on the shared CEC bus. No signal regeneration, no spoofed EDIDs, nothing for the rest of the chain to notice.</p><p>So the topology looks like this:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="mermaid">---

That’s the packet you expect any console to send when it wakes up.</p><h2 id="figuring-out-the-magic-handshake">Figuring out the magic handshake</h2><p>So I put the system in standby, start logging, then wake Apple TV. I got the expected <code>Active Source</code> burst, followed immediately by the Denon broadcasting that it has taken over audio:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>&gt;&gt; 8f:82:32:00       # Apple TV (logical 8) -&gt; Broadcast: Active Source

</span></span><span><span># ...a bunch of reports, but no 5f:72:01
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So what was the <code>8f:a6:06:10:56:10</code> frame when Apple TV was involved? With debug logs, <code>cec-client</code> showed <code>UNKNOWN (A6)</code>. I suspect <code>libCEC</code> labels it unknown because it’s in the vendor-specific range. The following bytes (<code>06:10:56:10</code>) could be Apple’s proprietary payload, like some capability or extended control. It’s possible Samsung and Apple have a private handshake here that ultimately results in the Denon doing the right thing. It’s neat, but I couldn’t rely on it since it’s undocumented and sending it manually from the Raspberry Pi’s logical address had no effect. Impersonating Apple TV over CEC is not realistically viable and likely brittle.</p><p>However, with <a href="https://www.cec-o-matic.com/">cec-o-matic.com</a>, it was easy to craft a CEC frame for the Raspberry Pi to send a normal system audio mode request:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>15:70:00:00 # TV (1) -&gt; Audio (5): System Audio Mode Request
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Breaking it down:</p><ul><li><code>15</code> = source <code>0x1</code> (Recorder 1 = Pi) sends to destination <code>0x5</code> (Audio System = Denon)</li><li><code>70</code> = opcode <strong>System Audio Mode Request</strong></li><li><code>00:00</code> = operands (TV’s physical address 0.0.0.0, plus “system audio status” = off/0, which Denon interprets as “please negotiate system audio mode and turn on ARC”)</li></ul><p>The second I typed this into <code>cec-client</code>’s interactive shell with <code>tx 15:70:00:00</code>, the Denon turned on and ARC anchored to the receiver even with only a console and TV powered on. I confirmed by checking the TV’s audio output:</p><p><img src="https://johnlian.net/images/posts/hdmi-cec/output.jpg" alt="Photo of TV UI confirming receiver output"></p><p>So the solution started to emerge: whenever a console wakes up and claims Active Source, the Pi should step in and send <code>15:70:00:00</code> to the Denon to kickstart audio negotiation.</p><h2 id="dont-spam-the-bus">Don’t spam the bus!</h2><p>Now that we know the basis of the automation, the most obvious thing to do is to write a bash script that loops <code>cec-client</code> every few seconds and blast <code>on 5</code>. That sort of works, but it’s not ideal:</p><ul><li>Using a loop means the automation is delayed instead of reacting to actual CEC events.</li><li>Every iteration spins up a new <code>cec-client</code>, binds to <code>/dev/cec0</code>, sends one command, and tears down.</li><li>CEC is a shared bus, not a write-only GPIO.</li></ul><p>A better pattern is:</p><ol><li>Start a <strong>single</strong> long-lived <code>cec-client</code> process.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></li><li>Let it print every <code>TRAFFIC</code> line for you to parse.</li><li>Feed it <code>tx ...</code> commands on stdin only when you need to intervene.</li></ol><p>The only catch: monitor mode (<code>-m</code>) can’t transmit. So for the automation we switch to:</p><p>No <code>-m</code> here. <code>cec-client</code> still prints all the traffic, but now it also accepts commands. Our Python script treats it like a bridge between HDMI land and our own logic: <code>stdout</code> is an event stream, <code>stdin</code> is a control channel.</p><h2 id="the-python-script">The Python script</h2><p>It took some trial and error, but it wasn’t too difficult to write a small Python program that watches for consoles waking up and sends the magic <code>15:70:00:00</code> command when needed. I put it all on GitHub:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jlian/cec_auto_audio">
<span>jlian/cec_auto_audio</span></a></p><p>The script logic goes:</p><ul><li>Starts <code>cec-client -d 8</code> as a subprocess.</li><li>Parses <code>TRAFFIC</code> lines.</li><li>Watches for <strong>Active Source (<code>0x82</code>)</strong> from any <strong>Playback</strong> logical address (<code>0x4/0x8/0xB</code>).</li><li>Tracks when the Denon last broadcast <strong>Set System Audio Mode (<code>5f:72:01</code>)</strong> so we don’t fight Apple TV or the TV’s own logic.</li><li>Sends <code>tx 15:70:00:00</code> at most once per console wake if nobody else has done it.</li></ul><p>A few notes:</p><ul><li>The script <strong>doesn’t hard-code</strong> any device names, vendors, or physical addresses.</li><li>It treats <strong>any Playback logical address</strong> (<code>0x4/0x8/0xB</code>) turning into Active Source as a “console wake” event.</li><li>It stays <strong>passive</strong> when Apple TV / Samsung / Denon manage to do the right thing themselves (because we observe a real <code>5f:72:01</code>).</li><li>It runs as a single long-lived process tied to a single <code>cec-client</code> instance.</li></ul><p>To make sure it starts on boot and keeps running, I wrapped it in a simple <code>systemd</code> service. The unit file I used <a href="https://github.com/jlian/cec_auto_audio?tab=readme-ov-file#running-as-a-systemd-service">can be found in the GitHub README</a>. I’ve been running it for a few days and feels rock solid.</p><h2 id="generalizing-this-approach">Generalizing this approach</h2><p>I hope this post gives you enough of a mental model to adapt this approach to your own CEC pain points. My solution is specific to the Denon + Samsung + consoles scenario, but the same pattern should work for other CEC quirks.</p><p>Maybe your issue isn’t consoles not engaging the AVR. Maybe DTS never negotiates, or your TV keeps snapping back to its tiny speakers. The workflow is the same:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Get the Pi onto the an HDMI port</strong>. Plug the Pi into the TV or Receiver’s HDMI input using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWQ7KLV">micro-HDMI–&gt;HDMI cable</a> (or adapter). Put it somewhere it can sit forever.</p></li><li><p><strong>Baseline the bus</strong>. Run:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>echo</span> <span>"scan"</span> <span>|</span> cec-client -s -d <span>1</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>to make sure your Pi can see all the expected devices, what logical/physical addresses they have, and what roles they use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Record a “good” scenario and a “bad” one</strong>. Use:</p><p>to log traffic while you:</p><ul><li>Trigger a <strong>good</strong> path (e.g., Apple TV gets 5.1 sound correctly).</li><li>Trigger a <strong>bad</strong> path (e.g., DTS falls back to stereo, or ARC drops to TV speakers).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Diff the traces</strong>. Look for opcodes that show up in the good trace but are missing in the bad.

That’s technically “correct” from the TV’s point of view (its own tuner is always a valid source), but wrong for how this setup is actually used.</p></li><li><p><strong>My sunset TV automation can land on a dead input.</strong> I have a HomeKit automation that turns the TV on around sunset. Most of the time that means Apple TV wakes up with a nice aerial screensaver. But if the last input before power-off was a console, the TV wakes to that HDMI port and just shows “no signal”, which confuses other people in the house.</p></li></ul><p>These problems are similar, but require slightly different solutions:</p><ol><li><strong>Console standby → TV becomes Active Source.</strong> When a console goes to sleep it tends to release the bus and the TV politely promotes its tuner. The helper could watch for that very specific frame pair (console Standby, TV Active Source) and, after a short grace period, switch the input to Apple TV.</li><li><strong>Sunset automation → no Active Source.</strong> In this case the TV powers on but nobody (not even the TV) claims Active Source, so it sits on the last HDMI port showing “no signal.” The helper needs to detect “TV on, Denon asleep, no Active Source within N ms,” then wake both Apple TV and the receiver and switch inputs.</li></ol><p>Or maybe we could unify both by having a state machine that tracks “who was Active Source most recently” and automatically falls back to Apple TV whenever the bus goes quiet <em>or</em> the TV promotes itself. Either way, the Pi’s job is to make sure there’s always a sane outcome.</p><p>That would turn the Pi into a more general “HDMI shepherd”: not just keeping ARC pinned to the receiver when something is playing, but also steering the system back to a sane default when nothing is.</p><p>There’s probably a small cottage industry of “two-page CEC scripts” waiting to be written.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last month, the Atlanta Fed came out with a </span><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/research/publications/wp/2025/11/06/15-geospatial-heterogeneity-in-inflation-market-concentration-story" rel="">report</a><span> showing a clear relationship between consolidation in grocery stores and the rate of food inflation. Unsurprisingly, where monopolies prevail, food inflation is 0.46 percentage points higher than where there is more competition. The study showed that from 2006-2020, the cumulative difference amounted to a 9% hike in food prices, and presumably since 2020, that number has gone much higher.</span></p><p>Affordability, in other words, is a market power problem. </p><p><span>And yesterday, we got specifics on just </span><em>how </em><span>market power in grocery stores works. The reason is because a nonprofit just forced the government to unseal </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.635565/gov.uscourts.nysd.635565.68.0.pdf" rel="">a complaint</a><span> lodged by Lina Khan’s FTC against Pepsi for colluding with Walmart to raise food prices across the economy. A Trump official tasked with dealing with affordability tried to hide this complaint, and failed. And now there’s a political and legal storm as a result.</span></p><p>Let’s dive in.</p><p>Everyone knows the players involved. Pepsi is a monster in terms of size, a $90 billion soft drink and consumer packaged goods company with multiple iconic beverage and food brands each worth over $1 billion, including Pepsi-Cola, Frito Lay, Mountain Dew, Starbucks (under license), Gatorade, and Aquafina. Walmart is a key partner, with between 20-25% of the grocery market.</p><p><span>Pepsi was also a key </span><a href="https://www.modernretail.co/operations/price-hikes-pump-up-pepsicos-annual-outlook/" rel="">player</a><span> in the post-Covid ‘greedflation’ episode. “I actually think we’re capable of taking whatever pricing we need,” said CFO Hugh Johnston in 2022. And the company did just that, </span><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/pepsico-tops-expectations-for-the-2nd-quarter-and-raises-its-expectations-for-2023/" rel="">raising prices</a><span> by </span><a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/retail/2023/10/10/pepsico-hikes-prices-7th-consecutive-quarter-profits-jump/71127783007/" rel="">double digit percentages</a><span> for seven straight quarters in 2022-2023. </span></p><p>The allegation is price discrimination, which is a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, a law passed in 1936 to prevent big manufacturers and chain stores from acquiring too much market power. The specifics in the complaint are that Pepsi keeps wholesale prices on its products high for every outlet but Walmart, and Walmart in return offers prominent placement in stores for Pepsi products. This approach internally is called a “price gap” strategy. It’s a partnership between two giants to exclude rivals by ensuring that Walmart has an advantage over smaller rivals in terms of what it charges consumers, and so that Pepsi maintains its dominance on store shelves.</p><p>This partnership comes in a number of forms. Pepsi offers allowances for Walmart, such as “Rollback” pricing, where specially priced soft drinks go into bins in highly visible parts of the store. The soft drink company gives Walmart “Save Even More” deals, online coupons and advertisements, and other merchandizing opportunities. Other outlets don’t get these same allowances, meaning they are charged higher prices.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png" width="656" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:656,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:801121,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/181432503?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EGsn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F90a5471b-fb95-44c2-8cd8-55d05469f9b6_656x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>While Pepsi is a “must-have” product for grocery stores, Walmart is also massively powerful. In its investment documents, Pepsi notes that Walmart is its largest customer, the the loss of which “would have a material adverse effect” on its business. Walmart is so dominant that the internal communication of the two companies would show a comparison of prices at Walmart versus “ROM,” or “rest of market,” meaning grocery, mass, club, drug, and dollar channels. It’s everyone in the world versus Walmart.</p><p>And Pepsi does a lot of alleged price discrimination to maintain the approval of Walmart. It goes far beyond special allowances and concessions to Walmart; Pepsi even polices prices at rival stores and prepares reports for Walmart showing them their pricing advantages on Pepsi products.  </p><p>When the “price gap” would narrow too much, Pepsi executives panicked with fear they might offend Walmart. They tracked “leakage,” meaning when consumers would buy Pepsi products outside of Walmart, which happened most often at stores where prices were more competitive. Pepsi kept logs on stores who would “self-fund” discounts, nicknaming them “offenders” of the price gap. It would note that where competition was fierce, such as in the Richmond-Raleigh-CLT corridor, it was harder to maintain a price gap for Walmart. This relationship went both ways; Walmart executives would complain to Pepsi if the “price gap” got too thin.</p><p>To ensure that prices would go up at rival stores, Pepsi would adjust allowances, such as “adjusting rollback levers.” It would punish stores that refused to cooperate by raising wholesale prices. Retailers who were trying to discount Pepsi products to better compete with Walmart would find it increasingly difficult to do so; not only would Pepsi take away their promotional allowances, but they might find that discounting six-packs of soda would lead to Pepsi charging them higher wholesale prices for the soda.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png" width="1406" height="546" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:546,&quot;width&quot;:1406,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:129575,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/181432503?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SQxj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45d660e7-2cc8-4342-9314-6417881bd943_1406x546.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The FTC offered the example of Food Lion, a 1000-store chain in 10 states that cut prices on Pepsi products on its own to match or beat Walmart prices.</p><blockquote><p>In 2022, Pepsi believed that Food Lion had “heavily indexe[d]” its retail prices “against retails at [Walmart] and Kroger” and “set[] retails relative to these competitors.” Pepsi characterized Food Lion as the “worst offender” on the price gap for “beating [Walmart] in price.”</p><p>As a result of Food Lion threatening Walmart’s price gap, Pepsi created a plan to nudge Food Lion’s retail prices on Pepsi products upward by reducing promotional payments and allowances to Food Lion and raising other costs for Food Lion. The plan advised that Pepsi “must commit to raising rate [on Food Lion] faster than market by minimum annually.”…</p><p>Nonetheless, even with these price increases, Pepsi leadership continued to push its Food Lion sales team to “begin to CLOSE the gap” because “[w]e absolutely have to demonstrate progress [to Walmart] in the immediate term.”</p></blockquote><p><span>This arrangement benefits each side by extracting from consumers and rivals. Walmart gets to have a price advantage in Pepsi soft drink products against rival grocery stores and convenience stores, and Pepsi is able to exclude competitor access to better shelf space at the most important retailer. Consumers end up paying more for soda, new companies find it harder to get distribution access for new soft drink products to compete with Pepsi, and all non-Walmart retail stores are put at a disadvantage to Walmart. ILSR’s Stacy Mitchell </span><a href="https://x.com/stacyfmitchell/status/1999468090753712219" rel="">laid out the terms of the deal</a><span> as “Keep us the king of our domain and we’ll make you the king of yours.”</span></p><p><span>This dynamic is why independent grocery stores are dying. “We can be almost certain that this is the same monopolistic deal Walmart has cut with other major grocery suppliers,” </span><a href="https://x.com/stacyfmitchell/status/1999468104813101500" rel="">noted</a><span> Mitchell. “It’s led to less competition, fewer local grocery stores, and higher prices.” To the end consumer, it creates an optimal illusion. Walmart appears to be a low-cost retailer, but that’s because it induces its suppliers to push prices up at rivals. The net effect is less competition at every level. There are more areas without grocery competition, which increases food inflation. And suppliers like Pepsi gain pricing power, such as that they exploited during the post-Covid moment.</span></p><p><span>This kind of presumptively illegal price discrimination isn’t unique to the Pepsi-Walmart relationship. Pepsi is </span><em>also</em><span> being </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/shdq7a2j4d7tb00bf0gw8/2025.02.17-1-Complaint-copy.pdf?rlkey=f2a69y8uvfw8mjl8pngc26vbp&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0" rel="">sued</a><span> in a class action complaint for giving better </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/monopoly-round-up-trump-antitrust" rel="">deals</a><span> for snack foods to big chains than it does to smaller stores, and Post is being sued by Snoop Dogg for working with Walmart to exclude sugar cereals produced by Snoop Dogg from its store shelves. You can find price discrimination everywhere in the economy, from shipping to ad buying to pharmaceutical distribution to liquor sales. And the resulting consolidation and high prices is also pervasive.</span></p><p><span>So why are we only learning about this situation now? Well, the original allegation was filed in January, in the last days of the Khan FTC. We knew the general outline of the argument, but we didn’t know specifics, because the complaint was </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6exjq8haeerlcv4ncit14/gov.uscourts.nysd.635565.1.0.pdf?rlkey=1lu7dtc9s5tnl8ns0mlzxryf8&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0" rel="">highly redacted</a><span>. Was it a real conspiracy? Was it just that Pepsi considered Walmart a “superstore” and had different prices for different channels? Was there coercion? None of these questions could be answered; there were so many blacked out words we couldn’t even say for sure that the large power buyer referenced in the document was Walmart. </span></p><p>Economists and fancy legal thinkers mocked the case endlessly. The FTC hates discounts! Price discrimination is good, it ends up lowering prices for consumers. The Robinson-Patman Act is stupid and pushes up prices. Suppliers always can only charge what “the market will bear” and if they could charge higher prices they’d already be doing it. And they’d never offer lower prices to any distributor; no lower  than they had to. Yet these claims relied on the complaint never seeing the light of day.</p><p>The reason for the secrecy was a choice by FTC Chair Ferguson. Normally, when the government files an antitrust case, the complaint is redacted to protect confidential business information, as this one against Pepsi was. Then the corporate defendant and the government haggle over what is genuinely confidential business information. Within a few weeks, complaints are unsealed with a few minor blacked out phrases, and the case goes on. </p><p><span>In this case, however, Trump Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson abruptly dropped the case in February after Pepsi </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2025/04/09/pepsi-hires-an-antitrust-lobbyist-00282762" rel="">hired</a><span> well-connected lobbyists. Small business groups were angry, but what was most interesting was the timing. Ferguson ended it the day before the government was supposed to go before the judge to manage the unsealing process. And that kept the complaint redacted. With the complaint kept secret, Ferguson, and his colleague Mark Meador, then publicly went on the attack. Ferguson’s </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Pepsi-Dismissal-Ferguson-Statement-05-22-2025.pdf" rel="">statement</a><span> was a bitter and personal invective against Khan; he implied she was lawless and partisan, that there was “no evidence” to support key contentions, and that he </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Pepsi-Dismissal-Ferguson-Statement-05-22-2025.pdf" rel="">had</a><span> to “clean up the Biden-Harris FTC’s mess,” which fellow commissioner Mark Meador later </span><a href="https://x.com/MeadorFTC/status/1925687128266092733" rel="">echoed.</a></p><p>And that was where it was supposed to stay, secret, with mean-spirited name-calling and invective camouflaging the real secret Ferguson was trying to conceal. That secret is something we all know, but this complaint helped prove - the center of the affordability crisis in food is market power. If that got out, then Ferguson would have to litigate this case or risk deep embarrassment. So the strategy was to handwave about that mean Lina Khan to lobbyists, while keeping the evidence secret.</p><p><span>However, the anti-monopoly movement and the court system actually worked. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-monopoly group filed to make the full complaint public. Judge Jesse Matthew Furman agreed to hear ILSR’s case, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Pepsi bitterly opposed. Last week, Furman directed the FTC </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.635565/gov.uscourts.nysd.635565.67.0.pdf" rel="">unseal</a><span> the complaint. So we finally got to see what Ferguson and Meador were trying to hide. </span></p><p>The political reaction is just starting. Ferguson has pretended that he’s taking a leading role in the ‘affordability’ strategy of the Trump administration, it wouldn’t surprise me if there’s internal anger at him among Republicans for flubbing such an obvious way to lower consumer prices and then lying about it. The grocery industry, especially rural grocers victimized by this price discrimination, leans to the right. </p><p><span>On the Democratic side, already we’re seeing states introducing price discrimination bills. There’s likely going to be bipartisan pressure on the FTC, which can and should reopen the case. There are already private Robinson-Patman Act cases, this complaint is likely to be picked up and used by plaintiffs who are excluded by the alleged scheme revealed in it. As a result of the publication of this complaint, Sabina Matos, the lieutenant governor of Rhode Island, </span><a href="https://x.com/i/status/1999550366141018443" rel="">just said</a><span> that her state should ban this kind of behavior.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png" width="968" height="920" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:920,&quot;width&quot;:968,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:402702,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/181432503?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hu6F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb749882-6fb7-4c11-9fcf-68db59e04209_968x920.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>But there’s also something deeper happening. Earlier this week, More Perfect Union </span><a href="https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1998377726432907537" rel="">came</a><span> out with an important investigative report on a company called Instacart, which is helping retailers charge individual personalized prices for goods based on a shopper’s data profile. The story went viral and caused immense outrage because it said something we already know. Pricing is increasingly unfair and unequal, a mechanism to extract instead of a means of sending information signals to the public and producers to coordinate legitimate commercial activity. And there’s a historical analogy to the increasing popular frustration.</span></p><p>The idea of the single price store, where a price is transparent and is the same for everyone, was created by department store magnate John Wanamaker in the post-Civil War era. Before founding his department store, Wanamaker was the first leader of the YMCA. He also created a Philadelphia mega-church. His single price strategy was part of an evangelical movement to morally purify America, the “Golden rule” applied to business. The price tag was political, an explicitly democratic attempt to treat everyone equally by eliminating the haggling and extractive approach of merchants.</p><p>At the same time as Wanamaker operated his store, the Granger movement of farmers in the midwest and later Populists fought their own war on unfair pricing of railroads, with the slogan “public prices and no secret kickbacks.” In the 1899 conference on trusts in Chicago, widely considered the most important intellectual and political forum for the later treatment of the Sherman Act, there were bitter debates, but everyone agreed that price discrimination by railroads were fostering consolidation in a dangerous and inefficient roll-up of power. These movements took place at a moment of great technological change, when Americans were moving to cities and leaving the traditional dry goods store behind.</p><p>Similarly, there was a big anti-chain store movement in the 1920s and 1930s to protect local producers and retailers, which ended up resulting in the Robinson-Patman Act, among other changes to law. That was a result of the Walmart or Amazon of its day, A&amp;P, which would engage in price discrimination, opening outlets it called “killing stores” just to harm rivals. Over the past five years, we’ve seen a similar upsurge in anger over prices that drove the grangers, John Wanamaker, and the anti-chain store movement. Prices are becoming political again.</p><p>This revival is being driven by two things. First, technology is enabling all sorts of new ways to price, which is to say, to organize commercial and political power. And we all feel the coercion. Second, we’re beginning to relearn our traditions. Our historical memory was erased in the 1970s by economists, who argued that price discrimination is affirmatively a good thing. But fortunately, they are losing the debate. </p><p>As a result, today we’re seeing something similar to the anti-chain store movement of the 1920s and 1930s, with attempts to reinvigorate Robinson-Patman, and write and apply antitrust laws to algorithmic pricing choices. The Instacart scheme is a new way to extract, the alleged Walmart-Pepsi scheme is a classic way to extract. But increasingly, the public is realizing that pricing is political. And they don’t want to be cheated anymore.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://questdb.com/blog/async-profiler-kernel-bug/">https://questdb.com/blog/async-profiler-kernel-bug/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46280465">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>
  QuestDB is the open-source time-series database for demanding workloads—from trading floors to mission control.
  It delivers ultra-low latency, high ingestion throughput, and a multi-tier storage engine.
  Native support for Parquet and SQL keeps your data portable, AI-ready—no vendor lock-in.</p>
<hr>
<p>I've been a Linux user since the late 90s, starting with <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> on an underpowered AMD K6.
Over the years I've hit plenty of bugs, but the last decade has been remarkably stable - until a kernel bug started
freezing my machine whenever I used <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/">async-profiler</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not a kernel developer, but I found myself poking around kernel source code to understand the problem better and
figure out what was going on under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The problem</a></h2>
<p>I was about to start an investigation of latency spikes in QuestDB reported by a user. To do that, I wanted to use the async-profiler to capture <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/3a493bedc4c6463ba19970018c50e0c9d7dcbfda/docs/Heatmap.md">CPU heatmaps</a>.</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="Screenshot of async-profiler heatmap" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2025-12-11/heatmap.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Async-profiler heatmap example</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>However, when I tried to attach the profiler, my machine froze completely. It did not respond to any
keys, it was impossible to switch to a terminal, it did not respond to SSH. The only way to recover was to hard
reboot it. I tried to start QuestDB with the profiler already configured to start at launch - the same result, a frozen machine almost immediately after the launch.</p>
<p>I thought that was weird, this had not happened to me in years. It was already late in the evening, I felt tired anyway so I decided to call it a day. There was a tiny chance I was hallucinating
and the problem would go away by itself overnight. A drowning man will clutch at a straw after all.</p>
<p>The next day, I tried to attach the profiler again - same result, frozen machine. Async-profiler integration in QuestDB is a relatively new feature, so I thought
there might be a bug in the integration code, perhaps a regression in the recent QuestDB release. So I built an older QuestDB version: The same result, frozen machine. This was puzzling - I positively
knew this worked before. How do I know? Because I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6150">integration code</a> not too long ago, and I tested the hell out of it.</p>
<p>This was a strong hint that the problem was not in QuestDB, but rather in the environment. I've gotten lazy since my
Slackware days and I have been using Ubuntu for years now and I realized
that I had recently updated Ubuntu to the latest version: 25.10. Could it be that the problem is in the new Ubuntu
version?</p>
<p>At this point I started Googling around and I found a <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/issues/1578">report</a> created by a fellow
performance aficionado, <a href="https://x.com/forked_franz">Francesco Nigro</a>, describing exactly the same problem: machine
freeze when using async-profiler. This was the final
confirmation I was not hallucinating! Except Francesco is using Fedora, not Ubuntu. However, his Fedora uses the same kernel version as my Ubuntu: 6.17.
I booted a machine with an older Ubuntu, started QuestDB and attached the profiler and it worked like a charm. This
was yet another indication that the problem was in the system, possibly even in the kernel. This allowed me to
narrow down my Google keywords and find this <a href="https://patchew.org/linux/176216460800.2601451.733142302683512228.tip-bot2@tip-bot2/">kernel patch</a> which talks about the very same problem!</p>
<p>I found it quite interesting: A kernel bug triggered by async-profiler causing machine freezes on recent mainstream distributions. After some poking I found a workaround:
Start the profiler with <code>-e ctimer</code> option to avoid using the problematic kernel feature. I tried the workaround and indeed, with this option, the profiler worked fine and my machine did not freeze.</p>
<p>Normally I'd move on, but I was curious. What exactly is going on under the hood? Why is it freezing? What is this
<code>ctimer</code> thing? What exactly is the bug and how does the patch work? So I decided to dig deeper.</p>

<p>Async-profiler is a sampling profiler. It periodically interrupts threads in the profiled application and collects their stack traces. The collected stack traces are then aggregated and visualized in
various ways (flame graphs are one of the most popular visualizations). It has multiple ways to interrupt the profiled application, the most common one is using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html"><code>perf_events</code></a> kernel feature. This is how it works by default on Linux
assuming <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/perf-security.html">kernel paranoia settings</a> allow it.</p>
<h3 id="perf_events-under-the-hood"><a href="#perf_events-under-the-hood">perf_events Under the Hood</a></h3>
<p>The <code>perf_events</code> subsystem is a powerful Linux kernel feature for performance monitoring. For CPU profiling, async-profiler uses
a software event called <code>cpu-clock</code>, which is driven by high-resolution timers (<a href="https://docs.kernel.org/timers/hrtimers.html">hrtimers</a>) in the kernel.</p>
<p>Here's the sequence of events during profiling:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setup</strong>: For each thread in the profiled application, async-profiler opens a <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/c6c2fc1497ab06ff357146ed91fd27c0ce5640ba/src/perfEvents_linux.cpp#L606"><code>perf_event</code></a> file descriptor configured
to generate a signal after a specified interval of CPU time (e.g., 10ms).</li>
<li><strong>Arming the event</strong>: The profiler calls <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/c6c2fc1497ab06ff357146ed91fd27c0ce5640ba/src/perfEvents_linux.cpp#L645"><code>ioctl(fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH, 1)</code></a> to arm the event for exactly one sample.
This is a one-shot mechanism, combined with the <code>RESET</code> at the end of the handler. The goal is to measure application CPU time only and exclude the signal's handler own overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Timer fires</strong>: When the configured CPU time elapses, the kernel's <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/2424e146bee00ddb4d4f79d3224f54634ca8d2bc/kernel/time/hrtimer.c#L1761">hrtimer fires</a> and delivers a signal to the target thread.</li>
<li><strong>Signal handler</strong>: Async-profiler's signal handler captures the stack trace and <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/c6c2fc1497ab06ff357146ed91fd27c0ce5640ba/src/perfEvents_linux.cpp#L704">records the sample</a>.
At the end of the handler,
it resets the counter and <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/c6c2fc1497ab06ff357146ed91fd27c0ce5640ba/src/perfEvents_linux.cpp#L709-L710">re-arms the event</a> for the next sample:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><p><span>ioctl(fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_RESET, 0);    // Clear the counter</span></p><p><span>ioctl(fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH, 1);  // Arm for exactly 1 more sample</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This cycle repeats for the duration of the profiling session, creating a stream of stack trace samples that are later
aggregated into flame graphs or heatmaps.</p>
<h2 id="the-kernel-bug"><a href="#the-kernel-bug">The Kernel Bug</a></h2>
<p>The kernel bug that caused my machine to freeze was introduced by commit <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/18dbcbfabfff">18dbcbfabfff ("perf: Fix the POLL_HUP delivery breakage")</a>.
Ironically, this commit was fixing a different bug, but it introduced a deadlock in the cpu-clock event handling.</p>

<p>When called from inside that same callback, it waits forever. Since this happens in interrupt context with interrupts disabled on the CPU,
that CPU becomes completely unresponsive. When this happens on multiple CPUs (which it does, since each thread has its own
<code>perf_event</code>), the entire system freezes.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix"><a href="#the-fix">The Fix</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/eb3182ef0405ff2f6668fd3e5ff9883f60ce8801">kernel patch</a> fixes this deadlock with two changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace <code>hrtimer_cancel()</code> with <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><p><span>- hrtimer_cancel(&amp;hwc-&gt;hrtimer);</span></p><p><span>+ hrtimer_try_to_cancel(&amp;hwc-&gt;hrtimer);</span></p></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/2424e146bee00ddb4d4f79d3224f54634ca8d2bc/kernel/time/hrtimer.c#L1347"><code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code></a> is non-blocking - it returns immediately with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> if the timer was not active</li>
<li><code>1</code> if the timer was successfully cancelled</li>
<li><code>-1</code> if the timer callback is currently running</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike <code>hrtimer_cancel()</code>, it doesn't spin waiting for the callback to finish. So when called from within the callback itself, it simply returns <code>-1</code> and continues.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use <code>PERF_HES_STOPPED</code> flag as a deferred stop signal</li>
</ol>
<p>The stop function now sets a flag:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>static void cpu_clock_event_stop(struct perf_event *event, int flags)</span></p><p><span>{</span></p><p><span>+   event-&gt;hw.state = PERF_HES_STOPPED;</span></p><p><span>    perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer(event);</span></p><p><span>    ...</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And the hrtimer callback checks this flag:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>static enum hrtimer_restart perf_swevent_hrtimer(struct hrtimer *hrtimer)</span></p><p><span>{</span></p><p><span>-   if (event-&gt;state != PERF_EVENT_STATE_ACTIVE)</span></p><p><span>+   if (event-&gt;state != PERF_EVENT_STATE_ACTIVE ||</span></p><p><span>+       event-&gt;hw.state &amp; PERF_HES_STOPPED)</span></p><p><span>        return HRTIMER_NORESTART;</span></p></pre></div>
<h3 id="how-it-works-together"><a href="#how-it-works-together">How It Works Together</a></h3>
<p>When <code>cpu_clock_event_stop()</code> is called from within the hrtimer callback:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>PERF_HES_STOPPED</code> flag is set</li>
<li><code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code> returns <code>-1</code> (callback running) - but doesn't block</li>
<li>Execution returns up the call stack back to <code>perf_swevent_hrtimer()</code></li>
<li><code>perf_swevent_hrtimer()</code> completes and returns <code>HRTIMER_NORESTART</code> (because <code>__perf_event_overflow()</code> returned <code>1</code>, indicating the event should stop)</li>
<li>The hrtimer subsystem sees <code>HRTIMER_NORESTART</code> and <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/2424e146bee00ddb4d4f79d3224f54634ca8d2bc/kernel/time/hrtimer.c#L1776-L1778">doesn't reschedule the timer</a></li>
</ol>
<p>When <code>cpu_clock_event_stop()</code> is called from outside the callback (normal case):</p>
<ol>
<li><code>PERF_HES_STOPPED</code> flag is set</li>
<li><code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code> returns <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> - timer is cancelled immediately</li>
<li>If by chance the callback fires before cancellation completes, it sees <code>PERF_HES_STOPPED</code> and returns <code>HRTIMER_NORESTART</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>PERF_HES_STOPPED</code> flag acts as a safety net to make sure the timer stops regardless of the race between setting the flag and the timer firing.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-a-kernel"><a href="#debugging-a-kernel">Debugging a kernel</a></h3>
<p>The explanation above is my understanding of the kernel bug and the fix based on reading the kernel source code.
I am a hacker, I like to tinker. A theoretical understanding is one thing, but I wanted to see it in action.
But how do you even debug a kernel? I'm not a kernel developer, but I decided to try. Here is how I did it.</p>
<p>My intuition was to use <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> since it allows one to emulate or virtualize a full machine. QEMU also has a built-in <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">GDB</a>
server that allows you to <a href="https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/gdb.html">connect GDB to the emulated machine</a>.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-qemu-with-ubuntu"><a href="#setting-up-qemu-with-ubuntu">Setting up QEMU with Ubuntu</a></h3>
<p>I downloaded an Ubuntu 25.10 ISO image and created a new empty VM disk image:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-25.10.qcow2 20G</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Then I launched QEMU to install Ubuntu:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ qemu-system-x86_64 \</span></p><p><span>    -enable-kvm \</span></p><p><span>    -m 4096 \</span></p><p><span>    -smp 4 \</span></p><p><span>    -drive file=ubuntu-25.10.qcow2,if=virtio \</span></p><p><span>    -cdrom ubuntu-25.10-desktop-amd64.iso \</span></p><p><span>    -boot d \</span></p><p><span>    -vga qxl</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The second command boots the VM from the ISO image and allows me to install Ubuntu on the VM disk image. I went through
the installation process as usual. I probably could have used a server edition or a prebuilt image, but at this
point I was already in unknown territory, so I wanted to make other things as simple as possible.</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="QEMU screen showing Ubuntu installation" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2025-12-11/ubuntu.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Ubuntu installation in QEMU</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Once the installation was complete, I rebooted the VM:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ qemu-system-x86_64 \</span></p><p><span>    -enable-kvm \</span></p><p><span>    -m 4096 \</span></p><p><span>    -smp 4 \</span></p><p><span>    -drive file=ubuntu-25.10.qcow2,if=virtio \</span></p><p><span>    -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::9000-:9000 \</span></p><p><span>    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \</span></p><p><span>    -monitor tcp:127.0.0.1:55555,server,nowait \</span></p><p><span>    -s</span></p></pre></div>
<p>and downloaded, unpacked and started QuestDB:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ curl -L https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/download/9.2.2/questdb-9.2.2-rt-linux-x86-64.tar.gz -o questdb.tar.gz</span></p><p><span>$ tar -xzvf questdb.tar.gz</span></p><p><span>$ cd questdb-9.2.2-rt-linux-x86-64</span></p><p><span>$ ./bin/questdb start</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This was meant to validate that QuestDB works in the VM at all. Firefox was already installed in the Ubuntu desktop
edition, so I just opened <code>http://localhost:9000</code> in Firefox and verified QuestDB web console was up and running.</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="QuestDB web console running in Ubuntu in QEMU" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2025-12-11/console.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>QuestDB web console in QEMU</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The next step was to stop QuestDB and start it with a profiler attached:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ ./bin/questdb stop</span></p><p><span>$ ./bin/questdb start -p</span></p></pre></div>
<p>At this point, I expected the virtual machine to freeze. However, it didn't. It was responsive as if nothing bad had
happened. That was a bummer. I wanted to see the deadlock in action!
I thought that perhaps QEMU is in a way shielding the virtual machine from the bug. But then I realized that the
default Ubuntu uses paranoia settings that prevent <code>perf_events</code> from working properly and async-profiler <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/c6c2fc1497ab06ff357146ed91fd27c0ce5640ba/src/profiler.cpp#L995-L998">falls back to
using <code>ctimer</code></a> when <code>perf_events</code> are restricted. The kernel bug specifically lives in the <code>perf_events</code> hrtimer
code path, so we must force async-profiler to use that path to trigger the bug.</p>
<p>To fix this, I changed the paranoia settings:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</span></p></pre></div>
<p>After this, I restarted QuestDB with the profiler again:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ ./bin/questdb stop</span></p><p><span>$ ./bin/questdb start -p</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And this time, the virtual machine froze as expected! Success! I was able to reproduce the problem in QEMU!</p>
<h3 id="attaching-gdb-to-qemu"><a href="#attaching-gdb-to-qemu">Attaching GDB to QEMU</a></h3>
<p>Now that I was able to reproduce the problem in QEMU, I wanted to attach GDB to the emulated machine to see the deadlock in action.</p>
<p>Let's start <code>GDB</code> on the host machine and connect it to QEMU's built-in GDB server:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ gdb</span></p><p><span>GNU gdb (Ubuntu 16.3-1ubuntu2) 16.3</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>(gdb) target remote :1234</span></p><p><span>Remote debugging using :1234</span></p><p><span>warning: No executable has been specified and target does not support</span></p><p><span>determining executable automatically.

<blockquote>
<p>Side note: We just casually attached a debugger to a live kernel! How cool is that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see 4 threads corresponding to the 4 CPUs in the VM. The <code>bt</code> command shows the stack traces of all threads, but there is not much useful information since we don't have the kernel symbols loaded in GDB.
Let's fix this. I am lazy again and take advantage of running exactly the same kernel version as the host machine so I can use the host's kernel image and symbol files.</p>
<p>On the host machine, we need to add repositories with debug symbols and install the debug symbols for the running kernel:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com questing main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list</span></p><p><span>echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com questing-updates main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list</span></p><p><span>echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com questing-proposed main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list</span></p><p><span>sudo apt install ubuntu-dbgsym-keyring</span></p><p><span>sudo apt update</span></p><p><span>sudo apt install linux-image-$(uname -r)-dbgsym</span></p></pre></div>
<p>With the debug symbols installed, I started GDB again and loaded the kernel image and symbols:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ gdb /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)</span></p><p><span>GNU gdb (Ubuntu 16.3-1ubuntu2) 16.3</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>gdb) target remote :1234</span></p><p><span>Remote debugging using :1234</span></p><p><span>0xffffffff9e9614d3 in ??

()</span></p><p><span>  4    Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [running]) 0xffffffff9e9614d3 in ?? ()</span></p><p><span>(gdb) quit</span></p></pre></div>
<p>and symbols were still NOT resolved! I had to capitulate and ask a LLM for help. After a bit of brainstorming, we
realized that the kernel is compiled with <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html">KASLR</a> enabled, so the kernel is loaded at a random address at each boot.
The simplest way to fix this is to disable KASLR, I could not care less about security in my test VM. To disable KASLR, I edited the GRUB configuration, added the <code>nokaslr</code> parameter, updated GRUB and rebooted the VM:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ vim /etc/default/grub</span></p><p><span># Add nokaslr to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line</span></p><p><span>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nokaslr"</span></p><p><span>$ sudo update-grub</span></p><p><span>$ sudo reboot</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Then I set the paranoia settings again, started QuestDB with the profiler and attached GDB again. This time, the symbols were resolved correctly!</p>
<div><pre><p><span>$ gdb /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)</span></p><p><span>GNU gdb (Ubuntu 16.3-1ubuntu2) 16.3</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>(gdb) target remote :1234</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>(gdb) info threads</span></p><p><span>  Id   Target Id                    Frame</span></p><p><span>* 1    Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3a460) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351</span></p><p><span>  2    Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3b520) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351</span></p><p><span>  3    Thread 1.3 (CPU#2 [running]) hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343d028) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p><p><span>  4    Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [running]) hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This looks much better! We can see that the first 2 threads are stuck in <code>csd_lock_wait()</code> function, presumably waiting for locks held by the other CPUs
and threads 3 and 4 are in <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code>.</p>
<p>The threads 3 and 4 are the interesting ones since they execute a function related to the kernel bug we are investigating.

<p>We can see the exact sequence of function calls leading to the deadlock: <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code> called from <code>cpu_clock_event_stop()</code>, called from <code>__perf_event_overflow()</code>, called from <code>perf_swevent_hrtimer()</code>.
This matches our understanding of the bug perfectly! This is the infinite loop in <code>hrtimer_cancel()</code> that causes the
deadlock.</p>
<h2 id="forensics-and-playing-god"><a href="#forensics-and-playing-god">Forensics and Playing God</a></h2>
<p>Okay, I have to admit that seeing a kernel stack trace is already somewhat satisfying, but we have a live (well,
half-dead) kernel under a debugger. Let's have some fun. I want to touch the deadlock and understand why it took
down the  whole machine, and see if we can perform a miracle and bring it back to life.</p>
<h4>Confirming the suspect</h4>
<p>We know <code>hrtimer_cancel</code> is waiting for a callback to finish. But which callback? The stack trace says <code>perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer</code>,
but let's verify the hrtimer struct in memory actually points to the function we blame.</p>
<p>I switched to the stuck thread (Thread 4 in my case) and looked at frame #0:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) thread 4</span></p><p><span>[Switching to thread 4 (Thread 1.4)]</span></p><p><span>#0  hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p><p><span>1359	in /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c</span></p><p><span>(gdb) frame 0</span></p><p><span>#0  hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p><p><span>1359	in /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c</span></p><p><span>(gdb) print *timer</span></p><p><span>$1 = {node = {node = {__rb_parent_color = 18446612682661667048, rb_right = 0x0, rb_left = 0x0}, expires = 48514879474}, _softexpires = 48514879474, function = 0xffffffff81716dd0 &lt;perf_swevent_hrtimer&gt;, base = 0xffff88813bda1440, state = 0 '\000', is_rel = 0 '\000', is_soft = 0 '\000', is_hard = 1 '\001'}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Let me explain these GDB commands: <code>frame 0</code> selects the innermost stack frame - the function currently executing.
In a backtrace, frame 0 is the current function, frame 1 is its caller, frame 2 is the caller's caller, and so on.
By selecting frame 0, I can inspect local variables and parameters in <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>print *timer</code> command dereferences the <code>timer</code> pointer and displays the contents of the <code>struct hrtimer</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>struct hrtimer {</span></p><p><span>    struct timerqueue_node  node;</span></p><p><span>    ktime_t                 _softexpires;</span></p><p><span>    enum hrtimer_restart    (*function)(struct hrtimer *);</span></p><p><span>    struct hrtimer_clock_base *base;</span></p><p><span>    u8                      state;</span></p><p><span>    u8                      is_rel;</span></p><p><span>    u8                      is_soft;</span></p><p><span>    u8                      is_hard;</span></p><p><span>};</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The key field here is <code>function</code> - a pointer to a callback function that takes a <code>struct hrtimer *</code> and returns
<code>enum hrtimer_restart</code>. This callback is invoked when the timer fires. GDB shows it points to <code>0xffffffff81716dd0</code> and helpfully resolves this address to <code>perf_swevent_hrtimer</code>. Since we're currently <em>inside</em> <code>perf_swevent_hrtimer</code> (look at frame #6 in our backtrace above), this confirms the self-deadlock: the timer is trying to cancel itself while its own callback is still running!</p>
<h4>The Mystery of the "Other" CPUs</h4>
<p>One question remained: If CPUs 3 and 4 are deadlocked in a loop, why did the entire machine freeze? Why couldn't I just SSH in and kill the process?
The answer lies in those other threads we saw earlier, stuck in <code>csd_lock_wait</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) thread 1</span></p><p><span>[Switching to thread 1 (Thread 1.1)]</span></p><p><span>#0  csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3a460) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351</span></p><p><span>warning: 351	/build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c: No such file or directory</span></p></pre></div>
<p><code>CSD</code> stands for Call Function Single Data. In Linux, when one CPU wants another CPU to do something (like flush a TLB
or stop a perf_event), it sends an IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt).
If the target CPU is busy with interrupts disabled (which is exactly the case for our deadlocked CPUs 3 and 4), it never responds.</p>
<p>The sender (CPU 0) sits there <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/fe90f3967bdb3e13f133e5f44025e15f943a99c5/include/asm-generic/barrier.h#L260-L274">spinning</a>,
waiting for the other <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/83e6384374bac8a9da3411fae7f24376a7dbd2a3/kernel/smp.c#L547">CPU to say "Done!"</a>. Eventually, all CPUs end up waiting for the stuck CPUs and the entire
system grinds to a halt.</p>
<h4>Performing a Kernel Resurrection</h4>
<p>This is the part where the real black magic starts. We know the kernel is stuck in this loop in <code>hrtimer_cancel</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>do {</span></p><p><span>    ret = hrtimer_try_to_cancel(timer);</span></p><p><span>} while (ret &lt; 0);</span></p></pre></div>
<p>As long as <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel</code> returns <code>-1</code> (which it does, because the callback is running), the loop continues
forever.</p>
<p>But we have GDB. We can change reality.</p>
<p>If we force the function to return <code>0</code> (meaning "timer not active"), the loop should break, <code>cpu_clock_event_stop</code>
should finish, and the kernel should unfreeze. It might crash 1 millisecond later because we left the timer in an
inconsistent state, but perhaps it's worth trying.</p>
<p>First, let's double-check we are in the innermost frame, inside <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) thread 4</span></p><p><span>[Switching to thread 4 (Thread 1.4)]</span></p><p><span>#0  hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p><p><span>warning: 1359	/build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c: No such file or directory</span></p><p><span>(gdb) frame 0</span></p><p><span>#0  hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p><p><span>1359	in /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Use the GDB <code>finish</code> command to let the function run to completion and pause right when it returns to the caller:</p>

<p>We are now sitting at line 1490, right at the check <code>if (ret &lt; 0)</code>.</p>
<div><pre><p><span>int hrtimer_cancel(struct hrtimer *timer)</span></p><p><span>{</span></p><p><span>	int ret;</span></p><p><span>	do {</span></p><p><span>		ret = hrtimer_try_to_cancel(timer);</span></p><p><span>		if (ret &lt; 0) // &lt;-- we are here</span></p><p><span>			hrtimer_cancel_wait_running(timer);</span></p><p><span>	} while (ret &lt; 0);</span></p><p><span>	return ret;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>On x86_64, integer return values are passed in the <code>%rax</code> register.
Since <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel</code> returns an <code>int</code> (32-bit), we can use <code>$eax</code> (the lower 32 bits of <code>%rax</code>):</p>

<p>Exactly as expected. <code>-1</code> means the timer callback is running, so the loop will continue.
But since the CPU is paused, we can overwrite this value. We can lie to the kernel and tell it the timer was
successfully cancelled (return code 1) or inactive (return code 0). I chose 0.</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) set $eax = 0</span></p><p><span>(gdb) print $eax</span></p><p><span>$3 = 0</span></p></pre></div>
<p>I crossed my fingers and unpaused the VM:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) continue</span></p><p><span>Continuing.</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And it did nothing. The VM was still frozen. Let's see what is going on:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) info threads</span></p><p><span>  Id   Target Id                    Frame</span></p><p><span>  1    Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3a460) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351</span></p><p><span>  2    Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3b520) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351</span></p><p><span>  3    Thread 1.3 (CPU#2 [running]) hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343d028) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359</span></p><p><span>* 4    Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3b560) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Now, thread 4 is also stuck in <code>csd_lock_wait</code>, just like threads 1 and 2. We managed to escape from the infinite
loop in thread 4, but thread 3 is still stuck in <code>hrtimer_try_to_cancel</code>.</p>
<p>We could try the same trick on thread 3, but would this be enough to unfreeze the entire system? For starters, we
tricked the kernel into thinking the timer was inactive, but in reality it is still active.  This is very thin ice
to skate on - we might have just created more problems for ourselves. And more importantly, even if the kernel could
escape the deadlock, the profiler would immediately try to re-arm the timer again, leading us back into the same
deadlock.</p>
<p>So I decided to give up on the resurrection attempt. The kernel was stuck, but at least I understood the problem now and I was pretty happy with my newly acquired kernel debugging skills.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>While I couldn't perform a miracle and resurrect the frozen kernel, I walked away with a much deeper understanding
of the machinery behind Linux <code>perf_events</code> and hrtimers. I learned how to set up QEMU for kernel debugging, how to attach GDB to a live kernel, and how to inspect kernel data structures in memory.</p>
<p>For QuestDB users, the takeaway is simple: if you are on a kernel version 6.17, use the <code>-e ctimer</code> flag when
profiling. It bypasses the buggy <code>perf_events</code> hrtimer path entirely. Or just wait for either the kernel fix to land
in your distro or the next QuestDB release, which will <a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6473">include</a> an
async-profiler version that <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/pull/1599">works around this issue</a>.</p>
<p>As for me, I’m going back to my code. The next time my machine freezes, I might just reboot it like a normal person. But where is the fun in that?</p>
<h2 id="addendum:-the-second-resurrection-attempt"><a href="#addendum:-the-second-resurrection-attempt">Addendum: The Second Resurrection Attempt</a></h2>
<p>After writing this post, I kept thinking about that failed resurrection attempt. We got so close: We broke one CPU out of the deadlock, but the other was still stuck. I should have tried harder!
So I started QEMU again, reproduced the deadlock, and this time came with a plan: use GDB to force kernel to kill the QuestDB Java process, so the profiler can't re-arm the timer.</p>
<p>First, I needed to find the Java process. The <code>perf_event</code> structure has an owner field pointing to the task that created it:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) print event-&gt;owner</span></p><p><span>$1 = (struct task_struct *) 0xffff88810b2ed100</span></p><p><span>(gdb) print ((struct task_struct *)0xffff88810b2ed100)-&gt;comm</span></p><p><span>$2 = "java"</span></p><p><span>(gdb) print ((struct task_struct *)0xffff88810b2ed100)-&gt;pid</span></p><p><span>$3 = 4488</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Great, we found the Java process with PID 4488. Now, how do you kill a process when the kernel is deadlocked and can't process signals?
You store the signal directly in memory. <code>SIGKILL</code> is signal 9, which means bit 8 in the signal bitmask:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) set ((struct task_struct *)0xffff88810b2ed100)-&gt;signal-&gt;shared_pending.signal.sig[0] = 0x100</span></p></pre></div>
<p>With the pending kill signal in place, I broke the deadlock loop as before. The system hit another deadlock - a different CPU was now stuck waiting for a spinlock.
The lock value showed it was held:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) print *((unsigned int *)0xffff88813bda1400)</span></p><p><span>$4 = 1</span></p></pre></div>
<p>I forcibly released the lock <em>(what could possibly go wrong?)</em>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) set *((unsigned int *)0xffff88813bda1400) = 0</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Then broke another <code>hrtimer</code> loop on a different CPU. It was like playing whack-a-mole with deadlocks - each Java thread had its own <code>perf_event</code>, and they were all hitting the same bug.</p>
<p>After a few rounds of this, I ran continue and checked the threads:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>(gdb) continue</span></p><p><span>Continuing.</span></p><p><span>^C</span></p><p><span>Thread 4 received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.</span></p><p><span>0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82</span></p><p><span>(gdb) info threads</span></p><p><span>  Id   Target Id                    Frame</span></p><p><span>  1    Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82</span></p><p><span>  2    Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82</span></p><p><span>  3    Thread 1.3 (CPU#2 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82</span></p><p><span>* 4    Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82</span></p><p><span>(gdb) continue</span></p></pre></div>

<p>I looked at the QEMU window. The desktop was responsive. The mouse moved. Java was gone - killed by the <code>SIGKILL</code> we planted before breaking the deadlock.
We actually did it. We resurrected a kernel-deadlocked machine by lying to it about return values, forcibly releasing locks, and planting signals in process memory.
Would I recommend this in production (or anywhere outside a lab)? Absolutely not. But was it fun? Totally!</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Using newly-assembled data from 1980 through 2024, we show that 25% of scientifically-active, US-trained STEM PhD graduates leave the US within 15 years of graduating. Leave rates are lower in the life sciences and higher in AI and quantum science but overall have been stable for decades. Contrary to common perceptions, US technology benefits from these graduates' work even if they leave: though the US share of global patent citations to graduates' science drops from 70% to 50% after migrating, it remains five times larger than the destination country share, and as large as all other countries combined. These results highlight the value that the US derives from training foreign scientists - not only when they stay, but even when they leave.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most people put too much effort into everything they do. Here’s a good example from Kristijan around tension in his hands when touching and holding things:</p>
<figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Something clicked about inhibition and non-doing (in Alexander Technique), and the strongest effect has been a relaxation of my hands.</p><p>Like I was touching and holding things with 40% more tension than required for that object or activity.<a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=expandingawareness.org">@m_ashcroft</a> any thoughts?</p></div>— Kristijan (@kristijan_moves) <a href="https://twitter.com/kristijan_moves/status/1958193756114423812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=expandingawareness.org">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>It’s a great example, because gripping too tightly, as we might with the hands, is a great metaphor for what it’s like everywhere else in your system. There’s a pattern of pervasive over-gripping that, once you start to look for it, you will find everywhere.</p>
<p>There is an appropriate amount of energy required for each activity. Holding a cup, turning a steering wheel, or writing a blog post all need exactly the amount of energy that they need. This may sound like a truism, but if it were so obvious, why do many drivers often realise they are driving with a vice-like grip, with tension running up into their shoulders and jaws?</p>
<p>Let me share my slightly unusual definition of “effort”: it’s the felt experience of expending energy beyond what an activity requires, like tensing your brow when you try to understand something, or the excess tension in your hand when you hold your phone<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Using this definition, it’s clear that the appropriate amount of <em>effort</em> for any activity is zero.</p>
<p>This idea is where the concept of non-doing can trip people up, because it doesn’t mean no action. It means no effort, even though the amount of energy required could be large. Or, to borrow from Daoist wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished." — Lao Tzu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nature is an enormous flow of energy, yet nature makes no effort. Everything nature does is perfectly well-suited to what it does, and it cannot be otherwise.  This is why non-doing comes with a felt experience of effortlessness, when it seems like everything is working exactly the way it’s supposed to be.</p>
<p>Consider this quote from Katie Ledecky who, with 14 Olympic medals, is described as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky?ref=expandingawareness.org">the most decorated female swimmer in history</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I felt so relaxed. It just felt very easy, and that's why it surprised me that I had broken my world record.” — <em>Katie Ledecky</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but trying too hard can reduce performance. Here’s marathoner Ryan Hall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… you don't get your best performances by trying harder. When you see the guy who wins the race, he usually jogs out of it waving to the crowd, feeling good. The people who look the worst come in after the top guy.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> – <em>Ryan Hall</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why is it so common to effort when it both feels harder and reduces performance?</p>
<p>For one thing, there are all kinds of societal scripts in the modern age that push us in that direction. All those hustle bros captured by <a href="https://michaelashcroft.com/writing/awakening-to-and-escapting-from-total-work/?ref=expandingawareness.org">Total Work</a> push their grindset worldview, recapitulating the Protestant work ethic for new audiences. The influence of these cultural waters on our psychophysical wiring can’t be overstated.</p>
<p>These scripts team up with one of the core principles of Alexander Technique: Faulty Sensory Appreciation. When you try so hard all the time, that level of effort feels familiar and you stop noticing it. Put another way, years of overdoing mis-calibrate your senses so effort feels right and ease feels wrong. If you follow your feelings, you are guided back to that same old familiar where you’re trying too hard without even realising it.</p>
<p>By the way, this phenomenon happens <em>all the time</em> in many other domains, and can be the cause of much trouble.</p>
<p>What all this means is that when you pull back the effort below your familiar baseline, it can feel unfamiliar, like you’re not trying hard enough, and those societal scripts I mentioned before can make this experience hard to stay in, even if you’re now closer to the appropriate amount of energy needed.</p>
<p>The way out of this is to experiment with feeling the unfamiliarity of trying less hard and seeing what it’s like. In Kristijan’s case, he played with this for long enough that his sensory perception updated to reflect what was going on more accurately, and he was able to feel that he had been using too much tension before.</p>
<p>So I invite you to go about your day and practice dropping the effort. See how weird it feels, but notice how the activity is still getting done. See what it’s like to drop the energy too low, where you might become lethargic or your performance drops. Notice the sweet spot as a surprising experience of ease and a kind of elegance: the less you grip, the smoother and more precise the movement.</p>
<p>Happy experimenting!</p>

              <p>Let’s Encrypt is introducing several updates to the certificates we issue, including new root certificates, the deprecation of TLS client authentication, and shortening certificate lifetimes. To help roll out changes gradually, we’re making use of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/09/acme-profiles">ACME profiles</a> to allow users to have control over when some of these changes take place. For most users, no action is required.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt has generated two new Root Certification Authorities (CAs) and six new Intermediate CAs, which we’re collectively calling the “Generation Y” hierarchy. These are cross-signed from our existing “Generation X” roots, X1 and X2, so will continue to work anywhere our current roots are trusted.</p>
<p>Most users get certificates from our default <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/#classic">classic</a> profile, unless they’ve opted into another profile. This profile will switch to the new Generation Y hierarchy on May 13 2026. These new intermediates do not contain the “TLS Client Authentication” Extended Key Usage due to an upcoming root program requirement. We have previously announced our plans to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/05/14/ending-tls-client-authentication">end TLS Client Authentication</a> starting in February 2026, which will coincide with the switch to the Generation Y hierarchy. Users who encounter issues or need an extended period to switch can use our <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/#tlsclient">tlsclient</a> profile until May 2026, which will also remain on our existing Generation X roots.</p>
<p>If you’re requesting certificates from our <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/#tlsserver">tlsserver</a> or <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/profiles/#shortlived">shortlived</a> profiles, you’ll begin to see certificates which come from the Generation Y hierarchy this week. This switch will also mark the opt-in general availability of short-lived certificates from Let’s Encrypt, including support for IP Addresses on certificates.</p>
<p>We also announced our timeline to comply with upcoming changes to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/">CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements</a>, which will require us to shorten the length of time our certificates are valid for. Next year, you’ll be able to opt-in to 45 day certificates for early adopters and testing via the tlsserver profile. In 2027, we’ll lower the default certificate lifetime to 64 days, and then to 45 in 2028. For the full timeline and details, please see our post on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/02/from-90-to-45">decreasing certificate lifetimes to 45 days</a>.</p>
<p>For most users, no action is required, but we recommend reviewing the linked blog posts announcing each of these changes for more details. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask here, on this forum.</p>

<p>Neither of us had prior experience developing mobile apps, but we thought, “Hey, we’re both smart. This shouldn’t be too difficult.”</p>

<h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Once upon a time, in the distant memory that is 2023, a new instant messaging app called Converso was launched. Converso made some pretty impressive claims about its security: it claimed to implement state of the art end-to-end encryption, to collect no metadata, and to use a decentralized architecture that involved no servers at all. Unfortunately, security researcher crnković <a href="https://crnkovic.dev/testing-converso/">did some basic reverse engineering and traffic analysis</a> and found all of these claims to be completely baseless, with Converso collecting plenty of metadata on every message and using a third-party E2EE provider to store messages on bog standard centralized servers. Even more unfortunately, crnković also found that Converso implemented the (perfectly functional if used properly) Seald E2EE service in such a way that encrypted messages’ keys could be derived from publicly available information, and also uploaded a copy of every encrypted message to an open Firebase bucket, meaning every message ever sent on the service could be trivially read by anyone with an Internet connection. After being informed of the vulnerabilities, Converso initially released an update claiming to fix them, then withdrew from the App Store and Google Play to “address and improve the issues.”</p>
<p>Not one to give up after a setback, Converso CEO Tanner Haas took a break from self-publishing books on <a href="https://archive.ph/6mywl">how to achieve and receive anything you want</a> to regroup and relaunch, as well as to bless the world with a <a href="https://archive.ph/CormV">lessons learned</a> blog post describing his decision to rebrand after realizing that “<em>privacy concerns were primarily coming from conservative circles</em>,” and imparting nuggets of wisdom such as “<em>accept criticism and get better: don’t complain</em>” and “<em>ensure the product has been thoroughly tested and is ready for prime-time</em>.” Presumably he hadn’t learned the first one yet when he responded to crnković’s responsible disclosure with vague legal threats and accusations of being a Signal shill. Let’s see how the second is going.</p>
<h2 id="part-0-setup">Part 0: Setup<a href="#part-0-setup" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>As usual, I start out by downloading the app from Google Play and running it while monitoring traffic with HTTP Toolkit. I quickly ran into Freedom Chat’s first security feature: as detailed on <a href="https://freedomchat.com/">their website</a>, the app “<em>prevent[s] screenshots and screen recordings entirely with built-in screenshot protection,</em>” perhaps to accomodate conservatives’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Republican_group_chat_leaks">complicated relationship with screenshots</a>. Screenshots aren’t really crucial to anything being discussed here, but I like to provide only the best blog posts to my tens of readers, so let’s hook the app with Frida and <a href="https://www.securify.nl/en/blog/android-frida-hooking-disabling-flagsecure/">disable the FLAG_SECURE attribute</a>. With that out of the way, the signup process works as expected for an instant messaging app - we type in a phone number, get texted a 2FA code, and enter it to create an account. We’re asked whether we want to create a PIN, which is apparently optional to log in on my own phone and required if we want to restore our account on another device, then get to the main UI of the app. There are two main features here: a Chat pane where we can start chats with contacts, and a Channels pane where we can subscribe to user-run microblogging channels à la Telegram.</p>

<p>Let’s start out with the basics and have a conversation with a second account. Sending a text message triggers the following exchange:</p>

<p>This is the encrypted and Base64-encoded text we sent, along with some metadata for things like read receipts and editing and the identifiers needed for decryption (they’re using the same Seald backend that Converso had, without uploading everything to Firebase this time). Sending a photo and a voice message yields similar results.
While verifying that they’re using Seald properly this time would require painstakingly decompiling and reverse engineering React Native’s <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hermes">Hermes VM bytecode</a>, at a high level this seems fine. Let’s move on to the Channels feature. When we open the tab, we see that we’ve already been added to a Freedom Chat
channel, which mostly posts about updates to the app and related media coverage.</p>

<p>We’re also suggested a handful of other channels to join, including that of Tanner Haas and some people who are apparently conservative influencers. Tanner mostly seems to use his to post fascinating political takes:</p>

<p>The <code>members</code> array has 1519 entries in that format, apparently one for each member of the channel. What’s going on in that <code>user</code> object? The <code>pin</code> field seems suspiciously related to the PIN we were asked to input after creating our account… To confirm, we can sort the array by <code>createdAt</code> and find that the most recent entry does indeed have the PIN we just set when making our account. So
anyone who’s in a channel (i.e. anyone who hasn’t left the default Freedom Chat channel) has their PIN broadcast to every other user! There’s no direct link between PINs and phone numbers here, but this is still not great.</p>

<p>If we scroll back a bit in the Freedom Chat channel, we see this message dunking on WhatsApp:</p>
<figure><img src="https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/super-secure-maga-messaging-app-leaks-everyones-phone-number/whatsapp.png" width="40%" height="40%">

<p>The vulnerability they’re talking about was presented in a <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/en/news/detail/forscherinnen-entdecken-grosse-sicherheitsluecke-in-whatsapp">paper</a> by researchers at the University of Vienna. The paper is interesting and you should go read it, but to summarize, WhatsApp failed to rate limit the API that eats up every phone number in your contacts and checks whether
they also use WhatsApp or not. Researchers were thus able to test nearly every possible phone number in the world, and end up with a dump of every WhatsApp user’s phone number, along with some other metadata. It’s interesting that Freedom Chat isn’t vulnerable to this, because they have the same contact discovery feature WhatsApp does, with the app offering you to either start a chat
or invite each of your contacts depending on whether they already have an account:</p>

<p>The first two numbers in the request are the two we used to register Freedom Chat accounts. The third is a number we didn’t register, as a control. A couple things are interesting here. Most obviously, this is <em>exactly</em> the WhatsApp API the Vienna researchers exploited, and will contain the same vulnerability if not rate limited. This endpoint also provides a linkage
between phone numbers and UIDs - if we could run every registered phone number through it, we could get each number’s UID and match it to the UIDs in the Channels response to get that number’s PIN, entirely defeating the PIN mechanism. Now we just need to test whether it’s rate limited</p>

<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We generate every valid 7-digit North American phone number, then for every area code, send every number in batches of 40000, plus a number we registered so we can check for false empty responses. We log
responses that don’t contain the string “uid” exactly once; if a response contains it 0 times it has failed to produce our registered number and is thus faulty somehow, if a response contains it 2+ times we have found another number. We also
reauthenticate as needed and note if we start to slow down the server at all. Yes, there are a million ways to make this concurrent and faster, but we’re trying to enumerate not DDOS their server, and at ~1.5 seconds average RTT we should be able
to test every American phone number in about a day.</p>
<p>The log file starts to fill up with entries within a few minutes:</p>

</code></pre><p>Time to go do something else for a while. Just over 27 hours and one ill-fated attempt at early season ski touring later, the script has finished happily, the logfile is full of entries, and no request has failed or taken longer than 3 seconds. So much for rate limiting. We’ve leaked
every Freedom Chat user’s phone number, and unless they happened to leave the default channel, we’ve also matched their phone number to their PIN, rendering the entire PIN feature pointless.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main_content_wrap">
        <h2>The future is (still) now</h2>

<p>The premier UX of the 21st century just got a little better: With <code>chafa</code>,
  you can now view very, very reasonable approximations
  of pictures and animations in the comfort of your
  favorite terminal emulator. The power of ANSI X3.64 compels you!</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You can get fair results by using only U+2580 (upper half
block). Other terminal graphics packages do this, and so can Chafa
with <code>chafa&nbsp;--symbols&nbsp;vhalf</code>. However, Chafa
uses more symbols by default, greatly improving quality.</p>



<p>
There are more examples in the <a href="https://hpjansson.org/chafa/gallery/">gallery</a>!
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Supports most popular image formats, including animated GIFs.</li>
  <li>Outputs to all popular terminal graphics formats: Sixels, Kitty, iTerm2, Unicode mosaics.</li>
  <li>Combines Unicode symbols from multiple selectable ranges for optimal output.</li>
  <li>Fullwidth character support, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean.</li>
  <li>Glyphs can be loaded from any font file supported by Freetype (TTF, OTF, PCF, etc).</li>
  <li>Multiple color modes, including Truecolor, 256-color, 16-color and simple FG/BG.</li>
  <li>RGB and DIN99d color spaces for improved color picking.</li>
  <li>Alpha transparency support in any color mode, including in animations.</li>
  <li>Works with most modern and classic terminals and terminal emulators.</li>
  <li>Documented, stable C API.</li>
  <li>Fast &amp; lean: SIMD optimized, multithreaded.</li>
  <li>Suitable for terminal graphics, ANSI art composition and even black &amp; white print.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of the features are discussed in a series of blog posts:

</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Chafa will print a help text if run without arguments, or with <code>chafa --help</code>.
It also comes with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/chafa/man/">man page</a> displayable with <code>man chafa</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://hpjansson.org/chafa/gallery/">gallery</a> contains examples of how command-line options can
be used to tweak the output.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://hpjansson.org/chafa/ref/">C API documentation for application developers</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mage.black/">Erica Ferrua Edwardsdóttir</a> is developing <a href="https://chafapy.mage.black/">Python bindings</a> that allow Chafa to be used in Python programs. These are documented on their own site.</p>

<p><a href="https://hector.molinero.dev/">Héctor Molinero Fernández</a> maintains <a href="https://github.com/hectorm/chafa-wasm">JavaScript bindings</a> that allow Chafa to be used in Node.js, web browsers, and more. These are documented on their own site.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>Please bring your questions to our <s>secret business</s> friendly Matrix chat. Stay a
while and listen, or talk about terminals, software or your choice of breakfast cereal. All
are welcome, but an appreciation for terminals, programming and/or computer graphics is
likely to enhance your experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#chafa:matrix.org"><img src="https://hpjansson.org/chafa/img/friendly-chat.svg" alt="Friendly Chat"></a></p>

<p>Although the chat's history is hidden from non-members, this is a public forum, so if
your ambition is to overthrow the government/megacorps by way of an underground
network of refurbished Minitels, you may want to keep it under your hat. Furthermore,
and hopefully obviously, we treat our fellow humans with respect. Have fun!</p>

He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement. </p><p>Sebastien Lai told the BBC earlier this year that his father's "body is breaking down" - "Given his age, given his health... he will <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cger51y928ro">die in prison</a>."</p><p>The Hong Kong government has also been criticised for barring foreign lawyers from working on NSL cases without prior permission. They said it was a national security risk, although foreign lawyers had operated in the city's courts for decades.

An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck. </p><p>"We all feel frustrated and powerless. Yet, there must be an ending to the whole issue and time comes when it comes," a former Apple Daily journalist, who was also in court, told the BBC.</p><p>"Jimmy always said that he was indebted to Hong Kong... but I think Hong Kong and most Hong Kongers are so grateful to have him upholding the core values, good faith and integrity for the community at the expense of his well being and personal freedom."</p><p>In his testimony, Lai had said that he had "never allowed" his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he described as a "conspiracy" and "too crazy to think about".</p><p>"The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong," he had said. These values, he added, include the "rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly".</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="hcfe-content" role="main">                   <article class="page" sc-render-smart-button="false" itemscope=""> <div data-stats-ve="35"><p>We are discontinuing the dark web report, which was meant to scan the dark web for your personal information. The key dates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>January 15, 2026:</strong> The scans for new dark web breaches stop.</li>
  <li><strong>February 16, 2026:</strong> The dark web report&nbsp;is no longer available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understand why dark web report is discontinued</h2>

<p>While the report offered general information, feedback showed that it didn't provide helpful next steps. We're making this change to instead focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online. We'll continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools that help protect you and your personal information.</p>

<p>We encourage you to use the existing tools we offer to strengthen your security and privacy, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Security Checkup</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/passkeys/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Create a Passkey to Log Into Your Google Account</a></li>

And even though some of you might be thinking "good riddance, who uses these slow old drives now, anyway?" – well, yes, they are outdated, but there are still buyers looking for budget-friendly SSDs who go this route.</p><p>That could be especially true if people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/i-build-pcs-for-a-living-here-are-the-6-worst-things-youre-doing-to-your-pc-and-how-to-fix-them" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/i-build-pcs-for-a-living-here-are-the-6-worst-things-youre-doing-to-your-pc-and-how-to-fix-them">building a PC</a> are forking out a fortune for RAM, as the price of that potentially shoots up further next year, and folks look to make savings elsewhere.</p><p>As to the reality of how many buyers of SATA SSDs there are, MLID theorizes that it's something in the order of 20% of the solid-state drive market, pointing out that some of the top sellers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> are SATA drives. Samsung likely represents something like half of those sales, so these drives disappearing from shelves could account for the supply of budget SSDs drying up as 2026 rolls onwards. Fewer cheap SSDs could also put pricing pressure on more affordable NVMe models, too.</p><p>Why is Samsung making this move? That would be because NVMe drives are simply more profitable, with higher premiums to be charged – as they are a lot faster than SATA products – and they're easier to manufacture, too (as a bare board that plugs into the motherboard, as opposed to a full drive with a case).</p><p>Samsung is going to be focusing on making HBM4 memory and GDDR7 video RAM, as well as NVMe SSDs, all of which are more profitable enterprises, particularly given the current AI boom.</p><p>Needless to say, if you're looking at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-solid-state-drives-ssds" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-solid-state-drives-ssds">buying an SSD</a>, now is likely the best time to act, especially if you can find anything in the way of a holiday deal on a drive – because as of Q1 2026, prices could head upwards quite quickly, particularly for budget SSDs.</p><p>Most predictions have memory supply levels being tight until 2027, if not longer – and MLID reckons we're looking at maybe late in 2026, possibly through to mid-2027, before pricing woes settle down somewhat.</p><p>Don't forget that storage and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/why-is-ram-so-expensive-right-now-its-more-complicated-than-you-think" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/why-is-ram-so-expensive-right-now-its-more-complicated-than-you-think">RAM price hikes</a> don't just impact those individual components and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/desktop-pcs/built-vs-bought-why-prebuilt-systems-are-always-superior-to-custom-gaming-pcs" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/desktop-pcs/built-vs-bought-why-prebuilt-systems-are-always-superior-to-custom-gaming-pcs">prebuilt PCs</a>, but also laptops.</p><hr id="486d1aa1-62f6-4b3d-a127-dec582c3e1cf"><div id="slice-container-person-4qA9ZreQ58tyf8kgq7vnp6-VWv2IqqHDXlqI8MyZRhfsaTINDPvnoyM"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="false"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA-140-80.png.webp 140w" sizes="99vw" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA-140-80.png 140w" sizes="99vw" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" alt="A WD_Black SN8100 ssd against a white background" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA-140-80.png 140w" sizes="99vw" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMZukRzZ6NdqkZrUQcGPyA.png" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div></figure></div><hr id="9abeba17-838c-4d2f-9646-5371797af060"><p id="86320b94-592f-40ab-8dd4-b50aab468745"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="Z2M3ANX3OVHE7AJEJ2RHC4MRFM">Paul Friday remembers when his hand started flopping in the cold weather – the first sign nerve cells in his brain were dying.</p><p id="W2ZE2LIMJFE3ZJCXFF2QQIPBB4">He was eventually diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a brain disease that gets worse over time. His limbs got stiffer. He struggled to walk. He couldn’t keep living on his family farm. Shortly afterward, Friday came to believe that decades of spraying a pesticide called paraquat at his peach orchard in southwestern Michigan may be the culprit.</p><p id="P2JCXDFYURB55A2RQKEMJTSQZA">“It explained to me why I have Parkinson’s disease,” said Friday, who is now 83, and makes that claim in a pending lawsuit.</p><p id="VRUL3AZYOJBDFJBELVLBCNTMRQ">The pesticide, a weed killer, is extremely toxic.</p><p id="7YB674MWOVDNZKFFDB45BXCDII">With evidence of its harms stacking up, it’s already been banned in dozens of countries all over the world, including the United Kingdom and China, where it’s made.

We stand by the safety of paraquat.”</p><p id="M4QGZGICNZCT5M7ESKM3H3NIEE">Chevron has also denied the claims saying the “scientific consensus is that paraquat has not been shown to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease.” </p><h2>What company files show</h2><p id="4XOEMU7DM5FVNOWYGLSHIRJX7U">A trove of internal documents released during litigation, <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/paraquat-papers-media-library/" target="_blank" rel="">as reported by The Guardian and the New Lede</a>, appeared to show that the manufacturers were aware of evidence that paraquat could collect in the brain.</p><p id="Z6QBJSAR2ZFL7PF4NROAAZ5MSA">But the New Lede acknowledged the documents do not show company scientists believed that paraquat causes Parkinson’s, Syngenta officials pointed out. </p><p id="L4AHTOFWLVHU7G6O5PL5LGNDS4">The trail of bread crumbs started as early as 1958 when a company scientist wrote about a study of 2.2 dipyridyl, a chemical in paraquat, saying it appears to have moderate toxicity “mainly by affecting the central nervous system, and it can be absorbed through the skin,” the internal documents said. </p><p id="TLTBEWEQ45HPZGFAYBHTDUTZ7Y">Imperial Chemical Industries, which later became Syngenta, started selling paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone in 1962, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6689968/" target="_blank" rel="">according to research</a>. Gramoxone contains nearly 44% paraquat. </p><div><p><img src="https://www.mlive.com//resizer/v2/YVFPSHHPFZFQNNGGGYLZLO7SSM.jpeg?auth=2220318f3c192b31f82f8531fbc5d931d1388d82a0a2ac5c01321cdbca8dcb48" srcset="https://www.mlive.com//resizer/v2/YVFPSHHPFZFQNNGGGYLZLO7SSM.jpeg?auth=2220318f3c192b31f82f8531fbc5d931d1388d82a0a2ac5c01321cdbca8dcb48 300w, https://www.mlive.com//resizer/v2/YVFPSHHPFZFQNNGGGYLZLO7SSM.jpeg?auth=2220318f3c192b31f82f8531fbc5d931d1388d82a0a2ac5c01321cdbca8dcb48 768w, https://www.mlive.com//resizer/v2/YVFPSHHPFZFQNNGGGYLZLO7SSM.jpeg?auth=2220318f3c192b31f82f8531fbc5d931d1388d82a0a2ac5c01321cdbca8dcb48 1024w"></p><p>Syngenta sells paraquat under the brand name Gramaxone, as a resgistered-use pesticide. It's labeled with a skull and cross bones and the warning "one sip can kill." The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also puts the regulations and rules for use on the label. It's dyed blue and has a strong odor as safety mechanisms. <span>&nbsp;<!-- -->Rose White | rwhite@MLive.com</span></p></div><p id="RILEQBRW75AUZDNHEPN32M4EIM">The internal documents show by 1974, the company updated safety precautions, recommending that anyone spraying the pesticide wear a mask, as there were the first reports of human poisoning and concerns about the effects of paraquat started to grow.</p><p id="FYY6PR67EFB67G4X233QAJC33U">A year later, Ken Fletcher from Imperial Chemical wrote a letter to Chevron scientist Dr. Richard Cavelli, saying the chemical company knew of “sporadic reports of CNS (central nervous system) effects in paraquat poisoning” that he believed to be coincidental.</p><p id="OWYNMMWELVAWPGOA5BFRTN2VPM">Within months, Fletcher also indicated “possible chronic effects” of paraquat exposure, calling it “quite a terrible problem” that should be studied more, the documents say.</p><p id="KUTYEHBGV5C5JPLU5JQ65JE2YA">“Due possibly to good publicity on our part, very few people here believe that paraquat causes any sort of problem in the field,” he wrote in the mid 1970s. “Consequently, any allegation of illness due to spraying never reaches serious proportions.”</p><p id="JSRARDDIT5A23JTRBSLU6PB2PQ">By the 1980s, outside research started to pick at the question of paraquat and Parkinson’s.</p><p id="GYVUGY3OOZBS5DA4XCZ6JAPDK4">“As more researchers dug into it, it’s only been more firmly established,” said Horsfield with the Environmental Working Group. </p><p id="FHCGRTN6BZDEDEFYIQIYKXQ6SU">Syngenta pushes back on this, though, saying two recent reports cast doubt on these claims. </p><p id="YS4C3IEPWZGJ7FBG2VWYEFVVEE">A<a href="https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/2024/12/30/department-of-pesticide-regulation-releases-preliminary-findings-from-review-of-environmental-and-human-health-studies-related-to-the-use-of-the-pesticide-paraquat/" target="_blank" rel=""> 2024 scientific report</a> from California pesticide regulators found recent evidence was “insufficient to demonstrate a direct causal association with exposure to paraquat and the increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.” And a September analysis from Douglas Weed, an epidemiologist and independent consultant, reached a similar conclusion.</p><p id="BO3ZK642V5GTHFLHGDE6SSMSXY">Syngenta also claims on its website to be a target of a “mass tort machine” that hovers behind multi-district litigation. </p><h2>Why hasn’t the EPA banned it?</h2><p id="75CKAB5XJJENNN3MLHZD2ZKDRQ">In 1981, Norway became the first country to outlaw paraquat due to the risk of poisoning. One by one, more countries followed suit. In 2007, the European Union <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/environment/eu-court-reimposes-ban-on-paraquat-weedkiller-idUSL11666800/" target="_blank" rel="">approved a blanket ban</a> for all 27 member countries, according to media reports. </p><p id="DF5YBLFXR5H7PGK2G4RJXJV4KQ">Yet Syngenta is still allowed to manufacture paraquat in countries that have banned its use. It’s been prohibited in the United Kingdom for 18 years and China banned paraquat to “safeguard people’s life, safety and health,” in 2012, <a href="http://www.chinapesticide.org.cn/eng/detail/21956" target="_blank" rel="">according to a government announcement</a>. </p><p id="M25A354WVBEUNBJSEQMHSDZRSU">Yet about two-thirds of the paraquat imported to the U.S. between 2022 and 2024 came from companies owned by the Chinese government, SinoChem and Red Sun Group, <a href="https://pesticidestorymap.com/" target="_blank" rel="">according to a joint report</a> published by three advocacy organizations in October.</p><p id="2Q7WICJXVVGWDDGDYDYKQIJWGQ">It found most of the 40 million and 156 million pounds imported annually over the past eight years comes from Chinese manufacturing facilities, in either China or Syngenta’s big factory in northern England. </p><p id="NKJXSBUUGFAQBKWV4CYXKMVPC4">Although hundreds of companies sell paraquat, Syngenta says <a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/docs/the-global-market-in-paraquat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">it accounts for a quarter of global sales.</a></p><p id="XPJQ5UVY55DMHOZEDA2OGQD7MU"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/chemchina-sinochem-merge-agricultural-assets-syngenta-idUSKBN1Z40HA/" target="_blank" rel="">According to previous media reports</a>, SinoChem, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, acquired Syngenta in a 2020 merger. SinoChem posted <a href="https://fortune.com/company/sinochem-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="">$3.4 billion</a> in profits last year, but it’s unclear how much came from paraquat sales because the company doesn’t make earnings reports public. <a href="https://www.syngenta.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Financial%20Report%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">Syngenta reported</a> $803 million in sales of its “non-selective herbicides,” the class that includes paraquat-containing Gramoxone, according to its 2024 financial report. </p><p id="HHGMRJMUP5GU3JY3G6FGHXB7DQ">While Chinese companies supply paraquat to American farmers, the report points out China is also a big purchaser of crops, like soybeans, that are grown with help from the pesticide.</p><p id="RSBBWQ5DLJDOXLNWJQ2SRW3PVE">“In these two ways, China economically benefits from the application of paraquat in the U.S., where it outsources many of its associated health hazards,” the report said.</p><p id="764KX4XJJ5GRDMKSZTE6QVPBVU">Paraquat, now prohibited in more than 70 countries, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/paraquat" target="_blank" rel="">according to the Environmental Working Group</a>, was reauthorized by the EPA in 2021 when it passed a regularly scheduled 15-year review — a move challenged by critics. </p><p id="2Q3265P3B5G75MRS6LQ7VPOELU">“EPA has the same information that those countries have,” said Kalmuss-Katz, the attorney with EarthJustice. “EPA has just reached a fundamentally different, and what we believe is a legally and scientifically unsupported position, which is: massive amounts of paraquat can continue to be sprayed without unreasonable risk.”</p><p id="43QS4VGRE5EHPODA5PWMI53J2Y">The federal agency determined paraquat remains “an effective, inexpensive, versatile, and widely used method of weed control,” and any risks to workers are “outweighed by the benefits” of farms using the weed killer.</p><p id="HJPUMSSU5NBHPDMFC4D5BIEY5M">“It is one of the mostly highly regulated pesticides available in the United States,” the agency said in a statement.</p><p id="34QDSAGPFFGZLJAGBAEU6DG5JA">This decision allowed it to be used with “new stronger safety measures to reduce exposure,” like requiring buffer zones where pesticides can’t be sprayed. </p><p id="VGLT7MCGHFD2ZEWWSWWRBROO6A">For plants like cotton, alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts, the EPA wrote in its decision “growers may need to switch to alternative (weed-killers), which could have financial impacts.” Unlike other pesticides, paraquat works well in low temperatures and early in the season, according to the agency.</p><div><div><p>“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides.”</p></div><p>Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz from EarthJustice</p></div><p id="2JUORFJJCJGV3FHSBIL4RL2PPM">More than 200,000 public comments have been submitted to the EPA’s docket on paraquat over the years. Industry groups, farmers, advocacy organizations and others have all chimed in, arguing for or against the weed killer.</p><p id="KDQMEVORGFAS3N7SVIWSJFJAPE">One submitted by a North Dakota farmer, Trey Fischbach, urged the EPA to continue allowing paraquat to fight resistant weeds like kochia, writing it’s the “last tool in the toolbox.” </p><p id="HOO2H3BTHNGCHNY34WIRMNU4OA">The EPA also noted there weren’t many other options. “The chemical characteristics of paraquat are also beneficial as a resistance management tool, where few alternatives are available.” </p><p id="ANVFXM4LIZBUVDBEXGLE75CAMI">But farmers can get trapped on what critics call the “<a href="https://www.panna.org/resources/the-pesticide-treadmill/" target="_blank" rel="">pesticide treadmill</a>,” in which broad pesticide use leads to “superweeds” that require stronger and stronger pesticides to be knocked down.</p><p id="WMHATQ6VW5D5VJ6WZL7D5XIMD4">A comment submitted by Kay O’Laughlin, from Massachusetts, urged instead: “Do your job and ban paraquat because it is killing people. I speak as someone who lost a brother to Parkinson’s. People should not be disposable so that big agro can make ever greater profits!”</p><p id="ST7LZTJNG5D7BLMJN7BLZDWUX4">The EPA’s 2021 decision was challenged within two months by environmental and farmworker groups who sued the EPA. Kalmuss-Katz said the groups challenged the EPA over reapproving paraquat without “truly grappling” with the connection to Parkinson’s.</p><p id="7TQ6CZ24SNDTPET5JMIE2CBIDE">“The EPA here failed to adequately protect farmworkers,” he said.</p><p id="N5FTKEU5GBHW7C6IJW3HWAHAHA">After that, the environmental agency shifted under President Joe Biden. </p><p id="GAYRCOE5WNFINGLHJSQRJOLB5Q">The EPA decided to consider the issues raised in the lawsuits and started seeking additional information last year. In early 2025, it asked the courts for more time to assess the human health risks of paraquat.</p><p id="EVK5BC2DOVH6ND2ZIXAQ3AVMNQ">But the EPA wasn’t focused on Parkinson’s, saying in its decision the “weight of evidence was insufficient” to link paraquat exposure to the neurological disease. Rather, the federal question was over how the weed killer turns into a vapor that could harm people when inhaled or touched. “Parkinson’s Disease is not an expected health outcome of pesticidal use of paraquat,” the EPA said in its review. </p><p id="NE5I2W6LO5BYNNLYCBLZBHK2LY">The study could take up to four years, according to the EPA, saying it’s “complex, large scale and is conducted under real world conditions,” while paraquat remains on the market. The <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0855-0554" target="_blank" rel="">agency in October</a> updated the review, saying it’s now seeking additional information from Syngenta. </p><p id="5AT4THVERJGOLMIZJSEAS63CNQ">Meanwhile, the EPA has shifted again. The Trump administration this year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/climate/from-industry-to-epa-lobbyist-now-oversees-pesticide-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="">put four former industry lobbyists</a> or executives, from the agricultural, chemical and cleaning industries, in charge of regulating pesticides at the EPA. </p><p id="2BCAIDNAJRDIVHNCVNYDD3ZT3E">And while it’s not clear where the agency stands on paraquat, there has been an early sign of backing away from opposition to controversial pesticides. Shortly after Kyle Kunkler, a recent American Soybean Association lobbyist, was tapped to lead pesticide policy, the EPA moved to reapprove the use of <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/pesticides/EPA-allow-new-dicamba-herbicides/103/web/2025/07" target="_blank" rel="">a different, controversial weed killer</a> that had previously been banned by federal courts.</p><h2>Growing pressure to ban it</h2><p id="KIE4VEVGPFAYFEAXHJ7PT74PPM">But grassroots pressure to ban paraquat continues to mount.</p><p id="YRPVDBB45FHV3JDLWBID2RHIGY">“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States,” said Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.</p><p id="YZHJ4EKKUJAJ5LD6DMQD3O7FIY">Last year, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, expressing “grave concern” in letters, urged the EPA to ban paraquat.</p><p id="NIAR7O7LD5AUBDL3NLGQWZCG2Y">“Due to their heightened exposure to paraquat, farmworkers and rural residents are hardest hit by the harmful health effects of paraquat like Parkinson’s,” said <a href="https://casar.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/casar.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/casar-paraquat-epa-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">an Oct. 7, 2024</a>, letter signed by U.S. representatives.

But the bill ended up getting pared back with Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a law to fast-track reevaluating paraquat’s safety, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2024/09/newsom-signs-bill-to-speed-up-review-of-widely-banned-herbicide-00181530" target="_blank" rel="">reporting shows</a>. </p><p id="BA2FTDNV3VD6PP3MABVAC6NYQE">Pennsylvania lawmakers are also considering banning it under <a href="https://www.pahousegop.com/News/35878/Latest-News/Bill-Package-to-Increase-Food-Safety-Sought-by-Mihalek-and-Bipartisan-Coalition-" target="_blank" rel="">state bills introduced this year</a>. </p><p id="JG64LT3J4FACBHIM7UKCU6VKNQ">“There are better, healthier alternatives,” said state Rep.

        <h5 id="best-read-with"><em>Best read with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E">Danger Zone</a> playing on loop</em></h5>
<p>Like most people, you’re probably an absolute expert at landing on the aircraft carrier in <em>Top Gun</em> for the NES. But if you’re in the silent minority that have not yet mastered this skill, you’re in luck: I’ve done a little reverse engineerining and figured out <em>precisely</em> how landing works. Hopefully now you can get things really dialed in during your next practice session. Let’s get those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxqKp_s6GWU">windmill high-fives</a> warmed up!</p>
<p>tl;dr: Altitude must be in the range 100-299, speed must be in the range 238-337 (both inclusive), and you must be laterally aimed at the carrier at the end of the sequence.</p>
<p>As a reminder in case you haven’t played Top Gun in the last few decades (weird), the landing portion of the stage looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://relaxing.run/blag/posts/top-gun-landing/landing.gif" alt="Perfect landing"></p>
<p>Mercifully, the game suggests you aim right in the middle of the acceptable range per the “Alt. 200 / Speed 288” text on your MFD. Altitude and speed are both controlled by throttle input and pitch angle. There’s no on-screen heading indicator, but the game will tell you if you’re outside of the acceptable range (“Right ! Right !”). The ranges for speed and heading are pretty tight, so focus on those: the range for altitude is much wider.</p>
<p>After about a minute of flying the game checks your state and plays a little cutscene showing either a textbook landing or an expensive fireball. Either way, you get a “Mission Accomplished!” and go to the next level (after all, you don’t own that plane, the taxpayers do):</p>

<p>Speed and altitude are stored as binary coded decimals, likely to simplify the rendering of on-screen text. For example, the number 1234 is stored as 4660 (ie., hex 0x1234).</p>
<p>The function at $B6EA performs the state check and writes the result at $9E. If you’re just here to impress your friends and don’t want to put in the practice, the game genie code AEPETA will guarantee a landing that Maverick and Goose (spoiler: <span>may he rest in peace</span>
) would be proud of.</p>

<p>lol.</p>
<p>I minted a new TLS cert and it seems that OpenAI is scraping CT logs for what I assume are things to scrape from, based on the near instant response from this:</p>

<p><a href="https://benjojo.co.uk/u/benjojo" rel="noreferrer">@benjojo</a><br>what if CT logs contained hash(domain, nonce) instead of containing the domain in plain, and the nonce was part of the CT inclusion proof?</p>

<p><a href="https://mstdn.io/users/wolf480pl" rel="noreferrer">@wolf480pl</a> the point of certificate transparency logs is so that outside observers can do the double-checking of the CAs certificate and policy in full, if you mess with any part of this, the entire system becomes deeply exploitable and difficult to end to end verify</p>

<p><a href="https://benjojo.co.uk/u/benjojo" rel="noreferrer">@benjojo</a><br>oh, duh I need to be able to find who's issuing carts for my domain  <img title=":blobfacepalm:" src="https://benjojo.co.uk/d/7Dwx2vmsBj1y71Gdk9.png"> </p>
<p>and I'm guessing some people look at all certs issued by CAs and verify certain criteria that may require knowing the domains...</p>
<p>it's kinda sad that it provides domain enumeration, but I guess putting addng zero-knowledge proofs to the mix would've been too complex</p>

<p><a href="https://mstdn.io/users/wolf480pl" rel="noreferrer">@wolf480pl</a> tbh domain's are not really that secret, and if you depended on that then something was very wrong.</p>
<p>You can work around a lot of this stuff by "just" using wildcard certs instead</p>
