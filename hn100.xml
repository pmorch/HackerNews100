<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Go 1.24</h2>
<p>The latest Go release, version 1.24, arrives six months after <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.23">Go 1.23</a>.
Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
As always, the release maintains the Go 1 <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1compat">promise of compatibility</a>.
We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.</p>
<h2 id="language">Changes to the language</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/46477 -->
<p>Go 1.24 now fully supports <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/46477">generic type aliases</a>: a type alias
may be parameterized like a defined type.
See the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Alias_declarations">language spec</a> for details.
For now, the feature can be disabled by setting <code>GOEXPERIMENT=noaliastypeparams</code>;
but the <code>aliastypeparams</code> setting will be removed for Go 1.25.</p>

<h3 id="go-command">Go command</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/48429 -->
<p>Go modules can now track executable dependencies using <code>tool</code> directives in
go.mod. This removes the need for the previous workaround of adding tools as
blank imports to a file conventionally named “tools.go”. The <code>go tool</code>
command can now run these tools in addition to tools shipped with the Go
distribution. For more information see <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#tools">the
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The new <code>-tool</code> flag for <code>go get</code> causes a tool directive to be added to the
current module for named packages in addition to adding require directives.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go#hdr-Package_lists_and_patterns"><code>tool</code> meta-pattern</a> refers to
all tools in the current module. This can be used to upgrade them all with <code>go get tool</code> or to install them into your GOBIN directory with <code>go install tool</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/69290 -->
<p>Executables created by <code>go run</code> and the new behavior of <code>go tool</code> are now
cached in the Go build cache. This makes repeated executions faster at the
expense of making the cache larger. See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/69290">#69290</a>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/62067 -->
<p>The <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code> commands now accept a <code>-json</code> flag that reports
build output and failures as structured JSON output on standard output.
For details of the reporting format, see <code>go help buildjson</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>go test -json</code> now reports build output and failures in JSON,
interleaved with test result JSON.
These are distinguished by new <code>Action</code> types, but if they cause problems in
a test integration system, you can revert to the text build output with
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> <code>gotestjsonbuildtext=1</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/26232 -->
<p>The new <code>GOAUTH</code> environment variable provides a flexible way to authenticate
private module fetches. See <code>go help goauth</code> for more information.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/50603 -->
<p>The <code>go build</code> command now sets the
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug#BuildInfo.Main">main module’s version</a> in the compiled
binary based on the version control system tag and/or commit.
A <code>+dirty</code> suffix will be appended if there are uncommitted changes.
Use the <code>-buildvcs=false</code> flag to omit version control information from the binary.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/63939 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain#select"><code>toolchaintrace=1</code></a>
can be used to trace the <code>go</code> command’s toolchain selection process.</p>
<h3 id="cgo">Cgo</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/56378, CL 579955 -->
<p>Cgo supports new annotations for C functions to improve run time
performance.
<code>#cgo noescape cFunctionName</code> tells the compiler that memory passed to
the C function <code>cFunctionname</code> does not escape.
<code>#cgo nocallback cFunctionName</code> tells the compiler that the C function
<code>cFunctionName</code> does not call back to any Go functions.
For more information, see <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/cmd/cgo#hdr-Optimizing_calls_of_C_code">the cgo documentation</a>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67699 -->
<p>Cgo currently refuses to compile calls to a C function which has multiple
incompatible declarations. For instance, if <code>f</code> is declared as both <code>void f(int)</code>
and <code>void f(double)</code>, cgo will report an error instead of possibly generating an
incorrect call sequence for <code>f(0)</code>. New in this release is a better detector for
this error condition when the incompatible declarations appear in different
files. See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/67699">#67699</a>.</p>
<h3 id="objdump">Objdump</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/15255, go.dev/issue/36738 -->
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/cmd/objdump">objdump</a> tool now supports dissassembly on 64-bit
LoongArch (<code>GOARCH=loong64</code>), RISC-V (<code>GOARCH=riscv64</code>), and S390X (<code>GOARCH=s390x</code>).</p>
<h3 id="vet">Vet</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/44251 -->
<p>The new <code>tests</code> analyzer reports common mistakes in declarations of
tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in test packages, such as
malformed names, incorrect signatures, or examples that document
non-existent identifiers. Some of these mistakes may cause tests not
to run.
This analyzer is among the subset of analyzers that are run by <code>go test</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/60529 -->
<p>The existing <code>printf</code> analyzer now reports a diagnostic for calls of
the form <code>fmt.Printf(s)</code>, where <code>s</code> is a non-constant format string,
with no other arguments. Such calls are nearly always a mistake
as the value of <code>s</code> may contain the <code>%</code> symbol; use <code>fmt.Print</code> instead.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/60529">#60529</a>. This check tends to produce findings in existing
code, and so is only applied when the language version (as specified by the
go.mod <code>go</code> directive or <code>//go:build</code> comments) is at least Go 1.24, to avoid
causing continuous integration failures when updating to the 1.24 Go toolchain.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64127 -->
<p>The existing <code>buildtag</code> analyzer now reports a diagnostic when
there is an invalid Go <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints">major version build constraint</a>
within a <code>//go:build</code> directive. For example, <code>//go:build go1.23.1</code> refers to
a point release; use <code>//go:build go1.23</code> instead.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/64127">#64127</a>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/66387 -->
<p>The existing <code>copylock</code> analyzer now reports a diagnostic when a
variable declared in a 3-clause “for” loop such as
<code>for i := iter(); done(i); i = next(i) { ... }</code> contains a <code>sync.Locker</code>,
such as a <code>sync.Mutex</code>. <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#language">Go 1.22</a> changed the behavior
of these loops to create a new variable for each iteration, copying the
value from the previous iteration; this copy operation is not safe for locks.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/66387">#66387</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gocacheprog">GOCACHEPROG</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64876 -->
<p>The <code>cmd/go</code> internal binary and test caching mechanism can now be implemented
by child processes implementing a JSON protocol between the <code>cmd/go</code> tool
and the child process named by the <code>GOCACHEPROG</code> environment variable.
This was previously behind a GOEXPERIMENT.
For protocol details, see <a href="https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/internal/cacheprog">the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="runtime">Runtime</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/54766 -->
<!-- go.dev/cl/614795 -->
<!-- go.dev/issue/68578 -->
<p>Several performance improvements to the runtime have decreased CPU overheads by
2–3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks.
Results may vary by application.
These improvements include a new builtin <code>map</code> implementation based on
<a href="https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Swiss Tables</a>, more efficient
memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
implementation.</p>
<p>The new builtin <code>map</code> implementation and new runtime-internal mutex may be
disabled by setting <code>GOEXPERIMENT=noswissmap</code> and <code>GOEXPERIMENT=nospinbitmutex</code>
at build time respectively.</p>
<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/60725, go.dev/issue/57926 -->
<p>The compiler already disallowed defining new methods with receiver types that were
cgo-generated, but it was possible to circumvent that restriction via an alias type.
Go 1.24 now always reports an error if a receiver denotes a cgo-generated type,
whether directly or indirectly (through an alias type).</p>
<h2 id="linker">Linker</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/68678, go.dev/issue/68652, CL 618598, CL 618601 -->
<p>The linker now generates a GNU build ID (the ELF <code>NT_GNU_BUILD_ID</code> note) on ELF platforms
and a UUID (the Mach-O <code>LC_UUID</code> load command) on macOS by default.
The build ID or UUID is derived from the Go build ID.
It can be disabled by the <code>-B none</code> linker flag, or overridden by the <code>-B 0xNNNN</code> linker
flag with a user-specified hexadecimal value.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64751 -->
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#bootstrap">Go 1.22 release notes</a>, Go 1.24 now requires
Go 1.22.6 or later for bootstrap.
We expect that Go 1.26 will require a point release of Go 1.24 or later for bootstrap.</p>
<h2 id="library">Standard library</h2>
<h3 id="directory-limited-filesystem-access">Directory-limited filesystem access</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67002 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a> type provides the ability to perform filesystem
operations within a specific directory.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#OpenRoot"><code>os.OpenRoot</code></a> function opens a directory and returns an <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a>.
Methods on <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a> operate within the directory and do not permit
paths that refer to locations outside the directory, including
ones that follow symbolic links out of the directory.
The methods on <code>os.Root</code> mirror most of the file system operations available in the
<code>os</code> package, including for example <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Open"><code>os.Root.Open</code></a>,
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Create"><code>os.Root.Create</code></a>,
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Mkdir"><code>os.Root.Mkdir</code></a>,
and <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Stat"><code>os.Root.Stat</code></a>,</p>
<h3 id="new-benchmark-function">New benchmark function</h3>
<p>Benchmarks may now use the faster and less error-prone <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing#B.Loop"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a> method to perform benchmark iterations like <code>for b.Loop() { ... }</code> in place of the typical loop structures involving <code>b.N</code> like <code>for range b.N</code>. This offers two significant advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The benchmark function will execute exactly once per -count, so expensive setup and cleanup steps execute only once.</li>
<li>Function call parameters and results are kept alive, preventing the compiler from fully optimizing away the loop body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improved-finalizers">Improved finalizers</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67535 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime#AddCleanup"><code>runtime.AddCleanup</code></a> function is a
finalization mechanism that is more flexible, more efficient, and less
error-prone than <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime#SetFinalizer"><code>runtime.SetFinalizer</code></a>.
<code>AddCleanup</code> attaches a cleanup function to an object that will run once
the object is no longer reachable.
However, unlike <code>SetFinalizer</code>,
multiple cleanups may be attached to a single object,
cleanups may be attached to interior pointers,
cleanups do not generally cause leaks when objects form a cycle, and
cleanups do not delay the freeing of an object or objects it points to.
New code should prefer <code>AddCleanup</code> over <code>SetFinalizer</code>.</p>
<h3 id="weak">New weak package</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/weak/"><code>weak</code></a> package provides weak pointers.</p>
<p>Weak pointers are a low-level primitive provided to enable the
creation of memory-efficient structures, such as weak maps for
associating values, canonicalization maps for anything not
covered by package <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/unique/"><code>unique</code></a>, and various kinds
of caches.
For supporting these use-cases, this release also provides
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime/#AddCleanup"><code>runtime.AddCleanup</code></a> and
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/maphash/#Comparable"><code>maphash.Comparable</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-mlkem">New crypto/mlkem package</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/70122 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/mlkem/"><code>crypto/mlkem</code></a> package implements
ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024.</p>
<p>ML-KEM is a post-quantum key exchange mechanism formerly known as Kyber and
specified in <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FIPS 203</a>.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-packages">New crypto/hkdf, crypto/pbkdf2, and crypto/sha3 packages</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/61477, go.dev/issue/69488, go.dev/issue/69982, go.dev/issue/65269, CL 629176 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/hkdf/"><code>crypto/hkdf</code></a> package implements
the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand key derivation function HKDF,
as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 5869</a>.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/pbkdf2/"><code>crypto/pbkdf2</code></a> package implements
the password-based key derivation function PBKDF2,
as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8018.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8018</a>.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/sha3/"><code>crypto/sha3</code></a> package implements
the SHA-3 hash function and SHAKE and cSHAKE extendable-output functions,
as defined in <a href="http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FIPS 202</a>.</p>
<p>All three packages are based on pre-existing <code>golang.org/x/crypto/...</code> packages.</p>
<h3 id="fips140">FIPS 140-3 compliance</h3>
<p>This release includes <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/security/fips140">a new set of mechanisms to facilitate FIPS 140-3
compliance</a>.</p>
<p>The Go Cryptographic Module is a set of internal standard library packages that
are transparently used to implement FIPS 140-3 approved algorithms. Applications
require no changes to use the Go Cryptographic Module for approved algorithms.</p>
<p>The new <code>GOFIPS140</code> environment variable can be used to select the Go
Cryptographic Module version to use in a build. The new <code>fips140</code> <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG
setting</a> can be used to enable FIPS 140-3 mode at runtime.</p>
<p>Go 1.24 includes Go Cryptographic Module version v1.0.0, which is currently
under test with a CMVP-accredited laboratory.</p>
<h3 id="testing-synctest">New experimental testing/synctest package</h3>
<p>The new experimental <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/synctest/"><code>testing/synctest</code></a> package
provides support for testing concurrent code.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/synctest/#Run"><code>synctest.Run</code></a> function starts a
group of goroutines in an isolated “bubble”.
Within the bubble, <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/time"><code>time</code></a> package functions operate on a
fake clock.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/synctest#Wait"><code>synctest.Wait</code></a> function waits for
all goroutines in the current bubble to block.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the package documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The <code>synctest</code> package is experimental and must be enabled by
setting <code>GOEXPERIMENT=synctest</code> at build time.
The package API is subject to change in future releases.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/67434">issue #67434</a> for more information and
to provide feeback.</p>
<h3 id="minor_library_changes">Minor changes to the library</h3>
<h4 id="archivepkgarchive"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/archive/"><code>archive</code></a></h4>
<p>The <code>(*Writer).AddFS</code> implementations in both <code>archive/zip</code> and <code>archive/tar</code>
now write a directory header for an empty directory.</p>
<h4 id="bytespkgbytes"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/"><code>bytes</code></a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes"><code>bytes</code></a> package adds several functions that work with iterators:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#Lines"><code>Lines</code></a> returns an iterator over the
newline-terminated lines in a byte slice.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#SplitSeq"><code>SplitSeq</code></a> returns an iterator over
all subslices of a byte slice split around a separator.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#SplitAfterSeq"><code>SplitAfterSeq</code></a> returns an iterator
over subslices of a byte slice split after each instance of a
separator.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#FieldsSeq"><code>FieldsSeq</code></a> returns an iterator over
subslices of a byte slice split around runs of whitespace characters,
as defined by <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/unicode#IsSpace"><code>unicode.IsSpace</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#FieldsFuncSeq"><code>FieldsFuncSeq</code></a> returns an iterator
over subslices of a byte slice split around runs of Unicode code points
satisfying a predicate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cryptoaespkgcryptoaes"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/"><code>crypto/aes</code></a></h4>
<p>The value returned by <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes#NewCipher"><code>NewCipher</code></a> no longer
implements the <code>NewCTR</code>, <code>NewGCM</code>, <code>NewCBCEncrypter</code>, and <code>NewCBCDecrypter</code>
methods. These methods were undocumented and not available on all architectures.
Instead, the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#Block"><code>Block</code></a> value should be passed
directly to the relevant <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/"><code>crypto/cipher</code></a> functions.
For now, <code>crypto/cipher</code> still checks for those methods on <code>Block</code> values,
even if they are not used by the standard library anymore.</p>
<h4 id="cryptocipherpkgcryptocipher"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/"><code>crypto/cipher</code></a></h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewGCMWithRandomNonce"><code>NewGCMWithRandomNonce</code></a>
function returns an <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#AEAD"><code>AEAD</code></a> that implements AES-GCM by
generating a random nonce during Seal and prepending it to the ciphertext.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#Stream"><code>Stream</code></a> implementation returned by
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCTR"><code>NewCTR</code></a> when used with
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/"><code>crypto/aes</code></a> is now several times faster on amd64 and arm64.</p>
<p><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewOFB"><code>NewOFB</code></a>,
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCFBEncrypter"><code>NewCFBEncrypter</code></a>, and
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCFBDecrypter"><code>NewCFBDecrypter</code></a> are now deprecated.
OFB and CFB mode are not authenticated, which generally enables active attacks to
manipulate and recover the plaintext. It is recommended that applications use
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#AEAD"><code>AEAD</code></a> modes instead. If an unauthenticated
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#Stream"><code>Stream</code></a> mode is required, use
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCTR"><code>NewCTR</code></a> instead.</p>
<h4 id="cryptoecdsapkgcryptoecdsa"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/ecdsa/"><code>crypto/ecdsa</code></a></h4>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64802 -->
<p><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/ecdsa#PrivateKey.Sign"><code>PrivateKey.Sign</code></a> now produces a

<h4 id="cryptorandpkgcryptorand"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/"><code>crypto/rand</code></a></h4>
<!-- go.dev/issue/66821 -->
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand#Read"><code>Read</code></a> function is now guaranteed not to fail.
It will always return <code>nil</code> as the <code>error</code> result.
If <code>Read</code> were to encounter an error while reading from
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand#Reader"><code>Reader</code></a>, the program will irrecoverably crash.
Note that the platform APIs used by the default <code>Reader</code> are documented to
always succeed, so this change should only affect programs that override the
<code>Reader</code> variable. One exception are Linux kernels before version 3.17, where
the default <code>Reader</code> still opens <code>/dev/urandom</code> and may fail.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/69577 -->
<p>On Linux 6.11 and later, <code>Reader</code> now uses the <code>getrandom</code> system call via vDSO.
This is several times faster, especially for small reads.</p>
<!-- CL 608395 -->
<p>On OpenBSD, <code>Reader</code> now uses <code>arc4random_buf(3)</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#GenerateKey"><code>GenerateKey</code></a> now returns an error if a key of
less than 1024 bits is requested.
All Sign, Verify, Encrypt, and Decrypt methods now return an error if used with
a key smaller than 1024 bits. Such keys are insecure and should not be used.
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> <code>rsa1024min=0</code> restores the old behavior, but we
recommend doing so only if necessary and only in tests, for example by adding a
<code>//go:debug rsa1024min=0</code> line to a test file.

<code>Precompute</code> is now faster in the presence of partially filled out
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#PrecomputedValues"><code>PrecomputedValues</code></a>, such as when
unmarshaling a key from JSON.</p>
<p>The package now rejects more invalid keys, even when <code>Validate</code> is not called,
and <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#GenerateKey"><code>GenerateKey</code></a> may return new errors for
broken random sources.

<p>When marshaling, a struct field with the new <code>omitzero</code> option in the struct field

<p>The implementation of <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/sync#Map"><code>sync.Map</code></a> has been changed, improving performance,
particularly for map modifications.
For instance, modifications of disjoint sets of keys are much less likely to contend on
larger maps, and there is no longer any ramp-up time required to achieve low-contention
loads from the map.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.23#linux">announced</a> in the Go 1.23 release notes, Go 1.24 requires Linux
kernel version 3.2 or later.</p>
<h3 id="darwin">Darwin</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/69839 -->
<p>Go 1.24 is the last release that will run on macOS 11 Big Sur.
Go 1.25 will require macOS 12 Monterey or later.</p>
<h3 id="wasm">WebAssembly</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/65199, CL 603055 -->
<p>The <code>go:wasmexport</code> compiler directive is added for Go programs to export functions
to the WebAssembly host.</p>
<p>On WebAssembly System Interface Preview 1 (<code>GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm</code>), Go 1.24 supports

by specifying the <code>-buildmode=c-shared</code> build flag.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/66984, CL 626615 -->
<p>More types are now permitted as argument or result types for <code>go:wasmimport</code> functions.
Specifically, <code>bool</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>uintptr</code>, and pointers to certain types are allowed

      <p>It's been just over two years and two months since ChatGPT launched, and in that time we've seen Large Language Models (LLMs) blossom from a novel concept into one of the most craven cons of the 21st century — a cynical bubble inflated by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman built to sell into an economy run by people that have no concept of labor other than their desperation to exploit or replace it. </p><p>I realize that Large Language Models like GPT-4o — the model that powers ChatGPT and a bunch of other apps — <em>have use cases</em>, and I'm <em>fucking tired of having to write this sentence.</em> There are people that really like using Large Language Models for coding (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/13/genai-code-mistakes-copilot-gemini-chatgpt?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>even if the code isn't good</u></a> or<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/draft-theres-good-news-and-bad-news-with-ai-assisted-software-development/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>makes systems less secure and stable</u></a>) or get something out of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered search, or like using one of the various AI companions or journal apps.&nbsp;</p><p>I get it. I get that there are people that use LLM-powered software, and I must be clear that <strong>anecdotal examples of some people using some software that they kind-of like is not evidence that generative AI is a sustainable or real industry at the trillion-dollar scale that many claim it is.</strong></p><p>I am <em>so very bored of having this conversation,</em> so I am now going to write out some counterpoints so that I don't have to say them again.</p><h3 id="ed-there-are-multiple-kinds-of-artificial-intelligence"><strong>Ed, there are multiple kinds of artificial intelligence-</strong></h3><p><strong><em><u>I KNOW.</u></em></strong> Stop saying this to me like an Uno reverse! I'm talking about generative AI!</p><h3 id="well-ed-there-are-300-million-weekly-users-of-chatgpt-that-surely-proves-that-this-is-a-very-real-industry"><strong>Well, Ed, there are</strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users?ref=wheresyoured.at"><strong> <u>300 million weekly users of ChatGPT</u></strong></a><strong>. That surely proves that this is a very real industry!</strong></h3><ol><li>Though I don't have an exact number, I'd estimate that there have been tens of thousands of articles about artificial intelligence written in the last two years that are specifically focused on the generative AI boom, which in turn guarantees that they'll mention ChatGPT.</li><li>The AI bubble means that effectively every single media outlet has been talking about artificial intelligence in the vaguest way, and there's really only been one "product" that they can try that "is AI" — and that product is ChatGPT.</li><li>Reporting on artificial intelligence,<a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/how-news-coverage-often-uncritical-helps-build-ai-hype?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism</u></a>, is led by industry sources, with coverage of artificial intelligence in the UK being summarized by one study as tending to “construct the expectation of a pseudo-artificial general intelligence: a collective of technologies capable of solving nearly any problem." Specifically, the Reuters Institute's Professor Rasmus Nielsen said that coverage "often takes claims about what the technology can and can’t do, and might be able to do in the future, at face value in ways that contributes to the hype cycle."<ol><li>In short, most of the coverage you read on artificial intelligence is led by <strong>companies that benefit financially from you thinking artificial intelligence is important</strong> and <strong>by default all of this coverage mentions OpenAI or ChatGPT.</strong></li></ol></li><li>So...yeah, of course ChatGPT has that many users. When you have hundreds of different reporters constantly spitting out stories about how important something may or may not be, and when that thing is <em>available for free on a website</em>, it's going to get a bunch of people using it. This is predominantly the media's doing!</li><li><strong>But 300 million people is a lot!</strong><ol><li>It sure is! But it doesn't really prove anything other than that people are using the single-most-talked about product in the world. By comparison, billions of people use Facebook and Google. I don't care about this number!</li><li>User numbers alone tell you nothing about the sustainability or profitability of a business, or how those people use the product. It doesn’t delineate between daily users, and those who occasionally (and shallowly) flirt with an app or a website. It doesn’t say how <em>essential</em> a product is for that person.</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="also-uhm-ed-its-early-days-for-chatgpt"><strong>Also, uhm, Ed? It's early days for ChatGPT-</strong></h3><ol><li>Shut the fuck up! There isn't a single god damn startup in the history of anything — other than perhaps Facebook — that has had this level of coverage at such an early stage. Facebook also grew at a time when social media didn't really exist (at least, as a mainstream thing that virtually every demographic used) and thus the ability for something to "go viral" was a relatively new idea. By comparison, ChatGPT had the benefit of there being more media outlets, and Altman himself having spent a decade gladhandling the media<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-sam-altman-investments-004fc785?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>through his startup investments</u></a> and crafting a real public persona.&nbsp;</li><li>The weekly users number is really weird. Did it really go from<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-chatgpts-weekly-users-have-grown-200-million-2024-08-29/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>200 million</u></a> to<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>300 million</u></a> users in the space of three months?<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>It was at 100 million weekly users in <em>February 2023</em></u></a><em>. </em>You're telling me that OpenAI took, what, over a year to go from 100 million to 200 million, but it took <em>three months</em> (August 29 2024 to December 4 2024) to hit 300 million?<ol><li>I don't have any insider information to counter this, but I will ask — where was that growth from? OpenAI launched its o1 "reasoning" model (<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the previews, at least</u></a>) on September 12 2024, but these were only available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers,<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-releases-chatgpt-o1-worlds-smartest-language-model/534597/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>with the "full" version released on December 5 2024</u></a>. You're telling me this company increased its free user base by <em>50%</em> in less than three months based on nothing other than the <em>availability of a product that wasn't available to free users?</em></li><li>This also doesn't make a ton of sense based on data provided to me by<a href="http://www.similarweb.com/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Similarweb</u></a>, a digital market intelligence company. ChatGPT's monthly unique visitors were 212 million in September 2024, 233.1 million in October 2024, and 247.1 million in November 2024. I am not really sure how that translates to 300 million <em>weekly</em> users at all.<ol><li>Similarweb also provided me — albeit only for the last few weeks — data on ChatGPT.com's weekly traffic. For the period beginning January 21 2025, it only had 126.1 million weekly visitors. For the period beginning February 11 2025, it only had 136.7 million. Is OpenAI being honest about its user numbers? I've reached out for comment, but OpenAI has never, ever replied to me.<ol><li><strong>Sidenote: </strong>Yes, these are <strong><em>visitors</em></strong> versus <em><strong>users</strong></em>. However, one would assume users would be <em>lower</em> than visitors, because a visitor might not actually use the product. What gives?</li></ol></li><li>There could be users on their apps — but even then, I'm not really sure how you square this circle. An article from January 29 2025 says that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/chatgpts-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>the iOS ChatGPT app has been downloaded 353 million times</u></a> <em>in total</em>. Based on even the most optimistic numbers, are you telling me that ChatGPT has over 100 million <em>mobile only</em> users a week? And no, it isn’t Apple Intelligence.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/apple-launches-its-chatgpt-integration-with-siri.html?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Apple%20Intelligence%20is%20the%20company's,of%20Apple%20Intelligence%20in%20October."><u> Cupertino didn’t launch that integration until December 11 2024.</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li>Here's another question: why doesn't OpenAI reveal <em>monthly </em>active users? Wouldn't that number be higher? After all, a monthly active user is one that uses an app <em>even once</em> over a given month! Anyway, I hypothesize that the reason is probably that<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-coo-says-chatgpt-passed-11-million-paying-subscribers?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>in September 2024 it came out that OpenAI had 11 million monthly paying subscribers</u></a>, and though ChatGPT likely has quite a few more people that use it once a month, admitting to that number would mean that <strong>we're able to see how absolutely abominable its conversion to paying users is. </strong>300 million monthly active users would mean a conversion rate of less than 4%, which is pretty piss-poor,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/#:~:text=ChatGPT%20Plus%2C%20Teams%2C%20and%20Enterprise%20%E2%80%94%2073%25%20of%20revenue%20(approximately%20%242.7%20billion)."> <u>especially as subscription revenue for ChatGPT Plus (and other monthly subscriptions) makes up the majority of OpenAI's revenue</u></a>.</li></ol></li><li>Hey, wait a second. Are there any other generative AI products that reveal their users? Anthropic doesn't.<a href="https://searchengineland.com/perplexity-plan-sell-ads-438904?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>AI-powered search product Perplexity claims to have 15 million monthly active users</u></a>. These aren't big numbers!

Fine, fine. Let's get specific. The iPhone fundamentally redefined what a cellphone and a portable computer could be, as did the iPad, creating entirely new consumer and business use cases almost immediately. Cloud computing allowed us to run distinct applications in the cloud, which totally redefined how software was developed and deployed, creating both entirely new use cases for software (as the compute requirements moved from the customer to the provider), and<a href="https://aag-it.com/the-latest-cloud-computing-statistics/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Operator%20and%20vendor%20revenues%20for,%24195%20billion%20of%20total%20revenues."> <u>an entirely new cloud computing <em>industry</em> that makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year</u></a>.</li><li>So, what exactly has generative AI actually done?

If generative AI disappeared tomorrow — assuming you are not somebody who actively builds using it — would your life materially change?</li><li>The answer is "not that much." Putting aside the hype, bluster and ungodly amounts of money, I can find no evidence that any of these apps are making anyone any real money. Microsoft claims to have hit "<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/microsoft-earnings-2/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>$13 billion in annual run rate in revenue from its artificial intelligence products and services</u></a>," which amounts to just over a billion a month, or $3.25 billion a quarter.<ol><li>This is not profit.

The reason I’m not certain is that in the past The Information has been a touch inconsistent with how it evaluates "costs," in that I’ve seen it claim that OpenAI "burned just $340 million in the first half of 2024,"<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-imply-losses-tripling-to-14-billion-in-2026?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>a number that they pulled from a piece from last year</u></a> followed by the statement that "[OpenAI's] losses "are steep due to the impact of major expenses, such as stock compensation and computing costs, that don't flow through its cash statement." To be clear, OpenAI burned approximately $5 billion on compute alone. So yeah, OpenAI “burned only $340 million last year” as long as you don’t consider billions of other costs for some reason. Great stuff! It isn’t obvious how The Information is evaluating Anthropic’s burn versus OpenAI’s, and I’ve reached out to Jon Victor over there to get some clarity. I want to be clear that I very much appreciate, value and recommend The Information’s journalism, but I do not accept the idea of arbitrarily leaving out costs. This isn’t real business! Sorry!&nbsp;</li><li>None of these companies are profitable, and despite repeated claims that "the cost of inference is coming down" (the thing that happens when you prompt the model to do something) it doesn't appear to be helping them.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/"> <u>In the weeks following the release of the super-efficient DeepSeek models</u></a> I kind of expected them to start talking about efficiency.

Great stuff!</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="what-are-we-doing-here"><strong>What Are We <em>Doing</em> Here?</strong></h3><p>OpenAI and Anthropic are both burning billions of dollars a year, and do not appear to have found a way to stop doing so. The only "proof" that they are going to reverse this trend is The Information saying that "<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Anthropic's management expects the company to stop burning cash in 2027</u></a>."</p><blockquote><strong>Sidebar: </strong>Hey, what is it with Dario Amodei of Anthropic and the year 2027?<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>He said (made up) that "AI could surpass almost all humans at almost everything" "shortly after 2027" in January</u></a>.

This man is full of shit! Hey, tech media people reading this — your readers hate this shit! Stop printing it! Stop it!</blockquote><p>While one could say "the costs will come down," and that appears to be what The Information is claiming, suggesting that "Anthropic said it would reduce its burn rate by "nearly half" in 2025, the actual details are thin on the ground, and there’s no probing of whether that’s even feasible without radically changing its models. Huh? How? Anthropic’s burn increased every single year! So has OpenAI's!</p><p>The Information — who I do generally, and genuinely, respect — ran an astonishingly optimistic piece about Anthropic <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>estimating that it'd make $34.5 billion in revenue in 2027</u></a> (there's that year again!), the very same year it’d stop burning cash. Its estimates are based on the premise that "leaders expected API revenue to hit $20 billion in 2027," meaning people plugging Anthropic's models into their own products. This is laughable on many levels, chief of which is that OpenAI, which made around twice as much revenue as Anthropic did in 2024,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/#:~:text=Licensing%20Access%20To%20Models%20And%20Services%20%E2%80%94%2027%25%20of%20revenue%20(approximately%20%241%20billion)."> <u>barely made a billion dollars from API calls in the same year</u></a>.</p><p>It's here where I'm going to choose to scream.</p><p>Anthropic, according to The Information, generated <strong><em>$908 million in revenue in 2024,</em></strong> and has <u>projected</u> that it will make $2.2 billion in revenue in 2025, and its "base case" — which The Information says would be "the likeliest outcome (???) — is that it will make $12 billion in revenue in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what happens during bubbles! Assets are over-valued based on a combination of vibes and hysteria!&nbsp;</p><p>Dario Amodei — much like Sam Altman — is a liar, a crook, a carnival barker and a charlatan, and the things he promises are equal parts ridiculous and offensive. The Information (which needs to do better work actually critiquing these people) justified Amodei and Anthropic's obscene and fantastical revenue targets by<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/paris-ai-summit?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <em><u>citing Amodei's blog</u></em></a><strong>, </strong>which at no point explains what a "country of geniuses in a datacenter" actually means or what the product might be or what he's going to do to increase revenue by <em>more than thirty billion dollars a year</em> by 2027.</p><p>But wait, The Information says it got a little more specific!</p><blockquote>Anthropic says its technology could transform office roles such as generating or reviewing legal paperwork and automating software engineering. It cited code repository GitLab and legal search firm LexisNexis as examples of customers. Up-and-coming startups such as Anysphere, which develops the Cursor coding assistant for programmers, are also major buyers of Claude software.</blockquote><p>So, just to be abundantly clear, it appears Anthropic's big plan is to "sell people more software to some people, maybe."</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-startup-anthropic-raising-funding-valuing-it-at-60-billion-19d0605a?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Anthropic is currently raising $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation</u></a> primarily based off of this trumped-up marketing nonsense. Why are we humoring these oafs?</p><h3 id="what-these-oafs-are-actually-doing"><strong>What These Oafs Are Actually Doing</strong></h3><p>When you put aside the hype and anecdotes, generative AI has languished in the same place, even in my kindest estimations, for several months, though it's really been years. The one "big thing" that they've been able to do is to use "reasoning" to make the Large Language Models "think" (they do not have consciousness, they are not "thinking," this just means using more tokens to answer a particular question and having multiple models check the work), which mostly results in them being a bit more accurate when generating an answer, but at the expense of speed and cost.</p><p>This became a little less exciting a month ago when<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/"> <u>DeepSeek released its open source "r1" model which performed similarly to reasoning products from companies like Google and OpenAI</u></a>, and while some argue it "built the model to game benchmarks," that is quite literally what every single model developer does. Nevertheless, the idea of "reasoning" being the "killer app" — despite the fact that nobody can really explain why it's such a big deal — is now quite dead.</p><p>As a result, the model companies are kind of flailing. In a recent post on Twitter, Sam Altman gave an "<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>updated roadmap for GPT 4.5 and GPT-5</u></a>" where he described how OpenAI would be "simplifying" its product offerings, saying that GPT-4.5 would be OpenAI's "last non-chain-of-thought model," and that GPT-5 would be "a system that integrates a lot of our technology," including o3, OpenAI's "powerful" and "<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-o3-cost-per-query?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>very expensive</u></a>" reasoning model, which it...would also no longer release as a standalone model.</p><p>To break this down, Altman is describing his next model — GPT 4.5 — as launching in some indeterminate timeframe and doing something probably quite similar to the current GPT 4o model. In the case of GPT-5, it would appear that Altman is saying that it won't be a model at all, but some sort of rat king of different mediocre products, including o3, a product that he would no longer be letting you use.</p><p>I guess that's the future of this company, right? OpenAI will release models and uh, well. Uhh.</p><p><em>Uhhhhhhh.</em></p><p>Wait! Wait! OpenAI released a new product! It's called Deep Research, which lets you ask ChatGPT to generate a report by browsing the web. This is almost a cool idea. I sure hope that it doesn't make glaring mistakes and cost a shit-ton of money!</p><p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/chatgpt-deep-research-hands-on/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>let's go to Casey Newton at Platformer for the review</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Generally speaking, the more you already know about something, the more useful I think deep research is. This may be somewhat counterintuitive; perhaps you expected that an AI agent would be well suited to getting you up to speed on an important topic that just landed on your lap at work, for example.&nbsp; In my early tests, the reverse felt true. Deep research excels for drilling deep into subjects you already have some expertise in, letting you probe for specific pieces of information, types of analysis, or ideas that are new to you.<p>It’s possible that you can make this work better than I did. (I think all of us will get better at prompting these models over time, and presumably the product will improve over time as well.)</p></blockquote><p>Personally, when I ask someone to do research on something, I don't know what the answers will be and rely on the researcher to explain stuff through a process called "research." The idea of going into something knowing about it well enough to <em><strong>make sure the researcher didn't fuck something up</strong></em> is kind of counter to the point of <em>research itself.</em></p><p>Also: "I think all of us will get better at prompting-" Casey, we're paying them! We're paying them for them to do stuff for us!</p><p>Nevertheless, I did go and look up one of Casey's examples,<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67a15df0-d2a8-8003-a8df-f01c5ce82083?ref=platformer.news"> <u>specifically one about how the Fediverse could benefit publishers</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Let's do some research!</strong></p><blockquote>Despite Newton's fawning praise, the citations in this "deep research" are flimsy at best.<a href="https://www.twipemobile.com/what-is-the-fediverse-a-guide-for-publishers-and-the-uninitiated/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Interoperability%3A%20Because%20ActivityPub%20enables%20different,who%20uses%20a%20different%20server"> <u>The first (and second) citation</u></a>s are from an SEO-bait article about the fediverse from a "news solutions" company called "Twipe" and is used to define "broad cross-platform reach." The next one is<a href="https://digiday.com/media/why-publishers-are-preparing-to-federate-their-sites/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=At%20least%20two%20digital%20media,driving%20readers%20to%20publishers%E2%80%99%20sites"> <u>from reputable digital advertising outlet Digiday</u></a>, but it's used to cite how sites like 404 Media and The Verge are "actively exploring the Fediverse to take more control over their referral traffic and onsite audience engagement," which is plagiarised ad-verbatim from the Digiday article.<p>After that, the next three citations are <em>posts from Hackernews, a web forum started by yCombinator </em>(</p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34916396&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Mastodon,now%20a%20pretty%20lonely%20place"><u>here's an example</u></a>). How is this "deep research" exactly?<p>In fact, this thing isn't well-researched at all. Across the following paragraphs, Deep Research cites the same Digiday article <em>eight times</em>, before going back to citing the same Twipe article again. It also, hilariously, says that federated posts "can simultaneously publish to [a] website and as a toot on federated platforms like Mastodon and Threads,"</p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/mastodon-toot-retired-twitter-tweet-equivalent-1849786221?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>a term that Mastodon retired two years ago</u></a>.<p>The next two citations are about</p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-embraces-mastodon-19dcb873eb11?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=air%E2%80%A6%20blog,a%20home%20in%20the%20fediverse"> <u>Medium's embrace of Mastodon</u></a>, followed by yet another citation of the Digiday article. Following that, Deep Research cites two different Reddit posts, a company called<a href="https://community.interledger.org/jeremiahlee/interledger-joins-the-fediverse-30fi?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Some%20people%20might%20worry%20that,over%20predominantly%20exclusive%20paid%20access"> <u>Interleger moving to the Fediverse</u></a>, which the report cites several more times, along with yet another forum post, <em>the very same Twipe post several more times</em>, and<a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=This%20distinction%20is%20intended%20to,choice"> <u>then the support documentation for social network Bluesky several more times</u></a>.<p>I won't go through more of the research paper citation by citation, but you'll be shocked to hear it mostly just cites Twipe and Hackernews and Reddit.</p><p>For now, Deep Research is only available on ChatGPT Pro, OpenAI's</p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/06/altman_gpt_profits/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>somehow-unprofitable</u></a> $200-a-month subscription,<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1886220053219069995?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>though it's apparently coming to ChatGPT Plus in a limited capacity</u></a>.<p>Not impressed? Well what if I told you it was</p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1886220051092512979?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>very compute-intensive and expensive</u></a>? Oh, one other detail — the entire thing’s on the very <em>edge </em>of comprehensible. <p>Here’s a bit under funding models:</p><p><em><strong>"Memberships and Donations:</strong> A common monetization approach in the Fediverse (and across the open web) is voluntary support from the audience."</em></p><p>Nobody talks like this! This isn’t how human beings sound! I don’t like reading it! I don’t know how else to say this — there is something deeply unpleasant about how Deep Research reads! It’s uncanny valley, if the denizens of said valley were a bit dense and lazy. It’s quintessential LLM copy — soulless and almost, but <em>not quite</em>, right.&nbsp;</p><p>Ewww.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it folks. OpenAI's next big thing is the ability to generate a report that you would likely not be able to use in any meaningful way anywhere, because while it can browse the web and find things and write a report, it sources things based on what it thinks can confirm its arguments rather than making sure the source material is valid or respectable. This system may have worked if the internet wasn't entirely poisoned by companies trying to get the highest ranking in Google, and if Google had any interest in making sure its results were high quality,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/"> <u>which it does not</u></a>.</p><p>I'm sorry, I know I sound like a hater, and perhaps I am, but this shit doesn't impress me even a little. Wow, you created a superficially-impressive research project that's really long and that cites a bunch of shit it found online that it made little attempt to verify? And said report took a while to generate, can only be produced if you pay OpenAI $200 each month, and it cost a bunch of money in compute to make?</p><p>Deep Research has the same problem as every other generative AI product. These models don't <em>know</em> anything, and thus everything they do — even "reading" and "browsing" the web — is limited by their training data and probabilistic models that can say "this is an article about a subject" and posit their <em>relevance</em>, but not truly understand their contents. Deep Research repeatedly citing SEO-bait as a primary source proves that these models, even when grinding their gears as hard as humanely possible, are exceedingly mediocre, deeply untrustworthy, and ultimately useless.</p><p>Furthermore, nothing about this product moves OpenAI toward profitability. In fact, I think they're doing the opposite. Deep Research uses OpenAI's o3 model<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-o3-cost-per-query?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>which can cost as much as $1,000 a query</u></a>, and while I imagine these prompts aren't <em>that </em>expensive, they are still significantly more so than a regular query from ChatGPT.</p><p>The whole point of hiring a researcher is that you can rely on their research, that they're doing work for you that would otherwise take you hours. Deep Research is the AI slop of academia — low-quality research-slop built for people that don't really care about quality or substance, and it’s not immediately obvious who it’s for.&nbsp;</p><p>Surely, if you’re engaged enough to spend $200 on an OpenAI subscription and are aware of Deep Research, you probably know what SEO bait is, and can distinguish between low-quality and high-quality content. If you were presented with a document with such low-quality, repetitive citations, you’d shred it — and, if created by an intern, you’d shred them too. Or, at the very least, give them some stern words of guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me put this in very blunt terms: we are more than two years into the generative AI boom and OpenAI's biggest, sexiest products are Deep Research — a product that dares to ask "what if you were able to spend a lot of compute to get a poorly-cited research paper," and <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/#:~:text=OpenAI%20is%20as,these%20tasks%20yourself.%22"><u>Operator, a compute-intensive application that rarely completes a task in minutes that would otherwise have taken you seconds</u></a>.</p><p>As an aside, SoftBank, the perennial money-losers that backed WeWork and WireCard and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/11/softbank-vision-fund-loses-32-billion-in-a-year-on-startups-valuation-cut/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>lost more than $30 billion in the last few years</u></a>,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-25-billion-in-openai-03d653fc?mod=article_inline&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>are trying to invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI</u></a>.</p><h3 id="i-feel-like-im-going-insane"><strong>I Feel Like I'm Going Insane</strong></h3><p>Everywhere you look, the media is telling you that OpenAI and their ilk are the future, that they're building "advanced artificial intelligence" that can take "human-like actions," but when you look at any of this shit for more than two seconds it's abundantly clear that it absolutely isn't and absolutely can't.</p><p>Despite the hype, the marketing, the tens of thousands of media articles, the trillions of dollars in market capitalization, none of this feels real, or at least real enough to sustain this miserable, specious bubble. People like Marc Benioff claiming that "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/business/davos-marc-benioff-salesforce-ai-prediction-intl/index.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>today's CEOs are the last to manage all-human workforces</u></a>" are doing so to pump up their stocks rather than build anything approaching a real product. These men are constantly lying as a means of sustaining hype, never actually discussing <strong><em>the products they sell in the year 2025</em></strong>, because then they'd have to say "what if a chatbot, a thing you already have, was more expensive?"</p><p>The tech industry — and part of our economy — is accelerating at speed into a brick wall, driven by people like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Marc Benioff, and Larry Ellison, all men that are incentivized to have you value their companies based on something <em>other</em> than what their businesses actually sell.&nbsp;</p><p>We are in the midst of a group delusion — a consequence of an economy ruled by people that do not participate in labor of any kind outside of sending and receiving emails and going to lunches that last several hours — where the people with the money do not understand or care about human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Their narrative is built on a mixture of hysteria, hype, and deeply cynical hope in the hearts of men that dream of automating away jobs that they would never, ever do themselves. Altman uses his digital baba yaga as a means to stoke the hearts of weak-handed and weak-hearted narcissists that would sooner shoot a man dead than lose a dollar, even if it means making their product that much worse. CEOs have the easiest jobs in the world, and no job is easier than Satya Nadella waving to the Microsoft 365 staff and saying “make them put AI in it, pronto” and telling Microsoft CFO Amy Hood that “we must make sure that Bing has generative AI” before jetting off to Davos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUO7H7OtW3E&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>yell that he intends to burn more money than ever on GPUs</u></a>.</p><p>Sam Altman believes you are stupid. He believes you are a moron that will slurp up whatever slop he gives you. Deep Research and Operator are both half-products that barely brush against the fabric of their intended purposes, and yet the media screams and applauds him like he's a gifted child that just successfully tied his shoes.</p><p>I know, I know, I'm a hater, I'm a pessimist, a cynic, but I need you to fucking listen to me: everything I am describing is unfathomably dangerous,<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/02/ed-zitron-interview-big-tech-ai-criticism.html?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=With%20ChatGPT%20and,really%20matters%20here%3F"> <u>even if you put aside the environmental and financial costs</u></a>.</p><p>Let me ask you a question: what's more likely?</p><p>That OpenAI, a company that has only ever burned money, that appears completely incapable of making a truly usable, meaningful product, somehow makes its products profitable, and then somehow creates a truly autonomous artificial intelligence?</p><p>Or that OpenAI, a company that has consistently burned billions of dollars, that has never shown any sign of making a profit, that has in two years released a selection of increasingly-questionable and obtuse products, actually runs out of money?</p><p>How does this industry actually continue? Do OpenAI and Anthropic continue to raise tens of billions of dollars every six months until they work this out?<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/morgan-stanley-hyperscaler-capex-to-reach-300bn-in-2025/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Do the hyperscalers keep spending hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditures for little measurable return</u></a>?</p><p>And fundamentally, when will everybody start accepting that the things that AI companies are saying have absolutely nothing to do with reality? When will the media stop treating every single expensive, stupid, irksome, quasi-useless new product is magical, and start asking these people to show us the fucking <em>future</em> already?</p><p>Generative AI is a financial, ecological and social time bomb, and I believe that it's fundamentally damaging the relationship between the tech industry and society, while also shining a glaring, blinding light on the disconnection between the powerful and regular people. The fact that Sam Altman can ship such mediocre software and get more coverage and attention than every meaningful scientific breakthrough of the last five years combined is a sign that our society is sick, our media is broken, and that the tech industry thinks we're all fucking morons.</p><p>This entire bubble has been inflated by hype, and by outright lies by people like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, their lies perpetuated by a tech media that's incapable of writing down what's happening in front of their faces. Altman and Amodei are raising billions and burning our planet based on the idea that their mediocre cloud software products will somehow wake up and automate our entire lives.</p><p>The truth is that generative AI is as mediocre as it is destructive, and those pushing it as "the future" that "will change everything" are showing how much contempt they have for the average person. They believe that they can shovel shit into our mouths and tell us it's prime rib, that these half-assed products will change the world and that as a result they need billions of dollars and to<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ai-data-centers-causing-distortions-in-us-power-grid-bloomberg/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>damage our power grid</u></a>.</p><p>I know this has been a rant-filled newsletter, but I'm so tired of being told to be excited about this warmed-up dogshit. I'm tired of reading stories about Sam Altman<a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-says-ai-is-progressing-faster-than-moores-law-as-he-predicts-agi-is-coming-into-view-and-its-leaving-me-worried-about-the-future?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>perpetually saying that we're a year away from "everything changing</u></a>" that exist only to perpetuate the myth that Silicon Valley gives a shit about solving anyone's problems other than<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/rotcombubble/"> <u>finding new growth markets for the tech industry</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I refuse to sit here and pretend that any of this matters. OpenAI and Anthropic are not innovators, and are antithetical to the spirit of Silicon Valley. They are management consultants dressed as founders, cynical con artists raising money for products that will never exist while peddling software that destroys our planet and diverts attention and capital away from things that might solve real problems.</p><p>I'm tired of the delusion. I'm tired of being forced to take these men seriously. I'm tired of being told by the media and investors that these men are building the future when the only things they build are mediocre and expensive. There is no joy here, no mystery, no magic, no problems solved, no lives saved, and very few lives changed other than new people added to Forbes' Midas list.</p><p>None of this is powerful, or impressive, other than in how big a con it’s become. Look at the products and the actual outputs and tell me — does any of this actually feel like the future? Isn’t it kind of weird that the big, scary threats they’ve made about how AI will take our jobs never seem to translate to an actual product? Isn’t it strange that despite all of their money and power they’re yet to make anything truly useful?&nbsp;</p><p>My heart darkens, albeit briefly, when I think of how cynical all of this is. Corporations building products that don't really do much that are being sold on the idea that one day they might, peddled by reporters that want to believe their narratives — and in some cases actively champion them. The damage will be tens of thousands of people fired, long-term environmental and infrastructural chaos, and a profound depression in Silicon Valley that I believe will dwarf the dot-com bust.</p><p>And when this all falls apart — and I believe it will — there will be a very public reckoning for the tech industry.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently had a saga with a washing machine that reminded me why one of the most feared and hated tasks for software developers starts with the question:</p><p><strong><em>“So how long will it take you to build that?”</em></strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93f8979b7255479e718_AD_4nXettmzPU7UXMfVTKRSFXfOYF6S4OPso6G4dMyzlgb7rYRMlZBVBiJ4t_iLo2cXkNCJjbYpWGNnMWb5Ozd00eDVtauoWQ966jRpjkFYtkRwnT1nPHT435fnn-gZo927Mw-kHv9Ok9A.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The familiar appliance luring me into a false sense of security</em></figcaption></figure><p>I just moved house. This was the first time I've ever moved into a home that's just been built, making me the first occupant.</p><p>One of the inevitable jobs on day one is hauling the washing machine into position and connecting it to water and power. This is the ninth house move of my life so I figured this installation would be like all the others.</p><p>Based on experience, it usually takes me 10 minutes or less to install a washing machine. Surely 10 minutes was a reasonable estimate for this time too.</p><div><p>This time, though, it took me 4 whole hours. Why was my estimate so off?</p><p>Here's how and why it reminded me so much of the dark art of software effort estimation.</p><p><strong>Blocker #1</strong></p></div><p>I look at the laundry compartment that the washer will sit in. The power point is in another compartment but the builder has forgotten to drill a hole in the shelf to pass that through. I can’t power the washing machine without that.</p><p><strong>Solution #1</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>I don't have a tool to make a big enough hole, but with a little research I find out a hole saw is the way to do it. It's an open-ended drum with serrated saw teeth that you mount on a drill to do the cutting. I go to my local hardware store, get some advice on what to get, and buy a 60mm hole saw.</p><p><strong>Blocker #2</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>I get home to use the hole saw, and find out that my consumer grade drill can't even fit the hole saw in the chuck - it's too big. I don't have any adapter that can fit it either.</p><p><strong>Solution #2</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>I go back to the hardware store. Another much more experienced-looking staff member tells me (with some slightly rude disdain for my ignorance) that consumer grade drills can't fit or drive hole saws - I need a more powerful trade drill that takes bigger bits. Perhaps so.</p><p>I take his word for it and he lends me his much better drill for $10 for the afternoon and I take it back home. You have to respect the hustle at least. At home, I find that this drill kicks like a mule but I can now mount the hole saw OK.</p><p>I get to drilling and after 25 minutes of learning how to keep it straight and the wonders of noise cancelling earphones, I have a neat 60mm hole with a plastic insert. The cable is through and the power is connected! Job done?</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93fcc990c91fce4dbf1_AD_4nXcQulpnSpcp2KumD9ENeqVn9x0-pTi6XKhKpD28aefS2qXt8hx3MZXrv6plGKFyAqrjbU8yZpaJeSwK3N_gIUx6_eOiopl-U-vu9mXrA-yN61Vku1vT4vl-eNlaGirk_Hj7-cUMfQ.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Hole made and presumably the end of this blog post</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Blocker #3</strong></p><p>I pass the inlet and outlet hoses through another hole the builder has this time remembered to drill for that purpose. However, where these hoses worked fine at my old place, they're now too short in the new setup.	</p><p><strong>Solution #3</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>I go to a big hardware store. I notice that they sell hoses with a concertina design which can expand from 1.2m to 4m. Hey, MY hoses look like just that too - rather than spending $80 on new hoses, maybe I can just expand the ones I have!</p><p><strong>Blocker #4</strong></p><p>I go home to eagerly expand my hoses. While they look remarkably similar - some would say misleadingly so - they do not, in fact, act like concertinas and remain stubbornly short.</p><p><strong>Solution #4</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>I go back to the hardware store and spend $80 to buy new hoses. I go home and install them. Job done?</p><p><strong>Blocker #5</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>As I connect the inlet hose to the cold water tap, I discover for the first time that it's covered by a steel cap which is fastened very tightly - certainly too tightly to remove by hand. The cap measures 35mm across and I don't have a shifting spanner big enough to handle it.</p><p><strong>Solution #5</strong></p><p>Back to the hardware store to buy a bigger shifting spanner. My fifth trip out. Back at home with my new tool, I can easily take off the tap's cap now and connect the water. Success!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93fddd6445181019de1_AD_4nXeztmVe8Qk_iQofAFWLUI355gbK8nHzYbfT1d9i-x8ylPKCnSA2Zr_c0pxtsoenz8eBc2S68-6wWnLVFHoA36vwN0vpD_RBC6rjAWONIGPfCykhClFtg-hiJylVHrQbtYXVFkLzWw.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The cold water tap’s now-removed cap which had been sneakily hiding in plain sight</em></figcaption></figure><p>I connect the washing machine's outlet hose with dirty water to a small spigot under the U-bend beneath the sink. This is the first time I've seen this kind of method to remove the waste water.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93f3b46343d1ec70143_AD_4nXeHPwRv60ygpO6VYNcoaRxaCG3VjoR97Mr3HYT2aRZwZfylUKir6CqGr68IhmOEOi4D40UMLW-dDyO7f5DgzCMzf22XcjlOG6oNKbBWPq12ZB1Dg7fcPQGpDnMyFGWXh2vNWG5ZQg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The spigot in question receiving the outlet hose. And yes, I should have a clamp on that.</em></figcaption></figure><p>I run the machine. I dust off my hands and relax, job done.</p><p><strong>Blocker #6</strong></p><p>After 20 minutes, the washing machine bleeps with an E39 error. Apparently this is a drainage obstruction. I’m resigned rather than surprised at this point.</p><p><strong>Solution #6</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Poking an exploratory screwdriver into the U-bend's spigot, I find it ends not with a hole into the U-bend but with a PVC wall. But of course it does: if you didn't have a hose connected to the spigot, waste water coming down the U-bend could back up and spill out below your sink. It turns out you have to drill out the PVC wall before connecting the hose, something I had no idea that was required before beginning the project.</p><p>I don't have a spade bit with the perfect width to open the hole, so I pick the biggest drill bit I have to hand. I contort myself to get under the sink to drill. It's not great but it gets the job done.</p><p>I connect the drainage pipe again. I run the washing machine. It works. After five trips to hardware shops to pick up supplies and drop off borrowed drills, I am too tired to celebrate much.</p><p>My initial 10 minute time estimate has gone 24 times over my time budget at 4 hours, including my five round trips to hardware stores.&nbsp;</p><h2>What did I learn?</h2><p>My woeful underestimate was informed by multiple sets of experience installing washing machines, but I had never installed a washing machine in a <em>new</em> house which presented a whole host of challenges I had no idea even existed before I began. “Unknown unknowns” as we might say.</p><p>As I was thinking about it the next day, <strong>it reminded me in a very physical form why a lot of why software development estimation is so hard.</strong> So often we're asked to build something we've built before, so we estimate with confidence that it might take a week.</p><p>What we fail to factor in is that while 90% of the project will be the same, there's going to be <strong>one critical difference</strong> between the last 5 projects and this project that seemed trivial at the time of estimation but will throw off our whole schedule. I could be one or all of:</p><p>1) Our well-used task-running framework we were going to use for a relatively small part of the system is totally unmaintained now and we'd have to fork it to make it fit for purpose again.</p><p>2) Our entire development tooling ecosystem was obsoleted 18 months after the last time we did this, so we're going to be learning the sharp edges of a whole new toolchain from scratch.</p><p>3) We find that our OS version has moved on and no longer supports key requirements for our existing dependencies, requiring rethinking or developing from scratch.</p><p>4) We need our infrastructure stack to use one component we've never used before and it doesn't work anything like we expected.</p><p>5) We otherwise find there are unstated, totally unknown, or seemingly trivial requirements that significantly change the effort that's going to be required.</p><p>A new house blew out my effort assumptions this time.&nbsp;The shifting sands of software development practices are like moving into new houses multiple times each year.</p><div><p><strong>So what do we do about it when we don’t even know what questions to ask before setting out on any software project, especially one that ostensibly seems routine?</strong></p><p>For my washing machine, they were unknown unknowns - I didn’t even expect there’d be a hole to drill, new hoses to buy, a cold water tap cap to remove, and a spigot PVC wall to drill out.</p></div><p>Yes, we can (and must) gather requirements as best we can, but at some point we’ll end up on the ground and battling dozens of blockers we didn’t expect to hit, even when we thought the territory looked very familiar and a 10 minute job turns into 4 hours.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h2>ON DAVID LYNCH'S <em>REVENGE OF THE JEDI</em></h2><p>Prologue</p><p>SOMEHOW MY FATHER CONVINCED MY mother to squander a date night and watch David Lynch’s <em>Dune</em> when it was in the theaters in 1984. I was seven; my sister, five. When we asked about the movie, my mother or my father or both—they may’ve coordinated their anecdote—told me they knew they were in trouble when the theater manager handed out to everyone in the audience a one-sheet that attempted to explain the intricacies of the film’s logic.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I am the theater manager. What’s worse, the production I hope to untangle is my own.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1977, George Lucas released <em>Star Wars</em>. In 1980, he released a sequel, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, and, in 1983, another sequel, <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. During <em>Jedi</em>’s production, and even after its release, <em>Jedi</em> was often referred to as <em>Star Wars</em> <em>III</em>. This is not to be confused with <em>Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith</em>, a <em>Star Wars</em> prequel released in 2005. Also, until the end of 1982, <em>Return of the Jedi</em> was titled <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>. This is not to be confused with <em>Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I write about two directors named David. David Lynch, who wrote and directed <em>Blue Velvet</em> and co-created/directed <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and David Cronenberg, who wrote and directed <em>Videodrome</em> and the 1986 remake of <em>The Fly</em>. I don’t mean for this to be confusing.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And:</p><p>&nbsp; Two excerpts from the screenplay for David Lynch’s <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em> appear in this essay. The first begins, “INTERIOR: DEATH STAR—MAIN DOCKING BAY”; the second begins, “INTERIOR: JABBA’S PALACE—HALLWAY.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay. Let’s begin.</p><p>1.</p><p>George Lucas and producer Howard Kazanjian considered a number of directors for the third <em>Star Wars</em> film. By April 1981, the decision was between two directors; Lucas offered the job to David Lynch. According to Kazanjian, Lynch “was thrilled.”&nbsp;At that point, and since May 1980, the film was called <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR—MAIN DOCKING BAY</p><p>CLOSE UP: the face of Darth Vader, mask of volcanic glass, brilliantly lit landing bay and white-armored legions therein reflected—a star-field.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WIPE TO:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EXTERIOR: ROAD TO JABBA THE HUTT’S PALACE—TATOOINE</p><p>(As the image of Darth Vader’s face is erased, our eyes naturally look to the image that replaces Vader’s face: a desert road—but for a moment, the Vader star-field and the road share the screen. Even as Vader’s face is replaced by sand, there is an afterimage—an ocular trick—that lingers: the sharp angles of Vader’s face, the dark lenses where would be eyes, the breath—a machine, a desert wind—crackles hate. In this afterimage, all the seams of Vader’s mask are apparent and the gruesome flesh within seeks to ooze from them.</p><p>We float above the desert road. “Ripples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of the moon. The WHISPERING grains billow up like the foam of waves as they hit the rock.”&nbsp; Sand blows past and toward the horizon.</p><p>A wind, barely audible but felt large, sounds along the road, caught between walls of rock, a road cut millions of years before by torrents of water all gone deep underground.</p><p>CUT TO:</p><p>INTERIOR: “DARK WATER - MENTAL IMAGE</p><p>…</p><p>“Suddenly a drop falls into the black, and white-hot widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.</p><p>“Darkness again.”</p><p>CUT TO:</p><p>EXTERIOR: ROAD TO JABBA THE HUTT’S PALACE—TATOOINE</p><p>Only the desperate and the foolhardy use this road. “We hear a familiar beeping and a distinctive voice before [we catch sight] of Artoo-Detoo and See-Threepio [as they make] their way along the road toward the ominous palace….”</p><p>2.</p><p>Among the best-known on Lucas and Kazanjian’s list of might-be directors for the new <em>Star Wars</em> film were Richard Donner, John Carpenter, Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg, Richard Lester, and John Boorman. This list provides us with a set of what-ifs, some not as compelling as others. Donner, for instance, had, by 1981, directed <em>The Omen</em> (’76), <em>Superman</em> (’78), <em>Inside Moves</em> (’80) and half (give or take) of <em>Superman II</em> (’80). The <em>Superman</em> films make him an obvious choice: He worked within a well-established mythology, with significant FX, and, incidentally, with composer John Williams. Furthermore, Donner’s films are without a notable style—a plus if Lucas wanted his trilogy to look of a piece.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As out-of-place as the other directors on Kazajian and Lucas’s list might seem, when their cinematic careers are considered only to 1981, their inclusion is easier to understand. By ’81 for instance, Terry Gilliam had directed only one film, the fantasy comedy <em>Jabberwocky</em> (’77) (<em>Time Bandits</em> was released in November of ’81, six months after Lucas chose David Lynch for <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>). Prior to John Carpenter’s first big budget effort <em>The Fog</em> (’80), he directed <em>Dark Star</em> (’75)<a href="https://www.benningtonreview.org/adam-golaski/#footnote-one">[1]</a>, a comic sf film; <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em> (’76); and <em>Halloween</em> (‘78). He also co-wrote the screenplay for <em>The Eyes of Laura Mars</em> (’78), directed by Irvin Kershner (whose next film was <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>). David Cronenberg’s <em>The Brood</em> (’79) and <em>Scanners</em> (’80) saw the director beyond the low-rent look of <em>Shivers</em> (’75) and <em>Rabid</em> (’77) and the avant-garde of his student films <em>Stereo</em> (’69) and <em>Crimes of the Future</em> (’70); and though his preoccupation with body horror is very present, it wouldn’t be firmly established until <em>Videodrome</em> in 1982. Before ’81, a single image represented all of Cronenberg’s oeuvre: the exploding head of the First Scanner, designed by Chris Walas, a “creature consultant” on <em>Jedi</em>.</p><div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Richard Lester and John Boorman were both experienced filmmakers. Since the Beatles’ film <em>A Hard Day’s Night</em> (’64), Lester directed fourteen films before ’80 (and, in 1980, he directed the other half of <em>Superman II</em>); since <em>Catch Us If You Can</em> (’65), a vehicle for beat group The Dave Clark Five, Boorman directed six films before ’81, notably <em>Deliverance</em> (’72). Lester, either an influence on Lucas or a director whose films Lucas “kind of liked,”&nbsp;became a more conservative director after <em>The Bed Sitting Room</em> (’69). Throughout the seventies, and culminating with his Superman films (parts II and III) in the eighties, Lester moved toward big-budget fantasy. Boorman’s catalog, on the other hand, gets progressively weirder (<em>Zardoz</em> [‘73], <em>Exorcist II: The Heretic</em> [‘77]).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Would <em>Jedi</em> be different if directed by any of these what-ifs?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How different?</p></div><p>3.</p><p>Lucas chose Lynch to direct <em>Jedi</em> shortly after <em>The Elephant Man</em> (’80), Lynch’s second feature film, proved to be a success (It was nominated for four Golden Globe awards and eight Academy Awards and won several international awards, including the BAFTA for Best Picture), but Lucas was already familiar with, and liked, Lynch’s work. Lucas, overseeing second-unit work at Elstree Studios in London for <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> (’80), crossed paths with director Stanley Kubrick, who was filming <em>The Shining</em> (’80). “Lucas had just seen David Lynch’s <em>Eraserhead,</em> and praised it for its timeless style: ‘You couldn’t tell what decade it was shot in,’ he told Kubrick, admiringly.” (For what it’s worth, Kubrick liked <em>Eraserhead</em> too. According to David Hughes’s <em>The Complete Lynch</em>, Kubrick “screened <em>Eraserhead</em> for the cast and crew of <em>The Shining</em>, in order to put them in the mood for the film he was making.” Lynch tells a related anecdote in his book <em>Catching the Big Fish</em>:</p><p>…[some guys who were working with George Lucas] said, “Yesterday, David, we were out at Elstree Studios, and we met Kubrick. And as we were talking to him he said to us, ‘How would you fellas like to come up to my house tonight and see my favorite film?’” They said, “That would be fantastic.” They went up, and Stanley Kubrick showed them <em>Eraserhead</em>. So, right then, I could have passed away peaceful and happy.</p><p>[By the way (and I realize we’re in the midst of a for-what-it’s-worth), while there is no reason to doubt this anecdote, I <em>do</em> doubt that Kubrick said, “fellas,” etc.—the whole dialogue was clearly put through a Lynch filter.])</p><p>INTERIOR: JABBA’S PALACE—HALLWAY</p><p>CLOSE UP: the back of Threepio’s golden head: the reflected light fills the screen, dims as the giant metal door closes behind them—just before we hear the sound of the door’s teeth meet, the light goes—for a long second, we see nothing but the faint, oval-shape of Threepio’s head, then on either side of Threepio’s head, appear the grotesque faces of the palace guards: skin the texture of a slug’s and slick with a sweat of mucus, pink-rimmed snouts, stupid-marble eyes, and yellowed tusks protruding from their lower lip.</p><p>DISSOLVE TO:</p><p>The face of “Bib Fortuna, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.”</p><p>CLOSE UP: of Fortuna’s mouth, a round hole full of little, pointed teeth, and Fortuna’s pale lips—Fortuna’s face drifts in and out of focus as he shouts an abrupt greeting in the club tongue. After a brief exchange between Fortuna and Threepio—punctuated by beeps and trills from Artoo—Fortuna agrees to bring the pair face-to-face with his master.</p><p>We watch as the droids, Fortuna, and the two palace guards walk deep into the tunnel, an “endless black cavity.” We can’t tell exactly when, but they slip out of sight around a bend in the tunnel.</p><p>INTERIOR: JABBA’S THRONE ROOM</p><p>“…filled with… creatures…. Artoo and Threepio” hesitate beneath an arch made of a local stone and without any decoration. The cavernous space is dark, and the curved, low ceiling creates dark spaces. (“…some sets were so murky and cloistered it was difficult to navigate within them…” “Most of the sets are very dark…. It’s just made life rather difficult, to physically get the light into the sets, which has been built with ceilings in.”&nbsp;“‘There was a breathing problem,’ Kazanjian confirms. Indeed, temperatures on the set reached 100<strong>°</strong> under the lights with so many personnel jammed into such a small area, while conditions inside the monster suits were unimaginable”). Threepio faces an empty space where, logically, Jabba would sit. Instead,</p><p>[Lynch] shows us something that isn’t in [Frank Herbert’s novel <em>Dune</em>]. With his fascination for physical and psychological transformation and the potential Otherness of flesh, Lynch is compelled to visualize a Third Stage Guild Navigator…. The… burnished gilt and emerald Grand Hall is penetrated by a glistening black locomotive-sized oblong box.... [“The golden Byzantian of the throne room is invaded by a locomotive-like carriage bearing the gigantic amoeba who rules the universe.”] The sides of the huge box slide back, revealing a glass tank filled with orange fog. Then… a creature glides out of the mist and up to the camera. A giant peach-colored head with a massive cranial dome, cauliflower-textured face with a small, vulva-shaped vertical mouth, pale, wide-spaced eyes almost on the sides of the head, spindly arms and hands, and a long, insect-pupa-like body tapering back into the fog.</p><p>Threepio greets the Third Guild Navigator; the Third Guild Navigator doesn’t exactly reply, but it does speak:</p><p>THIRD GUILD NAVIGATOR</p><p>We have just folded space from Ix…. Many machines on Ix… new machines. Better than those on Richesse… you are transparent… I see many things… I see plans within plans.</p><p>THREEPIO</p><p>[Impatiently addresses Artoo] The message, Artoo, the message.</p><p>4.</p><p>David Lynch declined the offer to direct <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several explanations for why Lynch turned down Lucas’ offer. Kazanjian implied—in either an interview conducted by John Philip Peecher in 1983 or an interview conducted by J. W. Rinzler between 2011 and 2012 (the bibliography in Rinzler’s <em>The Making of Return of the Jedi</em> doesn’t make this clear)—that Lynch turned down the offer because Dino De Laurentiis offered him <em>Dune</em>, an offer Lynch accepted. More recently, Kazanjian said, at a Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, that Lynch wasn’t hired because, “Ah, he didn’t want Johnny Williams to do the music and he didn’t want Ben Burtt—Academy Award winner like three times—to do the sound.” He added, “That’s the truth and only you guys have heard it.” The audience applauds, and the moderator adds, “Ha, ha, ha, ha. Wow. That’s incredible.”Incredible, yes—as in hard to believe. Kazanjian’s original claim, that Lynch weighed the pros and cons of Lucas’s offer and chose <em>Dune</em> instead, is more credible.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While promoting<em> INLAND EMPIRE</em>, Lynch was interviewed by Josh Horowitz for <em>MTV News</em> and was asked, “Is it true you almost directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>? How close did you come?” Lynch replied, “Not close at all. I had a meeting with George [Lucas]. I like George. It was his thing. I said, ‘You should direct this. It’s your thing! It’s not my thing.’” Lynch added, in an interview with Chris Rodley, “And, obviously, Star Wars was totally George’s thing,” and <em>then</em>, after considering Thomas Harris’s <em>The Red Dragon</em> (ultimately directed by Michael Mann as <em>Manhunter</em> [‘86]), he was offered <em>Dune</em>. My favorite retelling of the story, repeated in part in J. W. Rinzler’s <em>The Making of Return of the Jedi</em>, is in response to the question, “Why’d you turn down George Lucas for directing <em>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</em>?” What follows is Lynch’s anecdote (to preserve the character of the anecdote—oft repeated but unrehearsed—I’ve kept ahs and stutters, etc.):</p><p>I was asked ah by George ah to ah come up to see him and talk to him about directing [what] would be the third <em>Star Wars</em>. And I had next door to zero interest, but I always admired George… you know George is a guy that does what he loves, and I do what I love, the difference is what George loves makes hundreds of billions of dollars. So I thought I should go up and at least visit with him and it was incredible. I had to go to this building in LA first and get a special credit card and I had to get special keys and a letter came and a map and, um, then I went into the airport and I flew up and then they had a rental car all ready for me and these keys and you know everything was set and I was to drive to this place and I came into an office and there was George and he he talked with me for a little bit and then he said “I want to show you something” and right about at this time I started to get a little bit of a headache just a—you know what I’m talking about—okay… so he took me upstairs and he showed me these things called Wookies. And now this headache is gettin’, you know, gettin’ stronger. And he showed me many animals and different things. Then he took me for a ride in his Ferrari for a lunch and George is ah, kind of short so he was he was his seat was way back and he was almost lying down in the car and we were flying through this little town up in Northern California we went to a restaurant—not that I don’t like salad but that’s all they had was was salad—then I got a really, like, almost like a migraine headache and I could hardly wait to get to home and I and even before I got home I kind of crawled into a phone booth and called my agent and said there was no way no way I could do this. “He said David David David calm down you don’t have to do this.” And, um, so George, bless his heart, I told him on the phone the next day that he should direct it it’s his film he’d invented everything about it but he doesn’t really love directing and so someone else did direct that film. But uh, I did I called my lawyer and told him I wasn’t going to do it and he said you just lost I don’t know how many millions of dollars but it’s okay.”</p><p>There’s no audience reaction included at the end of this clip, but Lynch’s anecdote is meant to amuse, and it is amusing—I assume the reaction was laughter.</p><p>5.</p><p>That Lynch was offered <em>Jedi</em> is generally met with bemusement. For instance, Dan Fitch wrote, “The very notion is as surreal as one of David Lynch’s own films. Could the director of such unorthodox fare as <em>Eraserhead</em>, <em>Blue Velvet</em>, and <em>Lost Highway</em>, really have taken charge on <em>Star Wars: Episode VI: [Return of the Jedi]</em>?”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There’s nothing surreal about a film producer generating a list of available directors, and that list getting narrowed down to one or two. Nor was it surreal to consider Lynch. He was a respected director, he’d made a film for a Hollywood studio (Brooksfilms) that was a commercial success, and he was available. It’s only strange (let’s not use the word “surreal”) in retrospect. In 1981, Lynch was not yet the “Czar of Bizarre.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fitch goes on to speculate, “As for what would have been the consequence of a Lynch directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, YouTube is awash with <em>Star Wars</em> fans’ interpretations. Those backward-talking Emperors have to be seen to be believed.” Fitch exaggerates; there are three such interpretations, the best by Samuel C. Spitale. As parodies, these interpretations are amusing, but in no way do they imagine a Lynch-directed <em>Jedi</em>. As Greg Olson suggests, “[Lynch] made the sound judgment that he didn’t want to be a journeyman worker within a minutely detailed imaginative universe of established characters and situations that another artist had dreamed up.” We might modify Olson’s claim; Frank Herbert’s novel <em>Dune</em> is “a minutely detailed imaginative universe of established characters and situations that another artist had dreamed up”—but it wasn’t “dreamed up” on film. Lynch would author the look of <em>Dune</em>. He would not have such a free hand with a <em>Star Wars</em> sequel.</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jedi</em> could never be Lynch’s <em>Jedi</em>—except subtly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;David Lynch’s <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em> would have a different texture. Scenes we know well—Artoo-Detoo and See-Threepio’s encounter with Bib Fortuna inside the cavernous entryway to Jabba the Hutt’s throne room, for instance, would require little to be made “Lynchian.” A close-up on Fortuna’s hideous mouth. A moment in the dark when we can no longer tell if Threepio is somewhere in front of us, or if he’s rounded an invisible corner (“…I always like something dark in the frame...”). There’s so much in that scene that fits the Lynch aesthetic—concrete, inscrutable language, the importance of sound design.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Texture is a key word in the Lynch lexicon—Lynch on texture:</p><p>I don’t necessarily love rotting bodies, but there’s a texture to a rotting body that is unbelievable. Have you ever seen a little rotted animal? I love looking at those things, just as much as I like to look at a close-up of some tree bark, or a small bug, or a cup of coffee, or a piece of pie. You get in close, and the textures are wonderful.</p><p>Lynch’s appreciation for texture is apparent across his oeuvre. From the inclusion of resin sculpture or impressed objects in paintings such as “Man Throwing Up” (’67), “Rock with Seven Eyes” (’96), and “I See My Love” (‘12) to the body parts that equip “Fish Kit” (’79) and “Chicken Kit” (’83), to the curtains—“the walls are red, but they’re not hard walls”—in <em>Twin Peaks</em>’ (’90 – ‘91) red room, to the lamp he builds in the short film “Lamp” (’03). And this is Lynch on texture in Frank Herbert’s novel <em>Dune</em>:</p><p>In a lot of ways, this novel is the antithesis of the usual raygun and spaceship science fiction I’m used to seeing. <em>Dune</em> has believable characters and a lot of depth, a lot of resonance. It’s not all surface flash. In many ways, Herbert created an <em>internal</em> adventure, one with a lot of emotional and physical textures. And I love textures.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Lynch’s <em>Dune</em>, shortly after the Third Guild Navigator floats toward its microphone, Lynch cuts to a close-up of its eye, then to a close up of the fleshy “v” that is its mouth—texture. Lynch’s vision of the Third Guild Navigator—“a doughy grasshopper”—is reminiscent of the baby in <em>Eraserhead</em>, a moist clay horror of Lynch’s own making and reminiscent of the more monstrous concept drawings of Jabba the Hutt. Picture old Jabba, licking his lips. James Daniels suggests that the inclusion of the Third Guild Navigator is a direct result of the <em>Star Wars</em> films: “Just as post-<em>SW</em> audiences demanded futuristic weapons, they also demanded weird-looking aliens.” It’s more likely Lynch included the Third Guild Navigator because, having read on in the <em>Dune</em> series, and under contract to direct two sequels, he envisioned what a Third Guild Navigator might look like, and wanted to include one in the film.</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dune</em> offers insight into how texture would subtly color David Lynch’s <em>Revenge of the</em> <em>Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(I say this is true—that <em>Dune</em> offers insight into how texture would subtly color David Lynch’s <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>—in spite of what the makers of <em>Dune</em> themselves said at the time. For instance, Freddie Francis, David Lynch’s cinematographer, said in 1984: “One doesn’t want it to look like <em>Star Wars IV</em>, and it’s not that sort of film anyway.” By <em>Star Wars</em> <em>IV</em>, Francis didn’t mean <em>A New Hope</em>; he meant he didn’t want Dune to look like a sequel to <em>Jedi</em>.)</p><p>6.</p><p>At a multiplex in Boston during the summer of 1983 I peeked into a theater and saw on the screen Luke Skywalker make his way cautiously across a metal walkway in a dark chamber. A scene <em>like</em> the scene toward the end of <em>Jedi</em>, when Luke and Vader fight in the Emperor’s throne room, but a scene not actually in the film. Perhaps a showing of David Lynch’s <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>7.</p><p>George Lucas and producer Howard Kazanjian considered a number of directors for the third <em>Star Wars</em> film. By April 1981, the decision was between two directors: David Lynch and Richard Marquand. Lucas first offered the job to Lynch; when Lynch declined, Marquand was offered the job, and accepted. Richard Marquand directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michel Chion speculates as to why Lucas offered <em>Jedi</em> to Lynch at all:</p><p>In 1981, Lucas proposed that Lynch direct the third episode of the first <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, <em>Return of the Jedi</em> (1983). This was a sign of esteem and confidence, in view of the financial as well as the emotional stakes riding on this third episode which would have to match the global success of the first two. Lucas’s choice may seem surprising, because in <em>Star Wars</em> (1977) and <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> (1980), the emphasis had been on the brio with which scenes were linked to each other and on the light heartedness of the overall tone. …Lucas’s proposition suggests that along with the obligatory purple passages, he wished to give the third episode a graver tone in line with the mellowing of characters and the trials they had undergone.</p><p>I wonder, though: if Lucas was looking to make a darker entry, Lynch makes sense, but why, then, consider Marquand? Let me propose, alternative to Chion’s theory, that maybe Lucas entertained, <em>simultaneously</em>, radically different visions for his film. A dark <em>Star Wars</em> and a bright <em>Star Wars</em>. Jabba’s palace <em>or</em> the forest moon Endor.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps Lucas knew Lynch would never direct a <em>Star Wars</em>. Lucas enjoyed the <em>frisson</em> of offering the film to Lynch, but deliberately set out to scare Lynch away with “Wookies” (obviously, Ewoks).</p><p>Coda</p><p>Richard Marquand directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His film credits were few—a horror flick called <em>The Legacy</em> (’78), a Beatles biopic (instead of actors, impersonators—covers the same ground as <em>Backbeat</em> (’94) but lacks Laura Palmer), and a respectable spy film called <em>Eye of the Needle</em> (’81)—Lucas: “Richard Marquand was the director of the film [<em>Return of the Jedi</em>]. He’d done some great suspense films and was really good at working with actors. <em>Eye of the Needle</em>&nbsp;was the film I’d seen that he had done that impressed me the most. It was really nicely done, had a lot of energy and suspense.”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Directed, in the case of <em>Jedi</em>, means Marquand sat in the director’s chair. What else it means, is unclear. The Lucasfilm line on Marquand is that all he could direct were scenes with actors, and otherwise deferred to Lucas, who directed as producer, as he explains:</p><p>These movies [the <em>Star Wars</em> films] by this time had gotten to be more like television shows. The hierarchy in the way a television show works creatively is very much different than the way it works on a motion picture. The executive producer pretty much is the overall creative overseer of the project and comes up with the ideas for the scripts and, you know, directors just try to fulfill the obligation of getting it on the screen.</p><p>Marquand’s role as director in-name-only is further implied in <em>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy</em>. The narrator states, “Another challenge on the set was Richard Marquand’s relative inexperience with special effects”; then Carrie Fisher reiterates the point; finally, over footage of Marquand taking cues from Lucas in front of the Endor bunker set, we hear a voice-over of Lucas—“I hadn’t realized that, you know, ultimately it was probably easier for me to do those things than to farm them out because it was even more complex than the last one, I really did have to end up being there every day on the set and working very closely with Richard and shooting second unit….”</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marquand, however, in a 1984 interview with Jules-Pierre Malartre, claims his directorial stamp is on <em>Jedi</em>: “If you look at the three<em>&nbsp;Star Wars</em>&nbsp;movies, you can see they’re very different. Their look and approach to action and camera work, and so forth, are very different.” Credible, except for special effects shots—who directs the shot of a model of an Imperial shuttle moving toward a matte painting of the unfinished Death Star? Marquand further complicates the question of who directed <em>Jedi</em> when he describes his style: “I love to gain a tremendous simplicity. I like to make it look as though it’s tremendously easy, as though there wasn’t a camera around very much. I don’t love flashy work. I like to make it look like it just slid in and happened”—his style, Marquand explains, is to have no discernable style at all.</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Return of the Jedi</em> could only ever be George Lucas’s <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. Even Lucas’s <em>Jedi</em> could only be the third <em>Star Wars</em> based on the template established by the first <em>Star Wars</em>. The only totally original vision is <em>A New Hope</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After <em>Jedi</em>, Marquand directed <em>Until September</em> (’84), a romantic drama starring Karen Allen. Then <em>Jagged Edge</em> (’85). Robert Loggia was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor; it’s the film Glen Close starred in before <em>Fatal Attraction</em> (’87). Janet Maslin dismissed <em>Jagged Edge</em> for its “crashing melodrama”; Paul Attenasio damns it as a “director’s exercise.” (There’s a child in the film—I can’t remember whose child—none of the characters are responsible enough to raise children—but I amused myself examining his bedroom: a futuristic truck on his shelf [I spent too much time trying to identify it; it resembles the titular vehicle from the television show <em>Ark II</em> (’76)—perhaps it’s a model from <em>Jedi</em>?] There’s a <em>Ghostbusters</em> (’84) poster and, on the back of his bedroom door, a poster for <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marquand’s last picture is <em>Hearts of Fire</em> (’87), the story of a highly likeable tollbooth operator and singer-songwriter named Molly McGuire who attracts the attention of a middle-aged, retired rocker named Billy Parker. She inspires him to leave his chicken farm and go on tour in England and he invites her to join him as his opening act. While in England, she’s seduced by James Colt—a soulless pop star whose hit song (a cover of Soft Cell’s “Tainted Love”) is all over the radio. Molly is played by “Fiona”—Fiona Flanagan; Billy is played by Bob Dylan.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The film’s only delight is Fiona, but… well… Bob Dylan is in it. How do you remain largely unknown after you direct a <em>Star Wars</em> film (of the original trilogy!) <em>and</em> Bob Dylan?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At a press conference in London for <em>Hearts of Fire</em>, Dylan sits behind a long table with Fiona, Marquand, and… I don’t know who else, the camera keeps zooming in on Dylan. Journalists, incredulous that Dylan is acting in a movie they already know is lousy, keep asking Dylan, Why? Why did you do this film? Dylan offers a variety of non-answers, as is his wont: “Oh, it’s just the right time, the right place, the right words.” To the question, “Why didn’t you write the script yourself?” Dylan replies, “I couldn’t’ve written a script like this, it’s beyond me.” All this can be seen in the documentary <em>Getting to Dylan</em> (’86); watch it for Marquand—he’s quite charming.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marquand died of a stroke weeks before <em>Hearts of Fire</em> was released.</p>

<p>BOSTON — The apparent leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians has been arrested in Maryland along with another member of the group, Maryland State Police said Monday.</p>
<p>Jack Lasota, 34, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania. They face multiple charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in the vehicle.</p>
<p>A bail hearing for the the two is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court.</p>
<p>The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-d40ffa36bad16cfce6174daa3cd3fb96" id="link-1">David Maland</a> near the Canadian border in January and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.</p>
<p>Maland, 44, was killed in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-3ced268f987df53069d0096465ea2271" id="link-2">a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont</a>, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Officials have offered few details of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-agent-killed-78d4336b6ee5ea0bb4ae372627e37f67" id="link-3">cross-country investigation</a>, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of Maland. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.</p>
<p>Their goals aren’t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>At the middle of it all is “Ziz,” who appears to be the leader of the strange group members who called themselves “Zizians.” She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.</p>
<p>LaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and “often desire to kill each other.”</p>
<p>LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-youngblut-72c1b68aeb3d52cccb05b6b850d83450" id="link-4">attorney Daniel McGarrigle</a> declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.</p>
<p>Reached on Monday, McGarrigle would only confirm that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With OpenSSL, it’s pretty easy to generate a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate">self-signed TLS certificate</a>. Just run the following command:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days <span>365</span> -nodes -keyout cert.key -out cert.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The files that this command generates, <code>cert.key</code> and <code>cert.crt</code>, could be passed to a web server, for example, and it will work fine; that is, all the connections made to that web server will be properly encrypted. The only problem with using this certificate, however, is that our browser doesn’t trust it, because it has not been signed with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authority</a> that the browser trusts.</p><p>When you visit a website that uses a self-signed TLS certificate, the browser will block your request and tell you that it’s not safe to proceed. You can, of course, ignore that warning and continue, and for your use-case that might be just fine. After all, self-signed certificates are only useful for private use, such as for testing. But even for private use, if the server is accessed via the open internet, as opposed to from within a trusted private network, it’ll be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and so it won’t be secure.</p><p>The solution to this problem is to create our own certificate authority (CA), sign our certificates using our CA, and add the CA to the operating system’s (or the browser’s) list of trusted certificate authorities.</p><p>(If you have absolutely no idea how SSL/TLS works, you might want to either read <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/">this article</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Df5_cojAs">watch this video</a> or consult some other source before continuing. This post is only about the mechanics of getting this working on Linux, and so it doesn’t explain any of the concepts behind anything.)</p><p>First, we need to generate a private key and a certificate for our certificate authority:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out rootca.key
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>openssl req -x509 -key rootca.key -out rootca.crt -subj <span>"/CN=localhost-ca/O=localhost-ca"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the certificate of our CA is self-signed, which is necessarily the case with root certificate authorities—and our CA is a root CA. And it’s issued by an organization named ‘localhost-ca’ (the name, of course, is completely arbitrary).</p><p>Next, we need to generate a private key for the signed certificate we’ll be creating. In this example, we’ll be issuing a certificate for <code>localhost</code>, so we’ll name the private key <code>localhost.key</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out localhost.key
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request">certificate signing request</a> file, which we’ll use to obtain a signed certificate from our CA. But before we do that, we need to create a config file which we’ll pass to the <code>openssl</code> commands that follow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We’ll name this file <code>csr.conf</code>:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="conf">[req]
distinguished_name = dn
prompt             = no
req_extensions = req_ext

[dn]
CN="localhost"

[req_ext]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.0 = localhost
</code></pre><p>The <code>CN=localhost</code> line specifies that we’re using this config file to obtain a certificate for the domain name <code>localhost</code>. Additional domain names, which the certificate will be valid for, could be specified in the <code>[alt_names]</code> section (with the first domain name named <code>DNS.0</code>, the second one named <code>DNS.1</code>, etc).</p><p>Now we can create the certificate signing request file:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl req -new -key localhost.key -out localhost.csr -config csr.conf
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The final step is to obtain a signed certificate from our very own certificate authority:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl x509 -req -days <span>365</span> -extensions req_ext -extfile csr.conf -CA rootca.crt -CAkey rootca.key -in localhost.csr -out localhost.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>localhost.crt</code> file that this command generates is our certificate for the <code>localhost</code> domain, and <code>localhost.key</code> is its private key. The certificate is now signed with the private key of our CA, so that anyone with our CA’s public certificate, <code>rootca.crt</code>, can verify that the certificate is signed by our CA.</p><p>All we have to do now is to get our operating-system or the browser to trust our CA. At this point, I would suggest spinning up an HTTPS server at <code>localhost</code>, with the certificate and the private key that we just created, to test whether our certificate is working as it should after we make our CA a trusted CA.</p><h3 id="installing-a-root-ca-certificate-system-wide-on-ubuntu">Installing a root CA certificate system-wide on Ubuntu</h3><p>On Ubuntu, root certificates can be installed with:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>sudo cp rootca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>sudo update-ca-certificates
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Firefox and Chromium, however, on Ubuntu, use their own certificate stores; so you’ll have to import the root certificate to these browsers individually. Programs like <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code> should be able to access <code>https://localhost</code> without a problem now.</p><h3 id="installing-a-root-ca-certificate-system-wide-on-arch-linux">Installing a root CA certificate system-wide on Arch Linux</h3><p>On Arch Linux, root certificates can be installed using:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>sudo trust anchor rootca.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There’s no need to add root certificates individually to Firefox or Chromium on Arch Linux as the browsers use the system-wide certificates.</p><h3 id="installing-a-root-ca-certificate-in-firefox">Installing a root CA certificate in Firefox</h3><ol><li>Go to Settings → Privacy &amp; Security.</li><li>Scroll down to the ‘Certificates’ section and click ‘View certificates’.</li><li>Import the <code>rootca.crt</code> file in the ‘Authorities’ section.</li><li>Tick all the checkboxes and hit ‘OK’.</li><li><code>https://localhost</code> should give you no warnings now (you might have to restart the browser).</li></ol><h3 id="installing-a-root-ca-certificate-in-chromium">Installing a root CA certificate in Chromium</h3><ol start="6"><li>Go to Settings -&gt; Privacy and Security -&gt; Security -&gt; Manage certificates.</li><li>Go to the ‘Authorities’ tab and import the <code>rootca.crt</code> file.</li><li>Tick all the checkboxes and hit ‘OK’.</li><li><code>https://localhost</code> should give you no warnings now (you might have to restart the browser).</li></ol></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">NES86 is an IBM PC emulator for the NES.<br>
The goal of this project is to emulate an Intel 8086 processor and supporting PC hardware
well enough to run the
<a href="https://github.com/ghaerr/elks">Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset (ELKS)</a>,
including a shell and utilities.
It should be possible to run other x86 software
as long as it doesn't require more than a simple serial terminal.</p>

<p dir="auto">Download the NES ROM containing NES86 and ELKS from the <a href="https://github.com/decrazyo/nes86/releases">releases</a> page

NES86 uses a mapper configuration that is theoretically valid
but generally not supported by emulators nor flash cartridges.
The following platforms have been tested and Mesen2 is recommended.</p>

all require the ability to take an app
and poke at it to see how it works.</p><p>But it’s not uncommon for iOS apps
to include additional protections to keep
prying eyes away — like jailbreak detection
or <a href="https://bryce.co/youtube-code">code obfuscation</a>.</p><p>Though it looks like this app has a surprisingly fun combination of them.

with getting the debugger attached,
because that might help us with sorting
out the other protections later.</p><p>I’m running this app on a jailbroken phone,
which usually makes it pretty easy to attach a debugger to an app.
Normally, we can <code>ssh</code> into the phone
and then start <code>debugserver</code>
attached to a given app:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>$</span> <span>/</span><span>var</span><span>/</span><span>jb</span><span>/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>debugserver</span> <span>0.0.0.0</span><span>:</span><span>4445</span> <span>-</span><span>a</span> <span>AppStore</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And then attach to that <code>debugserver</code> from another computer using <code>lldb</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>$</span> <span>lldb</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>platform</span> <span>select</span> <span>remote</span><span>-</span><span>ios</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And now we can interact
with the app however we want; print debug information,

<source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>This failure to attach a debugger is thanks to a function called <code>ptrace</code>.
<code>ptrace</code> is a private API on iOS,
but it’s a public API on macOS, which means
we can easily access the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/ptrace.2.html">documentation</a> for it.</p><p><code>ptrace</code> is super cool — it is the thing that powers
most of the debugging functionality
that we know and love.
But there’s one operation that we’re particularly interested in here — <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code>. From the docs:</p><blockquote><p>PT_DENY_ATTACH</p><p>This request is the other operation used by the traced
process; it allows a process that is not currently being
traced to deny future traces by its parent. All other
arguments are ignored. If the process is currently being
traced, it will exit with the exit status of ENOTSUP;
otherwise, it sets a flag that denies future traces. An
attempt by the parent to trace a process which has set this
flag will result in a segmentation violation in the parent.</p></blockquote><p>Calling <code>ptrace</code> with the <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> request type
will prevent any future debugging requests,
and if the app has already been debugged,
it will exit out of the app entirely.
Very useful if you don’t want anyone poking around your app!</p><p>There are effectively two ways an iOS app can include this functionality,
and how we deal with circumventing it depends on which strategy the app
is using.</p><p>The simplest way for an app to integrate this is to just call the <code>ptrace</code>
function like you’d expect. The method call itself is fairly straightforward:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>PT_DENY_ATTACH</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We specify the type of <code>ptrace</code> request, <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code>, to indicate
that we want to prevent debuggers from attaching; there are then three
more required parameters, but per the docs, they’re all unused
for this request type, so we just set them to <code>0</code>.</p><p>However, because this is a private API, the full
setup to invoke it is a bit more annoying —
you have to look up a pointer to the method first,
define the function’s type information yourself, etc.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>#import &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you add this snippet to an iOS app,
and try to launch it, you’ll see the app flash alive for just
a second before being killed — but only if a debugger is being
attached! If you tell Xcode to not debug the
launched executable (via unchecking <code>Scheme &gt; Edit Scheme &gt; Run &gt; Info &gt; Debug executable</code>),
then the app launches fine!</p><h3 id="bypassing-pt_deny_attach-easy-mode">Bypassing <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> (Easy Mode)</h3><p>So that’s how <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> works - now how do we work around it?</p><p>Well there’s one easy weakness to this function,
which is that it only blocks the debugger
<em>after</em> it’s been called.</p><p>So if we put a breakpoint anywhere
before that call — say, at the start of the
<code>prevent_debugging</code> function above —
and then rerun, we’ll see that the debugger attaches just fine.</p><p>This gives us a lot of control to
actually circumvent that <code>ptrace</code> call later.
There’s a bunch of ways we could do that,
but probably the easiest is to just set
a breakpoint on <code>ptrace</code> itself:</p><p>Then when we continue execution,
we can see the debugger stop execution
when the <code>ptrace</code> function is invoked:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>bt</span>

function —
which means we can use <code>thread return</code> to back out
to where we were before the call
without actually invoking the function,
and then continue execution again.</p><p>And now we’ve successfully skipped the ptrace call —
the app is launched and our debugger is still attached!</p><p>We can try this strategy in the widget app
by launching <code>debugserver</code> again, but this time not
attaching it
to any currently running process:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>$</span> <span>/</span><span>var</span><span>/</span><span>jb</span><span>/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>debugserver</span> <span>0.0.0.0</span><span>:</span><span>4445</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Instead, we’ll specify the process we’re interested
in from the <code>lldb</code> side, this time using the <code>--waitfor</code>

this <code>ptrace</code> call, just like we saw

similar within your app, you’ll likely want to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html">extended asm</a>
instead. But this style makes for an easier walkthrough.</p></blockquote><p>If you’re not well-versed in assembly,
don’t worry — this one’s easier than it looks.</p><p>First we have the same four parameters
that we’re passing in our original <code>ptrace</code>
function call. There’s <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code>
(which is literally just the integer value
31), followed by three 0’s.
We’re passing all of those in registers
<code>x0</code> through <code>x3</code>.</p><p>Then we need to tell the kernel which
system call we actually want to make.
iOS expects
that to be passed along in register <code>x16</code>,
which we’re setting to the value <code>26</code>.
That’s the value corresponding
to <code>ptrace</code>, which we can actually see
in the disassembled version
of the real <code>ptrace</code> function above —
it sets register <code>x16</code> to <code>0x1a</code> (<code>26</code> in decimal).</p><p>And then we actually make the system
call itself.
The <code>0x80</code> here
is also unused —
We’re just required to pass a value,
and iOS uses that value <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56993314">by convention</a>.</p><p>That’s the entire assembly. If we re-run our sample app
with this function added, we’ll see the same behavior as before —
the app will kick us out as soon as a debugger is attached —
all without ever calling the private <code>ptrace</code> function.</p><p>This is a little harder for Apple to detect,
and a little harder for us to work around.
There’s now no common function like <code>ptrace</code>
that we could set a breakpoint on to detect and skip.
We instead have to figure out where in the binary
the system call happens, and then decide
from there how we want to bypass it.</p><p>To do that, we need to open a decrypted copy of the app in a disassembler
and then figure out a way to search for these instructions.</p><p>Luckily, if we look back at those instructions,
one of them sticks out as a good candiate to search for:</p><p>That’s a very specific value being set to a very specific register.
I wouldn’t expect this to appear in regular app code very frequently.
So looking for this instruction
might be a good way to narrow our search space down.</p><p>Most disassemblers should give you an option
to search through their raw disassembled output
text, but that can be super slow,
plus it can be tripped up by small
formatting differences,
like whether numbers are displayed
in hexadecimal or decimal.</p><p>It’s an option if we need it — but we may have a better option here,
which is to search for the exact bytes
corresponding to this instruction.</p><p>I like <a href="https://armconverter.com/">armconverter.com</a> for this. It lets you paste in
an assembly instruction, like</p><p>and get the corresponding
bytes out — in this case:</p><p>So we can search for those bytes in the binary to find potential places
where this <code>ptrace</code> system call is being made.
One consideration here is
that there is another way
that you could write this instruction,
which is to use <code>w16</code> instead of <code>x16</code>.
That’s the same underlying register —
<code>w16</code> is just a 32-bit view,
and <code>x16</code> is a 64-bit view.
Both would be valid ways to write this assembly, so we should search for
both in the binary.</p><p>Searching for the bytes corresponding to <code>mov x16, #26</code>, we find nothing — but searching
for the bytes for <code>mov w16, #26</code>, we get four results:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Address                  Function       Instruction

We’re just taking snapshots
in an infinite loop!</p><p>Sometimes a decompilation

The result is never referenced.
There are no other methods called.
We have no way to break out of the loop.</p><p>I need to emphasize how crazy this is.
Using too much memory can of course
get your app killed,
but it seems like somebody found a method
that, if you call it too quickly, will
soft-reboot the whole phone (in fact, I later found
that this is the strategy that at least <a href="https://github.com/haxi0/TrollLock-Reborn/blob/484616412a6b056f8fb241db14422ad471d9c1f9/TrollLock/TrollLock/ViewController.m#L115">one jailbreak tweak</a> uses
to respring the phone upon a user’s request) —
and then they chose
to take that information
and write a function
to call it in an infinite loop,
and just torpedo the phone of whoever’s
running this code, in a regular old app.</p><p>That’s delightful!</p><p>In this post’s <a href="https://youtu.be/ih6gWZDuNME">associated video</a>, we trace back
the origin of this call a bit further,
and learn that it’s run whenever a notification named <code>com.apple.tw.twrr</code> is fired,
and that it appears to be tied to the app running a risk check on the phone.
If we don’t pass the check, it resprings our phone.</p><p>The underlying setup is interesting, but we don’t need to dive too far into
it in order to bypass this protection — if we start <code>lldb</code> again,
bypass the anti-debugging call, but this time set an additional breakpoint
on the start of the function that intentionally crashes the phone —
we can just use <code>thread return</code> to skip its execution:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>br</span> <span>s</span> <span>-</span><span>a</span> <span>0x102A2BB68</span> <span>-</span><span>s</span> <span>TopWidget</span>

we try to inject new code into this app, it <em>also</em> crashes.</p><p>I’ll often do that when I have a debugger attached,
when I need some more complex utilities to help me dive into an app —
like wanting to quickly log the accessibility information of all buttons on screen,
for example.
You could do that just from <code>lldb</code>,
but it would be somewhat painful — it’s
easier to just write that in a framework,
inject that into the app, and then call your utility
function from the debugger.</p><p>But you might also want to inject code if you don’t
have a jailbroken phone in the first place — injecting
tools like <a href="https://frida.re/docs/ios/">Frida</a> or <a href="https://github.com/FLEXTool/FLEX">Flex</a>
let you get some initial exploration of an app without actually needing a jailbreak.
You would usually inject these using a tool that resigns the app
(I like <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Sideloadly</a>) — but if you do so here,
you’ll see an immediate crash launching the app.</p><p>So is this one more protection,
checking what frameworks are loaded at runtime
and crashing if anything unexpected appears?</p><p>Luckily, no. Some apps do that!</p><p>But we have a much simpler explanation
here. We can look at the crash — using either
<code>lldb</code> or, in the event we were doing this because
we didn’t have a jailbreak in the first place, by
pulling crash logs right from the device.</p><p>In our case, the crash shows the top of the stack trace
as <code>0x1002027D4</code>. Jumping there in our disassembler, we can see
a <code>BRK</code> instruction — which is exactly what we’d expect
in a scenario where the app was intentionally crashing,
like from force-unwrapping a nil value.</p><p>The decompilation of this method is a bit longer,
but scanning through, there’s one line that jumps out as our likely issue:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>v13</span> <span>=</span> <span>objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue</span><span>(</span><span>objc_msgSend</span><span>(</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:</code>
is a public, perfectly normal method
that returns a folder that multiple apps or extensions
in a single group can access together.
Usually apps are completely sandboxed
from each other, but putting them in a shared group means
that they can access shared resources.</p><p>The problem is that app groups are defined
as part of the code signing process, and
we just threw away the existing app signature
by injecting code and resigning the app —
and threw away any groups in the process.</p><p>So this method which is supposed to return a URL
pointing to the local file
system is probably returning <code>nil</code>,
and then the app is likely force-unwrapping that
and crashing as a result.</p><p>This is actually a pretty common problem —
and even though it’s acting like a defense
here, it’s probably not on purpose.
This is a widget app,
and it makes sense
that it would need to be in an app group
with its widget app extension that actually controls
displaying widgets on the home screen.</p><p>By far the easiest way to work around
this kind of issue is to just… not resign
the app. A jailbroken phone
makes this significantly easier —
you can inject frameworks into an app
using a jailbreak tweak
without ever having to resign it.
Or you can even run code
that has invalid signatures;
you can add whatever apps to
whatever groups you want.
Jailbreaking makes a lot of codesign
issues just go away.</p><p>In a pinch, though, if you were injecting
a debugging framework
because you don’t have
a jailbroken device,
you can still sometimes
work around things like this
even while resigning the app.</p><p>The app is crashing because it’s expecting
a URL to be returned here and it’s not getting one back.
We can create a small framework that swizzles this method
to make sure that a URL is always returned:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>@implementation</span> <span>NSFileManager</span> <span>(Swizzle)</span>

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>@end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we’re making it
so that anytime
<code>containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:</code>
method is called,
we’re going to invoke our replacement method instead,
which just returns
some temporary directory.</p><p>It’s worth noting
this is <strong>not</strong> an equivalent replacement
for what the app is actually trying to do —
this method is being called
because the app wants a shared
folder that both it and its app
extensions can access, and we’re lying to it and saying, “Here
you go. Here’s your shared folder” —
even though that is definitely not a shared folder.</p><p>But depending on what you’re trying to do,
that might actually be fine.
I’ve found
little patches like this will often break
the app extensions themselves,
But I usually don’t care about them —
I just want the main app to work fine,
especially if my goal
is to just poke around
at how the app does something,
and I just need
that basic functionality to work.</p><p>You can maybe do something more advanced
here like create your own app group,
resign the main app and all its extensions using it,
and swizzle this method (along with any others you run into)
to use your new group identifier instead. That would be a much larger
effort though, and not likely to be worth it unless you really need it —
at some point, finding a jailbroken device instead is probably worth your while.</p><p>Either way, if we build this framework,
and inject it into the app alongside whatever else
we wanted (like <code>Flex</code>), now the app launches perfectly fine
on a normal device! On a jailbroken device, we still need to attach a debugger
and bypass the earlier protections again,
but once we do, we’re back in the app, this time with <code>Flex</code> successfully
injected, giving us a whole bunch of other useful debugging tools:</p><p><img alt="The main screen of the Top Widgets app" src="https://bryce.co/undebuggable/Flex.png"></p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3><p>We’re in the app with a debugger attached, jailbreak detection bypassed, and code successfully injected!</p><p>… what were we here for again?</p><p>Oh, yeah - that’s for next time.</p><p>Until then, if you bypass any anti-debugging protections thanks to this article, or decide to add them
to your own app because you’re just learning about them for the first time — let me know!</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43081378">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I frequently see debates about whether it's better to be a cog at a giant semi-monopoly, or to take investment money in the hopes of one day growing to be head cog at a giant semi-monopoly.</p>
<p>Role models matter. So I made a list of small companies that I admire. Neither giants nor startups - just people making a living writing software on their own terms.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite"><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a></h2>
<p>Sqlite is an existence proof that you don't need a thousand engineers to have an impact. It's been around since the early 90s, is one of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most shipped</a> pieces of software in existence and is widely respected for its <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">exceptional testing methodology</a>. Yet it was written almost entirely by a few people:</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/sqlite$ git shortlog -s -n | head -n 5
</span><span> 14012	drh
</span><span>  4297	dan
</span><span>  1663	danielk1977
</span><span>  1099	mistachkin
</span><span>   175	shane
</span></code></pre>
<p>Their growth plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs, take-overs, and market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current size until at least the year 2050. We expect to be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sqlite is also interesting because although the code is open source they operate on a cathedral model, generally <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">refusing or rewriting</a> outside contributions.</p>
<h2 id="pinboard"><a href="https://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a></h2>
<p>Pinboard is a single-person operation that has been making a solid income year on year <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2019/07/i_cant_stop_winning/">since 2010</a>. It somehow still leaves Maciej enough free time to go around <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/5/">teaching politicians how to not get hacked</a> and <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm">explaining privacy to the senate</a>. All the while <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/">destroying his competition</a> using highly advanced tactics such as <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm">listening to his customers</a> and not operating at a loss.</p>
<p>But if Maciej had done nothing else he would still be on this list for his beautiful talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c">Barely Succeed! It's Easier!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a remarkable time when small teams (or even lone programmers) can successfully compete against internet giants. But while the last few years have seen an explosion of product ideas, there has been far less innovation in how to actually build a business. Silicon Valley is stuck in an outdated 'grow or die' mentality that overvalues risk, while investors dismiss sustainable, interesting projects for being too practical. So who needs investors anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll talk about some alternative definitions of success that are more achievable (and more fun!) than the Silicon Valley casino. It turns out that staying small offers some surprising advantages, not just in the day-to-day experience of work, but in marketing and getting customers to love your project. Best of all, there's plenty more room at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your goal is to do meaningful work you love, you may be much closer to realizing your dreams than you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tarsnap"><a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a></h2>
<p>Another single-person operation, tarsnap has been profitable <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/about.html">since 2009</a> and shows no sign of going anywhere, even lowering it's prices over the years as storage became cheaper. It's saved me on multiple occasions and it's so simple, reliable and cheap that I think of it almost like a utility - tarsnap having an outage would be more surprising to me than water not coming out of my taps.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about tarsnap is that it could <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/">easily be making more money</a>. If tarsnap had investors or shareholders, they would have <strong>already forced Colin to do so</strong>. In other words, the only reason that Colin gets to continue running the kind of business that he <strong>wants</strong> to run is that he owns it entirely and noone can force him to maximize profit instead.</p>
<h2 id="sublime"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a></h2>
<p>Version 1.0 came out in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/one-point-oh">2008</a> and they're still going strong today, making enough to <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge-2-announcement">hire an extra developer</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge">launch a separate product</a>.</p>
<p>Sublime is notable for surviving despite massive open-source competition in a field where people hate to pay for tools. As <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/">Tristan Hume points out</a>, it's really the only editor that has managed to remain both fast and consistent while still supporting a large plugin ecosystem. These kind of end-to-end qualities are perhaps one of the main advantages for small teams with a long time horizon.</p>
<h2 id="zig"><a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a></h2>
<p>Zig has been around <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/full-time-zig.html">only a few years</a> but I'm already wildly impressed by the quality of thought and engineering that has gone into it.</p>
<p>The Zig Software Foundation is a non-profit, currently funded entirely by donations and working towards being able to employ a second full-time developer. They explicitly chose to be a non-profit out of concern over how profit incentives creep into daily decision making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss, Paul Graham makes an analogy between animals in the zoo (employees) and animals in the wild (startup founders). I think he's on to something, but when you start a startup, you still have a boss. In fact, you have the same boss. At the end of the day, it is an inescapable fact that you must do what makes a profit, for the shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference in incentives makes a structural difference that permeates every part of an organization. Windows users wake up one day and find ads in their start menu. Will Debian Linux ever try to put ads into any of its software? The concept is absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zig was explicitly designed to be a <a href="https://ziglang.org/#Small-simple-language">small, simple language</a>, allowing it to be maintained indefinitely by a small, committed team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ZSF is a small organization and makes efficient use of monetary resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't see the need for ZSF to grow beyond a handful of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Maciej <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2144">puts it</a>, one of the advantages of being small is that you can speak with a human voice. This comes across clearly from the zig team, who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8f48iYKxgg">resolutely human</a> instead of projecting some impassive facade of professionalism.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Making AI ubiquitous requires addressing every culture and language. As AI proliferates globally, many of our customers worldwide have expressed a strong desire for models that are not just fluent but native to regional parlance. While larger, general-purpose models are often proficient in several languages, they lack linguistic nuances, cultural background, and in-depth regional knowledge required to serve use cases with strong regional context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In such scenarios, custom-trained models tailored to regional languages can grasp the unique intricacies and insights for delivering precision and authenticity. To that end, we are proud to introduce <strong>Mistral Saba</strong>, the first of our specialized regional language models.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mistral Saba is a 24B parameter model trained on meticulously curated datasets from across the Middle East and South Asia. The model provides more accurate and relevant responses than models that are over 5 times its size, while being significantly faster and lower cost. The model can also serve as a strong base to train highly specific regional adaptations. Mistral Saba is available as an <a href="http://console.mistral.ai/">API</a>, but importantly, it is also available to deploy locally within the security premises of customers.

We still have a very small (single-digit) number of boards available that we can provide to interested parties, but we kindly ask for your understanding that we must prioritize requests.
Please <a href="mailto:euchner@inue.uni-stuttgart.de">contact me</a> if you would like to receive an ESPARGOS board, or in case you have any questions or ideas to share about use cases, research ideas, open sourcing, manufacturing, or other topics.</p><p>We are still evaluating how to proceed, if we can (and should) make ESPARGOS available to a wider audience.
The hardware design and firmware files of ESPARGOS are currently not open source, but the <a href="https://github.com/ESPARGOS/pyespargos"><code>pyespargos</code></a> library including the demo applications are free software.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>


<p>Let’s say we’ve got some graph-like data, such as a social network.</p>

<p>We can represent this generically with two tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>

  <span>details</span> <span>jsonb</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>edges</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
  <span>type</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>

  <span>details</span> <span>jsonb</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we can insert some data (using lord of the rings characters) like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>details</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'Frodo Baggins'</span><span>,</span> <span>'{"species": "Hobbit"}'</span><span>),</span> <span>-- 1</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="simple-queries---finding-parents-and-children">Simple queries - finding parents and children</h2>

<p>We can find someone’s parents by joining the <code>edges</code> table to the <code>nodes</code> table.</p>

<p>Hardcoding the child id (3) to find Samwise’s parents:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>child</span>
<span>join</span> <span>edges</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>child</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>

<span>where</span> <span>child</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we didn’t know Samwise’s id, we could find him by name first using a CTE:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>child</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="more-complex-queries---friends-of-friends">More complex queries - friends of friends</h2>

<p>Not all of our characters knew each other directly. The friendship graph is a bit more complex:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>edges</span> <span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>from_id</span><span>,</span> <span>to_id</span><span>,</span> <span>details</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>We could follow two friendship links using CTEs like before. Let’s say friends of friends of Samwise:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>),</span>
<span>samwise_friends</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>samwise</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'friend'</span>
<span>),</span>
<span>friends_of_friends</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>samwise_friends</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>samwise_friends</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'friend'</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>select</span> <span>name</span> <span>from</span> <span>friends_of_friends</span> <span>join</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>on</span> <span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>friends_of_friends</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This returns almost everyone, except for Arathorn and Gloin who we’ve decided weren’t friends with anyone Samwise knew
(even though they probably knew Gandalf, in reality).</p>

<p>If we don’t mind building up arbitrarily long chains of CTEs, we can follow any number of edges using this technique.</p>

<p>It would be kind of nice to be able to pass in the root node and the edge paths as parameters though, rather than
dynamically building up the CTEs.</p>

<h2 id="parameterised-recursive-ctes">Parameterised recursive CTEs</h2>

<p>Let’s say we want to find the parents of the friends-of-friends of Samwise.</p>

<p>We could do this naively by building up a CTE for each level of friendship:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>),</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>But this quickly becomes unwieldy. Instead, let’s pull the variable bits out, and use a recursive CTE:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>recursive</span> 
<span>root</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>),</span>
<span>paths</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>'{friend,friend,parent}'</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>[])),</span>
<span>results</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>root</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>as</span> <span>path_index</span> <span>from</span> <span>root</span>
<span>union</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span><span>,</span> <span>path_index</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>as</span> <span>path_index</span> <span>from</span> <span>results</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>edges</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>paths</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>paths</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>[</span><span>path_index</span><span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>results</span>
<span>join</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>on</span> <span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>join</span> <span>paths</span> <span>on</span> <span>cardinality</span><span>(</span><span>paths</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>path_index</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This can then be parameterised, so we can create this as a prepared statement and call it lots of times with
different root nodes and paths.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>recursive</span> 
<span>root</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>?</span><span>),</span>
<span>paths</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>?</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>[])),</span>
<span>results</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>root</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>as</span> <span>path_index</span> <span>from</span> <span>root</span>
<span>union</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span><span>,</span> <span>path_index</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>as</span> <span>path_index</span> <span>from</span> <span>results</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>edges</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>paths</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>paths</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>[</span><span>path_index</span><span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>results</span>
<span>join</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>on</span> <span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>join</span> <span>paths</span> <span>on</span> <span>cardinality</span><span>(</span><span>paths</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>path_index</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we wanted every node along the path, instead of just the end node, we could remove the join to <code>paths</code> in the final
line.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is one way of representing graph-like data in Postgresql, and querying it in a flexible way.</p>

<p>I’d be very interested in hearing about other techniques or improvements.</p>
