<p>Over the last year or so, I have found myself on a journey to deeply understand how to run Rails applications backed by SQLite performantly and resiliently. In that time, <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/11/sqlite-on-rails-isolated-connection-pools/">I</a> <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/12/11/sqlite-on-rails-improving-concurrency/">have</a> <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/01/02/sqlite-quick-tip-multiple-databases/">learned</a> <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/10/enhancing-rails-sqlite-optimizing-compilation/">various</a> <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/07/enhancing-rails-sqlite-fine-tuning/">lessons</a> that I want to share with you all now. I want to walk through where the problems lie, why they exist, and how to resolve them.</p>

<p>And to start, we have to start with the reality that…</p>

<p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/022.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, running SQLite on Rails out-of-the-box isn’t viable today. But, with a bit of tweaking and fine-tuning, you can ship a very performant, resilient Rails application with SQLite. And my personal goal for <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/milestone/87">Rails 8</a> is to make the out-of-the-box experience fully production-ready.</p>

<p>And so, I have spent the last year digging into the details to uncover what the issues are with SQLite on Rails applications as they exist today and how to resolve those issues. So, let me show you everything you need to build a production-ready SQLite-driven Rails application today…</p>

<p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/023.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… Yeah, not too bad, huh? These three commands will set your app up for production success. You will get massive performance improvements, additional SQL features, and point-in-time backups. This is how you build a production-ready SQLite on Rails application today.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/024.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… And that’s all you need. Thank you. And I could genuinely stop the talk here. You know how and why to run SQLite in production with Rails. Those two gems truly are the headline, and if you take-away only 1 thing from this talk, let it be that slide.</p>

<p>But, given that this is a space for diving deep into complex topics, I want to walk through the exact problems and solutions that these gems package up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/025.png" alt=""></p>

<p>To keep this journey practical and concrete, we will be working on <a href="http://github.com/fractaledmind/wrocloverb-2024">a demo app</a> called “Lorem News”. It is a basic Hacker News clone with posts and comments made by users but all of the content is Lorem Ipsum. This codebase will be the foundation for all of our examples and benchmarks.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/026.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s observe how our demo application performs. We can use the <a href="https://github.com/hatoo/oha"><code>oha</code> load testing CLI</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/wrocloverb-2024/blob/main/app/controllers/benchmarking_controller.rb">benchmarking routes</a> built into the app to simulate user activity in our app. Let’s start with a simple test where we sent 1 request after another for 5 seconds to our <code>post#create</code> endpoint.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/027.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Not bad. We see solid RPS and every request is successful. The slowest request is many times slower than the average, which isn’t great, but even that request isn’t above 1 second. I’ve certainly seen worse. Maybe I was wrong to say that the out-of-the-box experience with Rails and SQLite isn’t production-ready as of today.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/028.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s try the same load test but send 4 concurrent requests in waves for 5 seconds.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/029.png" alt=""></p>

<p>All of a sudden things aren’t looking as good any more. We see a percentage of our requests are returning 500 error code responses.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/030.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we look at our logs, we will see the first major problem that SQLite on Rails applications need to tackle …</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/031.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html#busy"><code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> exception</a>.</p>

<p>In order to ensure only one write operation occurs at a time, SQLite uses a write lock on the database. Only one connection can hold the write lock at a time. If you have multiple connections open to the database, this is the exception that is thrown when one connection attempts to acquire the write lock but another connection still holds it. Without any configuration, a web app with a connection pool to a SQLite database will have numerous errors in trying to respond to requests.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/032.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As your Rails application is put under more and more concurrent load, you will see a steady increase in the percentage of requests that error with the <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> exception. What we need is a way to allow write queries to queue up and resolve linearly without immediately throwing an exception.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/033.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html#immediate">immediate transactions</a>. Because of the global write lock, SQLite needs different transaction modes for different possible behaviors.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/034.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s consider this transaction.</p>

<p>By default, SQLite uses a deferred transaction mode. This means that SQLite will not acquire the lock until a write operation is made inside the transaction. For this transaction, this means that the write lock won’t attempt to be acquired until …</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/035.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… this line here, the third operation within the transaction.</p>

<p>In a context where you only have one connection or you have a large amount of transactions that only do read operations, this is great for performance, because it means that SQLite doesn’t have to acquire a lock on the database for every transaction, only for transactions that actually write to the database. The problem is that this is not the context Rails apps are in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/036.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In a production Rails application, not only will you have multiple connections to the database from multiple threads, Rails will only wrap database queries that write to the database in a transaction. And, when we write our own explicit transactions, it is essentially a guarantee that we will include a write operation. So, in a production Rails application, SQLite will be working with multiple connections and every transaction will include a write operation. This is the opposite of the context that SQLite’s default deferred transaction mode is optimized for.</p>

<p>Our <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> exceptions are arising from the fact that when SQLite attempts to acquire the write lock in the middle of a transaction and there is another connection holding the lock, SQLite cannot safely retry that transaction-bound query. Retrying in the middle of a transaction could break the serializable isolation that SQLite guarantees. Thus, when SQLite hits a busy exception when trying to upgrade a transaction, it can’t queue that query to retry acquiring the write lock later; it immediately throws the error and halts that transaction.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/037.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we instead begin the transaction by explicitly declaring this an immediate transaction, SQLite will be able to queue this query to retry acquiring the write lock again later. This gives SQLite the ability to serialize the concurrent queries coming in by relying on a basic queuing system, even when some of those queries are wrapped in transactions.</p>

<p>So, how do we ensure that our Rails application makes all transactions immediate? …</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/038.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… As of <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/releases/tag/v1.6.9">version 1.6.9</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby"><code>sqlite3-ruby</code> gem</a> allows you to configure the default transaction mode. Since Rails passes any top-level keys in your <code>database.yml</code> configuration directly to the <code>sqlite3-ruby</code> database initializer, you can easily ensure that Rails’ SQLite transactions are all run in IMMEDIATE mode.</p>

<p>Let’s make this change in our demo app and re-run our simple load test.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/039.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With one simple configuration change, our Rails app now handle concurrent load without throwing nearly any 500 errors! Though we do see some errors start to creep in at 16 concurrent requests. This is a signal that something is still amiss.</p>

<p>If we look now at the latency results from our load tests, we will see that this new problem quickly jumps out.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/040.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As the number of concurrent requests approaches and then surpasses the number of Puma workers our application has, our p99 latency skyrockets. But, interestingly, the actual request time stays stable, even under 3 times the concurrent load of our Puma workers. We will also see that once we start getting some requests taking approximately 5 seconds, we also start getting some 500 <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> responses as well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/041.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If that 5 seconds is ringing a bell, it is because that is precisely what our timeout is set to. It seems that as our application is put under more concurrent load than the number of Puma workers it has, more and more database queries are timing out. This is our next problem to solve.</p>

<p>This timeout option in our <code>database.yml</code> configuration file will be mapped to one of SQLite’s configuration pragmas…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/042.png" alt=""></p>

<p>SQLite’s <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout"><code>busy_timeout</code> configuration option</a>. Instead of throwing the <code>BUSY</code> exception immediately, you can tell SQLite to wait up to the timeout number of milliseconds. SQLite will attempt to re-acquire the write lock using a kind of exponential backoff, and if it cannot acquire the write lock within the timeout window, then and only then will the <code>BUSY</code> exception be thrown. This allows a web application to use a connection pool, with multiple connections open to the database, but not need to resolve the order of write operations itself. You can simply push queries to SQLite and allow SQLite to determine the linear order that write operations will occur in. The process will look something like this:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/043.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Imagine our application sends 4 write queries to the database at the same moment.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/044.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One of those four will acquire the write lock first and run. The other three will be queued, running the backoff re-acquire logic. Once the first write query completes, …</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/045.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… one of the queued queries will attempt to re-acquire the lock and successfully acquire the lock and start running. The other two queries will continue to stay queued and keep running the backoff re-acquire logic. Again, when the second write query completes, …</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/046.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… another query will have its backoff re-acquire logic succeed and will start running. Our last query is still queued and still running its backoff re-acquire logic.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/047.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Once the third query completes, our final query can acquire the write lock and run. So long as no query is forced to wait for longer than the timeout duration, SQLite will resolve the linear order of write operations on its own. This queuing mechanism is essential to avoiding <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> exceptions. But, there is a major performance bottleneck lurking in the details of this feature for Rails applications.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/048.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Because SQLite is embedded within your Ruby process and the thread that spawns it, care must be taken to release Ruby’s global VM lock (GVL) when the Ruby-to-SQLite bindings execute SQLite’s C code. <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/issues/287#issuecomment-615346313">By design</a>, the <code>sqlite3-ruby</code> gem does not release the GVL when calling SQLite. For the most part, this is a reasonable decision, but for the <code>busy_timeout</code>, it greatly hampers throughput.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/049.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Instead of allowing another Puma worker to acquire Ruby’s GVL while one Puma worker is waiting for the database query to return, that first Puma worker will continue to hold the GVL even while the Ruby operations are completely idle waiting for the database query to resolve and run. This means that concurrent Puma workers won’t even be able to send concurrent write queries to the SQLite database and SQLite’s linear writes will force our Rails app to process web requests somewhat linearly as well. This radically slows down the throughput of our Rails app.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/050.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What we want is to allow our Puma workers to be able to process requests concurrently, passing the GVL amongst themselves as they wait on I/O. So, for Rails app using SQLite, this means that we need to unlock the GVL whenever a write query gets queued and is waiting to acquire the SQLite write lock.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/051.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Luckily, in addition to the <code>busy_timeout</code>, SQLite also provides the lower-level <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_handler.html"><code>busy_handler</code> hook</a>. The <code>busy_timeout</code> is nothing more than a specific <code>busy_handler</code> implementation provided by SQLite. Any application using SQLite can provide its own custom <code>busy_handler</code>. The <code>sqlite3-ruby</code> gem is a SQLite driver, meaning that it provides Ruby bindings for the C API that SQLite exposes. Since it provides <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/blob/055da734dafdbb01bb8cf59dbcdb475ea822683f/ext/sqlite3/database.c#L209-L220">a binding for the <code>sqlite3_busy_handler</code> C function</a>, we can write a Ruby callback that will be called whenever a query is queued.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/052.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here is a Ruby implementation of the logic you will find in SQLite’s C source for its <code>busy_timeout</code>. Every time this callback is called, it is passed the count of the number of times this query has called this callback. That count is used to determine how long this query should wait to try again to acquire the write lock and how long it has already waited. By using <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-sleep">Ruby’s <code>sleep</code></a>, we can ensure that the GVL is released while a query is waiting to retry acquiring the lock.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/053.png" alt=""></p>

<p>By ensuring that the GVL is released while queries wait to retry acquiring the lock, we have massively improved our p99 latency even when under concurrent load.</p>

<p>But, there are still some outliers. If we look instead at the p99.99 latency, we will find another steadily increasing graph.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/054.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Our slowest queries get steadily slower the more concurrent load our application is under. This is another growth curve that we would like to flatten. But, in order to flatten it, we must understand why it is occurring.</p>

<p>The issue is that our Ruby re-implementation of SQLite’s <code>busy_timeout</code> logic penalizes “older queries”. This is going to kill our long-tail performance, as responses will get naturally segmented into the batch that had “young” queries and those that had “old” queries, because SQLite will naturally segment queries into such batches. To explain more clearly what I mean, let’s step through our Ruby <code>busy_timeout</code> logic a couple times.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/055.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The first time a query is queued and calls this timeout callback, the count is zero.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/056.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And since 0 is less than 12, we enter the <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/057.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We get the zero-th element in the delays array as our delay, which is 1.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/058.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We then take the first 0 elements of the delays array, which is an empty array, and sum those numbers together, which in this case sums to 0. This is how long the query has been delayed for already,</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/059.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With our timeout as 5000, 0 + 1 is not greater than 5000, so we fall through to the <code>else</code> block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/060.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And we sleep for 1 millisecond before this callback is called again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/061.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The tenth time this query calls this timeout callback, the count is, well, 10.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/062.png" alt=""></p>

<p>10 is still less than 12, so we enter the <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/063.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We get the tenth element in the delays array as our delay, which is 50.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/064.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We then take the first 10 elements of the delays array, that is the everything in the array up to but not including the tenth element, and sum those numbers together, which in this case sums to 178. This is how long the query has been delayed for already.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/065.png" alt=""></p>

<p>50 + 178 is still not greater than 5000, so we fall through to the <code>else</code> block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/066.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And now we sleep for 50 milliseconds before this callback is called again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/067.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s consider the 58th time this query calls this timeout callback.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/068.png" alt=""></p>

<p>58 is greater than 12, so we fall through to the <code>else</code> block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/069.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Once we are past the 12th call to this callback, we will always delay 100 milliseconds.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/070.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In order to calculate how long this query has already been delayed, we get the sum of the entire delays array and add the 100 milliseconds times however many times beyond 12 the query has retried. In this case, the sum of the entire delays array is 328, 58 minus 12 is 46 and 46 times 100 is 4600. So 4600 plus 328 is 4928. Up to this point, our query has been delayed for 4928 milliseconds.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/071.png" alt=""></p>

<p>100 + 4928 is 5028, which is indeed greater than 5000, so we enter the <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/072.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And finally we raise the exception.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/073.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I know that stepping through this code might be a bit tedious, but we all need to be on the same page understanding how SQLite’s <code>busy_timeout</code> mechanism handles queued queries. When I say it penalizes old queries, I mean that it makes them much more likely to become timed out queries under consistent load. To understand why, let’s go back to our queued queries…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/074.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s track how many retries each query makes from our simple example above.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/075.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Our three remaining queries have retried once…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/076.png" alt=""></p>

<p>… and now the remaining two queries are, at best, on their second retry.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/077.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And our third query is, again at best, on its third retry. On the third retry, the delay is already 10 milliseconds. Let’s imagine that at this moment a new write query is sent to the database.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/078.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This new query immediately attempts to acquire the write lock, is denied and makes its zeroth call to the <code>busy_timeout</code> callback. It will be told to wait 1 millisecond. Our original query is waiting for 10 milliseconds, so this new query will get to retry again before our older query.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/079.png" alt=""></p>

<p>While the write lock is still held, our new query is only asked to wait 2 milliseconds next.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/080.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Even when the count is 2, it is only asked to wait 5 milliseconds. This new query will be allowed to retry to acquire the write lock <strong>three times</strong> before the original query is allowed to retry <em>once</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/081.png" alt=""></p>

<p>These increasing backoffs greatly penalize older queries, such that any query that has to wait even just 3 retries is now much more likely to never acquire the write lock if there is a steady stream of write queries coming in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/082.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, what if instead of incrementally backing off our retries, we simply had every query retry at the same frequency, regardless of age? Doing so would also mean that we could do away with our <code>delays</code> array and re-think our <code>busy_handler</code> function altogether.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/083.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And that is precisely <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/pull/456">what we have done</a> in the <code>main</code> branch of the <code>sqlite3-ruby</code> gem. Unfortunately, as of today, this feature is not in a tagged release of the gem, but it should be released relatively soon. This Ruby callback releases the GVL while waiting for a connection using the <code>sleep</code> operation and always sleeps 1 millisecond. These 10 lines of code make a massive difference in the performance of your SQLite on Rails application.</p>

<p>Let’s re-run our benchmarking scripts and see how our p99.99 latency looks now…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/084.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Voila! We have flattened out the curve. There is still a jump with currency more than half the number of Puma workers we have, but after that jump our long-tail latency flatlines at around half a second.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/085.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, when it comes to performance, there are 4 keys that you need to ensure are true of your next SQLite on Rails application…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/086.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We have covered the first three, but not the last. The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead-log</a> allows SQLite to support multiple concurrent readers. The default <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html">rollback journal mode</a> only allows for one query at a time, regardless of whether it is a read or a write. WAL mode allows for concurrent readers but only one writer at a time.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/087.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49349">starting with Rails 7.1</a>, Rails applies a better default configuration for your SQLite database. These changes are central to making SQLite work well in the context of a web application. If you’d like to learn more about what each of these configuration options are, why we use the values we do, and how this specific collection of configuration details improve things, I have <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/07/enhancing-rails-sqlite-fine-tuning/">a blog post</a> that digs into these details.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/088.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, while this isn’t a requirement, there is a fifth lever we can pull to improve the performance of our application. Since we know that SQLite in WAL mode supports multiple concurrent reading connections but only one writing connection at a time, we can recognize that it is possible for the Active Record connection pool to be saturated with writing connections and thus block concurrent reading operations.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/089.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If your connection pool only has 3 connections, and you receive 5 concurrent queries, what happens if the 3 connections get picked up by three write queries?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/090.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The remaining read queries have to wait until one of the write queries releases a connection. Ideally, since we are using SQLite in WAL mode, read queries should never need to wait on write queries. In order to ensure this, we will need to create two distinct connection pools—one for reading operation and one for writing operations.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/091.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can leverage <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html">Rails’ support for multiple databases</a> to achieve this result. Instead of pointing the reader and writer database configurations to separate databases, we point them at the same single database, and thus simply create two distinct and isolated connection pools with distinct connection configurations.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/092.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The reader connection pool will only consist of readonly connections…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/093.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And the writer connection pool will only have one connection.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/094.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can then configure our Active Records models to connect to the appropriate connection pool depending on the role.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/095.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What we want, conceptually, is for our requests to behave essentially like SQLite deferred transactions. Every request should default to using the reader connection pool, but whenever we need to write to the database, we switch to using the writer pool for just that operation. To set that up, we will use Rails’ <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html#activating-automatic-role-switching">automatic role switching feature</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/096.png" alt=""></p>

<p>By putting this code in an initializer, we will force Rails to set the default database connection for all web requests to be the reading connection pool. We also tweak the delay configuration since we aren’t actually using separate databases, only separate connections, we don’t need to ensure that requests “read your own writes” with a <code>delay</code>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/097.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can then patch the <code>transaction</code> method of the ActiveRecord adapter to force it to connection to the writing database.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/098.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Taken together, these changes enable our “deferred requests” utilizing isolated connection pools. And when testing against the comment create endpoint, we do see a performance improvement when looking at simple requests per second.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/099.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, these are the 5 levels of performance improvement that you should make to your SQLite on Rails application.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/100.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But, you don’t need to walk through all of these enhancements in your Rails app. As I said at the beginning, you can simply install <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/activerecord-enhancedsqlite3-adapter">the enhanced adapter gem</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/101.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And if you want to use the isolated connection pools, you can simply add this configuration to your application. This is a newer experimental feature, which is why you have to opt into it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/110.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And, after all that, we are now done with how to make your SQLite on Rails application performant.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/115.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the end, I hope that this exploration of the tools, techniques, and defaults for SQLite on Rails applications has shown you how powerful, performant, and flexible this approach is. Rails is legitimately the best web application framework for working with SQLite today. The community’s growing ecosystem of tools and gems is unparalleled. And today is absolutely the right time to start a SQLite on Rails application and explore these things for yourself.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/wrocloverb-2024/116.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I hope that you now feel confident in the hows (and whys) of optimal performance when running SQLite in production with Rails.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

				<p>Recent technological developments related to the extraction and processing of data have given rise to concerns about a reduction of privacy in the workplace. For many low-income and subordinated racial minority workforces in the United States, however, on-the-job data collection and algorithmic decisionmaking systems are having a more profound yet overlooked impact: These technologies are fundamentally altering the experience of labor and undermining economic stability and job mobility. Drawing on a multi-year, first-of-its-kind ethnographic study of organizing on-demand workers, this Article examines the historical rupture in wage calculation, coordination, and distribution arising from the logic of informational capitalism: the use of granular data to produce unpredictable, variable, and personalized hourly pay.</p>
<p>The Article constructs a novel framework rooted in worker on-the- job experiences to understand the ascent of digitalized variable pay practices, or the importation of price discrimination from the consumer context to the labor context—what this Article identifies as algorithmic wage discrimination. Across firms, the opaque practices that constitute algorithmic wage discrimination raise fundamental questions about the changing nature of work and its regulation. What makes payment for labor in platform work fair? How does algorithmic wage discrimination affect the experience of work? And how should the law intervene in this moment of rupture? Algorithmic wage discrimination runs afoul of both longstanding precedent on fairness in wage setting and the spirit of equal pay for equal work laws. For workers, these practices produce unsettling moral expectations about work and remuneration. The Article proposes a nonwaivable restriction on these practices.</p>

				<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Over the past two decades, technological developments have ushered in extreme levels of workplace monitoring and surveillance across many sectors.

 These automated systems record and quantify workers’ movement or activities, their personal habits and attributes, and even sensitive biometric information about their stress and health levels.

Med. &amp; Ethics 474, 474–75, 477–78 (2016) (describing the comprehensive data collection practices and capacities of worker wellness programs).	</span>
	
</cite>
 Employers then feed amassed datasets on workers’ lives into machine learning systems to make hiring determinations, to influence behavior, to increase worker productivity, to intuit potential workplace problems (including worker organizing), and, as this Article highlights, to determine worker pay.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>3</span>
		See, e.g., Annette Bernhardt, Linda Kresge &amp; Reem Suleiman, Berkeley Lab. Ctr., Data and Algorithms at Work: The Case for Workers’ Technology Rights 6, 15–17 (2021), https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-and-Algorithms-at-Work.pdf [https://perma.cc/TC3U-458E]. As employment law scholar Matthew Bodie has written in reference the role of data extraction at work under systems of informational capitalism:<br>
Workers find themselves on the wrong end of this data revolution. They are the producers of data, but the data flows seamlessly from their work and personal experience to corporate repositories. Employers can capture the data, aggregate it into meaningful pools, analyze it, and use it to further productivity. Individual employees cannot tap into that value, nor can independent contractors. They are trapped: the more data they provide, the more powerful their employers become.<br>
Bodie, supra note 1, at 736.	</span>
	
</cite>
</p>
<p>To date, policy concerns about growing technological surveillance in the workplace have largely mirrored the apprehensions articulated by consumer advocates. Scholars and advocates have raised concerns about the growing limitations on worker privacy and autonomy, the potential for society-level discrimination to seep into machine learning systems, and a general lack of transparency on workplace rules.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>4</span>
		See generally Bernhardt et al., supra note 3 (arguing that data-driven technologies harm workers through discrimination and work intensification at the expense of safety, depriving workers of their autonomy and dignity); Ajunwa et al., Limitless Worker Surveillance, supra note 1 (“[T]here has been a shift in focus from collecting personally identifying information, such as health records, to wholly acquiring unprotected and largely unregulated proxies and metadata, such as wellness information, search queries, social media activity, and outputs of predictive ‘big data’ analytics.”); Bodie, supra note 1 (“As the data collected in this new environment has become increasingly individualized, the line between person as individual and person as employee has become significantly blurred.”); Rogers, supra note 1 (“[L]abor and employment laws . . . and the broader political economy of work that they help sustain, also encourage employers to use new technologies to exert power over workers.”). Labor law scholars Antonio Aloisi and Valerio De Stefano have argued convincingly in a comprehensive review of technology, law, and work that concerns about the supposed “disappearance of work” lost to algorithmic intelligence are less urgent than the myriad challenges raised by the incipient practices of algorithmic management at work. These nascent practices, they argue, have intensified any number of problems including the devaluation of work, the maldistribution of risks and privileges, the health and safety of workers, the assault on dignity, and of course, the destruction of individual and collective worker privacy. Antonio Aloisi &amp; Valerio De Stefano, Your Boss Is an Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence, Platform Work and Labour 9, 23–24, 98–101, 104–05 (2022).	</span>

 For example, in October 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released a non-legally-binding handbook identifying five principles that “should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American public in the age of artificial intelligence.”
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>5</span>
		White House Off. of Sci. &amp; Tech. Pol’y, Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights 3 (2022), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf [https://perma.cc/A62C-TV47].	</span>
	
</cite>
 These principles called for automated systems that (1) were safe and effective, (2) protect individuals from discrimination, (3) offer users control over how their data is used, (4) provide notice and explanation that an automated system is being used, and (5) allow users access to a person who can remedy any problems they encounter.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>6</span>
		Id. at 5–7.	</span>
	
</cite>
 The<em> Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</em> (hereinafter <em>Blueprint</em>) specified that these enumerated rights extended to “[e]mployment-related systems [such as] . . . workplace algorithms that inform all aspects of the terms and conditions of employment including, but not limited to, <em>pay</em> or <em>promotion</em>, hiring or termination algorithms, virtual or augmented reality workplace training programs, and electronic workplace surveillance and management systems.”
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>7</span>
		Id. at 53 (emphasis added).	</span>
	
</cite>
</p>
<p>Under each principle, the <em>Blueprint</em> provides “illustrative examples” of the kinds of harms that the principle is meant to address. One such example, used to specify what defines unsafe and ineffective automation in the workplace, involves an unnamed company that has installed AI-powered cameras in their delivery vans to monitor workers’ driving habits, ostensibly for “safety reasons.” The <em>Blueprint</em> states that the system “<em>incorrectly</em> penalized drivers when other cars cut them off . . . . As a result, drivers were <em>incorrectly</em> ineligible to receive a bonus.”
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>8</span>
		Id. at 17 (emphasis added) (citing Lauren Kaori Gurley, Amazon’s AI Cameras Are Punishing Drivers for Mistakes They Didn’t Make, Vice (Sept. 20, 2021), https://www.vice.com/en/article/88npjv/amazons-ai-cameras-are-punishing-drivers-for-mistakes-they-didnt-make [https://perma.cc/HSF4-EG4M]).	</span>
	
</cite>
 Thus, the specific harm identified is a mistaken calculation by an automated variable pay system developed by the company.</p>
<p>What the <em>Blueprint</em> does not specify, however, is that the company in question—Amazon—does not directly employ the delivery workers. Rather, the company contracts with Delivery Service Providers (DSPs), small businesses that Amazon helps to establish. In this putative nonemployment arrangement, Amazon does not provide to the DSP drivers workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance, health insur-ance, or the protected right to organize. Nor does it guarantee individual DSPs or their workers minimum wage or overtime compensation.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>9</span>
		As economist Brian Callaci explains, since the DSPs legally employ the delivery drivers, the DSPs, rather than Amazon, bear “liability for accidents or workplace safety,” and DSP drivers, classified as Amazon’s contractors, “do not fall under Amazon’s $15 an hour minimum wage.” Brian Callaci, Entrepreneurship, Amazon Style, Am. Prospect (Sept. 27, 2021), https://prospect.org/api/content/1923a910-1d7c-11ec-8dbf-1244d5f7c7c6/ [https://perma.cc/‌AV2H-59YA]. Meanwhile, Amazon’s contracts with DSPs “[restrict] the wages the DSP can offer” drivers and mandate that drivers remain nonunion by stipulating that “they serve as at-will employees.” Id. If the drivers unionize, “Amazon can terminate the contract and find a new DSP, which is much easier than fighting a union campaign itself.” Id.	</span>
	
</cite>
 Instead, DSPs receive a variable hourly rate based on fluctuations in demand and routes, along with “bonuses” based on a quantified digital evaluation of on-the-job behavior, including “service, safety, [and] client experience.”
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>10</span>
		How Are Amazon DSPs Paid?, Route Consultant, https://www.routeconsultant.com/industry-insights/how-are-amazon-dsps-paid [https://perma.cc/684P-WLKB] (last visited Aug. 14, 2023). The scorecards that determine “bonuses” are calculated in constantly changing ways. The DSP scorecards I reviewed include four categories: safety and compliance, reliability, quality, and team. The “scores” for these categories—and for each driver employed by the DSP—are determined algorithmically. See also Peak Delivery Driver, Amazon DSP Scorecard Deep Dive, YouTube, at 1:04–1:58, 2:48–3:10 (Sept. 10, 2021), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mBOYfBZs9I (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>). The example in the <em>Blueprint</em>, for instance, lowered the score enough to undermine the DSP’s ability to get a bonus. White House Off. of Sci. &amp; Tech. Pol’y, supra note 5, at 17. By contrast, Amazon is guaranteed the data it wants from the DSPs (they cannot reject the use of cameras, for example)—not just while the DSP is servicing Amazon but also for three years afterward. In addition to using such data to calculate bonuses, Amazon can also use it to terminate contracts, terminate specific “underperforming” workers, and punish DSPs with fees. Josh Eidelson &amp; Matt Day, Drivers Don’t Work for Amazon but Company Has Lots of Rules for Them, Det. News (May 5, 2021), https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/05/05/drivers-dont-work-amazon-but-company-has-lots-rules-them/4955413001/ [https://perma.cc/7REA-NKRU].	</span>
	
</cite>
 DSPs, while completely reliant on Amazon for business, must hire a team of drivers as employees.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>11</span>
		When a DSP hires other drivers, it may appear more like a company that is legally separate from Amazon. This may protect Amazon from unionization efforts and downstream liability that it may otherwise incur based on allegations that the DSPs are its employees, not contractors. Callaci, supra note 9. It appears FedEx was the first delivery company to use this tactic after redrafting its contracts with drivers in response to Alexander v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., 765 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2014), the Ninth Circuit decision that held that its drivers were employees, not independent contractors. Rather than changing the drivers’ status in response to the decision, FedEx drafted its contracts to make the drivers appear more like independent contractors. V.B. Dubal, Winning the Battle, Losing the War?: Assessing the Impact of Misclassification Litigation on Workers in the Gig Economy, 2017 Wis. L. Rev. 739, 791–92. This included mandating that the drivers purchase more service areas, which in turn made drivers hire others to complete the deliveries. Id.	</span>

 These Amazon-created and -controlled small businesses rely heavily on their automated “bonuses” to pay for support, repairs, and driver wages.

</cite>
 As one DSP owner–worker complained to an investigator, “Amazon uses these [AI surveillance] cameras allegedly to make sure they have a safer driving workforce, but they’re actually using them not to pay [us] . . . . They just take our money and expect that to motivate us to figure it out.”

<p>Presented with this additional information, we should ask again: What exactly is the harm of this automated system? Is it, as the <em>Blueprint</em> states, the algorithm’s <em>mistake</em>, which prevented the worker from getting his bonus? Or is it the structure of Amazon’s payment system, rooted in evasion of employment law, data extraction from labor, and digitalized control?</p>
<p>Amazon’s automated control structure and payment mechanisms represent an emergent and undertheorized firm technique arising from the logic of informational capitalism: the use of <em>algorithmic wage discrimination</em> to maximize profits and to exert control over worker behavior.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>14</span>
		“Informational capitalism” or “information capitalism” as a descriptor of the contemporary digital-age world system is generally attributed to sociologist Manuel Castells. Castells first introduced the term in his three-volume study, <em>The Information Age</em>, published between 1996 and 1998. In describing a shift from industrial capitalism to information capitalism, Castells wrote in Volume I, “A technological revolution, centered around information technologies, is reshaping, at accelerated pace, the material basis of society. Economies throughout the world have become globally interdependent, introducing a new form of relationship between economy, state, and society, in a system of variable geometry.” Manuel Castells, The Rise of Network Society 1 (2d ed. 2000). In legal scholarship, Julie Cohen uses the term “informational capitalism” to explore the relationships between political, legal, and economic institutions amidst the propertized expansion of data and information exchange. See generally Julie Cohen, Between Truth and Power: The Legal Constructions of Informational Capitalism (2019).	</span>
	
</cite>
 “Algorithmic wage discrimination” refers to a practice in which individual workers are paid different hourly wages—calculated with ever-changing formulas using granular data on location, individual behavior, demand, supply, or other factors—for broadly similar work. As a wage-pricing technique, algorithmic wage discrimination encompasses not only digitalized payment for completed work but, critically, digitalized decisions to allocate work, which are significant determinants of hourly wages and levers of firm control. These methods of wage discrimination have been made possible through dramatic changes in cloud computing and machine learning technologies in the last decade.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>15</span>
		Zephyr Teachout has created a useful taxonomy of five different forms of “personalized wages” that have recently emerged in the labor market: (1) extreme Taylorism, in which “[h]igh degrees of surveillance [result in] . . . rewarding productivity”; (2) gamification, in which employers use psychological tools to incentivize task completion; (3) behavioral price discrimination, in which workers get paid more if they make certain lifestyle choices, like exercising, which can be tracked through fitness apps; (4) dynamic labor pricing, which, she argues, is based primarily on demand; and (5) experimentation, in which firms test “assumptions about what will lead to the firm gathering the highest output for the wages it pays.” Zephyr Teachout, Algorithmic Personalized Wages, 51 Pol. &amp; Soc’y 436, 437, 442–44 (2023) [hereinafter Teachout, Algorithmic Personalized Wages].<br>
In all these instances, wages are rooted in data extracted from labor. My data indicate the potential to further simplify this taxonomy to two main ways of thinking about algorithmic wage discrimination: (1) wages based on productivity analysis alone (most evident in the employment context), and (2) wages based on productivity, supply, demand, and other personalized data used to minimize labor costs. This second form of algorithmic wage discrimination appears most commonly in on-demand work that treats workers like independent contractors.	</span>

<p>Though firms have relied upon performance-based variable pay for some time (e.g., the use of bonuses and commission systems to influence worker behavior),
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>16</span>
		Nonalgorithmic variable payment systems with transparent payment structures are more familiar to many people. See, e.g., United Farm Workers (@UFWupdates), Twitter (Oct. 15, 2022), https://twitter.com/UFWupdates/status/1577795973476220930 (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>) (showing how California companies use a variable bonus system for some farmers’ pay). They are, nonetheless, controversial. Some critics in the human relations and management literature point to variable pay mechanisms as a contributor to income gaps by gender and race. See, e.g., Emilio J. Castilla, Gender, Race, and Meritocracy in Organizational Careers, 13 Am. J.

 my research on the on-demand ride hail industry suggests that algorithmic wage discrimination raises a new and distinctive set of concerns. In contrast to more traditional forms of variable pay, algorithmic wage discrimination—whether practiced through Amazon’s “bonuses” and scorecards or Uber’s work allocation systems, dynamic pricing, and wage incentives—arises from (and may function akin to) the practice of “price discrimination,” in which individual consumers are charged as much as a firm determines they may be willing to pay.

		To date, scholars and analysts who have written about what this Article terms “algorithmic wage discrimination” have predominantly adopted the language of pricing, though they describe wage and not product pricing. For example, in her 2021 Enlund Lecture at DePaul University School of Law, Professor Zephyr Teachout referenced some of these practices as “labor price discrimination.” Zephyr Teachout, Professor, Fordham Univ. Sch. of L., Enlund Lecture at DePaul University School of Law (Apr. 15, 2021). Niels van Doorn, in an article analyzing the pay structures of on-demand Deliveroo riders in Berlin, describes “the algorithmic price-setting power of food delivery platforms,” which he understands as a “monopsonistic power that is not only market-making but also potentially livelihood-taking.” Niels van Doorn, At What Price? Labour Politics and Calculative Power Struggles in On-Demand Food Delivery, 14 Work Org. Lab. &amp; Globalisation, no. 1, 2020, at 136, 138. But adopting the language of “pricing” for wage setting is politically and legally consequential. Since at least the rise of neoliberalism, price controls in the United States (and elsewhere) have been highly disfavored as economic interferences in the “free market,” raising conservative critiques of socialism and “planned economies.” See Benjamin C. Waterhouse, Lobbying America: The Politics of Business From Nixon to NAFTA 10623, 13239 (2013) (describing how American businesses rejected government price setting in the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations). Wage controls in the form of minimum-wage and overtime laws, on the other hand, have been contested but culturally naturalized as a necessary (or at least, accepted) part of economic regulation. See Amina Dunn, Most Americans Support a $15 Federal Minimum Wage, Pew Rsch. Ctr. (Apr. 22, 2021), https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/ [https://perma.cc/CX5Z-YX9Z] (surveying support for minimum-wage laws across the United States). In this sense, conceptualizing the digitalized wages received by workers not as firm price determinations but as firm wage determinations is a critical political—and legal—corrective.	</span>

 As a labor management practice, algorithmic wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that the firm desires, perhaps for as little as the system determines that the workers may be willing to accept.

<p>The <em>Blueprint</em> example underscores how algorithmic wage discrimination can be “ineffective” and rife with calculated mistakes that are difficult to ascertain and correct. But algorithmic wage discrimination also creates a labor market in which people who are doing the same work, with the same skill, for the same company, at the same time may receive different hourly pay.

		In 1957, Karl Polanyi wrote,<br>
Instead of economy being embedded in social relations, social relations are embedded in the economic system. The vital importance of the economic factor to the existence of society precludes any other result. For once the economic system is organized in separate institutions, based on specific motives and conferring a special status, society must be shaped in such a manner as to allow that system to function according to its own laws.<br>
Karl Polanyi, <em>The Great Transformation</em>: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time 60 (Beacon Press 2001) (1944). One interpretation of this important excerpt, as used in this Article, is that Polanyi was referring to the ways in which society adapts to and reorganizes itself “by demanding new social institutions that can constrain market forces and compensate for market failures.” Bob Jessop &amp; Ngai-Ling Sum, Polanyi: Classical Moral Economist or Pioneer Cultural Political Economist?, 44 Östereichische Zeitschrift für Soziologie 153, 158 (2019). This, in essence, is what he calls the “embedded economy”: that in order to prevent a “Hobbesian war of all against all,” a market society must limit—through law, politics, and morality—the range of legitimate activities of economic actors motivated by material gain.

 two restrictions on wages have emerged from social and labor movements: minimum-wage laws and antidiscrimination laws. Respectively, these laws set a price floor for the purchase of labor relative to time and prohibit identity-based discrimination in the terms, con-ditions, and privileges of employment, requiring firms to provide equal pay for equal work.

The central federal laws that prohibit wage discrimination based on protected identities or classes are the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) (requiring that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (2018) (prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin); the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 623, 631 (prohibiting employment discrimination based on age for workers older than forty); and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12112 (prohibiting employment discrimination based on disability).	</span>

 Both sets of wage laws can be understood as forming a core moral foundation for most work regulation in the United States. In turn, certain ideals of fairness have become embedded in cultural and legal expectations about work. Part I examines how recently passed laws in California and Washington State, which specifically legalize algorithmic wage discrimination for certain firms, compare with and destabilize more than a century of legal and social norms around fair pay.</p>
<p>Part II draws on first-of-its-kind, long-term ethnographic research to understand the everyday, grounded experience of workers earning through and experiencing algorithmic wage discrimination. Specifically, Part II analyzes the experiences of on-demand ride-hail drivers in California before and after the passage of an important industry-initiated law, Proposition 22, which legalized this form of variable pay. This Part illuminates workers’ experiences under compensation systems that make it difficult for them to predict and ascertain their hourly wages. Then, Part II examines the practice of algorithmic wage discrimination in rela-tionship to workers’ on-the-job meaning making and their moral interpretations of their wage experiences.

		Philosopher Antonio Gramsci used the term “Fordism” to refer to an emergent system of material production—routine, intensified labor—under the regime of Ford. But due in large part to corresponding political and economic forces, namely the laws and policies passed in response to upheaval during the Great Depression, the Fordist work structure in much of the mid-twentieth century often corresponded to an hourly (living) wage and a forty-hour work week.

</cite>
 As a normative matter, this Article contends that workers laboring for firms (especially large, well-financed ones like Uber, Lyft, and Amazon) should not be subject to the kind of risk and uncertainty associated with gambling as a condition of their work. In addition to the salient constraints on autonomy and threats to privacy that accompany the rise of on-the-job data collection, algorithmic wage discrimination poses significant problems for worker mobility, worker security, and worker collectivity, both on the job and outside of it. Because the on-demand workforces that are remunerated through algorithmic wage discrimination are primarily made up of immigrants and racial minority workers, these harmful economic impacts are also necessarily racialized.

 In addition to examining both approaches to addressing algorithmic wage discrim-ination, this Article argues that the constantly changing nature of machine learning technologies and the asymmetrical power dynamics of the digitalized workplace minimize the impact of these attempts at trans-parency and may not mitigate the objective or subjective harms of algorithmic wage discrimination. Considering the potential for this form of discrimination to spread into other sectors of work, this Article proposes instead an approach that addresses the harms directly: a narrowly structured, nonwaivable peremptory ban on the practice.</p>
<p>While this Article is focused on algorithmic wage discrimination as a labor management practice in “on-demand” or “gig work” sectors, where workers are commonly treated as “independent contractors” without protections, its significance is not limited to that domain. So long as this practice does not run afoul of minimum-wage or antidiscrimination laws, nothing in the laws of work makes this form of digitalized variable pay illegal.

		See supra note 25. Antitrust laws, however, are a more promising way to address these practices when and if workers are classified as independent contractors.

 The core motivations of labor platform firms to adopt algorithmic wage discrimination—labor control and wage uncertainty—apply to many other forms of work. Indeed, extant evidence suggests that algorithmic wage discrimination has already seeped into the healthcare and engineering sectors, impacting how porters, nurses, and nurse practitioners are paid.
<cite>
	<span>
		<span>39</span>
		For example, a company that brands itself “Uber for Hospitals” has developed AI staffing software for hospitals. This software uses “smart technology” to allocate work tasks and to judge the performance of porters, nurses, and nurse practitioners. See Nicky Godding, Oxford Tech Raises £9 Million for ‘Uber for Hospitals’ AI Platform, Bus. Mag. (May 21, 2020), https://thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/technology-innovation/oxford-tech-raises-9-million-for-uber-for-hospitals-ai-platform/ [https://perma.cc/8593-M9U7] (“Hospitals can use [this technology] to assign tasks to healthcare teams based on their location. . . . This helps to ensure . . . full visibility of vulnerable patient movement between departments, and connects porters directly with staff . . . .”). The technology company’s “performance analysis” may then be used to determine the pay for these healthcare workers. Id.<br>
IBM Japan is also using digital surveillance systems to help set wages for their workers. In 2019, the company introduced human relations software created by Watson to use as a “compensation advisor.” The Japan Metal, Manufacturing, Information and Telecommunication Workers’ Union ( JMITU), which represents IBM Japan workers, requested disclosure of the data the Watson AI acquired and used, an explanation for how it was evaluating workers, and how these evaluations were involved in the wage-setting process. IBM Japan refused to disclose the information. JMITU subsequently lodged a complaint with the Tokyo Labor Relations Commission. The union argues that the software is being used to unfairly target union members. According to one report, “[i]n awarding summer bonuses in June 2019, the individual performance rate assessed by the company was only 63.6% on average for union members, compared to an average of 100% for all [other] employees. In addition, an exceptional 0% assessment was made for many union members.” Hozumi Masashi (ほづみ まさし), AIによる賃金査定にどう向き合うか: 日本IBM事件(不当労働行為救済申立) の報告 [How to Face AI-Based Wage Assessments: Report on the IBM Japan Case (Unfair Labor Practice Relief Petition)], 338 季刊 労·働者の権利[Worker Rights Quarterly], no. 10, 2020, at 101, 102.	</span>

 If left unaddressed, the practice will continue to be normalized in other employment sectors, including retail, restaurant, and computer science, producing new cultural norms around compensation for low-wage work.

		See, e.g., Min Kyung Lee, Daniel Kusbit, Evan Metsky &amp; Laura Dabbish, Working With Machines: The Impact of Algorithmic and Data-Driven Management on Workers, in CHI 15: Proceedings of the 33rd Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 1603, 1603–04 (2015) (discussing how algorithms used across industries can produce new norms of allocation of, evaluation of, and compensation for work). Companies across the world use wage algorithms in both contracting and permanent employment settings to incentivize certain behaviors. Technology capitalists have foreshadowed its growth. See, e.g., Shawn Carolan, Opinion, What Proposition 22 Now Makes Possible, The Info. (Nov. 10, 2020), https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-proposition-22-now-makes-possible (on file with the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>) (predicting increased venture capitalist investment in “all sorts of industries” after the passage of Proposition 22). As Tarleton Gillespie has warned regarding the power of algorithms, “[t]here is a case to be made that the working logics of these algorithms not only shape user practices, but also lead users to internalize their norms and priorities.” Tarleton Gillespie, The Relevance of Algorithms, in Media Technologies: Essays on Communication, Materiality, and Society 167, 187 (Tarleton Gillespie, Pablo J.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently came across a great quote from <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2011/6/13/6675377/treme-watch-david-chang-gets-a-cameo">David Chang</a>, “Just because we’re a casual restaurant, doesn’t mean we don’t hold ourselves to fine dining standards. We try to do things the right way. That usually means doing things the long, hard, stupid way.”</p>
<p>David has elaborated <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/podcast/restaurateur-and-chef-david-chang/">on this quote</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When your back is turned and you’re no longer supervising them and they’re on their own making the decision are they going to make the right decision versus the wrong decision? And the only thing that’s separating them from making the wrong decision is personal integrity because no one’s ever gonna make… No one’s going to know. So many times in a kitchen you’re trying to teach someone to do the dumb long way. And like let’s just say you have a cook that’s making a dish and one of the steps that they do can save them 30 minutes if they just cheat, and the reality is the end result will lead to no one ever knowing the difference. I have to try to create an environment where I’m trying to get that Cook to take the long stupid way. It’s so inefficient. And ultimately I think being a chef is one of the hardest jobs to motivate people because there’s no lure of a giant paycheck or bonus or stock options. You’re really trying to teach someone to better themselves through their own personal integrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In real life, here’s what this looks like. David writes in <em>Eat a Peach</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, one of my favorite Majordomo dishes is a whole boiled chicken. We present the bird to the table in a big pot, bring it back to the kitchen to carve it, and then return with a beautiful platter of rice topped with the sliced breasts and two different sauces spooned over the top. Once guests are finished with that, we bring out a soup made from the carcass. It’s so good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day, David gets this email from his team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been cooking a “presentation chicken” lately to help get the chickens out earlier. That is, when the first bird is fired, we usually cook two &amp; have one just for presenting so we can butcher the chicken that’s rested, while we slow the other chicken, which speeds up the time it takes between seeing the chicken &amp; receiving the rice. The extra chicken at the end of the night is also butchered into our stock the next day, since we always like to use those bones from carcasses for the soup that follows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had cooked enough services to realize they could improve flow and make things easier on the staff with a little bit of bait-and-switch. A smart decision and common practice. The guest would have no idea that the chicken they’d seen wasn’t the same one they were eating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote to Jude and the rest of the Domo team saying we would discuss it upon my return, which they accurately interpreted to mean we were going back to the hard way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had nothing to do with integrity. I didn’t care about fooling the diners. What concerned me was the precedent we were setting. I worried about the mindset of the server whose job it would be to parade a stunt chicken around the dining room. I was terrified of our culture stagnating. The dish was meant to be a difficult pickup that required constant coordination between the front and back of house. That was what made it great. If they wanted to sandbag it, they needed to figure out how they would make up for the lost energy elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why the Momofuku brand of restaurants gained the popularity that it did, but no doubt this emphasis on quality is part of it. It’s this realm I think about when I’m discussing <a href="https://herbertlui.net/longcutting/">longcutting</a>, and <a href="https://herbertlui.net/to-succeed-in-the-age-of-ai-build-your-capacity-for-longcuts/">building the capacity for it</a>.</p>
<p>In a world where <a href="https://herbertlui.net/text-generation/">600 words are one click of a button and a prompt away</a>, writing a blog post—in 2024 at that!—<a href="https://herbertlui.net/this-is-probably-dumb/">sounds pretty stupid</a>. I write it because I think it will help me with all of the non-writing parts of writing. Asides from enjoying the practice—<a href="https://herbertlui.net/615-days-of-blogging-for-the-hell-of-it/">I write for fun</a>—it also <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1762866202433745292">improves my taste</a>, keeps me finding important things to say, and helps me figure out the right contexts for stories.</p>

    </div><p>Every day, people die waiting for an organ transplant. Time is at a premium, not just for those awaiting organs, but also for the organs themselves, which can deteriorate rapidly during transportation.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Looking to extend the viability of human tissues, researchers <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c03081" target="_blank">report</a> in<i>Nano Letters</i> their efforts to facilitate completely freezing, rather than cooling and then thawing, potentially life-saving organs. They demonstrate a magnetic nanoparticle's successful rewarming of animal tissues.</p>
<p>As of August 2024, more than 114,000 people are on the U.S. national transplant waiting list, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, and about 6,000 annually will die before receiving an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/organ+transplant/" rel="tag">organ transplant</a>. One reason is the loss of organs in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cold+storage/" rel="tag">cold storage</a> during transportation when delays cause them to warm prematurely.</p>
<p>Methods have been developed to quickly freeze organs for longer-term storage without risking damage from ice crystal formation, but ice crystals can also form during warming. To address this problem, Yadong Yin and colleagues advanced a technique known as nanowarming, pioneered by collaborator John Bischof, to employ <a href="https://phys.org/tags/magnetic+nanoparticles/" rel="tag">magnetic nanoparticles</a> and magnetic fields to thaw frozen tissues rapidly, evenly and safely.</p>
<p>Recently, Yin and a team developed magnetic nanoparticles—effectively extremely tiny bar magnets—that, when exposed to alternating magnetic fields, generated heat. And that heat rapidly thawed animal tissues stored at -238 degrees Fahrenheit (-150 degrees Celsius) in a solution of the nanoparticles and a cryoprotective agent.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>The researchers worried, however, that uneven distribution of the nanoparticles within the tissues might trigger overheating where the particles congregated, which could lead to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tissue+damage/" rel="tag">tissue damage</a> and toxicity from the cryoprotective agent at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>To reduce these risks, the researchers have continued their investigation, working on a two-stage approach that more finely controls nanowarming rates. They describe this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultured cells or animal tissues were immersed in a solution containing magnetic nanoparticles and a cryoprotective substance and then frozen with liquid nitrogen.</li>
<li>In the first stage of thawing, as before, an alternating <a href="https://phys.org/tags/magnetic+field/" rel="tag">magnetic field</a> initiated rapid rewarming of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/animal+tissues/" rel="tag">animal tissues</a>.</li>
<li>As the samples approached the melting temperature of the cryoprotective agent, the researchers applied a horizontal static magnetic field.</li>
<li>The second field realigned the nanoparticles, effectively tapping the brakes on heat production.</li>
</ul>
<p>The heating slowed fastest in areas with more <a href="https://phys.org/tags/nanoparticles/" rel="tag">nanoparticles</a>, which dampened concerns about problematic hotspots. Applying the method to cultured human skin fibroblasts and to pig carotid arteries, the researchers noted that cell viability remained high after rewarming over a few minutes, suggesting the thawing was both rapid and safe.</p>
<p>The ability to finely control tissue rewarming moves us one step closer to long-term organ cryopreservation and the hope of more life-saving transplants for patients, the researchers say.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Washington, D.C., September 9, 2024</strong> – Fifty years ago, as the <em>New York Times</em> prepared to break a major exposé on CIA covert operations in Chile, the architect of those operations, Henry Kissinger, misled President Gerald Ford about clandestine U.S. efforts to undermine the elected government of Socialist Party leader Salvador Allende, documents posted today by the National Security Archive show. The covert operations were “designed to keep the democratic process going,” Kissinger briefed Ford in the Oval Office two days before the article appeared fifty years ago this week. According to Kissinger, “there was no attempt at a coup.”</p><p>“I saw the Chile story,” Ford told Kissinger on September 9, 1974. “Are there any repercussions?” Kissinger replied: “Not really.”</p><p>In fact, the front-page story written by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/08/archives/cia-chief-tells-house-of-8million-campaign-against-allende-in-7073.html">“C.I.A. Chief Tells House Of $8 Million Campaign Against Allende in ‘70-’73”</a>—set in motion the biggest scandal on covert operations the intelligence community had ever experienced. Hersh’s September 8, 1974, article led directly to the formation of a special Senate committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church, that conducted the first major investigation of CIA covert actions in Chile and elsewhere and that was the first congressional body to evaluate the role of secret, clandestine operations in a democratic society. The political repercussions forced President Ford to publicly acknowledge the CIA operations in Chile while forcefully denying they had anything to do with fomenting a coup. The president’s White House lawyer subsequently advised Ford that his statement “was not fully consistent with the facts because all the facts had not been made known to you.”</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzmZRTto4PM?si=ED5a8IurvsJYrwXJ&amp;start=703" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>At a September 16th press conference, Gerald Ford became the first president to publicly acknowledge and defend CIA covert operations, which he characterized as limited to protecting Chilean democratic institutions from the threat of Allende. He stated that the CIA actions were "in the best interest of the people in Chile, and certainly in our best interest." (See timecode 11:55 in tape for Ford's statement.)&nbsp;</em></p><p>The Senate investigation, which also revealed CIA assassination plots against foreign leaders, and a similar investigative effort in the House of Representatives led to legislation to enhance checks and balances on CIA operations and curtail the ability of future presidents to “plausibly deny” covert action programs abroad. White House documents reveal the acute consternation expressed by Ford and Kissinger that covert operations might be restrained. “We need a CIA and we need covert operations,” Ford told his Cabinet nine days after the <em>Times </em>exposé was published. The article and a flood of follow up CIA stories by Hersh, as Kissinger later conceded in his memoirs, “had the effect of a burning match in a gasoline depot.”</p><article>

<p><strong>THE LEAK THAT CHANGED HISTORY</strong></p><p>The Hersh story was based on a summary of secret testimony by CIA director William Colby and a legendary agency official, David Atlee Phillips, who provided an overview of covert operations against Allende in Chile during an executive session of the House Armed Services Committee on April 22, 1974. According to the summary, Colby informed the Committee that between 1962 and 1973, the ultra-secret “40 Committee,” which oversaw covert operations, had authorized the CIA to spend $11 million in Chile, including $8 million to “destabilize” the Allende government and “to precipitate its downfall.” The summary stated that “the agency activities were viewed as a prototype, or laboratory experiment, to test the techniques of heavy financial investment in efforts to discredit and bring down a government.”</p><p>The summary was drafted by a liberal congressman from Massachusetts, Michael J. Harrington, who had heard about Colby’s TOP SECRET testimony and requested special permission to review it. Harrington read the 48-page hearing transcript twice—on June 5, and June 12, 1974—and realized Colby’s testimony clearly contradicted previous denials by Kissinger and top CIA officials (during earlier hearings on the CIA and ITT’s operations in Chile) that there had been any covert efforts to undermine Allende.</p><p>Harrington shared his concern that CIA officers had committed perjury with Senator Frank Church’s staff director, Jerome Levinson. In his unpublished memoir, Levinson recalled that Harrington “asked what I thought he should do.” Levinson recommended that Harrington write a letter to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator William Fulbright, requesting a full inquiry into the CIA’s role in Chile. On July 18, 1974, Harrington sent a lengthy letter to Fulbright, providing a summary of the secret CIA testimony and concluding that Congress and the American people “have a right to learn what was done in our name in Chile.”</p><p>After it became clear that Fulbright was not inclined to order a major investigation into the CIA role in Chile, Levinson decided to take the audacious step of calling attention to Colby’s still-secret testimony: he leaked the Harrington letter to Seymour Hersh. In early September, after lunch with Hersh at Jean-Pierre’s, a swanky D.C. restaurant, Levinson slipped Hersh a copy of the Harrington letter. On September 5, 1974, Hersh began calling State Department officials for comment on his forthcoming scoop, setting in motion a flurry of White House meetings, briefings and reports on what information Hersh might have obtained. On September 8, the <em>Times</em> published the story on the front page of its Sunday newspaper, generating a major scandal and eventually resulting in the prosecution of former CIA director Richard Helms for lying to Congress.</p><article>

<p><strong>REACTION OF THE CIA’s CHILEAN AGENTS</strong></p><p>The leak of Colby’s testimony forced the CIA to urgently contact its Chilean agents to ascertain the repercussions of the Hersh revelations on its network of assets and informants. In a revealing secret report four days after the <em>Times</em> article appeared, the CIA station transmitted the reactions of several Chilean operatives—identified by codenames such as FUBARGAIN, FUPOCKET and FUBRIG—who were embedded inside the Chilean military, the Chilean Christian Democrat political party, and the <em>El Mercurio</em> newspaper, which the CIA had financed as a bullhorn of opposition to the government of Salvador Allende. “Following Station agents were contacted, period 8-10 September, in connection with referenced revelations,” the Santiago Station informed CIA headquarters.</p><p>The agent codenamed “FUBRIG-2 “took the news calmly but was most concerned about implications of efforts of revelations and expressed opinion that system in Washington should be changed to prevent such leaks,” the CIA reported. “He was relieved that El Mercurio was not mentioned by name.”</p><p>According to this cable, the agent inside the Chilean military, FUBARGAIN-1, told the CIA that “General Pinochet did not seem very upset but [had] commented … that the disclosure ‘seemed to be a dumb thing to do.’” But the same agent told the CIA that other younger Chilean military officers interpreted the leak as a deliberate attempt to “damage [the] Junta and falsely cast doubt on their independence and role in bringing down Allende.” “Sum is that Chilean officer corps becoming increasingly baffled and resentful about U.S., according to this source.”</p><p><strong>STILL-SECRET DOCUMENTS</strong></p><p>Fifty years after the scandal broke over CIA operations in Chile, Colby’s original testimony before the House Armed Services Committee remains classified, as does the entire 48-page transcript of the closed hearing. Last year, the Chilean government officially requested that the Biden administration declassify those records as a gesture of “declassification diplomacy” for the 50th anniversary of the coup, but the CIA proved to be uncooperative.</p><p>“For the sake of historical accountability, it is imperative that the CIA declassify Colby’s testimony on Chile, as well as other relevant documentation,” stated Peter Kornbluh who directs the Archive’s Chile Documentation Project. As the 50th anniversary of the formation of the special Senate Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities approaches in January 2025, the Archive also called on Senate leaders to initiate the release the Church Committee’s voluminous investigative archives on Chile and other countries targeted for covert regime change operations.</p><p>“A half century of secrecy surrounding these records,” Kornbluh noted, “must come to an end.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="whats-in-the-box-">What’s in the box 📦</h2>

<p>Radicle 1.0 represents the culmination of <a href="https://radicle.xyz/history">years</a> of experimentation
and hard work from our team and community, where we set out to ensure that free
and open source software ecosystems can flourish without having to rely on the
whims of Big Tech. We designed Radicle with a first-principles approach, as a
natural extension to Git, expanding it to work in a collaborative, local-first,
peer-to-peer setting.</p>

<p>This milestone includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extensible, homegrown, peer-to-peer gossip and sync <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol">protocol</a>
built on the Git protocol.</li>
  <li>Social interactions such as issues, patches and code review, using our
extensible <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol#collaborative-objects">Collaborative Objects</a> system which keeps all artifacts
in the repository.</li>
  <li>A secure authentication and authorization protocol using public key
cryptography, which allows all published content to be verified locally,
without centralized authority.</li>
  <li>An intuitive CLI that should be familiar to users of Git, as well as a web
frontend for browsing Radicle repositories and seed nodes.</li>
  <li>Privacy at the protocol level, with truly private repositories and built-in
<a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user/#4-embracing-the-onion">Tor support</a>.</li>
  <li>Reproducible and signed <a href="https://radicle.xyz/download">builds</a> for all Radicle binaries.</li>
</ul>

<p>To us, Radicle 1.0 means that Radicle is <em>ready to use</em>. It stands as a
testament that sovereign code forges are possible today, and in our opinion,
<em>necessary</em>.</p>

<p>We feel comfortable now inviting you to join us, replicate, and
<a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user">collaborate</a> within the Radicle network or even <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/seeder">run a seed
node</a>.</p>

<p>For an in-depth explanation of how Radicle works, check out our <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol">Protocol
Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="stability-️">Stability ⛰️</h2>

<p>Radicle 1.0 marks our commitment to stability: from this release onwards, all
changes to the protocol will be designed in backwards compatible way, and any
necessary change on the CLI will include a seamless upgrade path.</p>

<p>We are aware that the release candidate phase was rockier than expected for
some, but we are now in a good place to slow things down and improve stability.</p>

<p>Along with this commitment will come a more dependable and streamlined release
process which starts with this release!</p>

<h2 id="future-plans-">Future plans 🔮</h2>

<p>There are several things in the pipeline that we intend to release when ready:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Native CI/CD capabilities</li>
  <li>The Radicle TUI (Terminal User Interface)</li>
  <li>Advanced code review functionality</li>
  <li>An inbox system for repository notifications</li>
  <li>Multi-device support and user profiles</li>
  <li>Support for other canonical references, such as tags</li>
  <li>Seed node moderation and management tools</li>
  <li>The Radicle desktop application</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="growing-ecosystem-">Growing ecosystem 🌱</h2>

<p>Outside of the core stack, the ecosystem is growing nicely:  an independent
team working on integrations &amp; tooling for Radicle has developed a <a href="https://app.radicle.at/nodes/seed.radicle.gr/rad:z3Makm6fsQQXmpSFE43DZqwupaEhk">VS
Code</a> and <a href="https://app.radicle.at/nodes/seed.radicle.gr/rad:z3WHS4GSf8hChLjGYfPkJY7vCxsBK">JetBrains</a> plugin. The Radicle network now also
comprises several deployments of the Radicle <a href="https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z4V1sjrXqjvFdnCUbxPFqd5p4DtH5">frontend</a>, and there are more
than 40 seed nodes operating on the network, freely replicating user content.</p>

<h2 id="invitation-to-forge-the-future-">Invitation to forge the future 🤝</h2>

<p>Once you <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/user#installation">install</a> Radicle and set up your identity, you’ll have access
to all public repositories on any public node, making it easier to explore and
contribute to the ecosystem. Compared to traditional self-hosted forges, which
often result in fragmented collaboration environments, Radicle represents an
evolutionary step for Git-based collaboration, with a single cryptographic
identity that works across nodes.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the spirit of free and open source software, we believe that power
lies in community. As we embark on further iterating the protocol and stack, we
also invite you to shape the future of Radicle with us. Consider joining us on
our <a href="https://radicle.zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a> instance. Your ideas and insights
are invaluable to our mission of creating a sovereign forge.</p>

<p>Together, we can make significant progress towards reclaiming the internet.</p>

    <p>I’ve come across people who believe that Max Headroom, the Channel 4 character from the Eighties (pictured at top), was a genuine piece of computer animation. But although he was conceived by the animators Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel  (of Cucumber Films fame) Max himself was portrayed by actor Matt Frewer, placed into latex makeup and a shiny costume and set amidst a range of technological tricks. </p>
<p>Half of the frames from the footage used in <em>Max Headroom</em> were removed in production, resulting in a juddery look to suggest animation shot on twos, and Frewer was bluescreened in front of a basic digital backdrop. The crew even added deliberate faults to the “animation” – such as the stammer which became Max’s trademark – to complete the effect.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f_hWGCsY1g?si=xwIH6F-NBDJ-7doe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This process seems somewhat surreal today, in our brave new world of Maya, Xtranormal and Blender. Max Headroom was created at a time when 3D CGI animation was desirable, but not always affordable; if the budget did not allow it, then the crew had to fake computer animation in front of the camera.</p><!--googleoff: index--><!--googleon: index-->
<p>Another good example of this can be found in the 1981 film <em>Escape from New York</em>. Early on in the movie we see what appears to be a wireframe model of Manhattan; in actual fact, a physical model was built for this sequence, with reflective tape placed along the edges of the buildings. Shot under ultraviolet light, this recreated the luminescent green-on-black effect of primitive CGI.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/escapefromnewyork-580x391.jpg" alt="" title="escapefromnewyork" width="580" height="391" srcset="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/escapefromnewyork-580x391.jpg 580w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/escapefromnewyork-380x256.jpg 380w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/escapefromnewyork-444x300.jpg 444w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/escapefromnewyork-180x122.jpg 180w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/escapefromnewyork.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></p><p>There has even been an incident in which a budget imitation of CGI itself received a budget imitation. In 1987 an unidentified signal hacker managed to replace two television broadcasts with a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cycVTXtm0U0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=30s">mildly disturbing video</a> of a home-made <em>Max Headroom</em> show. In this improvised effort Max was portrayed by a man in a shop-bought mask, while the moving backdrops – in the original series, an example of genuine digital animation amongst the pseudo-CGI – were replaced with somebody offscreen wiggling a bit of corrugated metal about.</p>
<p>These are all extreme examples; during this period, it was more common for digital animation to be emulated using hand-drawn techniques. Often used as a visual motif in kids’ science fiction-themed cartoons (witness the cel animated wireframes in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6_jqHKcTI">opening sequence to <em>Transformers</em></a>) this approach was put to good use by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rodlord.com/">Rod Lord’</a>s animation work on the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> television series from 1981. Created using litho film and coloured gels, these sequences suggested digital graphics simply by combining glowing primarily-coloured images with a black background. An added plus was that the animation could get away with being a little bit jerky…</p>

The biggest example of this, however, came when Disney produced an entire feature film based around the look of eighties arcade games: <em>Tron.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spaceinvadersstylefilm-580x398.jpg" alt="" title="spaceinvadersstylefilm" width="580" height="398" srcset="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spaceinvadersstylefilm-580x398.jpg 580w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spaceinvadersstylefilm-380x260.jpg 380w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spaceinvadersstylefilm-436x300.jpg 436w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spaceinvadersstylefilm-180x124.jpg 180w, https://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spaceinvadersstylefilm.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></p><p><em>Tron</em> contained genuine CGI animation backed up with large amounts of compositing tricks based around matte effects and backlighting; this made the live action footage look as though it had been digitally processed. As a result, the film stands as arguably the premiere example of pseudo-CGI.</p>
<p>In her book <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0253220963/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0253220963&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=animationblast08"><em>British Animation: The Channel 4 Factor</em></a><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=animationblast08&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0253220963" width="1" height="1" alt=""> Clare Kitson remarked on the fact that Max Headroom, Channel 4’s biggest animated hit, was not actually animated. But as she went on to argue, perhaps it is time for a reappraisal:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder if we might indeed classify those sequences as animation nowadays. With the plethora of different technologies now employed, the previous narrow definition (which insisted that the movement itself must be created by the animator) seems a bit old-fashioned. These days anything that appears on a screen and moves but is not a record of real life – including creatures moved by motion capture – tends to fall under the animation umbrella… The current popular synonym for animation, ‘manipulated moving image’, seems to be made for Max.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, if Max had been made using actual CGI he would have ended up as a creaky old relic, rather like the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAD6Obi7Cag">“Money for Nothing”</a> video which came out the year after his debut.  Instead, Jankel, Morton and Frewer came up with a genuinely iconic creation that has aged surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Today, it is all too easy for animators to fall back on the tricks of their software and lose track of the wider aesthetic potential of their work. What <em>Max Headroom</em>—and, to an extent, some of the other pieces mentioned here—show is the opposite effect: digital animation spurring creativity in analogue work. They have an ingenuity and hand-made charm which is missing from so much modern computer animation.</p>
<p>Primitive digital imagery has had something of a resurgence across the past decade or so, to the point where pastiches of 8-bit pixel graphics have found their way into mainstream productions such as <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>. Perhaps it is time that the animators and digital artists of today rediscovered the lesser-known cousin of this aesthetic: the strange world of pseudo-CGI.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I hate to admit it, but <strong>the Reddit, HackerNews, and Lobsters folks were right.</strong></p>
<p>Three months ago I published <a href="https://yaak.app/blog/why-not-open-source">Why Not Open Source</a> as an
attempt to explain why Yaak <em>wouldn't</em> be open source. Having burnt out on OSS in the
past, I thought that others might find my decision-making process useful, so I shared it
to the usual places.</p>
<p>Yaak users mostly agreed, which makes sense, as they were already happy with the
close-source reality. The broader open-source community, however, strongly disagreed with
almost everything.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq">lobste.rs post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1dgis44/why_yaak_is_not_open_source/">Reddit r/opensource post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41424910">HackerNews post</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t conflate “open source”/“free software” with github’s specific social model of
drive-by contributions, or even contributions at all...
→ <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq/why_yaak_is_not_open_source#c_k7tr74">lobste.rs</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But all of those things are also true of closed source software.
→ <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41425136">ycombinator.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The claims of this text are complete bullshit. No idea what this "app" is about,
anyways.
Dont need it. Can go to the trash can of history
→ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1dgis44/comment/l8qn0v9/">reddit.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While most of the replies weren't constructive, the quoted
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq/why_yaak_is_not_open_source#c_k7tr74">500-word lobste.rs comment</a>
is absolute gold. It immediately got me thinking that <strong>maybe I was wrong.</strong> 🙈</p>
<p>I wanted feedback, and that's exactly what I got.</p>
<p>The main theme was that <em><strong>open source doesn't mean open contribution.</strong></em> You can still
get most of the benefits by simply making the code public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open to security audits</li>
<li>Transparent functionality (no shady stuff)</li>
<li>Flexibility (can still fork and modify)</li>
<li>Runnable even if the developer leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted Yaak users to experience these benefits too, which is why Yaak is now open source
but closed (mostly) for contribution.</p>
<h2 id="-open-source-closedish-contribution">🙈 Open source, closed(ish) contribution</h2>
<p>Many commenters pointed to projects like SQLite which are open-source but don't allow
outside contribution. For some reason, I never even considered this to be a possibility.
While Googling for more projects like this, I came
across <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream?tab=readme-ov-file#contribution-policy">Litestream</a>,
which was initially closed to contribution and eventually opened for bug-fixes only.</p>
<p>This model made perfect sense to me, so it's exactly what I'm doing. <strong>Yaak is now open
source under the MIT license and open to contribution for bug fixes only.</strong></p>
<p><em>Now the desktop Linux users can fix their own bugs (please don't hate me)</em> 😅</p>

<p dir="auto">Turn your Apple Watch or any watch with an accessible magnetometer into an ammeter to measure DC currents.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apple Watches newer than Series 5 which have a compass also contain a magnetometer. The magnetometer is also sensitive to magnetic fields from nearby currents.</p>
<p dir="auto">This demonstration uses a coil of wire around the watch to alter the magnetic field sensed. A circular coil of wire with N turns and a diameter D will generate a magnetic field of B = u0.I/D (u0 is defined to be 4.π.10^-7); so for a watch with a diameter of about 48 mm (approximately Apple Watch 5), 5 turns with 1 A will generate a field of 5 * 4.π.10^-7 * 1/0.048 = 131 uT (or 1.3 gauss). Because the magnetometer is not centered in the coil (it's usually in the very bottom right corner of the watch), the actual sensitivity is a bit lower; 100 uT/A is a reasonable approximation that can be improved by calibrating.</p>
<p dir="auto">An app could easily be written to perform some calibration and zero offset as well as display current in Amperes. however nearly any app that can display raw magnetometer data can be used. I use 'Sensor-App' which is free. Note that you can only detect DC currents; the magnetometer is too slow to react to AC (e.g. household power) currents.</p>

The shoppers and sightseers still dawdle along the harbour front, gawping at the astonishing sculptures carved on the rocks behind: the gods and goddesses, bare-breasted and smiling; the lions, water buffalo, cobras and, of course, elephants. Nothing much has changed since the seventh-century poet Dandin, the greatest Sanskrit storyteller, sauntered along the prom ‘with eyes blossoming wide in wonder’. Nothing, except that there are no ships riding out at anchor any more.</p><p>In the heyday of the Pallava dynasty, from around 600-900 <span>ad</span>, Mamallapuram was probably the greatest seaport in India. On the monsoon winds, great ninety-foot long, three hundred-ton, lash-lugged vessels carried Indian textiles, steel swords and brass buddhas to the furthest corners of south-east Asia – Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia – bringing back on the north-easterly monsoon pepper, spices, camphor, resin and, above all, gold from the newly discovered mines of Sumatra and Sarawak. They carried with them hundreds of passengers exporting every variety of Buddhism and Hinduism, their Sanskrit language and their art and architecture. At ports along the Mekong Delta, statues and temples face the water as they do at Mamallapuram. At Angkor Wat and Borobudur in the Eastern highlands of Java, the local merchants and potentates built Buddhist temples in the Indian style, only ten times the size. Just as the greatest surviving Greek temples lie mostly in her colonies across the sea, at Paestum, Segesta and Agrigento, so the greatest monuments of Indic civilisation lie at its furthest Eastern reaches. The reproductions of St Martin-in-the-Fields that adorn many New England townships are only a modest parallel to the startling impact of Indian architecture on the whole of South-East Asia.</p><p>But the Western seas around India were alive too, and had been for centuries earlier. The wealth of India had been a legend in the Mediterranean since the fourth century <span>bc</span>, enhanced by Alexander the Great’s forays. India, not China, was Rome’s greatest trading partner. The sea was, after all, the fastest and most economic mode of travel in the pre-modern world. As William Dalrymple points out in <em>The Golden Road</em>, ships could carry much larger cargoes than camels and sail around wars, blockades and ambushes.</p><p>Dalrymple’s own odyssey is equally laden to the gunwales with pages of astounding illustrations and arresting anecdotes, but its destination is always clear and its argument compelling. He identifies the sea-lanes rather than the overland tracks as the ‘golden road’ that created the wealth of the ancient world, and places India, rather than China, at the heart of the story. This could have been a ferocious demolition job on the received wisdom. In fact, it is an eirenic exploration, in which he never speaks unkindly of his rivals – for example, Peter Frankopan, author of <em>The Silk Roads –</em> or of the dozen other new or newish books listed on Amazon that have ‘Silk Roads’ as part of their title; the topographical section of the London Library has a whole Silk Roads shelf. This is evidently an idea that still has traction. After Dalrymple, it looks unmistakably on the skids.</p><p>The concept was first energetically promoted as late as 1877 by the Prussian geographer the Baron von Richthofen, a relative of the more famous Red Baron whose ‘Flying Circus’ dominated the aerial combats of the Great War. Richthofen Senior had been tasked with dreaming up a route for linking Berlin with Beijing, with a view to establishing German colonies in the East and markets for German industry. So from the start, Richthofen’s idea of the <em>Seidenstrasse</em> had an ulterior motive (unlike the term’s first innocent surfacing forty years earlier in <em>Die Erdkunde,</em> by another German geographer, Carl Ritter). Today, from the other end of the supposed route comes the promotion of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, accompanied by a map on the Unesco website showing a direct overland passage, said to have been pioneered by the Chinese envoy Zhang Qian, who died in 114 <span>bc</span> and is now an official Chinese national hero.</p><p>Dalrymple will have none of it. The <em>Seidenstrasse</em> of Richthofen’s imagination barely existed in antiquity. There was scarcely any direct trade between China and the West until the Mongols flattened the barriers in the 13th century, making the trip possible for Marco Polo, who never mentions the term. As for silk, yes, it was China’s most famous export (though paper and gunpowder have been rather more influential in world history), but it usually reached Rome only indirectly, mostly by boat, via India, where much of the stuff was actually manufactured. It was dwarfed in value by the tons of Indian pepper, spices, ivory, cotton, teak, sandalwood, rhubarb and precious stones (until the 17th century India had the world’s only diamond mine, at Golconda outside Hyderabad). When Alaric the Visigoth held Rome to ransom in 408 <span>ad</span>, he demanded, on top of gold, not silk but 3000 lbs of black pepper.</p><p>Even if most of the East-West trade never went near the supposed route of the <em>Seidenstrasse</em>, the volume of it was still huge. Calculations based on one of those invaluable scraps of papyrus from the rubbish dump at Oxyrhynchus suggest that customs taxes on trade with India may have generated one-third of the total income of the Roman exchequer. Roman commentators were in despair about the drain of gold to India. Pliny the Elder called India ‘the sink of the world’s most precious metals’ – the converse of the complaint under the Raj that Britain was draining the wealth of India. Pliny also loathed the taste of pepper. Tacitus grumbled that ‘for promiscuous dress and the sake of jewels, our wealth is transported to alien and hostile countries.’ In economic terms, silk may have been no big deal, but its slithery, see-through quality outraged fogeys such as Seneca.</p><p>When Rome gained control of Egypt, trade really took off. Strabo calculated that now six times as many ships were leaving for India each year. The suicides of Antony and Cleopatra eventually brought prosperity to the seaports of Tamil Nadu, Mamallapuram not least among them. But Richthofen’s <em>Seidenstrasse</em> really does seem to be the road less travelled – even, during most of the first millennium <span>ad</span>, the road not taken at all. Less mild-mannered than Dalrymple, Warwick Ball in <em>Rome in the East</em> (1999) dismisses it as an academic ‘myth’. Ball is a distinguished archaeologist who has spent fifty years digging in the regions of West Asia that would have been a key part of the Silk Road. To get the full force of the Ball-blast, we must quote at some length:</p><blockquote><p>The existence of the ‘Silk Road’ is not based on a single shred of historical or material evidence. There was never any such ‘road’ or even a route in the organisational sense, there was no free movement of goods between China and the West until the Mongol Empire in the Middle Ages, silk was by no means the main commodity in trade with the East and there is not a single ancient historical record, neither Chinese nor classical, that even hints at the existence of such a road. The arrival of silk in the West was more the result of a series of accidents than organised trade. Chinese monopoly and protectionism of sericulture is largely myth. Despite technology existing in ancient China far in advance of anything in the West, most of it did not reach the West until the Middle Ages (usually via the Mongols) when much of it was already up to a thousand years old. Both ancient Rome and China had only the haziest notions of each other’s existence and even less interest, and the little relationship that did exist between East and West in the broadest sense was usually one-sided, with the stimulus coming mainly from the Chinese. The greatest value of the Silk Road to history is as a lesson – and an important one at that – at how quickly and how thoroughly a myth can become enshrined as unquestioned academic fact.</p></blockquote><p>It’s a valuable achievement to shunt off the Silk Road into a permanent siding, but Dalrymple’s book has deeper and even more provoking resonances, which indirectly challenge the way history is usually written. First of all, this long sweep of time – the book begins in the fifth century <span>bc</span> and ends in the thirteenth century <span>ad</span> – is mostly a saga without soldiers. Post-colonial Indian historians have pointed out that there is no evidence to show any large-scale Indian military activity in South-East Asia before the Chola raids of the 11th century. Indian influence was spread by merchants and sea captains, but also by monks. The Buddhist monasteries of Northern India and Afghanistan became rich centres of economic activity, as medieval monasteries were to become in Europe, lending at interest and sending out missionaries far and wide. The Buddhist message was taken northwards by adventurous monks and eventually reached China and captivated the mercurial former concubine, the Empress Wu, who proclaimed Buddhism the state religion. Religious conversion and economic expansion went hand in hand. Greater Angkor is reckoned to have had a population of a million or so at a time when London had only 20,000 inhabitants. Chiefs and kings took the names of Hindu gods. The Brahmins brought with them not only their faiths and their epics but also the previously unknown art of writing. Sanskrit inscriptions, like Roman coins, turn up at the furthest flingings of Indian influence. Yet everything was subtly changed by the prevailing local cultures. When Rabindranath Tagore visited South-East Asia in 1927, he wrote: ‘Everywhere I could see India, yet I could not recognise it.’</p><p>In these enterprises, trade did not follow the flag, because there was usually no flag to follow. These were not colonies of conquest, or servile satrapies. They were zones of peaceful influence, expanded by merchants and monks and not by force of arms. Strabo records, with some contempt, that the merchants who had travelled from Rome to Egypt and on through India as far as the Ganges, were ‘merely private citizens’ and of no use in describing the places they had seen.</p><p>Dalrymple calls all this the ‘Indosphere’, attributing the coinage to Simon Sebag Montefiore (elsewhere it is attributed to Professor James Matisoff, a celebrated coiner of neologisms). But however we wish to describe it, the phenomenon is achieved, if not quite without firing a shot, at least without the deployment of huge armies or indeed of organised nation states. Only briefly under the Emperor Ashoka was India a united state, apart from the far south. And even Ashoka’s legacy was more one of spreading the ideas of Buddhism than of perpetuating the idea of nationhood. All the same, a sense of India seems to have been always in the air. Strabo reported that Alexander the Great had talked to holy men in India who conceived of their homeland as stretching ‘from the mouth of the Indus in the West to the mouth of the Ganges in the East, from the mouth of the Ganges to the tip of southern India and from there, again, to the mouth of the Indus’.</p><p>It is the brutal irruption of large armies that eventually breaks up and extinguishes the Indosphere. The Mongol hordes cut off trade to the North and East; the Turkic invasions bring North India under the rule of the Mughals; in the West, the unstoppable force of Islam has already smashed the trade routes, only for them to be revived under the more civilised caliphs. If <em>The Golden Road</em> has a fault, it is that it does not spend enough time on the downslope. The withering and extinction of free trade by force majeure is one of the undersung songs of history. Dalrymple might reckon that he has already served his time on that front, with his histories of Mughal India and of the ultimate triumph of the East India Company. But the story here does need to be completed by a fuller account of the way the empire-seeking Europeans – the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and the British – imposed their trade monopolies and built their own ports at strategic points along the Indian coastline: the British at Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, the latter only a few miles north of the half-deserted Mamallapuram. From first to last, Britain’s trade policy was ruthlessly self-seeking. As Lord William Bentinck said of the consequences of allowing textiles from British mills into India: ‘The misery hardly finds parallel in the history of commerce. The bones of the cotton weavers are bleaching the plains of India.’</p><p>But Dalrymple does give full measure to the last and greatest achievement of the Indosphere: the spread of much of culture that we recognise as distinctively modern. The innovations range from the invention of the algorithm to the delights of the <em>Kama Sutra,</em> all reaching their apogee around the sixth and seventh centuries <span>ad</span>. In mathematics, the written sign for zero and the numerals that we call Arab are only the most conspicuous achievements. The great mathematician Aryabhata (476-550), in his masterwork composed when he was only 23, covers square and cube roots, the properties of circles and triangles, algebra, quadratic equations and sines, and contains a decent approximation of the value of pi at 3.1416. All this, being written down in a few crisp lines of Sanskrit verse, took centuries to be translated into Arabic by the scholars of Baghdad, and thence into Latin by Fibonacci of Pisa and then again into English by Michael Scot of Melrose (1175-1232) and Adelard of Bath (1080-1142). So alien was this new science to the dumbclucks of the West that Michael Scot was remembered in Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> and in Sir Walter Scott’s <em>Lay of the Last Minstrel</em> only as a sinister sorcerer. The oldest Latin MS containing what we must now call Indo-Arab numerals, the <em>Codex Vigilanus,</em> dates from only 976 <span>ad</span>. Its author, Vigila, frankly admitted: ‘We must know that the Indians have a most subtle talent and all other races yield to them in arithmetic and geometry and the other liberal arts.’ Fibonacci, apart from bequeathing his sequence, also imported the latest Arab accounting methods, which he learned as a boy travelling with his merchant father in Algeria, and which became the basis of double-entry book-keeping and modern commerce. Once again, we see in the Indian intellectual tradition the marriage of practical and theoretical science. And India invented chess too, although it reached us via Persia. <em>Rukh</em> is a Persian word meaning ‘chariot’ and ‘checkmate’ comes from <em>Shah maat!</em> – ‘the King’s frozen.’</p><p>No less crucial in the formation of ‘the West’ as we know it was the evolution of the university system from the early Buddhist monasteries in Northern India into the <em>madrasas</em> and thence into Oxford, Cambridge and the Sorbonne. The lineage of those secluded quads with their communities of dedicated scholars is clear. There was no greater example than the university of Nalanda in Bihar, with its endless courtyards and temples and its ten thousand monks and scholars. Dalrymple describes in alluring detail the three thousand-mile pilgrimage in 629 <span>ad</span> of the Buddhist monk Xuanzang from the Chinese capital to visit this amazing place. No freshman from the sticks can ever have had his mind more thoroughly blown by the uni experience. This is perhaps the most brilliant example of the traffic running predominantly one way from China to India. It was India that was so often the destination and the hub.</p><p>Dalrymple is well aware of the perils of overegging the India-first thesis. He quotes Sanjeev Bhaskar’s <em>Goodness Gracious Me</em> sketch: ‘Christianity? Indian! Leonardo da Vinci? Indian! Royal Family? Indian!’ But you cannot come away from <em>The Golden Road</em> without a strong sense of the peculiar, enduring qualities of the Indian tradition: its mercantile zest, its restless search for ultimate truth, its longstanding adherence to non-violence and consequently to vegetarianism (the ideal of <em>ahimsa</em> dates back to the sixth century <span>bc</span>). Nor can we ignore the persistence of those qualities in the remarkable success stories of the Indian diaspora today: not just the billionaires and politicians and novelists – the Tatas, Ambanis and Mittals, the Sunaks, Patels and Varadkars, the Naipauls, Rushdies and Desais – but also the tech geeks in Silicon Valley, the countless GPs and pharmacists, the convenience stores which are always open. We can safely forget the Silk Road, but we cannot forget India or the Indians.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <h2 id="about-me">about me</h2>
<p>I am 18, born in 2006. This is generally a good thing as I am in the prime of life currently. I am not one of those people who think they were “born in the wrong decade”, I think I was born at the perfect time to take advantage of superlinearly growing technological advancements.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-today">the internet today</h2>
<p>I generally greatly dislike social media, although I am an avid user of it. When social media caught on, the people running these companies were tasked to make it profitable. In doing this, social media got completely ruined.</p>
<p>Our data got commodified[1], our attention got commodified, and a substantive part of who we say we are got commodified. This, in general, has led to a degradation in the quality of the internet.</p>
<p>They basically made social media like a drug, as addictive as possible. They do this by promoting FOMO and comparison in Instagram’s case. Instagram is a game, it is extremely performative. People carefully curate each part of their insta to give certain impressions.</p>
<p>What’s the ratio of followers to following you have? Are your story highlights organized and “aesthetic”? What reels are you liking?</p>
<p>There are a lot of “rules” in this game, which are enforced by social “ins” and mutual respect.</p>
<p>When it comes to shortform content, hundreds of people compete for slivers of our attention. We are not agents in this, they are just presented to us. Completely depersonalized. They are forgotten within seconds. Ask someone watching tiktok to describe the previous tiktoks they just watched, they would be hard pressed to tell you more than a few minutes in the past. Something about tiktok is unusually addictive. all the while providing absolutely no value.</p>
<p>It has become so shallow, you can tell almost nothing about who someone actually is through Instagram or tiktok. You can only tell how they want to portray themselves to the general population and, by how they organize their profile, if they are eligible to be a part of your social circle.</p>
<h2 id="the-appeal-of-simplicity">the appeal of simplicity</h2>
<p>I wish I was around when people had blogs or even myspace. This era was deeply personal and creative. Most writing on the internet was individual, not written in search of “SEO” or profit but driven by the need and want of people to share knowledge–pure curiosity.</p>
<p>I want the thrill of finding new websites searching through web rings; when the web was truly the wild west and not another arm of control by mega corporations.</p>
<p>This is also reflective in the quality of content. There was little incentive to lie, to manipulate truth, and each blog entry or piece of information was tied to identity. (except in the cases of anonymity).</p>
<p>Even the content written by normal people for normal people has been commodified by sites like reddit and quora. What happened to an old fashioned forums or even usenet groups? (granted, especially for cars and hacking, there still exists plenty of forums)</p>
<p>Also, websites just simply looked cooler. Occasionally I scroll on the geocities archive and wonder, how did we get here?  What happened to the patterned backgrounds, the bright maximalist jpegs and gifs?  This is sort of contradictory to my website, as it’s almost annoyingly minimalist, but this more has to do with social norms and simplicity. Having a personal blog is already out of the ordinary, but the simple design and clear technical direction/theme gives me an excuse. I also am not that personal on here, because only a few of my friends frequent my blogs, and I want the site to be as simple and to the point as possible if a random person wants to know who I am.</p>
<h2 id="a-niche-resurgence">a niche resurgence</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocites</a>, and a small community of people who share this philosophy about the web (and that are relatively young), but I have not met anyone my age, in the real world, that would choose to do something like this.</p>
<p>The majority of people (my age) today would think sites like those (and, by extension, their creators) are weird.</p>
<p>[1] you can substitute “commodified” with “bought and sold”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>We’re excited to release Chai-1, a new multi-modal foundation model for molecular structure prediction that performs at the state-of-the-art across a variety of tasks relevant to drug discovery. Chai-1 enables unified prediction of proteins, small molecules, DNA, RNA, covalent modifications, and more.</p><p>The model is available for free via a <a href="https://lab.chaidiscovery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web interface</a>, including for commercial applications such as drug discovery. We are also releasing the model weights and inference code as a <a href="https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software library</a> for non-commercial use.</p><h2>A frontier model for biomolecular interactions</h2><p>We tested Chai-1 across a large number of benchmarks, and found that the model achieves a 77% success rate on the PoseBusters benchmark (vs. 76% by AlphaFold3), as well as an Cα LDDT of 0.849 on the CASP15 protein monomer structure prediction set (vs. 0.801 by ESM3-98B).</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,nAGHKUD9XOHtavXDEpA6XH8Wo4.png" data-framer-height="896" data-framer-width="1814" height="448" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/nAGHKUD9XOHtavXDEpA6XH8Wo4.png" width="907"></p><p>Unlike many existing structure prediction tools which require multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), Chai-1 can also be run in single sequence mode without MSAs while preserving most of its performance. The model can fold multimers more accurately (69.8%) than the MSA-based AlphaFold-Multimer model (67.7%), as measured by the DockQ acceptable prediction rate. Chai-1 is the first model that’s able to predict multimer structures using single-sequences alone (without MSA search) at AlphaFold-Multimer level quality.</p><p>For more information, and a comprehensive analysis of the model, read our <a href="https://chaiassets.com/chai-1/paper/technical_report_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical report</a>.</p><h2><strong>A natively multi-modal foundation model</strong></h2><p>In addition to its frontier modeling capabilities directly from sequences, Chai-1 can be prompted with new data, e.g. restraints derived from the lab, which boost performance by double-digit percentage points.&nbsp;We explore a number of these capabilities in our technical report, such as epitope conditioning – using even a handful of contacts or pocket residues (potentially derived from lab experiments) doubles antibody-antigen structure prediction accuracy, making antibody engineering more feasible using AI.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,icSSrTXU76WdTzKi30rSK70UY.png" data-framer-height="1962" data-framer-width="4716" height="981" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/icSSrTXU76WdTzKi30rSK70UY.png" width="2358"></p><h2><strong>Releasing the model for all</strong></h2><p>We are releasing Chai-1 via a web interface for free, including for commercial applications such as drug discovery. We are also releasing the code for Chai-1 for non-commercial use as a software library. We believe that when we build in partnership with the research and industrial communities, the entire ecosystem benefits.</p><p>Try Chai-1 for yourself by visiting <a href="http://lab.chaidiscovery.com/" rel="noopener">lab.chaidiscovery.com</a>, or run it from our GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab</a>.</p><h2><strong>What's next?</strong></h2><p>The team comes from pioneering research and applied AI companies such as OpenAI, Meta FAIR, Stripe, and Google X. Collectively, we have played pivotal roles in the advancement of research in AI for biology. The majority of the team has been Head of AI at leading drug discovery companies, and has collectively helped advance over a dozen drug programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Chai-1 is the result of a few months of intense work, and yet we are only at the starting line. Our broader mission at Chai Discovery is to transform biology from science into engineering. To that end, we'll be building further AI foundation models that predict and reprogram interactions between biochemical molecules, the fundamental building blocks of life. We’ll have more to share on this soon.</p><p>We are grateful for the partnership of <a href="https://www.dimensioncap.com/" rel="noopener">Dimension</a>, <a href="https://www.thrivecap.com/" rel="noopener">Thrive Capital</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://www.conviction.com/" rel="noopener">Conviction</a>, <a href="https://neo.com/" rel="noopener">Neo</a>, Lachy Groom, and <a href="https://www.amplifypartners.com/" rel="noopener">Amplify Partners</a>, as well as Anna and Greg Brockman, Blake Byers, Fred Ehrsam, Julia and Kevin Hartz, Will Gaybrick, David Frankel, R.
