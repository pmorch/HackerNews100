      <article>
        <h2>15 Years of Progress</h2>

        <p>
          Look at the two implementations above. The code is roughly the same length. They do exactly the same thing. One was written with a framework from 2010, the other with a framework that's had countless developer hours and a massive ecosystem behind it for over a decade.
        </p>

        <p>The interesting part is <b>not</b> how much better React is—it's how little progress we've actually made.</p>

        <h3>The Illusion of Simplicity</h3>

        <p>
          React <em>looks</em> cleaner. It reads better at first glance. But that readability comes at a cost: you're trading explicit simplicity for abstraction complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Backbone code is brutally honest about what it's doing. An event fires, a handler runs, you build some HTML, you put it in the DOM. It's verbose, sure, but there's no mystery. A junior developer can trace exactly what happens and when. The mental model is straightforward: "when this happens, do this."
        </p>

        <p>
          The React code hides a lot. And once you move past simple examples, you hit problems that don't make sense until you understand React's internals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your input mysteriously clears itself. Turns out you switched a list item's key from a stable ID to an index, so React thinks it's a completely different component and remounts it, wiping state. Or maybe you forgot that <code>value</code> can't be <code>undefined</code>—React saw it flip from uncontrolled to controlled and reset the input.
        </p>

        <p>
          You add a <code>useEffect</code> to fetch data, and suddenly your app is stuck in an infinite loop. The dependency array includes an object that gets recreated every render, so React thinks it changed and runs the effect again. Now you need <code>useMemo</code> and <code>useCallback</code> sprinkled everywhere to "stabilize identities," which is a thing you never had to think about before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your click handler sees old state even though you just set it. That's a stale closure—the function captured the value from when it was created, and later renders don't magically update it. You either need to put the state in the dependency array (creating a new handler every time) or use functional updates like <code>setState(x =&gt; x + 1)</code>. Both solutions feel like workarounds.
        </p>

        <h3>Magic Has a High Price</h3>

        <p>
          These aren't edge cases. They're normal problems you hit building moderately complex apps. And debugging them requires understanding reconciliation algorithms, render phases, and how React's scheduler batches updates. Your code "just works" without you needing to understand why it works, which is nice until it breaks.
        </p>

        <p>
          People say <a href="https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/">"you need to rebuild React from scratch to really understand it,"</a> and they're right. But that's kind of damning, isn't it? You shouldn't need to understand virtual DOM diffing, scheduling priorities, and concurrent rendering to build a password validator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Backbone might be tedious, but it doesn't lie to you. jQuery is hackable. You can view source, understand it, and add to it easily. It's just DOM methods. React's abstraction layers make that much harder.
        </p>

        <h3>So, What's Next?</h3>

        <p>
          We understand the problem: <strong>event + state = UI</strong>. That's it. That's what both of these implementations are solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          For massive apps with 1,000 components on the same page, maybe React's complexity is justified. But what the other 99% of apps? What about small apps that just want to do a job and don't need all the magic?
        </p>

        <p>
          Is there a better model? Something feels as hard and steady as the DOM, but still feels intuitive to write? Something hackable like Backbone and jQuery were, where you can pop open devtools and understand what's happening?
        </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Post Body" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>As iOS 26 is being rolled out, our team noticed a particular change in how the operating system handles the shutdown.log file: it effectively erases crucial evidence of Pegasus and Predator spyware infections. This development poses a serious challenge for forensic investigators and individuals seeking to determine if their devices have been compromised at a time when spyware attacks are becoming more common.</p><h3><strong><br>The Power of the shutdown.log</strong></h3><p>For years, the shutdown.log file has been an invaluable, yet often overlooked, artifact in the detection of iOS malware. Located within the Sysdiagnoses in the Unified Logs section (specifically, Sysdiagnose Folder -&gt; system_logs.logarchive -&gt; Extra -&gt; shutdown.log), it has served as a silent witness to the activities occurring on an iOS device, even during its shutdown sequence.</p><p>In 2021, the <!--$--><a href="https://securelist.com/shutdown-log-lightweight-ios-malware-detection-method/111734/" rel="noopener">publicly known version</a><!--/$--> of Pegasus spyware was found to leave discernible traces within this shutdown.log. These traces provided a critical indicator of compromise, allowing security researchers to identify infected devices. However, the developers behind Pegasus, NSO Group, are constantly refining their techniques, and by 2022 Pegasus had evolved.</p><h3><strong><br>Pegasus's Evolving Evasion Tactics</strong></h3><p>While still leaving evidence in the shutdown.log, their methods became more sophisticated. Instead of leaving obvious entries, they began to completely wipe the shutdown.log file. Yet, even with this attempted erasure, their own processes still left behind subtle traces. This meant that even a seemingly clean shutdown.log that began with evidence of a Pegasus sample was, in itself, an indicator of compromise. Multiple cases of this behavior were observed until the end of 2022, highlighting the continuous adaptation of these malicious actors.</p><p>Following this period, it is believed that Pegasus developers implemented even more robust wiping mechanisms, likely monitoring device shutdown to ensure a thorough eradication of their presence from the shutdown.log. Researchers have noted instances where devices known to be active had their shutdown.log cleared, alongside other IOCs for Pegasus infections. This led to the conclusion that a cleared shutdown.log could serve as a good heuristic for identifying suspicious devices.</p><h3><strong><br>Predator's Similar Footprint</strong></h3><p>The sophisticated Predator spyware, observed in 2023, also appears to have learned from the past. Given that Predator was actively monitoring the shutdown.log, and considering the similar behavior seen in earlier Pegasus samples, it is highly probable that Predator, too, left traces within this critical log file.</p><h3><strong><br>iOS 26: An Unintended Cleanse</strong></h3><p><img alt="" width="960" height="612" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?width=1920&amp;height=1224" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1920&amp;height=1224 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1920&amp;height=1224 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?width=1920&amp;height=1224 1920w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"></p><p>With iOS 26 Apple introduced a change—either an intentional design decision or an unforeseen bug—that causes the shutdown.log to be overwritten on every device reboot instead of appended with a new entry every time, preserving each as its own snapshot. This means that any user who updates to iOS 26 and subsequently restarts their device will inadvertently erase all evidence of older Pegasus and Predator detections that might have been present in their shutdown.log.</p><p>This automatic overwriting, while potentially intended for system hygiene or performance, effectively sanitizes the very forensic artifact that has been instrumental in identifying these sophisticated threats. It could hardly come at a worse time - spyware attacks have been a constant in the news and recent headlines show that high-power executives and celebrities, not just civil society, are being targeted.</p><h3><strong><br>Identifying Pegasus 2022: A Specific IOC</strong></h3><p>For those still on iOS versions prior to 26, a specific IOC for Pegasus 2022 infections involved the presence of a /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/com.apple.WebKit.Networking entry within the shutdown.log. This particular IOC also revealed a significant shift in NSO Group's tactics: they began using normal system process names instead of easily identifiable, similarly named processes, making detection more challenging.</p><p><img alt="An image of a shutdown.log file" width="960" height="287" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?width=1920&amp;height=574" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1920&amp;height=574 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1920&amp;height=574 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?width=1920&amp;height=574 1920w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"></p><h3><strong><br>Correlating Logs for Deeper Insight (&lt; iOS 18)</strong></h3><p>For devices running iOS 18 or earlier, a more comprehensive approach to detection involved correlating containermanagerd log entries with shutdown.log events. Containermanagerd logs contain boot events and can retain data for several weeks. By comparing these boot events with shutdown.log entries, investigators could identify discrepancies. For example, if numerous boot events were observed before shutdown.log entries, it suggested that something was amiss and potentially being hidden.</p><h3><strong><br>Before You Update</strong></h3><p>Given the implications of iOS 26's shutdown.log handling, it is crucial for users to take proactive steps:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Before updating to iOS 26, immediately take and save a sysdiagnose of your device.</strong> This will preserve your current shutdown.log and any potential evidence it may contain.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Consider holding off on updating to iOS 26</strong> until Apple addresses this issue, ideally by releasing a bug fix that prevents the overwriting of the shutdown.log on boot.</p></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

            <link>https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/</link>
            <guid>45700911</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 02:24:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/">https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45700911">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>What makes an effective principal engineer or scientist? Here, I’ve distilled what I’ve observed from role models and quoted some of their advice below. While my perspective is naturally Amazon-centric, these ideas should also apply to most principal tech IC roles. As always, use your best judgment and assess if this advice applies to you and your situation.</p>

<p>• • •</p>

<p><strong>1. Different principals will have different flavors.</strong> Some dive deep in one space while others excel at horizontal influence. Some are technical trailblazers who show how things are done, while others clarify complexity and illuminate the path forward. Still others are masters at aligning multiple orgs towards a common vision. No one flavor is more important than the other, and you need to find the flavor that plays to your strengths.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Amazon very specifically says they want their principals hands on. Any principal who’s not being hands-on for an extended period of time (okay in short bursts) is likely setting themselves up for failure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. The work that was core, and made you successful in your previous role, is now the side task.</strong> At this level, writing the code yourself may not be the best use of your time. While you should still be writing code (to stay connected to the work), your core role is now technical vision, design feedback, sponsorship, providing business, product, and technical context, finding new problems, connecting the dots, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is a well-known saying for L7+ roles. It is not saying that you should spend less time coding, but that even if you are still coding 80% of the time, the most impactful part of your role is how to make everyone more effective. The mindset shifts from focusing solely on coding for a single project or perfecting on your own to influencing how all builders can build better across projects. This can be through contributing high-quality code to the repository and letting the code speak for itself, but also through other efforts—arguably more effective—such as giving feedback on  design proposals, writing technical guidance, and driving the long-term vision.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. You’re kind of a part-time PM for technology.</strong> Scratch that, you’re part-time everything: product, design, engineering, science, quality assurance, hiring, finance, culture, etc. Nothing is not your job. The high judgment you have allows you to step out of your wheelhouse.</p>

<p><strong>4. Your role will involve more communication, influence, and connecting the right people.</strong> Your projects will typically be larger in scope, involving teams across directors and even VPs. These projects won’t succeed without effective alignment and collaboration, and you’ll want to be careful not to ship your org chart to customers.</p>

<p><strong>5. Being right is less than half the battle.</strong> You also have to convince others that you’re right, and more importantly, convince them to care enough to act on it. This means figuring out how to build momentum, who can sponsor the idea, and how to get it over the finish line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes it also means starting the project and showing value to gain these things. Principals should lead by example and we want people to be proactive in solving issues and not wait for committee.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I would almost say that principals are the committee, so who are you waiting for :)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>6. A big part of the work is teaching the org to value something it doesn’t care about.</strong> Your audience will range from executives to working-level ICs. This is some of the hardest work you can do, and it fails often, but as someone who has an eye on the future and broader  view, you should still do it. A mentor shared that for every 10 docs he pitched, probably three would get acted on, and he considered that a great outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Compared to ICs who shoulder more of the day-to-day, team-level, and immediate deliverables, L7+ roles have more space to step back and take a broader, longer-term view of the company. It allows them to evaluate impact more objectively, and contributing at that level is where they add the most value—connecting to #7 below, those are the things that won’t happen without them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>7. There’s a category of work that just won’t happen without you.</strong> It’s usually at the intersection of what you really care about and what you’re exceptional at. It could be building a quick prototype and socializing a new customer experience with leadership, building bridges across orgs or other practitioners in industry, or crafting the three-year vision. Focus on this category of work. Also, it’ll get deeper and narrower over the span of your career.</p>

<p><strong>8. Sometimes, the most valuable thing you can do is not even to do the work but to connect the dots.</strong> This includes connecting teams who’re looking to do the work to teams who’ve done the work that they can reuse or learn from. It also includes identifying someone suitable who can do the work and grow along the way.</p>

<p><strong>9. You can only do so much yourself.</strong> You’ll be more useful to the org spending part of the time coaching and mentoring others to be more effective. Perhaps set aside a few hours each week, such as office hours or regular syncs with folks you’re grooming. Identify one or two ICs you’d like to groom and set goals for yourself on how you’ll help them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Scaling through others is the key point here. I like to think the success of a PE is when the org is able to make the same decisions as the PE would. Then the PE moves on to other ambiguous problems and set the culture to achieve the right outcomes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“While you will want to help everyone, however you have to focus your energy on building others who can take your place long term. Not everyone has that ability so you have to spend focused time on those that you see demonstrating the potential to take over from you and they can in turn help others that show less potential at the moment and enable them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>10. Transition from involving others in the work to making the work theirs.</strong> Make it an opportunity for someone to do the work that got you to where you are. Support and set them up for success. Don’t worry, there’s a never-ending backlog of important problems and interesting opportunities to work on for customers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I tell folks that they should spend 1-2 hours a week with someone to scale them to achieve 40 hours of work under your insights. This is what the true Principal scale is of being able to find those small things that enable a Sr SDE to be even better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>11. When you give others the work, it is now theirs.</strong> You can provide context and guidance, but ultimately, the direction is theirs to set. This includes letting them take an approach you wouldn’t take. If it goes poorly, we all get to learn from it; if it goes well, you get to learn something from it. Nonetheless, you should step in if the project is walking through a high-risk, one-way door that could backfire.</p>

<p><strong>12. Create space for others in meetings.</strong> Sometimes, the room looks to the most senior person for their opinion or decision; you can create space for others by asking questions instead. Also, if you see someone who’s not participating, gently pull them in on topics that play to their strengths. And if the meeting forgot someone who should have been in the discussion, add them to the next occurrence.</p>

<p><strong>13. You don’t always have to demonstrate value.</strong> Some of the most effective principals I’ve worked with go through an entire meeting silent, or barely leave comments during document reviews. If the team and discussion are going fine as it is, that’s great! It means you can take a step back from the workstream and focus your energies elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be careful on the other side of this: If you’re present and staying silent, you have some implicit approval. Beware of multi-tasking and what your presence means.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>14. In meetings with execs, it’s okay not to address every topic on the agenda.</strong> If they’re engaged in the topic, ask meaningful questions, and make the decisions or unblock the obstacles that only they can, that’s a good meeting.</p>

<p><strong>15. Beware: If you work in a breadth role, your entire week can be filled with everything that comes at you.</strong> This includes reviews, escalations, emails, help needed, etc. This can become a bigger issue the longer you stay at an org, where you become the “go-to” person because you know so much or have earned that credibility. As a result, you’re now a “mandatory” attendee at every meeting. Learn to push back and guard your time, or else you’ll have no time to push for the ideas you really care about. You don’t need to be in every meeting or have an opinion on every idea, just the key ones that matter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One thing that a mentor shared with me is that you need time to think. If you are going from meeting to meeting, you can’t process things and can’t look ahead. You need to schedule quality thinking time and disconnect from meetings to really find that next big thing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You need to look to delegate—set someone else up to be that person so that you can free up your time. This gives you benefits in freeing you up, but also helps put aside scope for someone new to help them grow.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>16. If you can’t explain why what you’re working on needs a principal, you might be working on the wrong thing.</strong> (This may also apply to L6s.)</p>

<p><strong>17. Because of your position, you can sometimes improve outcomes with relatively low effort.</strong> The title grants you organizational privilege, and thus greater access to relationships and context. Combined with your experience, this allows you to see around corners better. Thus, you can meaningfully improve a project’s chances of success and outcomes by investing fairly little effort. This is high ROI, and when you spot such opportunities, act on them.</p>

<p><strong>18. The title comes with an aura of credibility even when you shouldn’t have it.</strong> Sometimes, people read more into your offhand comments than they should, especially if they don’t know you well. As a result, they may do a lot of work because of a casual comment you made. This can be a waste of time and effort. Thus, be clear on what you do know, what you don’t know, what you’re asking for, and what you’re simply commenting on.</p>

<p><strong>19. Don’t just say the “what”; also share the “why” you think so.</strong> This helps others make better decisions. It also reduces the chance that others say “Principal &lt;NAME&gt; said this and thus we should …” and parrot things you said without fully understanding why you said it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The kinds of problems that require L7 input usually involve decisions under significant uncertainty. What’s crucial—but also difficult—is articulating your mental model: How you arrive at a judgment without having all the information, and why certain pieces of knowledge are more important than other data points.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>20. Find mechanisms to stay in touch with teams.</strong> This can be design reviews, weekly demos, sitting nearby and keeping an ear out, team lunches, or casual hallway chats. This helps you keep a pulse on the org and where the key problems or opportunities are.</p>

<p><strong>21. Help teams keep sight of the bigger picture.</strong> When the working level is focused on the thick of things and day-to-day delivery, they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger, longer-term problems/opportunities and get stuck in the local optima. With the context that you have, you can help remind teams of this.</p>

<p><strong>22. Be pragmatic; balance seeing the big picture with accepting local solutions.</strong> Consult and listen to the working level on the details; they’re your on-the-ground experts.</p>

<p><strong>23. You’ll be asked for reviews or promo feedback on someone that you’ve only spent an hour or two with.</strong> It’s okay to decline instead of providing poor-quality feedback that’s based on a tiny sample of their entire behavior.</p>

<p><strong>24. Make time to interact with interns and their mentors.</strong> A few touch points during the internship can be transformative, including an early check-in (and course correction if necessary) and being there for demo day. Also, work with the mentors and interns towards deliverables that continue to be valuable beyond the internship, where others can extend the project. This includes product 1-pagers, working software, and technical documentation.</p>

<p><strong>25. To get to principal, you need to put yourself on the critical path. To be effective as a principal and go beyond it, you need to actively remove yourself from it.</strong> While you were previously the “go-to” person, you want to transition from essential to adjacent. The org should increasingly benefit from you, but shouldn’t be dependent on you to be effective. Think about how you can empower others to make the contributions you’re making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be careful about injecting yourself in critical path projects. Your focus is a lot more prone to being stolen by some other priority, so you need to keep yourself out of the critical path or be really stringent about locking down if you are in the critical path.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>26. If you were promoted to principal, it’s because you’ve been acting as a principal for a while.</strong> Typically, for more than a year. Thus, don’t worry about the increased expectation of the title. Just keep doing what you’re doing, engage with other principals, figure out your style, and work with your leadership to identify your focus areas.</p>

<p><strong>27. With great freedom comes great responsibility.</strong> You have the autonomy to choose what to work on, but there’s the expectation of accountability and impact. The freedom isn’t about doing what you want, but ownership of finding the highest leverage problems to solve. Don’t expect to be told what to do or be given any guidance. You’re expected to figure out what the org should focus on.</p>

<p><strong>28. Define and align your charter with your leadership.</strong> One way is to split your work into three buckets: (i) owner, (ii) sponsor, (iii) consultant. As a consultant, you’re involved in reviews and provide guidance, and have a high-level understanding of the system’s or product’s intent. As a sponsor, in addition to the above, you make the idea a priority for the org, work to build alignment and drive decisions, and engage with stakeholders. As an owner, it’s everything above, plus being the system expert and first point of contact, and having borderline obsession with the success of the design, execution, and impact. I tend to own 1 - 2 projects (&gt; 50% time), sponsor 2 - 3 projects (~20% time), and consult the rest of my time.</p>

<p><strong>29. Being a principal can be lonely.</strong> You’re part of all teams but also part of none. Build a network of peers with whom you can have open conversations. It likely doesn’t matter if you’re working in the same company or domain.</p>

<p><strong>30. Don’t neglect your own needs.</strong> Make time and space for projects that support your learning, growth, and wellbeing. While it can feel selfish in the short term, it’s far more preferable to you burning out on the org. If you’re actively looking for work that keeps you healthy and happy and growing, your org benefits too, and it’s easier for them to retain you. Work with your manager on how to balance this.</p>

<p><strong>31. Keep learning; our industry moves fast.</strong> If you take on projects that teach you nothing, or at least nothing relevant to your work, you’re moving backwards. This is sometimes inevitable—timebox such projects when they come along. Also, your learning doesn’t have to solely come from the job. I know PEs who find time to read papers and technical textbooks, and hack on prototypes over weekends to better understand new ideas and technology.</p>

              <p>The OSM dataset is huge, and keeps growing every day. Great news, of course, but sometimes the sheer volume can be overwhelming – there are just gobs and <em>gobs</em> of data!</p>
<p>Hence, we created GOB (“Geo-Object Bundle”), a new file format that makes tackling OSM data faster and easier. It’s a companion format to our now-familiar <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Geographic_Object_Library">Geo-Object Library</a> (essentially, a tightly-compressed GOL with its indexes stripped).</p>
<p>To support this new format, GOL Tool 2.1 has two new commands: <code>save</code> GOLs as GOBs and <code>load</code> GOBs into a GOL (Of course, like all of the GeoDesk Toolkit, the GOL Tool is free &amp; open-source).</p>
<div><a href="https://community-cdn.openstreetmap.org/uploads/default/original/3X/6/3/63cb08ad6b5f33578da3f529982ccd975caba949.jpeg" data-download-href="https://community-cdn.openstreetmap.org/uploads/default/63cb08ad6b5f33578da3f529982ccd975caba949" title="GOB Tiling &amp; Size Statistics"><img src="https://community-cdn.openstreetmap.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/3/63cb08ad6b5f33578da3f529982ccd975caba949_2_690x358.jpeg" alt="GOB Tiling &amp; Size Statistics" data-base62-sha1="eeOgB0dnd7f5NRTE9l9cGzuDQvL" width="690" height="358" srcset="https://community-cdn.openstreetmap.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/3/63cb08ad6b5f33578da3f529982ccd975caba949_2_690x358.jpeg, https://community-cdn.openstreetmap.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/3/63cb08ad6b5f33578da3f529982ccd975caba949_2_1035x537.jpeg 1.5x, https://community-cdn.openstreetmap.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/6/3/63cb08ad6b5f33578da3f529982ccd975caba949_2_1380x716.jpeg 2x" data-dominant-color="AFA6A4"></a></div>
<h2><a name="p-1172010-advantages-of-gob-1" href="#p-1172010-advantages-of-gob-1"></a>Advantages of GOB</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GOB files are on average half the size of a GOL, and <strong>30% smaller</strong> than <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format">PBFs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importing a GOB is <strong>5 times faster</strong> than building a GOL from a PBF. A modern system loads a planet-size GOB into a GOL in 3 minutes. The speed advantage grows more pronounced on memory-constrained machines: <code>gol build</code> starts paging heavily with less than 32 GB of RAM, whereas <code>gol load</code> requires minimal resources (even a decade-old laptop loads the whole planet in under an hour).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOBs are organized into tiles, so it’s easy to extract regional subsets (basically at file-copy speed) and stitch them back together; that makes GOB a convenient format for archiving and distributing geodata.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The image above shows some of the tiling structure, which mimics that of tile renderers. On the left, the smallest squares are zoom 6, the right shows the most granular level (zoom 12). A typical planet GOB has about 60,000 tiles.</em></p>
<p>Below are some size statistics for the planet file and popular regional extracts (without metadata):</p>
<pre><code>                PBF      GOL               GOB
Planet      65.4 GB  93.6 GB  +43.1%   46.0 GB  -29.7%
California  1.18 GB  1.59 GB  +35.0%    770 MB  -36.5%
France      4.54 GB  5.89 GB  +29.7%   2.84 GB  -36.3%
Germany     4.29 GB  5.92 GB  +38.0%   2.67 GB  -37.5%
Italy       1.96 GB  2.63 GB  +34.0%   1.34 GB  -31.6%
Japan       2.13 GB  2.91 GB  +36.1%   1.34 GB  -37.0%
Poland      1.84 GB  2.72 GB  +47.6%   1.29 GB  -29.7%
Switzerland  487 MB   634 MB  +30.1%    311 MB  -36.2%
</code></pre>
<p>Dense, well-mapped areas tend to compress best as GOB. Less complete regions are below average in terms of GOB’s size advantage (GOBs for Brazil and China are only 23% smaller).</p>
<h2><a name="p-1172010-limitations-2" href="#p-1172010-limitations-2"></a>Limitations</h2>
<p>Just like GOLs, GOBs don’t store:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>metadata (timestamp of last edit, changeset, username, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>history (each GOB is a snapshot of the OSM dataset)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is not intended for editing, but for archival and distribution.</p>
<h2><a name="p-1172010-how-to-work-with-gobs-3" href="#p-1172010-how-to-work-with-gobs-3"></a>How to work with GOBs</h2>
<p>You will need GOL Tool 2.1 or above (<a href="https://www.geodesk.com/download" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">download</a>).</p>
<p>To export a GOL as a GOB:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code>gol save &lt;gol-file&gt; [&lt;gob-file&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>&lt;gob-file&gt;</code> is omitted, it uses the same base name as the GOL. The <code>.gol</code> and <code>.gob</code> extensions are optional.</p>
<p>To limit the export to a specific area, use the <code>--area</code> (<code>-a</code>) option. You can specify a (multi)polygon as WKT, GeoJSON or simple coordinates (<code>lon,lat</code> pairs, rings are closed automatically), either directly or as a file. If no file extension is given, <code>.wkt</code> is assumed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code>gol save world bodensee -a 9.55,47.4,8.78,47.66,9.01,47.88,9.85,47.58,9.82,47.46 
</code></pre>
<p>exports the tiles covering the region around the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1156846">Bodensee</a> (Lake Constance).</p>
<p>To import tiles into a GOL:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code>gol load &lt;gol-file&gt; [&lt;gob-file&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>As with <code>save</code>, if <code>&lt;gob-file&gt;</code> is omitted, the base name of the GOL is used. If the GOL does not exist, it is created. To load just a specific region, restrict it with the <code>-a</code> option.</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code>gol load japan -a shikoku
</code></pre>
<p>loads tiles from <code>japan.gob</code> into <code>japan.gol</code> (creating it if it doesn’t yet exist), but only those intersecting the area defined in <code>shikoku.wkt</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="p-1172010-available-datasets-4" href="#p-1172010-available-datasets-4"></a>Available datasets</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openplanetdata.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Open Planet Data</a> publishes the full planet as a GOB (&lt; 50 GB, updated daily).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-1172010-whats-next-5" href="#p-1172010-whats-next-5"></a>What’s next</h2>
<p>This is still a work in progress, so the format may change. I’m experimenting with different compression algos beyond zlib to make it even tighter and faster (zstd didn’t yield any significant gains). I’m also in the process of enabling <code>gol load</code> to download a GOB directly from a URL and build the GOL in the background, which would bring the wall-clock import time to zero.</p>
<p>As always, questions/feedback are welcome! Please stop on by <a href="https://github.com/clarisma">on Github</a> and <a href="https://en.osm.town/@geodesk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">@geodesk@en.osm.town</a>.</p>

<p><em>New research offers a potential explanation for why some patients retain toxic metals long after undergoing an MRI.</em></p>
<p><em>Published in the journal Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the findings show that gadolinium contrast agents used in MRI scans may react with common dietary compounds to form harmful metal nanoparticles in the body. As detailed in an April 7 Newsweek report on the study, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected to sharpen MRI images and are typically excreted without causing harm. However, gadolinium particles have been found lingering in the brain, kidneys, blood, and urine years after exposure, and the US Food and Drug Administration links retained gadolinium to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).</em></p><!-- [Ad Widget Id: ai_ad_widget-9 | Sidebar: ad-orm-native] --><!-- end [Ad Widget Id: ai_ad_widget-9 | Sidebar: ad-orm-native] -->
<p><em>The study specifically identifies a chemical reaction between gadolinium and oxalic acid—a compound found naturally in foods and produced in the body after ingesting vitamin C—as a likely contributor, Newsweek reports. Lab tests showed oxalic acid caused gadolinium to separate from its chelating agent and form nanoparticles capable of infiltrating cells in various organs.</em></p>
<p><em>Lead author Dr Brent Wagner told Newsweek he personally avoids vitamin C when undergoing MRI with contrast, citing its potential to increase gadolinium reactivity. “Metabolic milieu,” including high oxalic acid levels, could explain why some individuals experience severe symptoms while others do not, he said.</em></p>
<p><em>According to the article, nearly half of the patients found to have gadolinium traces in the body had received the contrast agent only once, suggesting that individual biology—not dosage—may influence risk. Dr Wagner theorized that nanoparticle formation could trigger a disproportionate immune response, with affected cells sending distress signals that intensify the body’s reaction.</em></p>
<p><em>The research team is now building an international patient registry to further study gadolinium accumulation. According to the article, the registry will collect blood, urine, hair, and fingernail samples to help identify individuals at greatest risk and understand long-term retention patterns.</em></p>

      <p>Swift has matured significantly over the past decade — extending from cloud services to Windows applications, browser apps, and microcontrollers. Swift powers apps and services of all kinds, and thanks to its great interoperability, you can share code across platforms.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.swift.org/android-workgroup/">Android workgroup</a> is an open group, free for anyone to join, that aims to expand Swift to Android. Today, we are pleased to announce nightly preview releases of the <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/macos/#swift-sdk-buindles-dev">Swift SDK for Android</a>.</p>

<p>This milestone reflects months of effort by the Android workgroup, building on many years of grassroots community effort. With the SDK, developers can begin developing Android applications in Swift, opening new avenues for cross-platform development and accelerating innovation across the mobile ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Swift SDK for Android is available today, bundled with the <a href="https://www.swift.org/install/windows/">Windows installer</a> or downloadable separately for use on Linux or macOS.</p>



<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-android-getting-started.html">Getting Started guide</a> to help you set up your first native Swift code on an Android device. The <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-android-examples">Swift for Android Examples</a> help demonstrate end‑to‑end application workflows on Android.</p>

<p>With the Swift SDK for Android, you can now start porting your Swift packages to Android. <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/blog/adding-wasm-and-android-compatibility-testing">Over 25% of packages in the Swift Package Index</a> already build for Android, and <a href="https://www.swift.org/packages/showcase.html">the Community Showcase</a> now indicates Android compatibility.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-java">swift-java project</a> enables you to interoperate between Java and Swift. It is both a library and a code generator, enabling you to integrate Swift and Java in both directions by automatically generating safe and performant bindings. To learn about generating bindings to bring your business logic to Android, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IQAA7Nl8E&amp;t=982s">recent Swift Server Side meetup talk</a> by Mads Odgaard.</p>



<p>This preview release opens many new opportunities to continue improving these tools. We encourage you to share your experiences, ideas, tools and apps on the <a href="https://forums.swift.org/">Swift forums</a>. This post has been published on an <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-swift-sdk-for-android/82845">associated thread</a> for discussion, and new posts can be shared in the <a href="https://forums.swift.org/c/platform/android/115">Android category</a>.</p>

<p>The Android workgroup is drafting <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/pull/2946">a vision document</a>, currently under review, for directing future work regarding Swift on Android. This vision will outline priority areas and guide community efforts to maximize impact across the ecosystem. In addition, we maintain a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/swiftlang/projects/17">project board</a> that tracks the status of major efforts, as well as <a href="https://ci.swift.org/job/oss-swift-package-swift-sdk-for-android/">official CI for the Swift SDK for Android</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re as excited as we are, join us and help make this ecosystem even better!</p>

In fact, there are some leaders in the home electrification industry who believe the name itself is one of the barriers to adoption. It’s one of many ways that </span><span><b>the heat pump is misunderstood</b></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Think of a heat pump as a “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cpNebGqGBk&amp;t=3474s&amp;utm_source=www.heatpumped.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=harnessing-america-s-heat-pump-moment" target="_blank">2-way AC</a><span>.” An air conditioner cools your home by pulling heat from inside an enclosed space and transferring it outside. Your refrigerator works the same way.</span></p><p><span>A heat pump does the same thing, but can also </span><span><b>reverse the process to bring heat </b></span><span><i><b>into</b></i></span><span><b> the home</b></span><span>. It uses a few key components to make this happen:</span></p><div><ul><li><p><span><b>The fan</b></span><span> pulls air across the system’s coils to help move heat in or out of the space.</span></p></li><li><p><span><b>The evaporator coil</b></span><span> absorbs heat from the air inside your home (in cooling mode) or from the outside air (in heating mode).</span></p></li><li><p><span><b>The compressor</b></span><span> pressurizes and moves a fluid called refrigerant through the system, enabling the heat transfer process.</span></p></li><li><p><span><b>The refrigerant</b></span><span> is the working fluid that captures and carries heat from one place to another—either out of your home or into it.</span></p></li></ul></div><p><span>What’s important to understand is that </span><span><b>a heat pump does not </b></span><span><i><b>create</b></i></span><span><b> heat</b></span><span>. It also doesn’t create cold (cold is the absence of heat, just like darkness is the absence of light). A heat pump simply </span><span><i>transfers </i></span><span>– pumps! – heat from one place to another.</span></p><div><p>“The difference between a heat pump and a one-way AC is just one valve. It still works perfectly fine as an air conditioner—there’s no difference. That’s why we’ve started calling them “two-way ACs” as an education tool. It helps people compare a two-way AC, which has a reverse gear, with a one-way AC—which, in my mind, is basically broken.”</p></div><p><span><b>But what about in the winter when it’s below freezing?</b></span><span> In any environment where the temperature is above absolute zero (remember </span><a href="https://nationalmaglab.org/about-the-maglab/around-the-lab/maglab-dictionary/kelvin-temperature-scale/?utm_source=www.heatpumped.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=harnessing-america-s-heat-pump-moment" target="_blank">the Kelvin scale</a><span>?) there is still a significant amount of heat in the air in the form of thermal energy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That’s why a heat pump can still heat your home even on the coldest day of the year.</span></p><div id="da7ed52e-37ae-4fe9-80e4-ef859564db27"><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/iQaycSD5GWE" width="100%"></iframe></p></div><p id="why-heat-pumps-matter"><h2><span><b>Why Heat Pumps Matter&nbsp;</b></span></h2></p><p><span>The fact that heat pumps simply transfer heat—and do not create it—gives them the potential to heat homes without doing the thing that humans have done since time immemorial to keep warm: </span><span><b>burn stuff</b></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/home-electrification-heat-pumps-gas-furnace/?utm_source=www.heatpumped.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=harnessing-america-s-heat-pump-moment" target="_blank">over half of all homes still rely on burning fossil fuels for heat</a><span>.

His account sheds light on the FBI’s attempts to map out some organized Antifa superstructure — and in doing so, undermining Americans’ freedom of speech and political expression.</span></p><p>Special-needs teacher Miles Serafini, 26, was watching a movie with his roommate when the FBI knocked on his door in suburban Tucson, Arizona last Friday. Two special agents greeted him, introducing themselves only as “James” and “Keith.” They didn’t offer their own last names, but they knew Miles’ — as well as his home address, his social media handles, what car he owns, and, unbeknownst to him, his political activities.</p><p>“We came out here to ask you questions regarding a protest that happened on the the 11th of June,” one of the agents said in an exchange captured on a Ring camera and provided to me by Serafini. “We’ve been just basically going around asking questions for a few people … and your name was brought up.”</p><p>The suggestion that his name “was brought up,” puzzled Serafini, who told me he didn’t know anyone at the protest, which he’d learned about from a post on social media. When he asked the agents how they knew who he was, they wouldn’t say — though one agent, Serafini said, later told him that they knew “way more about me than I’d think.”</p><p>The exact scale of these FBI questionings is unclear, but I’ve heard similar accounts involving protesters in Portland and Chicago. (The FBI declined to comment on Serafini’s account, citing the government shutdown.)</p><p>Serafini attended an anti-ICE protest around an ICE facility in June so he could express his opposition to the deportations, he told me. </p><p>“ICE is impacting our community and people aren’t happy,” Serafini said. “People see people around them being kidnapped and shipped away in cages and they show up to protest — It’s as easy as that.”</p><p><span>The protest involved an estimated 300 people gathering near the ICE field office at East Valencia Road and South Country Club Road in Tucson on June 11. The demonstration started off peacefully but later became rowdy. As the crowd gathered at the ICE office, a smaller group of protesters began </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skcpyzdeoxQ" rel="">throwing objects</a><span> — rocks, paint-balls, fireworks and smoke devices — at what appeared to be  security guards stationed outside the building. The guards responded with crowd-control munitions.</span></p><p>Windows of the ICE facility and adjacent buildings were broken and spray-painted with graffiti. A number of businesses nearby boarded up or posted signs distancing themselves from ICE operations. Tucson Police later announced that three people were taken into custody for charges including unlawful assembly, resisting arrest, obstructing a public thoroughfare and disorderly conduct — and said that their investigation could lead to more arrests.</p><p><span>Serafini said he didn’t engage in any violence and hasn’t been detained or charged with any crime. But last month’s </span><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/trumps-nspm-7-labels-common-beliefs" rel="">presidential directive NSPM-7</a><span> authorizes federal law enforcement to treat “extremism on migration” as an indicator of terrorism. </span></p><p><span>Under the domestic counter-terrorism cases of the Trump administration, no crime needs to be actually committed for authorities to open an investigation. In fact, NSPM-7 explicitly calls for a preemptive approach where law enforcement intervene in things “before they result in violent political acts.” Attorney General Pam Bondi cited NSPM-7 in her own </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1415691/dl" rel="">directive</a><span>, ordering the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies to crack down on anti-ICE “terrorism,” citing protests in front of ICE facilities specifically.</span></p><p>After 9/11, as the FBI reoriented itself to fighting terror groups like al Qaeda, they focused on identifying and locating individuals and then mapping out their networks of family, friends and associates. That’s the Trump administration approach to Antifa, imagining an organization network that encompasses everything from membership cards to elaborate funding.</p><p>This approach was evident to Serafini, who told me: “I could tell by their questioning that they were trying to figure out the shadowy entity behind the protest.”</p><p>He added: “What a waste of their time to go after shit that doesn’t exist.”</p><p>The FBI seemed more interested in who was behind the protest than the protest itself, with the agents repeatedly asking about who had produced the protest signs, he explained.</p><p>“They wanted to know where they were from and who supplied them,” Serafini said. “Nothing about what was actually on them.”</p><p>The signage has become a point of interest to the Trump administration. At a roundtable event on Antifa earlier this month, President Trump pointed to the quality of the signs as evidence that the protests must be funded by unseen benefactors. </p><p>Per Trump: </p><blockquote><p><span> </span><em>“When you see the signs, and they’re all made out of a beautiful, beautiful paper. Beautiful, nice, stiff, very expensive paper with beautiful wood handles all the same. All the same color. They come from very expensive printing machines. These are are people that write out their signs in a basement, that believe in something. These are paid anarchists.”</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed the same sentiment recently. </p><p>“That’s one of the things about Antifa," Bondi said on Fox News earlier this month. “You’re seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match — pre-bought, pre-put together — they’re organized and someone is funding it.”</p><p>The administration is convinced that these protests aren’t spontaneous, and because of NSPM-7, the FBI has to prioritize collecting intelligence to show that. Serafini said that a particular focus of the FBI agents was whether the violence at the protest had been premeditated; and he when he told them it all seemed spontaneous, they implied he was lying.</p><p>Per Serafini:</p><blockquote><p><em>“They asked me if the violence (rocks, paint balloons) seemed spontaneous or premeditated. I told them it seemed spontaneous once the ICE agents escalated. They brought up that some protestors showed up with riot shields, so they questioned why they would bring shields if violence wasn’t premeditated. And they kept drilling me on the fact that I showed up alone, [that I didn’t] remember where I saw the flyer, and didn’t know anybody there. They told me that’s unusual and pretty suspicious — as if I was holding back information about whoever organized the protest. They kept insinuating that I was lying to them.”</em></p><p><em>“They showed me photos of several protestors … and tried to get information on them. They said ICE officers were badly injured and that these were the real suspects they needed info on. I told them I had no idea who they were. They seemed frustrated by that, but it’s the truth.”</em></p></blockquote><p>According to Serafini, the two FBI agents showed him photos of himself at the protest as well as several other protesters — people he knew nothing about. The agents asked him for his cell phone, but he refused. The questioning lasted about an hour. Serafini said they left him with a chilling message: that they couldn’t guarantee this would be the last time they saw him.</p><p>The agents may not have learned anything from Serafini, but the visit — which took place one day before the No Kings protest — did accomplish one thing: Serafini decided against going to No Kings. He was spooked.</p><p>That is exactly the chilling effect on speech that the FBI investigating political matters risks creating. </p><p>“Worked on me,” he said.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/video-fbi-agents-visit-anti-ice-protester?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>— </span><em>Edited by William M.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The Smith chart from electrical engineering is the image of a Cartesian grid under the function</p>
<p><em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) = (<em>z</em> − 1)/(<em>z</em> + 1).</p>
<p>More specifically, it’s the image of a grid in the right half-plane.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smith_chart.png" alt="Smith chart"></p>
<p>This post will derive the basic mathematical properties of this graph but will not go into the applications. Said another way, I’ll explain how to&nbsp;<em>make</em> a Smith chart, not how to&nbsp;<em>use</em> one.</p>
<p>We will use&nbsp;<em>z</em> to denote points in the right half-plane and&nbsp;<em>w</em> to denote the image of these points under&nbsp;<em>f</em>. We will speak of lines in the&nbsp;<em>z</em> plane and the circles they correspond to in the&nbsp;<em>w</em> plane.</p>
<h2>Möbius transformations</h2>
<p>Our function&nbsp;<em>f</em> is a special case of a Möbius transformation. There is a theorem that says Möbius transformation map generalized circles to generalized circles. Here a generalized circle means a circle or a line; you can think of a line as a circle with infinite radius. We’re going to get a lot of mileage out of that theorem.</p>
<h2>Image of the imaginary axis</h2>
<p>The function <em>f</em>&nbsp;maps the imaginary axis in the <em>z</em> plane to the unit circle in the <em>w</em> plane. We can prove this using the theorem above. The imaginary axis is a line, so it’s image is either a line or a circle. We can take three points on the imaginary axis in the <em>z</em> plane and see where they go.</p>
<p>When we pick <em>z</em> equal to 0,&nbsp;<em>i</em>, and&nbsp;−<em>i</em> from the imaginary axis we get <em>w</em> values of −1, <em>i</em>, and −<em>i</em>. These three&nbsp;<em>w</em> values do not&nbsp;line on a line, so the image of the imaginary axis must be a circle. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/06/18/circle-through-three-points/">three points uniquely determine a circle</a>, so the image of the imaginary axis is the circle containing −1, <em>i</em>, and −<em>i</em>, i.e. the unit circle.</p>
<h2>Image of the right half-plane</h2>
<p>The imaginary axis is the boundary of the right half-plane. Since it is mapped to the unit circle, the right half-plane is either mapped to the interior of the unit circle or the exterior of the unit circle. The point&nbsp;<em>z</em> = 1 goes to&nbsp;<em>w</em> = 0, and so&nbsp;the right half-plane is mapped inside the unit circle.</p>
<h2>Images of vertical lines</h2>
<p>Let’s think about what happens to vertical lines in the <em>z</em> plane, lines with constant positive real part. The images of these lines in the <em>w</em> plane must be either lines or circles. And since the right-half plane gets mapped inside the unit circle, these lines must get mapped to circles.</p>
<p>We can say a little more. All lines contain the point ∞, and <em>f</em>(∞) = 1, so the image of every vertical line in the&nbsp;<em>z</em> plane is a circle in the&nbsp;<em>w</em> plane, inside the unit circle and tangent to the unit circle at <em>w</em> = 1. (Tossing around ∞ is a bit informal, but it’s easy to make rigorous.)</p>
<p>The vertical lines in the&nbsp;<em>z</em> plane</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smithchart0.png" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p>map to tangent circles in the&nbsp;<em>w</em> plane.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smithchart1.png" width="480" height="360"></p>
<h2>Images of horizontal lines</h2>
<p>Next, let’s think about horizontal lines in the <em>z</em> plane, lines with constant imaginary part. The image of these lines is either a line or a circle. Which is it? The image of a line is a line if it contains ∞, otherwise it’s a circle. Now <em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) = ∞ if and only if&nbsp;<em>z</em> = −1, and so the image of the real axis is a line, but the image of every other horizontal line is a circle.</p>
<p>Since <em>f</em>(∞) = 1, the image of every horizontal line passes through 1, just as the images of all the vertical lines passes through 1.</p>
<p>Since horizontal lines extend past the right half-plane, the image circles extend past the unit circle. The part of the line with positive real part gets mapped inside the unit circle, and the part of the line with negative real part gets mapped outside the unit circle. In particular, the image of the positive real axis is the interval [−1, 1].</p>
<p>Möbius transformations are conformal maps, and so they preserve angles of intersection. Since horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines, the circles that are the images of the horizontal lines meet the circles that are the images of vertical lines at right angles.</p>
<p>The horizontal rays in the <em>z</em> plane</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smithchart2.png" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p>become partial circles in the <em>w</em> plane.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smithchart3.png" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p>If we were to look at horizontal <em>lines</em> rather than rays, i.e. if we extended the lines into the left half-plane, the images in the <em>w</em> plane would be full circles.</p>
<p>Now let’s put our images together. The grid</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smithchart4.png" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p>in the <em>z</em> plane becomes the following in the <em>w</em> plane.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/smithchart5.png" width="480" height="360"></p>
<p>An evenly spaced grid in the <em>z</em> plane becomes a very unevenly spaced graph in the&nbsp;<em>w</em> plane. Things are crowded on the right hand side and sparse on the left. A useable Smith chart needs to be roughly evenly filled in, which means it has to be the image of an unevenly filled in grid in the <em>z</em> plane. For example, you’d need more vertical lines in the <em>z</em> plane with small real values than with large real values.</p>

        </p>

        <p>What’s going on, Internet? To the outrage of the Firefox community across the web, Mozilla has started rolling out AI across our beloved browser and has enabled the features by default.</p>
        <p>I’ve found the new Firefox “AI” features, like the pop-ups that appear when highlighting text, to be more distracting than useful. The sidebar chat isn’t something I need either; if I want that experience, I’ll just open ChatGPT in a containerised tab.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to turn these features off, open <code>about:config</code> in the Firefox address bar, search for <code>browser.ml.enable</code>, set it to false, and that should disable everything.</p>
        <p>If you’d rather try some features while disabling others, keep <code>browser.ml.enable</code> set to true and toggle each feature individually.</p>
        <p>I’m giving Smart Tab Groups a try for now, as I’m curious to see how the “AI” handles organising my dozens of open tabs. I’ll let you know how that goes.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of the “AI” features you can disable in <code>about:config</code>, along with a short explanation of what I understand each one does. Enjoy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lot of people say AI will make us all “managers” or “editors”…but I think this is a dangerously incomplete view!</p>

<p>Personally, I’m trying to <strong>code like a surgeon.</strong></p>

<p>A surgeon isn’t a manager, they do the actual work! But their skills and time are highly leveraged with a support team that handles prep, secondary tasks, admin. The surgeon focuses on the important stuff they are uniquely good at.</p>

<p>My current goal with AI coding tools is to spend 100% of my time doing stuff that matters. (As a UI prototyper, that mostly means tinkering with design concepts.)</p>

<p>It turns out there are a LOT of secondary tasks which AI agents are now good enough to help out with. Some things I’m finding useful to hand off these days:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before attempting a big task, write a guide to relevant areas of the codebase</li>
<li>Spike out an attempt at a big change. Often I won’t use the result but I’ll review it as a sketch of where to go</li>
<li>Fix typescript errors or bugs which have a clear specification</li>
<li>Write documentation about what I’m building</li>
</ul>

<p>I often find it useful to run these secondary tasks async in the background – while I’m eating lunch, or even literally overnight!</p>

<p>When I sit down for a work session, I want to feel like a surgeon walking into a prepped operating room. Everything is ready for me to do what I’m good at.</p>

<h2 id="mind-the-autonomy-slider">Mind the autonomy slider</h2>

<p>Notably, there is a <em>huge</em> difference between how I use AI for primary vs secondary tasks.</p>

<p>For the core design prototyping work, I still do a lot of coding by hand, and when I do use AI, I’m more careful and in the details. I need fast feedback loops and good visibility. (eg, I like Cursor tab-complete here)</p>

<p>Whereas for secondary tasks, I’m much much looser with it, happy to let an agent churn for hours in the background. The ability to get the job done eventually is the most important thing; speed and visibility matter less. Claude Code has been my go-to for long unsupervised sessions but Codex CLI is becoming a strong contender there too, possibly my new favorite.</p>

<p>These are <em>very</em> different work patterns! Reminds me of Andrej Karpathy’s <a href="https://www.latent.space/p/s3">“autonomy slider”</a> concept. <strong>It’s dangerous to conflate different parts of the autonomy spectrum</strong> – the tools and mindset that are needed vary quite a lot.</p>

<p>The “software surgeon” concept is a very old idea – Fred Brooks attributes it to Harlan Mills in his 1975 classic “The Mythical Man-Month”. He <a href="https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1484.php#:~:text=Mills%20proposes%20that%20each%20segment%20of%20a%20large%20job%20be%20tackled%20by%20a%20team%2C%20but%20that%20the%20team%20be%20organized%20like%20a%20surgical%20team%20rather%20than%20a%20hog%2Dbutchering%20team.">talks about</a> a “chief programmer” who is supported by various staff including a “copilot” and various administrators. Of course, at the time, the idea was to have humans be in these support roles.</p>

<p>OK, so there is a super obvious angle here, that “AI has now made this approach economically viable where it wasn’t before”, yes yes… but <strong>I am also noticing a more subtle thing at play, something to do with status hierarchies.</strong></p>

<p>A lot of the “secondary” tasks are “grunt work”, not the most intellectually fulfilling or creative part of the work. I have a strong preference for teams where everyone shares the grunt work; I hate the idea of giving all the grunt work to some lower-status members of the team. Yes, junior members will often have more grunt work, but they should also be given many interesting tasks to help them grow.</p>

<p>With AI this concern completely disappears! <strong>Now I can happily delegate pure grunt work.</strong> And the 24/7 availability is a big deal. I would never call a human intern at 11pm and tell them to have a research report on some code ready by 7am… but here I am, commanding my agent to do just that!</p>

<h2 id="notion-is-for-surgeons">Notion is for surgeons?</h2>

<p>Finally I’ll mention a couple thoughts on how this approach to work intersects with my employer, <a href="https://notion.com/">Notion</a>.</p>

<p>First, as an employee, I find it incredibly valuable right now to work at a place that is bullish on AI coding tools. Having support for heavy use of AI coding tools, and a codebase that’s well setup for it, is enabling serious productivity gains for me – <em>especially</em> as a newcomer to a big codebase.</p>

<p>Secondly, as a product – in a sense I would say we are trying to bring this way of working to a broader group of knowledge workers beyond programmers. When I think about how that will play out, I like the mental model of enabling everyone to “work like a surgeon”.</p>

<p>The goal isn’t to delegate your core work, it’s to <strong>identify and delegate the secondary grunt work tasks, so you can focus on the main thing that matters.</strong></p>

  <p>
    <time datetime="2025-06-01 00:00:00 +0200">2025-06-01</time>
  </p>

  

  <p>I was recently flying between HKG &amp; LHR via British Airways. I’d done the same flight back in 2023, and remember relying on the in-flight entertainment for the 14 hour journey. However, this time on my way to London, they had an interesting offer: Free WiFi for “Messaging”, for members of “The British Airways Club”.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure I wasn’t a member of any sort of club (I’m only flying economy anyway); but turns out this is just the name of their frequent flyer program. Conveniently enough, you’re able to sign up for this via the captive portal while in the sky; and although it asks for your E-Mail you don’t need to verify it (thereby allowing you to complete the signup without access to the internet).</p>

<p>Once signed in, the captive portal invited me to “Start session”, which true to it’s word, let me start texting people. I tried Whatsapp, Signal, Wechat and Discord. The first three worked (though not for images), Discord expectedly did not. Not bad for free wifi!</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-know">How does it know?</h2>

<p>This was the first question I had as soon as I confirmed messaging did work. It’s 2025; everything should be encrypted in transit. So how does it know if I’m using Whatsapp vs. Discord? One idea I had is it just somehow capped the bandwidth / data transfer of individual TCP connections; so when you’re sending a single message or two it gets through, but something larger would fail.</p>

<p>To test this, I used my phone to open up the classic: <a href="https://example.com/">example.com</a>. Unfortunately this didn’t load - so there must’ve been a bit more going on…</p>

<p>Thankfully I had my laptop on me, so the next step was to connect to WiFi with the devtools open to the network tab, and wireshark on the side for good measure. After registering for the WiFi again, it was time to play around a bit. Opening up something like <a href="https://example.com/">example.com</a> revealed a TCP reset in the wireshark, right after the Client Hello, and my brain immediately jumped to SNI. It’s something that’s really annoyed me about the TLS spec since it’s widely used by ISPs in India to block websites (although there is work being done to fix this; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/">ECH</a> (which was itself previously ESNI)).</p>

<p>tl;dr SNI reveals the domain name of EVERY website you connect to in the TLS handshake, before the tunnel is established! Although the actual contents of what you’re doing, on say, totallynondodgywebsite.com are encrypted, anyone on the wire can see that you connected to it (including ISPs). My guess was that they had a set of whitelisted domains used by messaging apps, and if they see anything else, they just reset the connection.</p>

<p>Sidebar: people’s reactions when I try to tell this are always extremely varied. Many of my non-technical friends think anything you do without a VPN is visible to everyone, while some slightly technical ones still think that the URL (including query params) is visible, but the responses are not. Finally there is some subset of people who believe TLS means all data is encrypted in transit between client &amp; server, though they had no idea SNI leaks all the domains they visit!</p>

<h2 id="testing-out-the-theory">Testing out the theory</h2>

<p>Although BA blocks DNS queries to all (well all I could remember) public resolvers, they do resolve any domain you throw at them, including MX, TXT, HTTPS records. (This itself could be an interesting area of exploration; especially since the DNS resolution can be triggered before signing up for free WiFi. Something along the lines of arbitrary subdomains which represent the request payload, and a custom nameserver that returns responses via the TXT record or something. Anyway…).</p>

<p>Getting the A record of my personal server, I made a TLS handshake to the IP address directly, without any SNI. This was then reset by BA; so the lack of SNI is also blocked!</p>

<div><pre><code>$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443

</code></pre></div>

<p>The next step was to try and test some SNI that might go through. Off the top of my head, I knew <code>wa.me</code> was used by Whatsapp for some stuff, so I decided to use it. The way SNI works is it tells the server which host you want to connect to, so it can present the right TLS certificate. In my case, my server did not have any cert for <code>wa.me</code> , but NGINX seemingly just ignores the SNI if it doesn’t exist and returns the first cert (I think; could also be related to my config but I didn’t look to much into this).</p>

<p>But basically, as long as I (the client) don’t care, I can complete the TLS connection for any random cert the server offers me, even if in the SNI I provide a domain I don’t control (e.g. <code>wa.me</code> in this case).</p>

<div><pre><code>$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443 -servername wa.me

&lt;snip&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Success! Using a Whatsapp SNI tricked BA into thinking I’m “messaging”, which allowed the TLS tunnel to be established. Since I am connected to the server, to make sure it works I wrote an HTTP/1.1 request within the socket; using the host header of a real website on my NGINX instance</p>

<div><pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: saxrag.com

<p>I successfully managed to request and receive my homepage! All ~5KiB of it, not bad. Now the challenge was to extend this to browse any website…</p>

<h2 id="enemies-to-lovers">Enemies to Lovers</h2>

<p>Ok, my relationship with SNI isn’t as cliche as that, and I think we’re still enemies. But this opens up some exciting opportunities to say the least. If I can convince BA that I’m connecting to <code>wa.me</code>, I can potentially do whatever I want over that connection (under the guise of “messaging”). So the requirments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establish a TLS connection using the SNI <code>wa.me</code></li>
  <li>Tunnel arbitrary traffic through that connection</li>
  <li>Do all this without actually owning / controlling the <code>wa.me</code> domain</li>
</ul>

<p>From my past experiences w/ reverse-engineering etc., the most obvious way to do this seemed to be an HTTPS proxy. It had to be HTTPS specifically, since the connection to proxy was going to be what I’d “fake” as Whatsapp. If the TLS handshake to the HTTPS proxy had the SNI <code>wa.me</code> , BA <em>should</em> let it through, and then I can make the real requests I want via the proxy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was in the air, and without easy access to the internet to manage my servers and the like, I couldn’t quite set all of this up; I’d have to do that while on holiday and test it on the flight back. I could <em>try</em> and emulate the BA restrictions etc. while on thr ground, but I decided to YOLO it.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>I managed to find one of my VPSs that wasn’t already using port 443. Let’s assume the public IP was <code>333.333.333.333</code> (yes I know octets don’t go beyond <code>0xFF</code>, if you really want my IP check the screenshots below). I then setup an HTTP proxy on it using <a href="https://github.com/tinyproxy/tinyproxy">tinyproxy</a>. However this just sets up a basic HTTP proxy, which was listening on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>.</p>

<p>To add the TLS layer, I used <a href="https://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</a>. For the TLS setup of stunnel, I just generated some self-signed certs via openSSL using all defaults, except the common name (CN), for which I used <code>wa.me</code>, since I wanted to try and ensure max compatibility (e.g. the client doesn’t reject due to unexpected SNI vs. CN, or the server not knowing which cert to provide).</p>
<div><pre><code>openssl req -nodes -newkey ed25519 -keyout ssl.key -x509 -days 365 -out ssl.crt
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> actually, on the client I decided to ignore TLS errors (self-signed cert), and stunnel didn’t care about SNI, so this (<code>CN</code>) didn’t matter too much. But for more legit use cases it definitely does!</p>

<h2 id="testing-it-out">Testing it out</h2>

<p>To just make sure the proxy worked as expected, I tried it via curl directly on the IP:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ curl -x https://user:pass@333.333.333.333:443 ifconfig.co -v
*   Trying 333.333.333.333:443...
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
*  CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
*  CApath: none
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Encrypted Extensions (8):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS alert, unknown CA (560):
* SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
* closing connection #0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the webpage mentioned above.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course! I just randomly generated the certs on my VPS, not signed by a “trusted” CA or anything. Well, we can tell cURL to ignore TLS errors for the proxy with the <code>--proxy-insecure</code> flag, and now it works; the response is the IP of my VPS.</p>

<p>However there’s a problem - if I connect to the proxy directly via the IP, there is no SNI extension set, so this would get blocked. The SNI extension is set when connection to a domain, so I need to configure <code>wa.me</code> to point to <code>333.333.333.333</code>. This can be done via the hosts file of course, but cURL also provides <a href="https://curl.se/mail/archive-2015-01/0042.html">a quick CLI hack via <code>--resolve</code></a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>curl --resolve wa.me:443:333.333.333.333 -x https://username:password@wa.me ifconfig.co --proxy-insecure -v
</code></pre></div>

<p>This tells cURL how to resolve the IP. With this, I could now see the SNI being set to <code>wa.me</code> via wireshark, and the connection to the proxy succeeding (TLS errors about the self-signed cert ignored of course). Not bad, now time to wait for my flight back to Hong Kong…</p>

<h2 id="testing-it-in-flight">Testing it in-flight</h2>

<p>If I’d messed something up, I was cooked, since without internet access I wouldn’t be able to fix it! My flight back was at 1935hrs local time, but I’d been up since 0400 thanks to an early morning flight in from Edinburgh, and then spent the day browsing the markets, having pints and watching the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. The place I went to even had screens above the urinals!</p>

<p>Anyway, despite being up for ~16 hours already, I was ready to see if my work would, well, work. Once we were sky-high, I connected to the WiFi (from my laptop), signed up for the BA loyalty program, and activated the “Messaging” plan. Trying the curl command from above, I got back an HTTP 200 from <code>ifconfig.co</code> with my VPS IP; it worked! For good measure I tried cURLing some more websites like example.com, google.com etc. to make sure stuff seemed fine.</p>

<p>The next challenge was to extend this to web browsing. Thankfully most modern browsers support sending traffic through an HTTPS proxy, and chromium even has a flag to disable TLS cert warnings (so it won’t complain about my self-signed cert, which obviously doesn’t belong to the real <code>wa.me</code>).</p>

<p>I also had to set a DNS record for <code>wa.me</code> to <code>333.333.333.333</code> in my hosts file, so chromium would set the SNI to <code>wa.me</code> in the TLS handshake, but the connection would be made to my VPS. Since the bandwidth would probably be quite limited (owing to not just the internet on an airplane, but proxying it via a VPS in Netherlands), I decided to load a very simple, text-heavy website: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.</p>

<picture>
  <source srcset="https://saxrag.com/bucket/ba/hn_wireshark.avif" type="image/avif">
  <img src="https://saxrag.com/bucket/ba/hn_wireshark.png">
</picture>

<p>Bada bing bada boom! Looks like we cooked. I can actually browse HN using BA’s free “messaging” WiFi! (Note: the reason you can see the HTTP requests in plaintext in wireshark is because I used <a href="https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/tls/sslkeylogfile.html">SSLKEYLOGFILE</a> and configured wireshark to decrypt TLS).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, trying to load websites with heavier assets would fail, with images on simple text blogs loading line-by-line. Well, at least its some dial-up nostalgia!</p>

<picture>
  <source srcset="https://saxrag.com/bucket/ba/image_loading.avif" type="image/avif">
  <img src="https://saxrag.com/bucket/ba/image_loading.png">
</picture>

<p>My guess is that on the free WiFi, apart from the SNI checks, they also throttle the bandwidth. Maybe they anticipated this kind of circumvention. On the other hand, if this is really the internet speed that the full plan unlocks…</p>

<h2 id="bonus-ech">Bonus: ECH</h2>

<p>Earlier above I talked about <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/">work being done to fix the SNI leakage: ECH</a>. The scope of explaining how it works is out of scope here, but I do encourage you to read up on it. Pretty good stuff! It’ll help this section make more sense.</p>

<p><a href="https://rfc5746.mywaifu.best:4443/">I operate an ECH test website</a>, so I decided to do some more setup before my flight. I basically created <em>another</em> ECHConfig, with the public_name set to <code>wa.me</code>. <a href="https://ckcr4lyf.github.io/tech-notes/services/nginx/nginx-ech.html#generating-a-new-echconfig">I’ve a bit of a guide on how to do this btw</a>, though it could do with some improvements.</p>

<p>Anyway, since ECH world, the public SNI is purely for the server to complete the outer ClientHello, and since ECH clients set the public SNI based on the ECHConfig, I can <a href="https://rfc5746.mywaifu.best:7443/">type in my real domain</a> in firefox, which will still use the <code>wa.me</code> domain as the public SNI. The inner Client Hello will then occur securely, containing the real SNI of <code>rfc5746.mywaifu.best</code>, and the handshake will complete with the “legit” CA-signed certificate for that domain.</p>

<picture>
  <source srcset="https://saxrag.com/bucket/ba/ech.avif" type="image/avif">
  <img src="https://saxrag.com/bucket/ba/ech.png">
</picture>

<p>This worked as well, and without any TLS ignore flags, since the actual cert for <code>rfc5746.mywaifu.best</code> was signed by a “trusted CA” (Let’s Encrypt). What’s more interesting is that this worked even on a non-standart TLS port: <code>7443</code>! Not sure exactly why, but I’m not complaining.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-echconfig-resolution">A note on ECHConfig resolution</h3>

<p>Typically, ECHConfigs should be resolved via encrypted DNS, such as DNS-over-HTTPS. I believe this is what firefox does by default. I am not 100% sure if this is what happened while I was in flight, since I’d think the DoH would be blocked on messaging WiFi? Or maybe they allow the DoH SNI as well, since newer phones default to that. If any of you are flying BA anytime soon, try it out and let me know!</p>

<h2 id="sni-dont-blindly-trust-it">SNI: Don’t blindly trust it</h2>

<p>SNI, as the name indicates (sorry) is just a “hint” of sorts, from the client to the server. If someone controls both sides (client &amp; server), they can put whatever fake value they want in here, for middleboxes to sniff out and try to analyze. While this unfortunately does work for applications like censorship (<a href="https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/reliance-jio-is-using-sni-inspection-to-block-websites">where an ISP</a> or country is trying to block a particular website), for use cases such as threat detection it should not be relied on; malwre authors can “spoof” the SNI when connecting to their C&amp;C, since they don’t actually need it, but it may look more innocent to middleboxes.</p>

            After more than three centuries, a geometry problem that originated with a royal bet has been solved.        </p>

<div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Imagine you’re holding two equal-size dice. Is it possible to bore a tunnel through one die that’s big enough for the other to slide through?</p>
<p>Perhaps your instinct is to say “Surely not!” If so, you’re not alone. In the late 1600s, an unidentified person placed a bet to that effect with Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Rupert — a nephew of Charles I of England who commanded the Royalist forces in the English Civil War — spent his sunset years studying metallurgy and glassmaking in his laboratory at Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>Rupert won the bet. The mathematician John Wallis, recounting the story in 1693, didn’t say whether Rupert wrote a proof or bored a hole through an actual cube. But Wallis himself proved mathematically that, if you drill a straight tunnel in the direction of one of the cube’s inner diagonals, it can be made wide enough to allow another cube through. It’s a tight squeeze: If you make the second cube just 4% larger, it will no longer fit.</p>
<p>It’s natural to wonder which other shapes have this property. “I think of this problem as being quite canonical,” said <a href="http://tom7.org/">Tom Murphy</a>, a software engineer at Google who has explored the question extensively in his free time. It “would have gotten rediscovered and rediscovered — aliens would have come to this one.”</p>

<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The full menagerie of shapes is too diverse to get a handle on, so mathematicians tend to focus on convex polyhedra: shapes, like the cube, that have flat sides and no protrusions or indentations. When such a shape is much wider in some directions than others, it’s usually easy to find a straight tunnel that will allow another copy of the shape to pass through. But many famous convex polyhedra — for instance the dodecahedron, or the truncated icosahedron, the shape that forms a soccer ball — are highly symmetric and difficult to analyze. Among these, “for hundreds of years we only knew of the cube,” said Jakob Steininger, a mathematician at Statistics Austria, Austria’s federal statistics organization.</p>
<p>Then, in 1968, Christoph Scriba proved that the <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=0497615">tetrahedron and octahedron</a> also have the “Rupert property,” as mathematicians now call it. And in a burst of activity over the past decade, professional mathematicians and hobbyists have found Rupert tunnels through many of the most widely studied convex polyhedra, including the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/math.mag.90.2.87">dodecahedron, icosahedron</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2018.1449505">soccer ball</a>.</p>
<p>The Rupert property appeared to be so widespread that mathematicians conjectured a general rule: Every convex polyhedron <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2018.1449505">will have the Rupert property</a>. No one could find one that didn’t — until now.</p>

    <p>In a paper posted online in August, Steininger and <a href="https://yurkevi.ch/">Sergey Yurkevich</a> — a researcher at A&amp;R Tech, an Austrian transportation systems company — describe a shape with 90 vertices and 152 faces that they’ve named the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475">Noperthedron</a> (after “Nopert,” a coinage by Murphy that combines “Rupert” and “nope”). Steininger and Yurkevich proved that no matter how you bore a straight tunnel through a Noperthedron, a second Noperthedron cannot fit through.</p>
<p>The proof required a mix of theoretical advances and massive computer calculations, and relies on a delicate property of the Noperthedron’s vertices. “It’s a miracle that it works,” Steininger said.</p>
<h2><strong>Passing Through the Shadows</strong></h2>
<p>To see how one cube can pass through another, imagine holding a cube over a table and examining its shadow (assuming it’s illuminated from above). If you hold the cube in the standard position, the shadow is a square. But if you point one of the corners directly upward, the shadow is a regular hexagon.</p>
<p>In 1693, Wallis showed that the square shadow fits inside the hexagon, leaving a thin margin. That means that if you point a cube’s corner upward, you can bore a vertical tunnel that’s big enough for a second cube to pass through. About a century later, Pieter Nieuwland showed that a different orientation casts an even better shadow — one that can accommodate a cube more than 6% larger than the cube with the tunnel.</p>

    <p>Every subsequent analysis of more complicated shapes has relied on this process of turning the shape in different directions and looking for one shadow that fits inside another. With the aid of computers, mathematicians have found Rupert passages through a wide variety of shapes. Some are incredibly tight fits — for instance, the passage in a “triakis tetrahedron” has a margin that’s only about 0.000002 times the length of the shape’s radius. “The world of mixing computation and discrete geometry has flowered to make these kinds of calculations possible,” said <a href="https://www.smith.edu/people/joseph-orourke">Joseph O’Rourke</a>, an emeritus professor at Smith College.</p>
<p>Researchers who have written algorithms to find Rupert passages have noticed a curious dichotomy: For any given convex polyhedron, the algorithm seems to either find a passage almost immediately, or not find one at all. In the past five years, mathematicians have accumulated a small collection of holdout shapes for which no passage has been found.</p>
<p>“I’ve had my desktop churn for two weeks on trying the rhombicosidodecahedron,” said <a href="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/">Benjamin Grimmer</a>, an applied mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, referring to a solid made of 62 regular triangles, squares and pentagons. “That one just seems to resist any attempt.”</p>

    <p>But such resistance doesn’t prove that a shape is a Nopert. There are infinitely many ways to orient a shape, and a computer can only check finitely many. Researchers don’t know whether the holdouts are true Noperts or just shapes whose Rupert passages are hard to find.</p>
<p>What they do know is that candidate Noperts are incredibly rare. Starting last year, Murphy began to <a href="http://tom7.org/ruperts/ruperts.pdf">construct hundreds of millions of shapes</a>. These include random polyhedra, polyhedra whose vertices lie on a sphere, polyhedra with special symmetries, and polyhedra in which he moved one vertex to intentionally mess up a previous Rupert passage. His algorithm easily found Rupert tunnels for nearly every one.</p>
<p>The contrast between these quick results and the stubbornness of the Nopert holdouts made some mathematicians suspect that true Noperts do exist. But until August, all they had were suspicions.</p>
<h2><strong>No Passage</strong></h2>
<p>Steininger, now 30, and Yurkevich, 29, have been friends since they participated together as teenagers in mathematics Olympiad competitions. Even though both eventually left academia (after a doctorate for Yurkevich and a master’s for Steininger), they have continued to explore unsolved problems together.</p>
<p>“We just had pizza three hours ago, and we talked about math almost the whole time,” Steininger told <em>Quanta</em>. “That’s what we do.”</p>
<p>Five years ago, the pair happened upon a YouTube video of one cube passing through another, and they were instantly smitten. They developed an algorithm to search for Rupert tunnels and soon became convinced that some shapes were Noperts. In a 2021 paper, they conjectured that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13754">the rhombicosidodecahedron is not Rupert</a>. Their work, which preceded Murphy’s and Grimmer’s recent explorations, was, “I think, the first to conjecture that there might be solids that don’t have this property,” Steininger said.</p>
<p>If you want to prove that a shape is a Nopert, you must rule out Rupert tunnels for every possible orientation of the two shapes. Each orientation can be written down as a collection of rotation angles. This collection of angles can then be represented as a point in a higher-dimensional “parameter space.”</p>

    <p>Suppose you choose an orientation for your two shapes, and the computer tells you that the second shadow sticks out past the border of the first shadow. This rules out one point in the parameter space.</p>
<p>But you may be able to rule out much more than a single point. If the second shadow sticks out significantly, it would require a big change to move it inside the first shadow. In other words, you can rule out not just your initial orientation but also “nearby” orientations — an entire block of points in the parameter space. Steininger and Yurkevich came up with a result they called their global theorem, which quantifies precisely how large a block you can rule out in these cases. By testing many different points, you can potentially rule out block after block in the parameter space.</p>
<p>If these blocks cover the entire parameter space, you’ll have proved that your shape is a Nopert. But the size of each block depends on how far the second shadow sticks out beyond the first, and sometimes it doesn’t stick out very far. For instance, suppose you start with the two shapes in exactly the same position, and then you slightly rotate the second shape. Its shadow will at most stick out just a tiny bit past the first shadow, so the global theorem will only rule out a tiny box. These boxes are too small to cover the whole parameter space, leaving the possibility that some point you’ve missed might correspond to a Rupert tunnel.</p>

<p>To deal with these small reorientations, the pair came up with a complement to their global theorem that they called the local theorem. This result deals with cases where you can find three vertices (or corner points) on the boundary of the original shadow that satisfy some special requirements. For instance, if you connect those three vertices to form a triangle, it must contain the shadow’s center point. The researchers showed that if these requirements are met, then any small reorientation of the shape will create a shadow that pushes at least one of the three vertices further outward. So the new shadow can’t lie inside the original shadow, meaning it doesn’t create a Rupert tunnel.</p>
<p>If your shape casts a shadow that lacks three appropriate vertices, the local theorem won’t apply. And all the previously identified Nopert candidates have at least one shadow with this problem. Steininger and Yurkevich sifted through a database of hundreds of the most symmetric and beautiful convex polyhedra, but they couldn’t find any shape whose shadows all worked. So they decided to generate a suitable shape themselves.</p>
<p>They developed an algorithm to construct shapes and test them for the three-vertices property. Eventually, the algorithm produced the Noperthedron, which is made of 150 triangles and two regular 15-sided polygons. It looks like a rotund crystal vase with a wide base and top; one fan of the work has already 3D-printed a copy to use as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fractalkitty.com/post/3lxkvjiqa2c2p">pencil holder</a>.</p>

    <p>Steininger and Yurkevich then divided the parameter space of orientations into approximately 18 million tiny blocks, and tested the center point of each block to see if its corresponding orientation produced a Rupert passage. None of them did. Next, the researchers showed that each block satisfied either the local or global theorem, allowing them to rule out the entire block. Since these blocks fill out the entire parameter space, this meant that there is no Rupert passage through the Noperthedron.</p>
        
        
<p>The “natural conjecture has been proved false,” O’Rourke said.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether mathematicians can use the new method to generate other Noperts, or if they can find a different local theorem that can handle candidates like the rhombicosidodecahedron. But now that mathematicians know that Noperts do exist, “we’re on sound footing to study other shapes,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Murphy, who like Steininger and Yurkevich has been exploring the question for its own sake, independent of his day job, feels a kinship across the centuries with Prince Rupert. “I like that he chose to use his retirement to do math and science in his castle,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Steininger and Yurkevich are on the lookout for new questions to tackle. “We’re just humble mathematicians — we love working on such problems,” Steininger said. “We’ll keep doing that.”</p>

The Asahi Linux developers involved with working on Linux support for Apple Silicon M-Series devices have put out a new progress report on their development efforts.
</p><p>
Asahi Linux developers have kept working on new kernel patches and some being upstreamed for Linux 6.17 and 6.18 cycles, as previously covered on Phoronix. Notably with Linux 6.18 is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.18-SoC-DT-Changes">the Device Trees for the Apple M2 Pro / Max / Ultra devices</a> albeit more driver code is still working its way upstream.
</p><p>
Asahi Linux developers are also working on moving toward the Rust programming language with their important m1n1 bootloader for Apple Silicon. They feel going to Rust is important for such a critical piece of software for better maintainability, safety, and ensuring the correct logic.
</p><p>
Asahi Linux developers have also made progress on getting more games working on Apple Silicon devices. Wine is also now working outside of muvm and their graphics driver support continues maturing:
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=asahi_october" alt="Asahi Linux running a game"></p>
<p>With the upstream Linux kernel work around Apple Silicon so far being focused on Apple M1 and M2, you may be wondering about M3 and M4 or the recently announced M5... They still are battling Apple M3 bring-up. Today's progress report comments:
</p><blockquote>"It may be surprising to learn that very basic, low-level support for M3 has existed for quite some time now. m1n1 is capable of initialising the CPU cores, turning on some critical peripheral devices, and booting the Asahi kernel. However, the level of support right now begins and ends with being able to boot to a blinking cursor. Naturally, this level of support is not at all useful for anything but low-level reverse engineering, but we of course plan on rectifying this in due time..."</blockquote>
