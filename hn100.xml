            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998290/hasbro-layoffs-before-christmas">https://www.polygon.com/23998290/hasbro-layoffs-before-christmas</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38618111">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ws0cUw">Game and toy maker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23500171/hasbro-magic-overprinting-fireside-chat-cynthia-williams">Hasbro</a> announced it will cut roughly 1,100 jobs on Monday. When added to the 800 layoffs made earlier this year, the total amounts to just less than one-third of the company’s entire labor force. The news comes exactly two weeks ahead of Christmas, traditionally the biggest holiday of the year for game and toy sales.</p>
<p id="ftaXmm">“We entered 2023 expecting a year of change including significant updates to our leadership team, structure, and scope of operations,” said CEO Chris Cocks in a memo to his employees that was shared with Polygon. “We anticipated the first three quarters to be challenging, particularly in Toys, where the market is coming off historic, pandemic-driven highs. While we have made some important progress across our organization, the headwinds we saw through the first nine months of the year have continued into Holiday and are likely to persist into 2024.”</p>
<p id="70D5Ca">The news likely comes as no surprise to insiders, including investors, who have been tracking the shortfalls of the company’s toy portfolio for some time. Meanwhile, Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, which publishes both <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/21294556/dnd-how-to-play-dungeons-dragons-5e-guide-spells-dice-character-sheets-dm">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, is experiencing all-time highs for both revenue earned and the number of players engaged in those brands. Activist hedge fund Alta Fox attempted to push the Rhode Island-based company to spin off Wizards in 2022, but the effort was defeated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/hasbro-defeats-board-challenge-activist-investor-alta-fox-2022-06-08/">a high-profile shareholder election in June 2022</a>. Now the 100-year-old company is left to rebuild in 2024.</p>
<p id="PCODex">Polygon reached out to the tabletop teams impacted by these layoffs, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23817191/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-santa-claus-holiday-expansion-release-date-price">Avalon Hill</a>, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. One representative said that the company is “not sharing breakdowns on geography or teams out of respect for employees.” Impacted workers are expected to be contacted by the end of the business day Tuesday.</p>
<p id="9HLQqg">“Cost-cutting is not a strategy,” Cocks added. “We know this, and that’s why we’ll continue to grow and invest in several areas in 2024.”</p>
<p id="axNzev">One area of investment for Hasbro appears to be the video game sector. Its latest project, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23992111/exodus-release-date-bioware-rpg-archetype"><em>Exodus</em></a>, made a big splash last week at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23992648/the-game-awards-2023-biggest-game-announcements-trailers">The Game Awards</a>. Following the success of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/baldurs-gate-3-guides"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, which was produced under license by Larian Studios, Wizards’ own Archetype Entertainment appears to have a solid footing. Founded by veterans of BioWare, the studio behind <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>, <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/12/21135139/mass-effect-drew-karpyshyn-wizards-of-the-coast-archetype-entertainment-bioware">the Mass Effect trilogy</a>, the game will be released on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. It currently has no release date.</p>
<p id="EUcigJ">Hasbro stock has fallen some 20% this year according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/hasbro-layoffs-toy-company-ed760682">The Wall Street Journal</a>, with today’s price down slightly on the news. Long-term investors, meanwhile, are expected to continue to earn dividends at a rate of 5.8% annually according to <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HAS:NASDAQ?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwkey8poqDAxX9IzQIHezaAAwQ3ecFegQILxAi">Google Finance</a>. Cocks earned a reported <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/rhodeisland/news/2023/04/05/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks.html">$9.4 million</a> last year — his first year as Hasbro’s CEO. At the new price point of $59.95, that’s roughly equivalent to 156,797 copies of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23730399/dnd-dungeons-dragons-revised-core-rulebook-preview-players-handbook-dmg"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"><p><strong>Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip –</strong> Inside one of the rooms of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, Mahmoud Zindah stays close to his father, Nader, the horrors of the past week etched on both of their faces. Their eyes are wide, darting around.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old and his father were among hundreds of Palestinians rounded up on December 5 by Israeli forces in the Shujayea area, east of Gaza City, who endured five days of torture and degradation before they were released – without any explanation.</p>
<p>“One of the soldiers said I looked like his nephew and that this nephew was killed in front of his grandmother who was taken hostage by Hamas and that the soldiers will slaughter us all,” Mahmoud says, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Before their ordeal, the Zindah family was trapped in their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City for two days, unable to leave as tanks advanced and artillery shelling got closer and closer. Those who dared to leave their homes for whatever vital errand were shot down in the streets by snipers.</p>
<p>On the third day, the family, who slept on the cold tile floor under mattresses to shield them from potential flying shrapnel, woke up to find the tanks on their street.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2549574" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2549574"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1E3A0077-1702307776.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="Mahmoud and Nader Zindah recall their experience of arrest and torture by Israeli forces " data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2549574">Mahmoud and Nader Zindah recall their arrest and torture by Israeli forces [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We heard the soldiers shouting and the tank tracks getting louder,” Nader, 40, says. “I felt like there was something wrong, so I went to the house behind me, which was farther from the street. Before I reached it I stopped in shock. The house was moving!</p>
<p>“Then I realised that the Israeli bulldozer was knocking its walls down” and soldiers were firing live ammunition as well, he adds.</p>
<p>Nader quickly tore some white sheets into small “flags” for each of his eight children to carry. They poked one out of their front door, as the adults shouted that there were people in the house. The bulldozer stopped, as did the shooting. But suddenly the home was full of Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p>“They made us empty out our bags on the floor and blocked us from picking up our money or our wives’ gold,” Nader recalls. “What little food we had, they also threw away. They took our money, IDs and phones.”</p>
<p>The soldiers divided the household: women and young children in one room and the men and teenage boys in another. Then they told Nader, Mahmoud, his brother-in-law and another male relative to strip, then pushed them outside.</p>
<p>“They rounded up at least 150 men from the surrounding homes and blindfolded and handcuffed us all in the street,” Nader explains.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2549568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2549568"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1E3A0100-2-1702307644.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="Mohammed Odeh, 14, was separated from his family and taken with at least 150 other men and teenage boys to a rice warehouse by Israeli forces where he faced torture for several days " data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2549568">Mohammed Odeh, 14, was separated from his family and taken with at least 150 other men and teenage boys to a rice warehouse by Israeli forces where he faced torture for several days [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the soldiers forced the men onto the backs of some trucks, Nader made sure Mahmoud was on his lap, terrified of what they would do to his son if they were separated.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to lose my child, nor do I want my son to lose his father,” he says.</p>
<p>The men quickly realised that there were also women in the truck, which kept braking suddenly, sending the prisoners falling on top of each other.</p>
<p>“We were all blindfolded, so we couldn’t see each other, but we heard the women telling us to look out for them like we would for our own sisters,” Nader says. “There were also younger children with them.”</p>
<p>The truck stopped, and once again, the men and women were separated. The men and teenage boys were taken to a warehouse where they sat on a bare floor covered in scattered grains of rice. There they were beaten, interrogated and verbally abused. There was no sleep, and the grains of rice cut their skin as they sat there, undressed.</p>
<h2 id="starved-and-beaten-for-days">Starved and beaten for days</h2>
<p>Mohammed Odeh, 14, was taken from the same Wadi al-Arayes neighbourhood in Zeitoun as the Zindahs, where he and his family were stuck in their homes for five days, starving.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2549588" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2549588"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1E3A0107-1702307940.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="Israeli soldiers released about 10 men they had arrested last Tuesday " data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2549588">Israeli soldiers released about 10 men they had arrested on December 5, 2023 [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>
<p>Two of the neighbourhood boys who left to look for water were killed on the street by Israeli snipers. After the bulldozer knocked down the walls of several homes, the soldiers dragged the men and teenagers out, slapping, punching and hitting them with their guns.</p>
<p>“There was no reasoning with them,” Mohammed recalls. “They kept saying, ‘You are all Hamas.’ They wrote numbers on our arms. My number was 56.” When he stretches his arms out, the red marker is still visible on his skin.</p>
<p>“When they spoke to us in Hebrew and we wouldn’t understand, they’d beat us up,” he continues.</p>
<p>“They hit me in the back where my kidneys are and my legs. They took my family, and I don’t know where they are,” he says, his voice breaking.</p>
<p>Before they were forced inside the warehouse, Israeli female soldiers came and spat on the men, Mohammed recalls.</p>
<p>In the warehouse, it was common for groups of five soldiers to suddenly enter and beat one person while the others were forced to listen to his screams of pain. If any of the men and teenagers nodded off from exhaustion, the soldiers poured cold water on them.</p>
<p>“Their contempt for us was unnatural, like we were lesser beings,” Mohammed says.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2549558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2549558"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1E3A0175-2-1702307496.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="One of the Palestinian men arrested and tortured for days by Israeli soldiers shows the number he was marked by, and his swollen hand from the handcuffs " data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2549558">One of the Palestinian men arrested and tortured for days by Israeli soldiers shows the number he was marked with and his swollen hands from the handcuffs [Abdelhakim Abu Riash\Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Some people didn’t return from the torture sessions,” Nader says darkly. “We would hear their screams and then nothing.”</p>
<p>At one point, Mahmoud told his father that his wrists were bleeding from the handcuffs. A soldier overheard, asked where it hurt and then proceeded to press down on the spot. Nader tried to shield his son, and one of the soldiers tried to drag the teenager away. When Mahmoud resisted, he was kicked in the face. The mark is still visible.</p>
<p>“My dad kept shouting at them that I’m a child and threw himself on top of me,” he says. “I heard a soldier speaking in an American accent, and I told him in English that I’m just a kid that goes to school.” Their words fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Blindfolded and handcuffed the entire time, the men and boys endured hours of beatings.</p>
<p>“They cursed at us, spewing the most foul language,” says Nader, who suffered a particularly painful blow to his head. “Some of them spoke Arabic. Every time you tried to talk, asking to go use the bathroom or wanting a drink of water, they would come and beat us up, using the butts of their M16 rifles.”</p>
<p>The soldiers interrogated them and threatened to kill them all. They accused the Palestinians of stealing their army jeeps and raping Israeli women. When they asked Mahmoud where he was on October 7 and he answered that he was sleeping at home, the soldiers hit him, he says.</p>
<p>“They have this unbelievable racism. They really hate us,” Nader says. “This isn’t about Hamas. This is about wiping us all out. This is about a genocide, signed off by [US President] Biden.”</p>
<p>The men were given only a few drops of water and some scraps of bread to eat. Some were forced to relieve themselves on the spot while others were handed a foul-smelling bucket.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, Saturday, Nader, Mahmoud, and 10 other men were taken to Nitzarim, a former settlement south of Gaza City that had been turned into farmland after the 2005 Israeli disengagement. It is now an Israeli checkpoint just before Wadi Gaza and the men were released there and told to head south.</p>
<p>The group took off their blindfolds and let their eyes adjust to the light after days of darkness. They were exhausted and hungry and still did not have any clothes. After walking painfully for two hours, a group of Palestinians spotted them.</p>
<p>“They clothed us and gave us water,” Nader says. “An ambulance was called, and we arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where we were immediately given IV fluids.”</p>
<p>“I thought I didn’t have a chance of getting out alive,” he adds.</p>
<p>“It was hell on earth. It was like spending five years in that warehouse. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By Krish Prasad, Senior Vice President and General Manager, VMware Cloud Foundation Division</em></p><p>Broadcom’s close of the VMware acquisition has brought together two engineering-first, innovation-centric teams to help build the world's leading infrastructure technology company. Together, we are well-positioned to enable global enterprises to embrace private, hybrid and multi-cloud environments. And we are committed to driving customer success through faster innovation, a simpler portfolio and a robust ecosystem.</p><p>Over the past two years, VMware has been on a journey to simplify its portfolio and transition from a perpetual to a subscription model to better serve customers with continuous innovation, faster time to value, and predictable investments.</p><p>Today, VMware by Broadcom has reached a new milestone with the announcement of the following:</p><ul><li>A dramatic simplification of our product portfolio that allows customers of all sizes to gain more value for their investments in VMware solutions. The portfolio simplification across all VMware by Broadcom divisions stems from customer and partner feedback over the years telling us our offers and go-to-market are too complex.</li><li>Complete the transition of all VMware by Broadcom solutions to subscription licenses, with the end of sale of perpetual licenses, Support and Subscription (SnS) renewals for perpetual offerings, and hybrid purchase program/subscription purchase program (HPP/SPP) credits beginning today (effective dates will vary). Additionally, we are introducing a bring-your-own-subscription license option, providing license portability to VMware validated hybrid cloud endpoints running VMware Cloud Foundation.</li></ul><p><strong>Portfolio Simplification</strong></p><p>Today, we’re announcing specific changes coming to the VMware Cloud Foundation division portfolio. Going forward, the division will feature two primary offers:</p><ul><li><strong>VMware Cloud Foundation</strong>, our flagship enterprise-class hybrid cloud solution for customers to run their business critical and modern applications – in a secure, resilient and cost efficient manner. To allow more customers to benefit from this solution, we’ve reduced the previous subscription list price by half and added higher support service levels including enhanced support for activating the solution and lifecycle management.<strong></strong></li><li>The new <strong>VMware vSphere Foundation</strong> delivers a more simplified enterprise-grade workload platform for our mid-sized to smaller customers. This solution integrates vSphere with our intelligent operations management to provide the best performance, availability, and efficiency with greater visibility and insights.</li></ul><p>Both VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere Foundation will have optional advanced add-on offers. Our storage offering, ransomware and disaster recovery service, and application platform services are available on both offers. And Application Network and Security offerings are available for VMware Cloud Foundation. Additional advanced services and offerings, including Private AI, will be available soon.</p><p><strong>Subscription Licenses</strong></p><p>VMware has been on a journey to transition to a subscription model for more than a year now, and the industry has already embraced subscription as the standard for cloud consumption. With a simplified portfolio in place, we’re completing our transition to subscription offerings. Offerings will solely be available as subscriptions or as term licenses following the end of sale of perpetual licenses and Support and Subscription (SnS) renewals beginning today.</p><p>The subscription model helps us deliver what customers want:</p><ul><li>Continuous innovation.</li><li>Faster time to value.</li><li>Predictable investments.</li></ul><p>Customers may continue using perpetual licenses with active support contracts. We will continue to provide support as defined in contractual commitments. We encourage customers to review their inventory of perpetual licenses, including Support Services renewal and expiration dates. Broadcom will work with customers to help them “trade in” their perpetual products in exchange for the new subscription products, with upgrade pricing incentives. (For additional details, see FAQ).</p><p>The simplification of our portfolio and shift to subscription and term offerings are a culmination of our multi-year business transformation efforts. The steps we’re taking today will further enable customer and partner success by delivering the innovation, simplicity and flexibility they need as they undertake their digital transformations.</p><p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p><p><strong>Q: What is VMware by Broadcom announcing?</strong></p><p>A: Today, VMware by Broadcom has reached a new milestone in its journey and announced the following:</p><ul><li>A dramatic simplification of our product portfolio that allows customers of all sizes to gain more value for their investments in VMware solutions. The portfolio simplification across all VMware by Broadcom divisions stems from customer and partner feedback over the years telling us our offers and go-to-market are too complex.</li><li>Complete the transition of all VMware by Broadcom solutions to subscription licenses, with the end of sale of perpetual licenses, Support and Subscription (SnS) renewals for perpetual offerings, and HPP/SPP (generic) credits beginning today. Additionally, we are introducing a bring-your-own-subscription license option, providing license portability to VMware validated hybrid cloud endpoints running VMware Cloud Foundation.</li></ul><p><strong>Q: How do these changes benefit customers?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>A: Over the past two years, VMware has been on a journey to simplify its portfolio and transition to a subscription model, the industry standard for cloud consumption, and to better serve customers with continuous innovation, faster time to value, and predictable investments. We’re also helping more customers benefit from VMware Cloud Foundation by reducing the list price by half and including higher support service levels including enhanced support for activating the solution and lifecycle management.</p><p><strong>Q: Why is this good for partners?</strong></p><p>A: The industry has already widely embraced subscription and SaaS, and many partners in our ecosystem have already developed success practices in this area. Subscription and SaaS models provide an opportunity for partners to engage more strategically with customers and deliver higher-value services that drive customer success. It also helps accelerate their own transition to a business model focused on annual recurring revenue.</p><p><strong>Q: What are the changes to perpetual licenses?</strong></p><p>A: As part of our transition to subscription and a simplified portfolio, beginning today, we will no longer sell perpetual licenses. All offerings will continue to be available as subscriptions going forward. Additionally, we are ending the sale of Support and Subscription (SnS) renewals for perpetual offerings beginning today.</p><p><strong>Q: Why make this change from perpetual licenses to subscription?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A: This shift is the natural next step in our multi-year strategy to make it easier for customers to consume both our existing offerings and new innovations. VMware believes that a subscription model supports our customers with the innovation and flexibility they need as they undertake their digital transformations.</p><p><strong>Q: Can customers continue to use their perpetual license</strong><strong>s?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, customers can continue to use perpetual licenses that they’ve purchased for products.</p><p><strong>Q: Can customers still purchase and add additional perpetual licenses after </strong><strong>today?</strong></p><p>A: After a customer’s effective date for the end of availability of perpetual licenses, customers will not be able to purchase new perpetual licenses. Customers will be able to purchase subscription software or term licenses to supplement or replace their current perpetual-licensed install base.</p><p><strong>Q: Can customers renew their Service and Support (SnS) contracts </strong><strong>after today?</strong></p><p>A: No, customers cannot renew their SnS contracts for perpetual licensed products after today. Broadcom will work with customers to help them “trade in” their perpetual products in exchange for the new subscription products, with upgrade pricing incentives. Customers can contact their VMware account or partner representative to learn more.</p><p><strong>Q: Do customers have to collect and submit their perpetual licenses to Broadcom when they “trade-in” their products for subscription?</strong></p><p>A: No, Broadcom does not require customers to submit their perpetual licenses to Broadcom when they “trade in” their products for subscription.</p><p><strong>Q: Will VMware by Broadcom continue to provide support for active Service and Support (SnS) contracts?</strong></p><p>A: We will continue to provide support as defined in contractual commitments.</p><p><strong>Q: What will happen to customers’ existing perpetual licenses with active SnS contracts when they are up for renewal?</strong></p><p>A: Customers should contact their VMware account or partner representative for upgrade pricing from perpetual to subscription.</p><p><strong>Q: What can customers with perpetual licenses do now to prepare?</strong></p><p>A: This is an excellent time for customers to assess their current state with VMware infrastructure and management products. We encourage customers to review their inventory of perpetual licenses, including refresh cycles and renewal dates, and become more familiar with VMware's available subscription offers. Customers should also contact their VMware or partner representative for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: What VMware Cloud Foundation division offerings are available for purchase?</strong></p><p>A: The product simplification across the VMware Cloud Foundation division stems from customer and partner feedback requesting we reduce the complexity of our offers and go-to-market.

      <p data-block-key="yx97h">The internet was born as a way to connect people and data together around the world. Today, machine learning is upending the way that we interact with data and information.

      <p data-block-key="3scq2">The way that humans think is uniquely personal to each individual. While individuals share many principles, values and properties of their surrounding communities and organizations, each of us has a unique perspective and set of information that we're exposed to on a regular basis. The process of making new insights from the content we create and consume is not a "one-size-fits-all" opportunity, and machine learning capabilities open up a vast range of new computing advancements and paradigms.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Jeremy Howard (founding CEO, previously co-founder of Kaggle and fast.ai) and Eric Ries (founding director, previously creator of Lean Startup and the Long-Term Stock Exchange) today launched Answer.AI, a new kind of AI R&amp;D lab which creates practical end-user products based on foundational research breakthroughs. The creation of Answer.AI is supported by an investment of USD10m from Decibel VC. Answer.AI will be a fully-remote team of deep-tech generalists—the world’s very best, regardless of where they live, what school they went to, or any other meaningless surface feature.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-new-rd-lab">

<p>In 1831 Michael Faraday showed the world how to harness electricity. Suddenly there was, quite literally, a new source of power in the world. He later found the basis of the unification of light and magnetism, and knew he was onto something big:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I happen to have discovered a direct relation between magnetism and light, also electricity and light, and the field it opens is so large and I think rich.”</em> Michael Faraday; letter to Christian Schoenbein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it wasn’t quite clear how to harness this power. What kinds of products and services could now be created that couldn’t before? What could now be made far cheaper, more efficient, and more accessible? One man set out to understand this, and in 1876 he put together a new kind of R&amp;D lab, which he called the “Invention Lab”: a lab that would figure out the fundamental research needed to tame electricity, and the applied development needed to make it useful in practice.</p>
<p>You might have heard of the man: his name was Thomas Edison. And the organization he created turned into a company you would know: General Electric.</p>
<p>Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation. There’s a new source of power in the world—artificial intelligence. And, like before, it’s not quite clear how to harness this power. Where are all the AI-powered products and services that make our lives and work dramatically easier and more pleasant?</p>
<p>To create these AI-powered products and services, we’ve created a new R&amp;D lab, called <strong>Answer.AI</strong>. Answer.AI will figure out the fundamental <em>research</em> needed to tame AI, and the <em>development</em> path needed to make it useful in practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="an-iterative-path-to-harnessing-ai">
<h2 data-anchor-id="an-iterative-path-to-harnessing-ai">An iterative path to harnessing AI</h2>
<p>Harnessing AI requires not just low-level computer science and mathematical research, but also deep thinking about what practical applications can take advantage of this new power. The “D” in “R&amp;D” is critical: it’s only by considering the <em>development</em> of practical applications that the correct <em>research</em> directions can be targeted.</p>
<p>That’s why Answer.AI is built on the work of experts in both research <em>and</em> development. Co-founders Jeremy Howard (that’s me!) and Eric Ries have created pioneering ideas in each of these areas. I co-founded fast.ai, where I have worked for the last 7 years on <strong>research</strong> into how to best make AI more accessible, particularly through <em>transfer learning</em> and <em>fine tuning</em>. I’ve been working with machine learning for over 30 years, including creating the ULMFiT method of fine-tuning large language models which is used as the basis of all popular language models today, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. I have developed the longest running online courses on Deep Learning in the world, in which I show students how to start with simple models and then iteratively improve them all the way to the state of the art.</p>
<p>I’ve known Eric for years, and there’s no-one I trust or respect more, which is why I asked him to serve as the founding director of Answer.AI. Eric has dedicated the last 10 years of his life to improving how companies operate, serve customers, and are governed. He is the creator of the Lean Startup movement, which is the basis of how most startups build products and scale their organizations. His work focuses on <strong>development</strong>: how can organizations go from an idea to a sustainable, mission-driven, and profitable product in practice. One of his key insights was to create and then iteratively improve a <em>Minimal Viable Product</em> (MVP).</p>
<p>I asked Eric for his thoughts on Answer.AI’s unique approach to R&amp;D, and he summarised better than I ever could, so I’ll just quote his reply here directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“People think that the order is research→development, and that therefore an R&amp;D lab does “R” and then “D”. That is, the research informs the development, and so being practical means having researchers and developers. But this is wrong, and leads to a lot of bad research, because development should inform research and vice-versa. So having development goals is a way to do more effective research, if you set that out as your north star.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric is also an expert on governance and how companies should be led in order to align profit and increased human flourishing. He created the <a href="https://ltse.com/">Long-Term Stock Exchange</a> (LTSE), the first fundamentally new US Stock Exchange in over 50 years. LTSE mandates that listed companies and likeminded investors work towards long-term value, rather than just short-term profit maximization. Eric serves as the Chairman of LTSE, meaning he is not only up to date on the right long-term governance frameworks, but on the cutting edge of inventing new systems.</p>
<p>It will take years for Answer.AI to harness AI’s full potential, which requires the kind of strategic foresight and long-term tenacity which is hard to maintain in today’s business environment. Eric has been writing a book on exactly this topic, and his view is that the key foundation is to have the right corporate governance in place. He’s helped me ensure that Answer.AI will always reflect my vision and strategy for harnessing AI. We’re doing this by by setting up a for-profit organization that focuses on <em>long-term</em> impact. After all, over a long-enough timeframe, maximizing shareholder value and maximizing societal benefits are entirely aligned.</p>
<p>Whilst Eric and I bring very different (and complementary) skills and experiences to the table, we bring the same basic idea of how to solve really hard problems: solve smaller easier problems in simple ways first, and create a ladder where each rung is a useful step of itself, whilst also getting a little closer to the end goal.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-research-platform">
<h2 data-anchor-id="our-research-platform">Our research platform</h2>
<p>Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have been working on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). And they’ve done an astonishing job of that — we’re now at the point where experts in the field are claiming that “<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/">Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here</a>”.</p>
<p>At Answer.AI we are not working on building AGI. Instead, our interest is in effectively using the models that already exist. Figuring out what practically useful applications can be built on top of the foundation models that already exist is a huge undertaking, and I believe it is receiving insufficient attention.</p>
<p>My view is that the right way to build Answer.AI’s R&amp;D capabilities is by bringing together a very small number of curious, enthusiastic, technically brilliant generalists. Having huge teams of specialists creates an enormous amount of organizational friction and complexity. But with the help of modern AI tools I’ve seen that it’s possible for a single generalist with a strong understanding of the foundations to create effective solutions to challenging problems, using unfamiliar languages, tools, and libraries (indeed I’ve done this myself many times!) I think people will be very surprised to discover what a small team of nimble, creative, open-minded people can accomplish.</p>
<p>At Answer.AI we will be doing genuinely original research into questions such as how to best fine-tune smaller models to make them as practical as possible, and how to reduce the constraints that currently hold back people from using AI more widely. We’re interested in solving things that may be too small for the big labs to care about-—but our view is that it’s the collection of these small things matter a great deal in practice.</p>
<p>This informs how we think about safety. Whilst AI is becoming more and more capable, the dangers to society from poor algorithmic decision making have been with us for years. We believe in learning from these years of experience, and thinking deeply about how to align the <em>applications</em> of models with the needs of people today. At fast.ai three years ago we created a pioneering course on <a href="https://ethics.fast.ai/">Practical Data Ethics</a>, as well as dedicating <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/03_ethics.ipynb">a chapter of our book</a> to these issues. We are committed to continuing to work towards ethical and beneficial applications of AI.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-fast.ai-to-answer.ai">
<h2 data-anchor-id="from-fast.ai-to-answer.ai">From fast.ai to Answer.AI</h2>
<p>Rachel Thomas and I realised over seven years ago that deep learning and neural networks were on their way to becoming one of the most important technologies in history, but they were also on their way to being controlled and understood by a tiny exclusive sliver of society. We were worried about centralization and control of something so critical, so we founded fast.ai with the mission of making AI more accessible.</p>
<p>We succeeded beyond our wildest dreams, and today fast.ai’s AI courses are the longest-running, and perhaps most loved, in the world. We built the first library to make PyTorch easier to use and more powerful (fastai), built the fastest image model training system in the world (according to the Dawnbench competition), and created the 3-step training methodology now used by all major LLMs (ULMFiT). Everything we have created for the last 7 years was free—fast.ai was an entirely altruistic endeavour in which everything we built was gifted to everybody.</p>
<p>I’m now of the opinion that this is the time for rejuvenation and renewal of our mission. Indeed, the mission of Answer.AI is the same as fast.ai: to make AI more accessible. But the <em>method</em> is different. Answer.AI’s method will be to <em>use</em> AI to create all kinds of products and services that are really valuable and useful in practice. We want to research new ways of building AI products that serve customers that can’t be served by current approaches.</p>
<p>This will allow us to make money, which we can use to expand into more and bigger opportunities, and use to drive down costs through better efficiency, creating a positive feedback loop of more and more value from AI. We’ll be spending all our time looking at how to make the market size bigger, rather than how to increase our share of it. There’s no moat, and we don’t even care! This goes to the heart of our key premise: creating a long-term profitable company, and making a positive impact on society overall, can be entirely aligned goals.</p>
</section>
<section id="we-dont-really-know-what-were-doing">
<h2 data-anchor-id="we-dont-really-know-what-were-doing">We don’t really know what we’re doing</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, then I’ll tell you the honest truth: we don’t actually know what we’re doing. Artificial intelligence is a vast and complex topic, and I’m very skeptical of anyone that claims they’ve got it all figured out. Indeed, Faraday felt the same way about electricity—he wasn’t even sure it was going to be of any import:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am busy just now again on Electro-Magnetism and think I have got hold of a good thing but can’t say; it may be a weed instead of a fish that after all my labour I may at last pull up.”</em> Faraday 1931 letter to R. Phillips</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it’s OK to be uncertain. Eric and I believe that the best way to develop valuable stuff built on top of modern AI models is to try lots of things, see what works out, and then gradually improve bit by bit from there.</p>
<p>As Faraday said, “A man who is certain he is right is almost sure to be wrong.” Answer.AI is an R&amp;D lab for people who aren’t certain they’re right, but they’ll work damn hard to get it right eventually.</p>
<p>This isn’t really a new kind of R&amp;D lab. Edison did it before, nearly 150 years ago. So I guess the best we can do is to say it’s a new old kind of R&amp;D lab. And if we do as well as GE, then I guess that’ll be pretty good.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   
  <div><p>Tacit knowledge, often called “tribal knowledge” in tech, is prevalent in this industry. Documentation is a common afterthought and is frequently wrong, out of date, or lacking crucial information. New hires join a company and go through onboarding exercises intended to have them learn by doing. Often that learning means asking others when they get stuck. It becomes natural for an engineer to end up having key information in their head. When others need it, the engineer freely shares it. Until, the inevitable happens.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://er4hn.info/blog/2023.08.26-tacit-knowledge-dangerous/out_of_office.png" alt="Colleague out of office">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You need to know something not written down. You won’t be able to get an answer for a long time from the person who knows it best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person who knows what you need is not there. Maybe they left the company, maybe they are on vacation. You may really need to know about the whizbang service, but it’s been 4 years since anyone last worked on it and no-one remembers how it works. You’ve now fallen into the trap of tacit knowledge.</p>
<p>It’s easy, even efficient, to rely on tacit knowledge early on. It is often called tribal knowledge because it’s shared by people close to you, the proverbial tribe. This passing on of knowledge helps bond junior and senior members. The tribe passes this knowledge from seniors to juniors via rituals of song and dance. These songs will take form of video calls, ☕chats, instant message exchanges. Dances transmit information by moving the hand to ctrl+c from a notebook of useful commands, and pressing ctrl+v to send to a colleague. Other more advanced dances involve connecting to a colleagues machine to fix an issue or show a manual setup process that isn’t written down. These song and dance routines will hit their limit at some point.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://er4hn.info/blog/2023.08.26-tacit-knowledge-dangerous/graph_relative_time.png" alt="Relative time scales for learning">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graph showing relative time scales for different ways of learning something at work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where sharing tribal knowledge breaks down is at scale. It’s faster to shoot someone who knows the answer a message than to read the documentation, but only if that wise sage can respond quickly. If the holder of the knowledge is busy, in another timezone and you missed the end of their day, or are on vacation, you are out of luck until they return. The timezone problem is particularly painful. 3:30 pm pacific has 1.5 hours left in the 9 - 5 working day. But if you need help from someone on the east coast of the US, it’s 6:30 pm and they have gone home. That same time is 8 am in Australia, and 4 am in India. If you need help from someone on the other side of the world, you’ll be waiting for a while. This doesn’t even attempt to account for different countries having their own set of national holidays.</p>
<p>As a company scales, reliance on tacit knowledge becomes more of a burden. The amount of time it takes to answer a question is a blocker and needing to ask someone begins to consume more time due to both timezones as well as the busy nature of some senior people.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://er4hn.info/blog/2023.08.26-tacit-knowledge-dangerous/graph_getting_answers.png" alt="Graph showing time to get answers">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graph showing how it takes a long time to get answers when distributed. Asking a fourth question doesn’t even fit on the “large, distributed” row.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer it takes to get answers, the longer an engineer is blocked. These blockers begin to act as a drag on the ability of an engineer to be productive, and at scale slows down the company itself. Features took longer to ship, bugs take longer to fix. The company itself becomes less nimble and vulnerable to smaller players. This situation always existed, but was exacerbated by COVID and the rise of remote work. Coworkers that used to sit next to each other would now work from home. People moved to different cities, and sometimes moved across timezones. How then, can one try to regain productivity?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://er4hn.info/blog/2023.08.26-tacit-knowledge-dangerous/scaling_middle_ground.png" alt="Having docs and videos is the middle ground of scaling">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graph showing how reading docs and watching videos is still slower than asking people who know (and can respond quickly) but far faster than waiting for large, distributed teams to reply to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer lies in the original chart: As teams scale up and knowledge becomes more distributed, it is faster to read documentation and watch video lectures than it is to ask others for help. Personally, I am an avid reader and prefer reading (and grepping) for what I need to know. Others learn topics better through video lectures and that is fine. Both have a place, but documentation should always be there because it is easily searchable and easy to reference. By investing the time to create a library of information, both written and video, a middle ground is reached. It will never have that small co-located team efficiency, but it will scale far better than anything relying on tacit knowledge.</p>
<p>For those who need help in getting started with writing documentation, a previous blog post of mine discusses that as well. <a href="https://er4hn.info/blog/2023.07.22-good_docs_great_effort/">Good Docs Take Great Effort</a> is where I would suggest anyone start when they need to figure out how to write documentation or see where they may improve.</p>

<p>We’ve long noted how the FCC (regardless of party) <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/20/as-net-neutrality-debate-reheats-remember-the-real-problem-is-telecom-monopoly-power/">largely ignores</a> how muted competition and monopolization drives up prices for consumers. The agency often talks a good (if ambiguous) game about “bridging the digital divide,” but they don’t collect and share pricing data proving market failure, nor are they capable of admitting monopolies exist and are harmful in public-facing messaging.</p>
<p>As part of the Communications Act, the FCC is tasked with giving periodic reports on whether broadband is being delivered to all Americans on a “reasonable and timely basis.” If the answer is no, the regulator is theoretically supposed to, you know, actually do something about it. </p>
<p>Back in November, the agency issued a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-23-89A1.pdf">Notice of Inquiry (NOI)</a> pondering whether they should more seriously analyze the cost of broadband when making those determinations (yes, duh). As per tradition, the FCC NOI is pretty vague about things, but does acknowledge the importance of affordability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“To truly close the connectivity gap and ensure that all Americans have access to advanced telecommunications capability, broadband services must be affordable.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind this is just the FCC saying they’re <strong>thinking</strong> about taking a more consistent look at high broadband prices as part of their policy approach. It doesn’t mean they’ll actually do it, do it well, or punish any of the companies found to be monopolizing access and squashing competition to jack up market prices. </p>
<p>But even the faint possibility of the FCC looking at expensive U.S. broadband has been enough to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/12/cable-lobby-to-fcc-please-dont-look-too-closely-at-the-prices-we-charge/">send telecom lobbyists into a tizzy</a>, with cable lobbying organizations arguing in filings that <strong>even asking the question</strong> is “inappropriate”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“While the Commission has reiterated that it has no interest in any kind of rate regulation, the proposal to make a traditional deployment analysis contingent on whether the Commission determines that broadband pricing is sufficiently affordable suggests that rate regulation in some form is potentially on the table.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of Americans live under a monopoly or duopoly for broadband access protected by state and federal corruption. This muted competition consistently results in spotty coverage, high prices, slow speeds, and comically terrible customer service. And again, FCC officials can’t even openly admit there’s a monopoly/duopoly problem, much less field concrete solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, between the Trump era and the first two years of Biden term (where the FCC lacked a voting majority due to the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/07/telecom-monopolies-win-again-gigi-sohn-forced-to-withdraw-from-fcc-nomination/">attacks on Gigi Sohn</a>), the FCC was basically a cardboard cutout for <strong>six straight years</strong>. The telecom industry has grown fat and comfortable with the FCC performing regulatory theater where its functions are entirely decorative. A sort of regulatory simulacrum. </p>
<p>The fact that it’s 2023 and the FCC and NTIA have <em>only fairly recently</em> realized they should be considering affordability in broadband access policy genuinely speaks for itself. </p>
<p>And in the U.S., where Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T dictate the lion’s share of all telecom policy, the idea of rate regulation is treated as the most extreme possibility imaginable. Having a regulator ponder things like affordable wholesale access or any sort of rate caps is genuinely treated the same way you’d treat a batshit, naked streaker in a public mall. </p>
<p>But the FCC is making it very clear they lack the political backbone to get anywhere near price regulation. The net neutrality restoration similarly <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/26/biden-fcc-prepares-to-restore-net-neutrality-but-the-details-will-matter/">makes it very clear</a> that price regulation is off the table. But the simple act of even looking more closely at pricing data — so that the public has a clearer understanding of the impact of muted competition — is apparently a bridge too far for unchecked monopolists. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Austrian company Turbulence Solutions claims it's already flight-testing a system that can detect and neutralize air turbulence, reducing the forces felt by passengers by up to 80% – and reducing fuel burn by up to 10%. It's set to launch in 2024. </p><p>Nobody likes to fly through turbulence – which is tough luck, because climate change has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65844901" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">already caused it to increase by as much as 55%</a> on some popular routes, and it's projected to continue getting worse as temperatures rise, bringing wind speeds and thus wind shear along with them. </p><p>Where it can be accurately predicted, airliners will often go out of their way to go around it, hoping to avoid a whole lot of passenger distress as well as showers of vomit. But in clear air, it's nigh-on impossible to spot turbulence until you're in the middle of it, guts in your throat and praying for a quick death. </p><p>Enter Turbulence Solutions, which claims to have built and tested something that solves the problem, acting a little like an active noise cancellation system in a pair of headphones. Effectively, it detects turbulence just before it happens, and uses super-quick automated lift adjustment through the aircraft's control surfaces to generate forces in opposition to the turbulence. </p><div data-align-center="">

            </div><p>To predict what's about to hit the wings, the system uses 5-hole differential air pressure probes, mounted as far forward as possible. On the unmanned testbed above, for example, the company placed a pair of lightweight rails on front of the aircraft, holding up a third rail with the pressure sensors held out nearly as far as the wing tips. </p><p>On the manned test aircraft, the sensors were instead mounted directly to the wings, on long pole masts that placed them some 2.65 m (8.69 ft) forward of the leading edges.

<p><img alt="MULTIMEDIA" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/multimedia.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
The long-in-development work for <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/FFmpeg-CLI-Multi-Threaded">a fully-functional multi-threaded FFmpeg command line</a> has been merged! The FFmpeg CLI with multi-threaded transcoding pipelines is now merged to FFmpeg Git ahead of FFmpeg 7.0 releasing early next year. FFmpeg is widely-used throughout many industries for video transcoding and in today's many-core world this is a terrific improvement for this key open-source project.
</p><p>
In recently sharing a technical presentation on the FFmpeg multi-threading effort, FFmpeg developers <a href="https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/1731288541395587411">called</a> this work "<em>one of the most complex refactoring of the FFmpeg CLI in decades.</em>" And in calling for testing today <a href="https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/1734572553836851252">added</a>, "<em>Please test and report issues to [FFmpeg Trac] - this is one of the most complex changes in FFmpeg ever!</em>"
</p><p>
The code is now in <a href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commits/master">FFmpeg Git</a>. The patches include adding the thread-aware transcode scheduling infrastructure, moving encoding to a separate thread, and various other low-level changes. In culminating with converting FFmpeg to a threaded architecture is summed up as:
</p><blockquote>fftools/ffmpeg: convert to a threaded architecture
<p>
Change the main loop and every component (demuxers, decoders, filters, encoders, muxers) to use the previously added transcode scheduler. Every instance of every such component was already running in a separate thread, but now they can actually run in parallel.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=ffmpeg_cli_multithread" alt="FFmpeg threading"></p>
<p>There's a recent <a href="https://up.khirnov.net/7m.pdf">presentation</a> on this work by developer Anton Khirnov.
</p><p>
It's terrific seeing this merged and will be interesting to see the performance impact in practice.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, "what songs do you want me to play?"</p>

<p>They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and usually the songs are tolerable, at least.</p>

<p>But a few albums, like Bluey's soundtrack, transcend the children's genre. They're genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car.</p>

<p>Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you, besides a few duds, Ladybug Music <em>slaps</em>. And the songs incorporate diverse styles, too, it's not just the same nursery rhymes regurgitated in a bubbly voice.</p>

<p>So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed out.</p>

<p>I tapped one, and <em>nothing</em>. Just this notice:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/song-not-available.jpg" width="700" height="auto" alt="Song not available Apple Music on iPhone"></p>

<p>Not available in my region? Well, that's weird. I pay for Apple Music. And I know the artist is in the US, and <em>I'm</em> in the US...</p>

<p>But my kids were restless, and we had somewhere to be, so I put on Pinkfong for the drive. After I got home, I went online to investigate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This blog post is a transcript of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ">this video on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, Ladybug music isn't a huge artist, so there wasn't any news coverage, like "thousands of parents cry out as their favorite kids songs disappear from Apple Music!"</p>

<p>But I <em>did</em> find the <a href="https://ladybugmusic.com/">Ladybug Music website</a>.</p>

<p>And on that website, they have a <a href="https://ladybugmusic.com/shop/">shop</a>. Great! I can just buy the CDs, and support the artist directly!</p>

<p>And... no. Apparently Ladybug music is now an app. So I downloaded the App! Long story short, I created an account, and found out you either have to fly to LA and join one of the in-person kids music courses, or pay <a href="https://ladybugmusic.com/licensing-application/">$3000 in licensing fees</a> to get access to any of the songs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: I've also reached out to Ladybug Music using their contact form to ask about any other way to purchase the music, and have received no response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No bueno.</p>

<p>Scrounging around, you can get a few free songs from their YouTube or Soundcloud, and on Amazon a couple of used CDs are floating around... but there's literally no way to buy the music online anymore!</p>

<p>This isn't the first time I've seen a song disappear from Apple Music. And this kind of thing happens on Spotify and other streaming services too.</p>

<p>I can't get <em>too</em> mad, because I never actually "bought" those songs directly. I just rented them. That's the model for video streaming too, like on Netflix. Even though it's <em>super</em> annoying to have shows and music disappear, I <em>am</em> renting, so it's not like I have a <em>right</em> to anything.</p>

<h2>Playstation</h2>

<p>But that's just streaming. Luckily, you can also <em>buy</em> digital movies and music, and you get to keep it.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p><em>Right?</em></p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Enshittification has reached new heights, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/playstation-is-erasing-1318-seasons-of-discovery-shows-from-customer-libraries/">Sony just decided to yoink over a <em>thousand seasons</em></a>—that's right, <em>seasons</em>, not <em>episodes</em>—of Discovery shows from the PlayStation Store.</p>

<p>But they're not just removing them from the <em>store</em>.</p>

<p>They're removing them from people's <em>libraries</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library. (<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you paid full retail price for Mythbusters on your PlayStation, too bad. You can't watch it anymore.</p>

<p>That is, unless you go over and set up a new subscription to yet another completely unneccessary and broken streaming service from Warner Brothers.</p>

<p>The term for that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification"><em>enshittification</em></a>.</p>

<p>I'm not gonna rehash <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill">everything Cory Doctorow wrote</a> about this latest assault on digital ownership, but I'll summarize a few of the main things that get under my skin.</p>

<p>First, the headline: "If buying isn't owning, than piracy isn't stealing."</p>

<p>I made a whole video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VkY1vTpCJY">how I manage all my video content on my NAS</a>. I run software called Jellyfin, and I've ripped <em>hundreds</em> of movies and <em>thousands</em> of TV episodes over the years. My family can enjoy every movie and TV show I've bought, now and forever.</p>

<p>But <em>most</em> people don't do that. And even for crazies like me, it's getting harder. More and more TV series and movies are going stream-only.</p>

<p>Meaning the <em>only</em> way to ever watch it is to subscribe to yet another broken and temporary streaming service.</p>

<p>You'd think as the years wore on, society's access to media would get easier and better.</p>

<p>But instead, backwards-thinking execs in Hollywood and the music industry keep backpedaling, making it <em>harder</em> for you to actually watch the content they produce.</p>

<p>I mean, more and more of it is garbage anyway, but there are still compelling shows and movies out there. It's a shame they're committed to being so anti-consumer by killing off any semblance of ownership.</p>

<p>In my video about Jellyfin, I danced around the issue of piracy. Mostly because I know how pernicious the MPAA and RIAA are.</p>

<p>Well, you know what? I still don't officially endorse pirating content. But if there's literally <em>no other way</em> to view the content you already paid for? Who am I to judge?</p>

<p>And cracking DRM? First of all, it's <em>laughable</em> how bad DRM normally is. But second, DRM is the enabler of all the horrible, scummy business practices that lead to so much e-waste, <em>and</em> to kids being disappointed in their Dad for not being able to play music that's been available digitally for years.</p>

<p>So if you crack DRM to truly own the things you already paid for? Yeah, I don't got a problem with that.</p>

<p>Forget spaceships flying to Mars, I just want my music.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<li><strong>Works with any application in macOS:</strong> macOSpilot is application agnostic, and simply takes a screenshot of the currently active window when you trigger the assistant.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger with keyboard shortcut, speak your question:</strong> No need to juggle windows, just press the keyboard shortcut and speak your question.</li>
<li><strong>Answers in-context and in audio:</strong> The answer to your question is provided in an small window overlayed on top of your active window, and in audio (using text-to-speech).</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>macOSpilot runs NodeJS/Electron. Simply install the NodeJS project and dependencies (see below) and make the necessary configurations in <code>index.js</code>. Then chose to run <code>yarn start</code> from the terminal, or package it with Electron with the instructions below, add your OpenAI API key and let the application run in the background.</li>
<li>When you need to use macOSpilot, press the keyboard shortcut you've configured (default is Command+Shift+'). macOSpilot will take a screenshot of your currently active macOS application window and activate the microphone.</li>
<li>Speak your question into your microphone and then press the same keyboard shortcut to end the microphone recording.</li>
<li>macOSpilot will send your question to OpenAI's Whisper API, and the transcription will be sent to OpenAI's Vision API along with the screenshot.</li>
<li>The Vision API response will be displayed in a small notification window on top of your active macOS application window, and read outloud once it's been processed by OpenAI's TTS (text to speech) API.</li>
<li>A simple history of answers to your questions in the current session is available in another window that you can hide/minimize.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The most recent screenshot, audio recording, and TTS response will be stored on your machine in part for debugging purposes. The same filename is used every time so they will be overwritten, but are not automatically deleted when you close or delete the application.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Video walk-through</h3>
<p dir="auto">Prefer a video? Head on over to YouTube to watch the walk through of how to get started, how the application works, and a brief explanation of how it works under the hood.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IdCWqTZLyA" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/94417497/289893066-e96e314f-6778-42e5-8a9b-04ce9e6fc0b9.jpg?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.h1WiMJ0-bqY6wHVOqR_3v4HOBpZMwmq01OafGDb6Nkc" alt="YouTube walk-through and tutorial" secured-asset-link=""></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Install</h3>
<p dir="auto">Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. Then clone the repo and follow the steps below.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="
git  clone  https://github.com/elfvingralf/macOSpilot-ai-assistant.git
"><pre>git  clone  https://github.com/elfvingralf/macOSpilot-ai-assistant.git
</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Navigate to the folder and run <code>yarn install</code> or <code>npm install</code> in your folder. This should install all dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>yarn start</code> or <code>npm start</code>. Because the application needs access to read your screen, microphone, read/write files etc, you will need to go through the steps of granting it access and possibly restarting your terminal.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configurations</h3>
<p dir="auto">Make sure to add your OpenAI API key by clicking the settings icon in the top right-hand corner of the main window. (it's not stored encrypted!)</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to change the default values here's a few things that might be worth changing, all in <code>index.js</code>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Keyboard shortcut:</strong> The default keyboard shortcut <code>keyboardShortcut</code> is set to "CommandOrControl+Shift+'" (because it seemed like it was rarely used by other applications)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OpenAI Vision prompt:</strong> The OpenAI Vision API system prompt in <code>conversationHistory</code>, currently just set to "You are helping users with questions about their macOS applications based on screenshots, always answer in at most one sentence."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>VisionAPI image size:</strong> Image resize params to save some money, I left an example of how in <code>callVisionAPI()</code> (I found that I had much poorer results when using it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Application window sizes and settings:</strong> The size of the main window: <code>mainWindowWidth</code> and <code>mainWindowHeight</code>. The size of the notification window, which always remains on top: <code>notificationWidth</code> and <code>notificationHeight</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>More notification window settings:</strong> The level of opacity of the notification window: <code>notificationOpacity</code>. Where the notification window moves to on activation, relative to the active window: inside <code>positionNotificationAtTopRight()</code> (terrible naming, I know)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Turn it into an .app with Electron</h3>
<p dir="auto">Want to create an .app executable instead of running this from your terminal?</p>
<p dir="auto">First go to <code>index.js</code> and change <code>const useElectronPackager</code> from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Run one of these in your terminal, depending on which platform you're on.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm  run  package-mac
npm  run  package-win
npm  run  package-linux"><pre>npm  run  package-mac
npm  run  package-win
npm  run  package-linux</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note I have only tested this on Mac (Apple silicon and Intel).</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to <code>/release-builds/</code> in your project folder, and chose the folder of your platform. In there is an executable, <code>.app</code> if you're on Mac. Double-click it to open the app, note that it may take a few seconds the first time so be patient.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the app is opened, trigger your keyboard shortcut. You'll be asked to grant Privacy &amp; Security permissions. You may need to repeat this another one or two times for all permissions to work properly, and to restart the app.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE:</strong> I've had consistent issues getting macOS to trigger the Privacy &amp; Security Microphone dialog window for the .app, which means that I can't ask my question. If it works for you, or if you have a work-around to this issue, I'd love to know.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Improvements:</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some improvements I'd like to make, in no particular order:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Enable optional conversation state inbetween sessions (open/close application)</li>
<li>Use buffers instead of writing/reading screenshot and audio files to disk</li>
<li>Make assistant audio configurable in UI (e.g. speed, make playback optional)</li>
<li>Make always-on-top window configurable in UI (e.g. toggle sticky position, enable/disable)</li>
<li>Make screenshot settings configurable in UI (e.g. select area, entire screen)</li>
<li>Fix microphone issue not working as .app</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About / contact</h2>
<p dir="auto">I'm a self-taught and really like scrapping together fun projects. I write functional code that probably isn't beautiful nor efficient, and share it with the hope that someone else might find it useful.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find me as <a href="https://twitter.com/ralfelfving" rel="nofollow">@ralfelfving</a> on Twitter/X. If you liked this project, consider checking my tutorials on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ralfelfving" rel="nofollow">@ralfelfving</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/702-open-letter-against-surveillance">https://tuta.com/blog/702-open-letter-against-surveillance</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38611590">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today US politicians are going to vote on the FISA “Reform” Bill - the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 (FRRA). This bill would greatly expand
the surveillance possibilities of US and non-US citizens. Privacy-first companies like Mozilla, Tuta, and the Tor Project
now call on policymakers to not cement such surveillance measures with FISA 702 Surveillance.
</p><div><p>Ten years after the Snowden leaks the United States continues to spy on American citizens via its unconstitutional surveillance
program.</p>
<p><strong>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows US authorities to spy on foreigners to prevent terrorism
attacks. However, a vast amount of data from US citizens is scooped up by the NSA and regularly abused by
the FBI via <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/posts/why-a-backdoor-is-a-security-risk">backdoor searches on US citizens without warrants or probable cause</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This practise must end. FISA Section 702 must not be reauthorized.</strong></p>
<h2 id="open-letter-demands">Open Letter Demands</h2>
<p>We at Tuta together with other privacy-first companies are making clear in a joint open letter that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Congress should not provide a blank check for surveillance overreach by reauthorizing FISA 702 in NDAA;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Congress should pass a strong surveillance reform bill such as the Government Surveillance Reform Act (GSRA) or
the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act (PLEWSA), and that measures such as the House and Senate
Intelligence bills would only cement and expand the status quo of surveillance abuses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Simply put, the vitality of the Internet economy depends on strong surveillance reform that leave no room for backdoors.</strong></p>
<h3 id="open-letter-against-fisa-section-702">Open Letter Against FISA Section 702</h3>
<p>Dear Members of the House of Representatives,</p>
<p>We, a group of companies, builders, and providers of critical internet-based products and
services, write to you today in support of legislative proposals, such as the Government
Surveillance Reform Act, that would effectively address bipartisan and bicameral concerns
around consistent surveillance overreach. We also applaud the Protect Liberty and End
Warrantless Surveillance Act, which takes key steps forward in reform, and encourage you to
strengthen the bill further.</p>
<p>Additionally, current efforts to reauthorize Section 702 until April through the National Defense
Authorization Act would amount to rubber-stamping surveillance abuses, and we strongly
oppose such efforts.</p>
<p>As providers of digital products and services, both nonprofit and for-profit, we depend on the
trust of our customers to sustain digital communities. If widely-documented abuses go
unaddressed in legislation, individuals will remain concerned that their most intimate
information could be collected by intelligence agencies without accountability, thus deteriorating
the economic and social power of the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>While the current legislative debate may have been sparked by the imminent expiration of
Section 702 of FISA, the widely-documented surveillance abuses highlighted by policy experts
and members of Congress across the political spectrum would continue under narrow 702
“fixes,” especially ones that only cosmetically change FISA. For that very reason, we are
particularly concerned by reauthorization proposals by the House and Senate Intelligence
Committees that would only cement overbroad surveillance.</strong></p>
<p>A true reform proposal will need to address similar ways that the government surveils Americans
without adequate oversight and accountability, including warrantless purchases of Americans’
information from data brokers, narrowing the scope of surveillance in line with the President’s
own EO 14086, increasing the ability of Americans to stand up for their rights in court, and,
optimally, parallel reforms of EO 12333. These provisions would ensure that surveillance
overreach does not simply continue the day after a reform bill passes, but under a slightly
different authority. In other words, Congress should take this “functional” approach to
surveillance reform by addressing end results.</p>
<p><strong>The Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, while not containing all of these
provisions, would take critical steps forward in shielding Americans from overbroad
surveillance. Most notably, it would protect Americans from warrantless data broker purchases
and would create an ironclad warrant requirement for 702 surveillance of US persons, among
other provisions.</strong> Lawmakers should consider strengthening the bill, for example by increasing
transparency and accountability measures.</p>
<p>Of particular importance in both bills is inserting language codifying the scope of surveillance
proposed by the President’s own EO 14086 to tether surveillance of non-US persons to basic
guardrails.</p>
<p>We remain available to discuss the impact of reform proposals on the economy and on the
privacy of people online as you continue your thoughtful work.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey Reddit,</p>

<p>i recently noticed that there are way more scam ads on YouTube. And i am not talking about those ads of people selling you get rich quick courses, which i get to see way too often as well, i am talking about deep fake Elon Musk saying that he has built an AI powered trading bot that will allow you to make 1 million dollars in 6 months risk free and to be honest i can't tell that it is deep fake, it looks very real. Here is the link to the ad: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGb0BLYBOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGb0BLYBOs</a></p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/z7zagtomju5c1.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed808fbf9800784a6bb1698fac2317d8e5f2a85">https://preview.redd.it/z7zagtomju5c1.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed808fbf9800784a6bb1698fac2317d8e5f2a85</a></p>

<p>or here another one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE77YkmsbDc&amp;t=75s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE77YkmsbDc&amp;t=75s</a> </p>

<p>​</p>

<p>I am from Austria so i get to see the German version of these scams as well. Like this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Iyuyx5thgI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Iyuyx5thgI</a></p>

<p>or this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRY5dxnZ4E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRY5dxnZ4E</a></p>

<p>The first one i have seen so many times it gets ridiculous. Its about a famous German figure supposedly being sued by the central bank because he found an infinite money glitch.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>And because these scam ads are getting so annoying i started reporting them every time i see one, because i do understand that there are probably millions of advertisers on YouTube and sometimes these scams don't get detected right away. So i also reported that Fake Elon Musk Ad, but the next day i get shown the exact&nbsp;same ad again, then i open my email inbox finding a YouTube email about my report stating <strong>"We decided not to take this ad down.&nbsp;We found that the ad doesn’t go against&nbsp;Google’s policies".</strong> The same goes for all four ads listed above, all reported, all apparently not against policy.</p>

<p>So one of these two is true:</p>

<p>1 - Elon Musk has actually found a way to make everyone rich with ai.</p>

<p>2 - YouTube simply doesn't care about people getting scammed as long as they make money.</p>

<p>As much as i would like the first one to be true, these YouTube Ads are not cheap to run, with one of them running for more than a month with 364K views. So the fact that the scammers are able to afford these ads means that people keep falling for these scams, and YouTube doesn't seem to care at all.  </p>

<p>And i don't want to use an adblocker because i want the people i watch to get paid for their work, but i don't want them to be paid with the money from the victims of these scams. </p>

<p>Is this a regional problem in Austria or do you see these scams too? </p>

            <div><p>FORT MEADE, Md. - The National Security Agency (NSA) joins Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and U.S. and international partners in releasing <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Dec/06/2003352724/-1/-1/0/THE-CASE-FOR-MEMORY-SAFE-ROADMAPS-TLP-CLEAR.PDF">”The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps” Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI)</a>. Expanding on the “Software Memory Safety” CSI published by NSA in April 2023, the report provides guidance for software manufacturers and technology providers to create roadmaps tailored to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their products.</p><p>
&nbsp;
Memory safety vulnerabilities are coding errors affecting software’s memory management code in which memory can be accessed, written, allocated, or deallocated in unintended ways. Types of memory-related coding errors mentioned in the CSI include buffer overflow, use after free, use of uninitialized memory, and double free. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to access or corrupt data, or run arbitrary malicious code with the same privilege as the system owner.</p><p>
&nbsp;
“Memory safety vulnerabilities affect software development across all industries,” said Neal Ziring, Technical Director of NSA Cybersecurity Directorate. “Working together to set clear goals and timelines in transition roadmaps to safer programming language is critical for mitigating these problems.”</p><p>

In a shared conclusion, the co-authoring agencies recommend software manufacturers create roadmaps for the utilization of, and transition to, memory safe programming languages. This transition will enable memory safe programming languages to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities and reduce the products' attack surface. Recommended memory safe programming languages mentioned in the CSI include C#, Go, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. Software manufacturers should evaluate multiple memory safe programming languages before integrating them into their workflows.</p><p>

The CSI includes technical and non-technical factors for software manufacturers to consider when developing their roadmap. These include picking a memory safe language, staff capabilities and resourcing, and prioritization guidance. Additional guidance includes elements that should be part of the roadmaps, including the following: defined phases with dates and outcomes, dates for memory safe programming languages in new systems, internal developer training and integration plans, external dependency plans, transparency plans, and CVE support program plans.</p><p>
&nbsp;
The authoring agencies urge software manufacturers to create and publish memory safe roadmaps to plan and communicate how memory safety vulnerabilities will be mitigated in their products.</p><p>
&nbsp;
The authoring agencies include CISA, NSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) and Computer Emergency Response Team New Zealand (CERT NZ), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK). The agencies jointly developed this report as part of their Secure by Design campaign to urge software manufacturers to prioritize design and implementation practices to reduce customer risk by using memory safe languages in their products.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Christmas is coming up. When I used to work at a bank the entire month of December and a bit of January we were placed under “Change Freeze”. We weren’t allowed to deploy updates to our applications during this period. The thinking was:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lot of people are away over Christmas</li>
<li>Application changes can lead to crashes</li>
<li>People who know how to fix those crashes might be away</li>
</ol>
<p>To prevent this they just stopped us from deploying updates. That meant December was a pretty relaxing time to be working at a bank, and it was also a good time to do big refactors, clean up //TODOs or mess around with some new technology. So how about learning to code a game in C and build it out to WebAssmebly?</p>

<pre><code># Get the emsdk repo
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git

cd emsdk

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="featured">
                         <p>
            December 11th, 2023</p><!-- .entry-meta -->
        <p>The x86 instruction set has an <code>ENTER</code> instruction which builds a stack frame. It is almost always used with a zero as the second parameter.</p>
<pre>        enter   n, 0
</pre>
<p>This is functionally equivalent to</p>
<pre>        push    ebp
        mov     ebp, esp
        sub     esp, n
</pre>
<p>But what happens if you increase that second parameter beyond zero?</p>
<p>Values greater than zero for the second parameter are intended for languages like Pascal which support nested functions that can access the local variables of their lexical parents. <a title="What is a static chain pointer in the context of calling convention ABI?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231204-00/?p=109095"> We learned about these functions a short time ago</a>. But the designers of the x86 instruction set had a different design in mind for how a function can access the variables of its lexical parent: Instead of receiving a pointer to the start of a linked list of lexical parent frames, they receive an <i>array</i> of pointers to lexical parent frames.</p>
<p>In its full generality, the</p>
<pre>    enter n, k + 1
</pre>
<p>instruction goes like this:</p>

<pre>    push    ebp
    mov     internal_register, esp
   <span> sub     ebp, 4 </span> ⎱ <span><var>k</var> times</span>
   <span> push    [ebp]  </span> ⎰
    push    internal_register
    mov     ebp, internal_register
    sub     esp, n
</pre>
<p>If you ignore the order of operations and worry just about the final state, then you can reinterpret it like this, which I think captures the essence of the instruction better:</p>
<pre>    push    ebp
   <span> push    [ebp-4]   </span>
   <span> push    [ebp-8]   </span> <span><var>k</var> pushes</span>
   <span> :                 </span>
   <span> push    [ebp-4*<var>k</var>] </span>
    lea     ebp, [esp + 4*<var>k</var>]    ; where we pushed the previous ebp
    push    ebp		        ; add our own frame to the array
    sub     esp, n
</pre>
<p>Let’s look at our example function again.</p>
<pre>function Outer(n: integer) : integer;
    var i: integer;

    procedure Update(j: integer);
    begin
        i := i + j
    end;

    procedure Inner(m: integer);

        procedure MoreInner;
        begin
            Update(m)
        end;

    (* Inner body begins here *)
    begin
        MoreInner
    end;

(* Outer body begins here *)
begin
    i := 0;
    Inner(n);
    Outer := i
end;
</pre>
<p>On entry to <code>Outer</code>, the stack looks like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>n</code> parameter</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>return address</td>
<td>← <var>esp</var></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>Outer</code> function establishes its stack frame by performing an <code>enter 4, 1</code>. The extra <code>1</code> at the end means that this is the outermost of a chain of nested functions. In our cookbook, <var>k</var> is zero, so the functional equivalent is</p>
<pre>    push    ebp
                                ; no pointers copied from parent
    lea     ebp, [esp+0]        ; equivalently, "mov ebp, esp"
    push    ebp                 ; pointer to our own frame
    sub     esp, 4
</pre>
<p>and we wind up with this stack frame for <code>Outer</code>:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>Outer</code> frame</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>n</code> parameter</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>return address</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td rowspan="2">▶︎</td>
<td rowspan="2">previous <var>ebp</var></td>
<td rowspan="2">← <var>ebp</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
<td rowspan="2"><code>Outer</code> frame pointer</td>
<td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td>← <var>esp</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That extra <code>,1</code> caused us to push the address of where we saved the previous <code>ebp</code>, which I’ve called the <code>Outer</code> frame pointer. That value isn’t really useful to us right now, since we already have that value in the <var>ebp</var> register. But it comes in handy when we call <code>Inner</code>.</p>
<p>On entry to <code>Inner</code>, the stack looks like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>m</code> parameter</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>return address</td>
<td>← <var>esp</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>Inner</code> function performs an <code>enter 0, 2</code>. The 0 means that <code>Inner</code> has no local variables, and the <code>2</code> means that we are now the second level in a chain of nested functions.</p>
<p>The functional equivalent now has one extra memory push before we push a pointer to our own frame:</p>
<pre>    push    ebp
   <span> push    [ebp-4]  </span>           ; one pointer copied from parent
    lea     ebp, [esp+4]
    push    ebp                 ; pointer to our own frame
    sub     esp, 4
</pre>
<p>Before pushing the address of its own frame, the <code>enter</code> instruction also copies one pointer from the parent’s frame, namely the <code>Outer</code> frame pointer.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><code>Inner</code> frame</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<p>Now things are interesting.</p>
<p>The <code>Inner</code> function has access to its own frame, via the <var>ebp</var> register (and redundantly via the <code>Inner</code> frame pointer on its stack). It also has access to the <code>Outer</code> frame through its local copy of the <code>Outer</code> frame pointer.</p>
<p>The next thing that happens is that <code>Inner</code> calls <code>More­Inner</code> with no parameters. This time <code>More­Inner</code> uses <code>enter 0, 3</code> where the 0 means that <code>More­Inner</code> has no local variables, and the <code>3</code> means that it is a nested function three levels deep, so it should copy <i>two</i> frame pointers from its parent.</p>

<p>The frame for <code>MoreInner</code> contains its own parameters and local variables (nothing), plus pointers to both parent frames, plus a pointer to its own frame (which <code>More­Inner</code> doesn’t use, but which is ready for any nested function to use).</p>
<p>The code generation for <code>MoreInner</code> therefore reads the value of <code>m</code> by following the <code>Inner</code> frame pointer and then reading the <code>m</code> parameter from the <code>Inner</code> frame’s parameter space.</p>
<p>After <code>More­Inner</code> calls <code>Update</code>, the <code>Update</code> function starts with an <code>enter 0, 2</code> because it is a level-2 nested function. This copies only the <code>Outer</code> frame pointer to <code>Update</code>‘s frame, resulting in this:</p>

<p>I didn’t draw it, but the “previous <var>ebp</var>” in the <code>Update</code> frame points to the <code>More­Inner</code> frame.</p>
<p>The <code>Update</code> function reads <code>j</code> from its own parameter space and uses to update the <code>i</code> variable in <code>Outer</code>‘s frame by following the <code>Outer</code> frame pointer.</p>
<p>The result is the same as the <a title="What is a static chain pointer in the context of calling convention ABI?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231204-00/?p=109095"> System V Application Binary Interface static chain pointer</a>, but it’s done in a different way. Instead of passing the head of a linked list of frames, the <code>enter</code> instruction copies an entire array of pointers to frames. This reduces the number of instructions required in order to access faraway frames, but it increases the cost of a function call due to the extra copying.</p>
<p>I wonder if anybody uses the Intel design for nested functions. I suspect it’s silicon on the CPU that is completely wasted.</p>

    </div><p>Researchers at The Park Center for Mental Health, Australia, have added to the growing body of evidence that cat ownership is a major risk factor for schizophrenia and quantified the risk at more than double.</p>

                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>In a paper, "Cat Ownership and Schizophrenia-Related Disorders and Psychotic-Like Experiences: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis," <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbad168/7458104?redirectedFrom=fulltext">published</a> in <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>, the team details the connections between youth cat ownership and later-in-life schizophrenia-related diagnosis.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted an extensive study search across various databases and gray literature from January 1, 1980, to May 30, 2023, without geographical or language limitations. They included studies reporting original data on cat ownership and schizophrenia-related outcomes. Out of 1,915 identified studies, 17 were used from 11 different countries.</p>
<p>Cat ownership was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia-related disorders. The unadjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) was 2.35, and the adjusted estimate was 2.24, indicating an over twofold increase in the odds of developing schizophrenia-related disorders among all individuals exposed to cats.</p>
<p>While some studies suggest childhood exposure to cats might be associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia-related disorders, the exact age or specific time frame of exposure is not clearly defined across all studies.</p>
<p>One included study from Finland initially reported higher scores on perceptual aberration, schizoid, and social anhedonia scales for those exposed to cats under age seven, though they limited their conclusion to perceptual aberration. Another study from the UK found associations between cat exposure during childhood (at 4 and 10 years) and higher psychotic-like experiences at age 13.</p>
<p>The research suggests that the critical window of exposure needs to be better defined and might be influenced by various factors. More robust investigations are needed to precisely identify the specific period of exposure that might pose the highest risk for schizophrenia-related disorders associated with youth cat exposure.</p>
<p>The overall risk trend focuses on the interaction between the developing brain and feline exposure. But of course, it is not just hanging out with cat personalities that is to blame for the higher risk. There is a causal agent operating unseen in the cat environment that is likely the true culprit—Toxoplasma gondii.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Toxoplasmosis</h2>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, an infection that around 25% of the world population has gotten at some point.</p>
<p>It is the reason kitty litter bags have a warning label for pregnant women to avoid contact with cat feces, as toxoplasmosis infection is the leading cause of newborn blindness globally, as well as later vision loss, mental disability, and seizures.</p>
<p>Toxoplasmosis can be a significant cause of death among people with severely weakened immune systems. A daily drug is taken by patients with AIDS, undergoing organ transplant, or with intense chemotherapy treatments just to counter the effects of this one parasite.</p>
<p>T. gondii has previously been linked with all sorts of neurological impairments and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/behavioral+changes/" rel="tag">behavioral changes</a>, from guilt issues to novelty seeking and increased car accidents. Some presentations of schizophrenia can be reversed by antiprotozoal drugs, suggesting that a T. gondii infection may have been the root cause of those case symptoms.</p>
<p>A 2012 <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analysis/" rel="tag">meta-analysis</a> of 38 studies, "Toxoplasma gondii and Other Risk Factors for Schizophrenia," also <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/38/3/642/1867672">published</a> in <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>, found that patients with schizophrenia were nearly three times more likely to have toxoplasma antibodies in their blood, suggesting past infections were far more prevalent with the pathology.</p>
<p>A striking find in that study, while comparing risk factors for schizophrenia, was the discrepancy between the risk associated with having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia (RR 6.99–9.31) and the risk associated with specific genetic polymorphisms (OR 1.09–1.24). While a family disease pattern can suggest the involvement of shared genes, it can also point to nongenetic factors like environmental exposure to an infectious agent, like a chemical superfund site, or cats.</p>
<p>Toxoplasmosis has also been linked to various wildlife illnesses, as behavioral changes in <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wild+animals/" rel="tag">wild animals</a> often result in poor survival strategies. Rats, for example, become unafraid of cats while infected. It is a common comorbidity for most California sea lions found distressed or dead to have a toxoplasma infection. If anyone is wondering how a sea lion has contact with a cat, try to see a sandy beach from a cat's perspective. That and the human habit of flushing cat litter have created a massive problem for marine mammals.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Why cats?</h2>
<p>The connection to cats has to do with T. gondii's affinity for reproducing only in domestic cats. This affinity may be related to the lack of a single enzyme in feline guts, delta-6-desaturase.</p>
<p>While any mammal can become infected by the parasite, the digestive enzyme delta-6-desaturase prevents the parasite from getting high enough levels of linoleic acid the parasite requires to fuel reproduction.</p>
<p>Unlike all other mammals, cats are full of linoleic acid due to not producing the data-6-desaturase enzyme that would convert linoleic acid to oleic acid. So, the parasite only reproduces in cat intestines.</p>
<p>Cats then shed oocytes (protozoan parasite eggs) by the millions when they defecate, trapping them on fur and paw used to dutifully cover up their deposit, tracking them wherever a cat's paw may wander.</p>
<p>With the parasite completing its lifecycle, it may not affect the rest of cat biology. In humans and other animals, the failure to turn into the larger reproductive form allows the tiny parasite to migrate past the blood-brain barrier, where the disruption occurs.</p>
<p>The missing enzyme and the independent social lives of outdoor cats, mingling in shared sandboxes and loose garden soils around the world, make cat contact the primary vector for the infection. The secondary vector would be anything that has been in contact with a cat, such as a kitchen counter or any surface a cat has walked on or rubbed against.</p>
<p>While social media has clearly made the case that society would crumble without cats, it is important for all cat owners never to allow their cats outdoors to prevent the continued spread of the T. gondii parasite.</p>
<p>It is even more important that parents, with or without cats, understand the danger cat-borne <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/parasites/" rel="tag">parasites</a> can pose to the long-term <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag">mental health</a> of their children.</p>

<p>Microsoft's OpenAI headaches might not be going away following reports that now the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is considering an investigation into the Windows giant's investment in the company.</p>
<p>At question, should the FTC opt to open a formal examination, is whether any antitrust rules have been broken. Despite the money poured into it over the years, OpenAI <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/our-structure">was founded as a non-profit</a> in 2015, and Microsoft's investment does not amount to control of the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft chief communications officer Frank X Shaw underlined attempts to dampen down industry talk of a probe: "While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions."</p>

    

<p><i>The Register</i> contacted the FTC for its view on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/ftc-makes-preliminary-antitrust-queries-into-microsoft-openai?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reports</a> and will update should we receive a response.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft has invested upwards of $10 billion in OpenAI to fund the computing power needed to train AI models. To see a return, Microsoft is shoehorning ChatGPT into every corner of its portfolio. However, the recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/21/microsoft_openai_altman_nadella/">departure and subsequent return</a> of OpenAI boss Sam Altman rattled execs in Microsoft HQ.</p>
<p>As such, the Windows vendor parachuted a non-voting observer into OpenAI's board.</p>

</ul>
<p>At the end of last week, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/microsofts_relationship_with_openai_now/">launched</a> a consultation to ask interested parties to comment on Microsoft's relationship with ChatGPT developer, and if it could be construed as a merger that potentially skews competition.</p>
<p>If so, the CMA will itself launch an official inspection.</p>

        

<p>The FTC has already begun <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/13/ftc_openai_investigation/">investigating</a> OpenAI's ChatGPT over privacy and reputational concerns. It is also no stranger to Microsoft. Despite the company's $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard seemingly going ahead in October, the FTC has continued its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter">attempts</a> to undo the merger.</p>
<p>In October, the UK's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/13/cma_criticizes_microsoft_as_it/">CMA gave Microsoft's $69 billion buy of Activision Blizzard the green light</a> but criticized the tactics employed by Microsoft to push through the deal.</p>
<p>"Businesses and their advisors should be in no doubt that the tactics employed by Microsoft are no way to engage with the CMA," said the regulator's CEO, Sarah Cardell. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three years after <em>Fortnite-</em>maker Epic Games sued Apple and Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23944251/epic-google-antitrust-trial-explainer-monopoly">for allegedly running illegal app store monopolies</a>, Epic has a win. The jury in <em>Epic v. Google </em>has just <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.606.0.pdf">delivered its verdict</a> — and it found that Google turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly.</p><p>After just a few hours of deliberation, the jury unanimously answered yes to every question put before them — that Google has monopoly power in the Android app distribution markets and in-app billing services markets, that Google did anticompetitive things in those markets, and that Epic was injured by that behavior. They decided Google has an illegal tie between its Google Play app store and its Google Play Billing payment services, too, and that its distribution agreement, Project Hug deals with game developers and deals with OEMs were all anticompetitive.</p><p>Google affairs and public policy vp Wilson White said the company plans to appeal the verdict, and that “The trial made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles.” You can read theirfull statement further down.</p><p>In <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fsite%2Fen-US%2Fnews%2Fepic-v-google-trial-verdict-a-win-for-all-developers">a post on its company blog</a>, Epic Games said, “Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world.

Google</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">turned out to be a very different case</a>. It hinged on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap#:~:text=This%20trial%20destroyed%20any%20notion%20that%20Google%20treats%20developers%20fairly%20and%20equally.">secret revenue sharing deals</a> between Google, smartphone makers, and big game developers, ones that Google execs internally believed were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap#:~:text=Google%20execs%20clearly%20wanted%20to%20block%20other%20app%20stores.">designed to keep rival app stores down</a>.

He also said he did not intend to decide what percentage fee Google should charge for its products. </p><p>Although Epic didn’t sue for damages, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney suggested Epic stood to make hundreds of millions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970123/tim-sweeney-just-laughed-and-agreed-hed-love-to-make-billions-of-dollars-by-not-paying-google-anythi">or even billions of dollars</a> if it doesn’t have to pay Google’s fee. </p><p>Here’s the completed verdict form that jurors had to fill out in<em> Epic v. Google: </em></p><p><strong>Wilson White, Google VP, Government Affairs &amp; Public Policy:</strong></p><div><blockquote><p><em>We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform. The trial made clear that we compete fiercely with Apple and its App Store, as well as app stores on Android devices and gaming consoles. We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem.”</em></p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update December 11th, 8:45PM ET:</strong> Added statements from both Google and Epic Games as well as final jury verdict.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>Earlier this week, both the House Committee on the Judiciary (HJC) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) marked up two very different bills (</span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/RCP_6570_xml.pdf"><span>H.R. 6570</span></a><span> - Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act in HJC, and HR 6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 in HPSCI), both of which would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)—but in very different ways. Both bills head to the House floor next week under a procedural rule called “</span><a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS20313.html"><span>Queen of the Hill</span></a><span>,” where the bill with the most votes gets sent to the Senate for consideration.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>While renewing any surveillance authority remains a complicated and complex issue, this choice is clear - we urge all Members to vote NO on the Intelligence Committee’s bill, </b><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20231207/116666/BILLS-118pih-ReformandreauthorizeauthoritiesoftheForeignIntelligenceSurveillanceActof1978.pdf"><b>H.R.6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023</b></a><b>.</b></p>

<p><span>TELL congress: Defeat this bad 702 Bill<br></span></p>
<p><span>On Nov. 16, HPSCI </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/intelligence-committees-proposals-702-reauthorization-bill-are-beyond-bad"><span>released a report </span></a><span>calling for reauthorization of Section 702 with essentially superficial reforms. The bill that followed, H.R. 6611, was as bad as expected. It would renew the mass surveillance authority Section 702 for another eight years. It would create new authorities that the intelligence community has sought for years, but that have been denied by the courts. It would continue the indiscriminate collection of U.S. persons’ communications when they talk with people abroad for use by domestic law enforcement. This was not the intention of this national security program, and people on U.S. soil should not have their communications collected without a warrant because of a loophole.</span></p>
<p><span>As a reminder, Section 702 was designed to allow the government to warrantlessly surveil non-U.S. citizens abroad for foreign intelligence purposes. Increasingly, it’s this U.S. side of digital conversations that domestic law enforcement agencies trawl through—all without a warrant. FBI agents have been using the Section 702 databases to conduct millions of invasive searches for Americans’ communications, including those of </span><a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/e9e72454-4156-49b9-961a-855706216063/2023%20PCLOB%20702%20Report%20(002).pdf#page=157"><span>protesters</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/e9e72454-4156-49b9-961a-855706216063/2023%20PCLOB%20702%20Report%20(002).pdf#page=157"><span>racial justice activists</span></a><span>, 19,000 </span><a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/21/2021_FISC_Certification_Opinion.pdf#page=29"><span>donors</span></a><span> to a congressional campaign, </span><a href="https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/22nd_Joint_Assessment_of_FISA_702_Compliance_CLEARED_REDACTED_FOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE.pdf#page=60"><span>journalists</span></a><span>, and even </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/21/fbi-improper-search-senator-court"><span>members of Congress</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, the HPSCI bill authorizes the use of this </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/deja-vu-fbi-proves-again-it-cant-be-trusted-section-702"><span>unaccountable and out-of-control</span></a><span> mass surveillance program as a new way of vetting asylum seekers by sifting through their digital communications. According to </span><a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/2023/FISC_2023_FISA_702_Certifications_Opinion_April11_2023.pdf"><span>a newly released Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) opinion</span></a><span>, the government has sought some version of this authority for years, but was repeatedly denied it, only receiving court approval for the first time this year. Because the court opinion is so heavily redacted, it is impossible to know the current scope of immigration- and visa-related querying, or what broader proposal the intelligence agencies originally sought.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This new authority proposes to give immigration services the ability to audit entire communication histories before deciding whether an immigrant can enter the country. This is a particularly problematic situation that could cost someone entrance to the United States based on, for instance, their own or a friend’s political opinions—as happened to a </span><a href="https://time.com/5663283/harvard-student-visa-ismail-ajjawi-lebanon/"><span>Palestinian Harvard student</span></a><span> when his social media account was reviewed when coming to the U.S. to start his semester.</span></p>
<p><span>The HPSCI bill also includes a call “to define Electronic Communication Service Provider to include equipment.” Earlier this year, the FISA Court of Review released a </span><a href="https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/2023_FISC-R_ECSP_Opinion.pdf"><span>highly redacted opinion</span></a><span> documenting a fight over the government's attempt to subject an unknown company to Section 702 surveillance. However, the court agreed that under the circumstances the company did not qualify as an "electronic communication service provider" under the law. Now, the HPSCI bill would expand that definition to include a much broader range of providers, including those who merely provide hardware through which people communicate on the Internet. Even without knowing the details of the secret court fight, this represents an ominous expansion of 702's scope, which the committee introduced without any explanation or debate of its necessity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By contrast, the House Judiciary Committee bill, H.R. 6570, the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, would actually address a major problem with Section 702 by banning warrantless backdoor searches of Section 702 databases for Americans’ communications. This bill would also prohibit law enforcement from purchasing Americans’ data that they would otherwise need a warrant to obtain, a practice that circumvents core constitutional protections. Importantly, this bill would also renew this authority for only three more years, giving Congress another opportunity to revisit how the reforms are implemented and to make further changes if the government is still abusing the program.</span></p>
<p><span>EFF has long fought for significant changes to Section 702.

Our government, with the FBI in the lead, has come to treat Section 702—enacted by Congress for the surveillance of foreigners on foreign soil —as a domestic surveillance program of Americans. This simply cannot be allowed to continue. While we will continue to push for further reforms to Section 702, we urge all members to reject the HPSCI bill.</span></p>

    <p>The largest beaver dam on Earth was discovered via satellite imagery in 2007, and since then only one person has trekked into the Canadian wild to see it. It’s a half-mile long and has created a 17-acre lake in the northern forest — a testament to the beaver’s resilience.</p>

<div>
<p>Wood Buffalo National Park, the largest national park in Canada, covers an area the size of Switzerland and stretches from Northern Alberta into the Northwest Territories. Only one road enters it from Alberta, and one from the NWT. If not for people observing it from airplanes and helicopters, and satellites photographing it, little would be known about big parts of it. The park is a variety of landscapes — boreal swamps, fens, bogs, black spruce forests, salt flats, gypsum karst, permafrost islands, and prairies that extend the continent’s central plains to their northern limit. The wood buffalo in the park’s name are bison related to the Great Plains bison. In this remoteness, the buffalo descend from the original population, and the wolves that prey on them are also the wild originals. Millions of birds summer and breed here. The park holds one of the last remaining breeding grounds of the whooping crane. </p>
<p>Other superlatives and near-superlatives: the delta in the park’s southeast where the Peace River and the Athabasca River come together is one of the largest freshwater deltas in the world; last summer, some of Canada’s largest forest fires burned in the park and around it; and — just inside the park’s southern border — is the largest beaver dam in the world.</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>Animal technology created the largest beaver dam in the world, but human technology revealed it.</blockquote>
</div>
                        

<p>The dam is about a half-mile long and in the shape of an arc made of connected arcs, like a recurve bow. The media has known about it for 16 years, and in that time no bigger beaver dam has come to light, so it’s still known as the biggest, and scientists believe it almost certainly is. Animal technology created it, but human technology revealed it. In 2007, Jean Thie, a Dutch-born landscape ecologist who lives near Ottawa, was looking at the latest satellite imagery of places he had examined via satellite in 1973 and 1974, when he was studying permafrost. It’s hard to remember, but in the early ‘70s some scientists thought the Earth might be cooling. Thie’s research had showed evidence of the opposite; the paper about permafrost melting that he published in 1974 is now considered one of the pioneering studies of climate change.</p>

<p>As he looked over 1970s images taken by NASA’s Landsat satellite and compared them with the latest images from Google Earth and other sources, he noticed that in certain landscapes the evidence of beavers now was everywhere. From being almost wiped out by the fur trade between about 1600 and the 20<sup>th</sup> century, beavers had bounced back. Just one example was a belt about 1,100 miles long that extended into Wood Buffalo Park. Among the hundreds of beaver dams in this area Thie came across one that looked bigger. He measured it and found it to be 2,790 feet long, or about a half-mile. The 17-acre lake created by the dam reposed undisturbed, shiny and opaque in its swampy northern forest, and in the middle of the lake the small brown dot of a beaver lodge could be seen.</p>

<div>
<p>On October 5, 2007, Thie posted the satellite photo of the dam on the Google Earth Community Forum, with text explaining that it was probably the world’s largest. Seven months later, a reporter for Canadian Broadcasting Company Radio saw the posting and did a story about it. Other outlets picked up the story, and “the world’s largest beaver dam,” a phrase that’s satisfying to say and think about, achieved a modest international fame.</p>
<p>Many of the beavers that have reestablished themselves globally are descended from beavers that were planted by wildlife biologists. The thriving beaver population of Tierra del Fuego (another place Thie has studied) is descended from beavers brought to Argentina from Canada’s Saskatchewan River, who are themselves scions of beavers transplanted from upstate New York. No reintroduction of beavers was done in Wood Buffalo Park. Thie believes that the beavers who built the dam are of original stock. Like the wood buffalo and the wolves, they were too remote to be wiped out.</p>

  <blockquote>At the request of the Mikisew Cree First Nation, UNESCO has investigated environmental threats to Wood Buffalo National Park.</blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>The officials who run the park heard about the world’s largest beaver dam because of Thie’s discovery, like everybody else. Until the CBC reporter called them for comment, they had not known that their park contained the world’s largest beaver dam. None of the park’s personnel had ever been to it, or has visited it on the ground (or what passes for ground there), to this day. When I called Tim Gauthier, the park’s external relations manager, he said that he had flown over the dam many times but never stood on or near it. He did not know if the water in the lake was still deep enough to cover the entrance to the lodge or lodges. In these remoter areas of the park, he said, “we tend to let such things regulate themselves.”</p>
<p>Since 1983, Wood Buffalo National Park has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the environmental and cultural agency of the United Nations. In more recent years, this designation has become shaky; at the request of the Mikisew Cree First Nation, whose members gather traditional resources in the park and depend on it for cultural survival, UNESCO has twice investigated environmental threats to the park and has come close to declaring it officially endangered. Wood Buffalo Park is now on UNESCO probation, and the governments of Canada and Alberta are supposed to fix its problems.</p>

<p>The park is suffering the worst drought in its history. Flows are down by half in many places, owing to climate change, water diversion, poor seasonal snowpack, and dams on the Peace River, upstream in British Columbia. A danger that seems inescapable comes from the oil sands that are being mined for crude-oil-containing bitumen, and from tailing ponds that hold trillions of liters of mine-contaminated water. The ponds are near the banks of the Athabasca River, just upstream from the park boundary. They are fatal to birds that land on them. Given the direction that water flows, conservationists and native people fear the tailings will pollute the park eventually. Toxic chemicals have already been found in McClelland Lake, just southeast of the park. Locals stopped taking their drinking water from the lake years ago.</p>
<p>Gillian Chow-Fraser, the boreal program manager for the Northern Alberta chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, in Edmonton, travels in the park often by helicopter, canoe, and foot. She has described the park’s environment as “super degraded.” When I spoke with her by phone not long ago, she talked about a recent tailing basin leak that was not reported to the First Nations downstream of it for nine months. In places that used to flood regularly but now don’t, the land is drying out and vegetation disappearing. Though she crisscrosses the park, she has never seen the world’s largest beaver dam, but she’s grateful that it’s there and bringing the park attention.</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>The idea of going to the world’s largest beaver dam came to Rob Mark after reading about Thie’s discovery.</blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>Another expert, Phillip Meintzer, conservation specialist with the Alberta Wilderness Association, told me that he hadn’t seen the dam, either, but that the park’s difficulty of access is a good thing, in a way, because it keeps people from visiting in large numbers and putting stress on the area. The downside is that environmental degradation, like the recent tailings seepage, can happen without many watchers finding out. Meintzer’s main worry is that when the economy shifts to renewables, the oil sands will be abandoned and taxpayers stuck with the cleanup. What will be done about the multi-trillion liters of toxic tailings is unknown. “Last summer I was on a trip to test water quality in and around McClelland Lake,” he said. “We camped by the shore, and all night in this remote and uninhabited place we could hear the propane cannons at the nearby tailings ponds firing to scare off the birds.”</p>
<hr><p>As far as is known, only one person has ever been to the world’s largest beaver dam. In July 2014, Rob Mark, of Maplewood, New Jersey, 44 years old at the time, reached the dam after a challenging journey. Holding the flag of the Explorers Club, the international organization with headquarters in New York City, he took a photo of himself standing on the dam. The top of the structure was the only solid ground he had encountered for miles. After he got back, a newspaper in Edmonton did a story about him, and he appeared in other newspapers and a travel magazine. His achievement is like the dam in that so far no one has said it isn’t unique.

<p>Mark is now a blueberry farmer in Virginia. When I reached him by phone, he told me he did solo extreme treks unsponsored and for his own pleasure. In 2007, he crossed South America from the Pacific Ocean to the Amazon River by hiking over the Andes. The idea of going to the world’s largest beaver dam occurred to him after he read about Jean Thie’s discovery. He planned the trek for several years, and in 2011, he flew to Fort McMurray — the Alberta town, more than 100 miles from the dam, that is the hub of the oil sands industry — to see how he could get from A to B.</p>
                        
 <!-- footnoteBlock -->
                        

<div>
<p>His plan was to go down the Athabasca River by boat, then hike through the muskeg peatland. That proving impracticable, he returned home and decided he would come at the dam from another direction, by way of Lake Claire, whose southwestern edge is about 10 miles from it. Crossing the lake by boat, a distance of about 25 miles, and then hiking to the dam, seemed straightforward enough. But the lake is more like a wetter spot in a swamp than a lake. Sometimes it does not have enough water for boats. Mark waited three years for that problem to improve. In 2014 it did, and Mark went to the town of Fort Chipewyan, east of Lake Claire, and hired a man to ferry him.</p>
<p>The lake has no real shore, it just gets shallower at the edges. At a chosen point Mark got out and arranged for the boatman to return and pick him up there in six days. Mark noted the coordinates in his handheld GPS and told them to the boatman. The boatman replied that he had no GPS. That was a detail Mark had not thought of. The boatman told him to cut one of the nearby willows and stick it in a more conspicuous place in the swamp-lake, and they arranged to meet by it. Then the boatman left, and Mark began his trek.
</p>
</div>
                        
<div>
  <blockquote>Mostly the route, which required two days of slogging, was just swamp. The last mile to the dam took Mark five hours.</blockquote>
</div>
                        

<div>
<p>The mosquitos swarmed like nothing he’d seen in the Amazon. He was ready for that and for trying not to go crazy from their noise. The sphagnum moss islands submerged slowly under his weight, step by step, as he grasped at willows to sort of brachiate on. By looking at the tree species shown on satellite photos he had plotted a route along comparatively higher ground, and he tried to keep to that. Mostly the route, which required two days of slogging, was just swamp. The last mile to the beaver dam took him five hours.</p>
<p>Late in the long subarctic afternoon he emerged into the clear patch of sky created by the dam’s lake, waded to the dam, and stepped onto it. The dam is no more than three feet high at any point. He realized that a person seeing it up close would never guess it extended for half a mile. To grasp its full size and the ingenuity of its construction you needed a photograph from space. A lone beaver appeared, looked at him, and slapped its tail. Mark got a sense that his presence enraged the beaver.</p>
<p>Bringing out his Explorers Club flag from his pack, he took the selfie. To be allowed to carry that flag he had had to apply to the club, which reviewed his plan of exploration and deemed it worthwhile. Mark became the 851st explorer in the club’s 110 years to carry the flag, joining a list that includes Thor Heyerdahl and James Cameron. After a supper of granola and peanut butter, he hiked to some larger spruce nearby, lashed his hammock between two of them, draped the mosquito netting, and prepared to spend the night.</p>

<p>Hiking out occupied three more days. When he reached the lake, he could not wait next to the willow marker for his ride, because that would mean standing thigh-deep in water. He sat on a drier patch of ground back in the trees, too far from the lake to see it, and listened for the engine. At mid-morning of the day appointed, he heard a sound that got louder. The boatman went right to the unlikely willow and Mark walked through swamp to the lake and waded out to the boat, so exhausted he could barely climb in.</p>
<hr><p>The world’s largest beaver dam is not like human dams. It does not stopper a river, or even a stream or rivulet. Its low half-mile barrier collects small trickles that come off a plateau called the Birch Mountains. Along the margin of this comparatively higher ground, it accommodates itself to a slope of less than two percent. The gathered-up trickles have amounted to a lake, and after the beavers eat the plants that grow in it, they may relocate to another dam and another pond, graze that area, then move on again, in a sort of crop rotation. Other dams in this beaver belt are up to three-quarters the length of the longest dam. These long, low dams may help the beavers adapt to drought.</p>
<p>Places almost impossible to get to undergird all of existence. In my car there are regions under the front seats where, when my cell phone falls into them, I must almost take the car apart to get it out. Beavers create hard-to-access places that are good for them, less so for us. Jean Thie had beavers on land he owned near Ottawa, and they built dams and made swampy ponds and cut down trees. He got a trapper to remove them but they or other beavers came back. Finally, he gave up and just put chicken wire around the trunks of trees on the property and lived with the beaver landscape.</p>

<p>In the big picture, Thie is pro-beaver nonetheless. “Of course, I’m not very positively minded about our own future on the planet,” he told me. “But I am an optimist about beavers. Their presence improves water management, reduces water flows, reduces the loss of runoff, and creates and improves wetlands. In drier landscapes of the future all this could be of benefit. I think the worldwide flourishing of beavers is a small step in a good direction.”</p>

Typically, there is a division between licensing and product divisions. When a company uses patent licensing, usually there will be some patents that protect products they produce while a licensing arm will license patents to noncompetitive products. A few rare companies like ARM have a </span><a href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/arm-the-biggest-ipo-of-the-year-is" rel="">business model</a><span> entirely organized around patenting, which produces profit margins that exceed those of software companies—truly epic. This is separate, of course, from non-practicing entities, also known as NPEs or patent trolls, that purchase patents for the purposes of suing other companies—true licensing companies like ARM develop their own IP through R&amp;D.</span></p><p><span>Qualcomm does not respect this dichotomy. Qualcomm is a very active firm with over 24,000 active patent families and a patent portfolio of 140,000 global patents.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-136758509" href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/the-secret-behind-qualcomms-margins#footnote-1-136758509" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> In fact, their San Diego headquarters has a wall of some of their most famous patents. They are patenting every day, from 5G and 6G modems, where they </span><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/12/why-qualcomm-is-the-true-leader-in-5g" rel="">claim</a><span> to have the most license agreements of any company, to </span><a href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/drafting-patents-for-ai-tips-for" rel="">AI applications</a><span>. Unlike most companies, Qualcomm will not just sell you a chip. Qualcomm incorporated its patent licensing business alongside its chip business. In other words, to even purchase a Snapdragon, you have to agree to a patent license. This means that Qualcomm is able to double-dip where most companies divide their revenue streams. Because of this, they </span><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/08/how-qualcomm-is-helping-to-foster-a-more-inclusive-patent-ecosys" rel="">call</a><span> themselves a “champion” of patent rights and engage actively with the patent community. These businesses are divided between QTL, or Qualcomm Technology Licensing, and QCT, or Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, which actually makes chips.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-136758509" href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/the-secret-behind-qualcomms-margins#footnote-2-136758509" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p><span>The financial impact, as told on their annual </span><a href="https://investor.qualcomm.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000804328-23-000055/0000804328-23-000055.pdf" rel="">10-K filing</a><span>, is staggering. In 2023, QTL brought in $5.3 billion in revenue but $3.6 billion in profits, a 68% margin. While this is only 15.9% of revenue, it is a staggering 49.3% of Qualcomm’s entire net income. Although in 2023 Qualcomm’s margins were hit, generally they achieve a profit margin exceeding 29%, which is far above the </span><a href="https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html" rel="">industry average</a><span> of 22.74%. In an industry that is ruthlessly competitive, this is an impressive achievement and has been recognized by investors on Wall Street.</span></p><p><span>These licenses are very expensive. First, Qualcomm does not negotiate on a product-by-product basis, which makes sense in a market with millions of SKUs. Instead, they </span><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/the-devil-is-in-the-detail-the-qualcomm-take-on-patent-licensing-iam.pdf" rel="">negotiate product definitions</a><span> and take a cut of every product that meets that definition—so for example, Apple would not pay a license for each individual iPhone but rather would pay across all iPhone models. QTL extracts a license for its Standard Essential Patents even when the companies do not use any QCT products. They are not afraid to litigate patent infringement and even brought </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/04/qualcomm-and-apple-agree-to-drop-all-litigation/" rel="">Apple to their heels</a><span> after two years of bitter fighting, worth a reported $4.5 billion in the first year. </span></p><p>More astoundingly, the license is taken as a percentage of the value of the licensed product, regardless of the percentage of value that the chips, primarily modems, represent. This is incredibly aggressive. Even ARM has not accomplished that feat. But then, ARM has to contend with open-source competitors like RISC-V, while Qualcomm’s lead is so vast that no one has been able to replace them. Primarily, this is because the testing requirements are so severe: to properly test a modem, one must use it all over the world with cell towers from dozens of cell phone carriers. It is a complex task that takes years and billions of dollars. </p><p><span>Qualcomm’s tactics have attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission and faced monopoly accusations. Qualcomm actually faced an antitrust lawsuit, </span><em>Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm</em><span>, where it lost the case at the district court level (though it was reversed unanimously by the Ninth Circuit). There have been other notable and related cases over the years, most notably </span><em>Continental Automotive v. Avanci</em><span>, which was quite controversial and finally put to bed in 2022 while still leave many Standard Essential Patent questions unanswered. Some observers </span><a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/alerts/2019/06/continental-v-avanci--wireless-sep-licensing-presents-challenges-to-automotive-industry" rel="">noted</a><span> that the </span><em>Continental</em><span> case echoed </span><em>Qualcomm</em><span>, but unlike in </span><em>Continental</em><span>, Qualcomm does not try to get around its obligations as a Standard Essential Patent holder by refusing to license to suppliers. </span></p><p>Qualcomm’s licensing business is best-in-class and an example many companies can learn from. There is a lesson in how truly essential companies can use intellectual property to boost their business. But the use of the Qualcomm patents also shows the requirements: any company that attempts the same strategy must be prepare for ample litigation and be so technologically ahead that no one can catch it.</p><ul><li><p><span>In an attempt to cut pharma prices, the Biden administration threw its support behind aggressive “march-in rights” for the National Institutes of Health (</span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/06/drug-prices-march-in-rights-white-house-pharma-patents/" rel="">Stat News</a><span>)</span></p></li><li><p><span>An analysis of how the famous laser patents would have held up in light of the recent </span><em>Amgen</em><span> decision; a very interesting example of legal alternate history (</span><a href="https://ipwatchdog.com/2023/12/03/laser-lessons-supreme-court-undermined-pioneering-laser-patents/id=170134/" rel="">IP Watchdog</a><span>) </span></p></li><li><p><span>A new CRISPR patent fight might be brewing with the advent of a new treatment by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (</span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084152/the-first-crispr-cure-might-kickstart-the-next-big-patent-battle/" rel="">MIT Tech Review</a><span>)</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/22-1906.OPINION.12-4-2023_2231550.pdf" rel="">VLSI Technology v.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Every SQL statement is limited to return a single, possibly denormalized, table. This design decision has far reaching consequences. (1.) for databases users in terms of slow query performance, long query result transfer times, usability-issues of SQL in web applications and object-relational mappers. In addition, (2.) for database architects it has consequences when designing query optimizers leading to logical (algebraic) join enumeration effort, memory consumption for intermediate result materialization, and physical operator selection effort. So basically, the entire query optimization stack is shaped by that design decision. In this paper, we argue that the single-table limitation should be dropped. We extend the SELECT-clause of SQL by a keyword 'RESULTDB' to support returning a result database. Our approach has clear semantics, i.e. our extended SQL returns subsets of all tables with only those tuples that would be part of the traditional (single-table) query result set, however without performing any denormalization through joins. Our SQL-extension is downward compatible. Moreover, we discuss the surprisingly long list of benefits of our approach. First, for database users: far simpler and more readable application code, better query performance, smaller query results, better query result transfer times. Second, for database architects, we present how to leverage existing closed source systems as well as change open source database systems to support our feature. We propose a couple of algorithms to integrate our feature into both closed-source as well as open source database systems. We present an initial experimental study with promising results.
