										<p>The recent introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs has been generating headlines and buzz in pockets of the industry. However, Vanguard does not have plans to create a Vanguard bitcoin ETF or other crypto-related products. Additionally, such products from other issuers will not be offered on our brokerage platform. In this Q&amp;A, two Vanguard leaders—Janel Jackson, global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker &amp; Index Relations, and Andrew Kadjeski, head of Brokerage &amp; Investments—discuss why.</p>

                    <p><b>Jackson:</b> No, given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have <i>enduring</i> investment merit and meet our clients’ needs. While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios. <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

                    <p>We do have a lot of interest in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies. We believe its application to a number of other uses besides crypto will make capital markets more efficient, and we’ve been actively involved in research to use blockchain technology.&nbsp;<br>

                </div>

        <div>
                <h5><p>Why is Vanguard not offering crypto-related products on its brokerage platform?<sup>1</sup></p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><a name="OLE_LINK10" id="OLE_LINK10"></a><b>Kadjeski:</b> Investors have a lot of choices these days when it comes to where to save for their retirement, invest for their kids’ education, and hold their emergency savings. Investors who come directly to Vanguard do so because they know we put their interests first<a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6"></a>—and that is reflected in what products and services we <i>do</i> and <i>don’t</i> have on the shelf.</p>
<p>The easy step for us would have been just to allow full access to crypto-related products. But as a firm and a brokerage platform, we’re purposely structured to meet the needs of our investor-owners, most of whom are long-term, buy-and-hold investors.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment. This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others. With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/inflation-fighting-power-of-commodities.html" target="_self">role in certain portfolios</a>. While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.</p>
<p>Morningstar recently published a perceptive article pointing out that even a modest 5% allocation to bitcoin in an otherwise traditional balanced portfolio can drastically raise its risk profile.<sup>3</sup> This is driven, in large part, by bitcoin’s extreme volatility.</p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> Over just the past three years, the price of bitcoin has increased by as much as 150% and declined by as much as 77%. Double-digit percent price drops are routine among cryptocurrencies. Remember that you need a 100% return just to make up for a 50% decline. And the more volatile an asset, the more tempting it is to trade. At Vanguard, our products and services are designed with the goal to help investors save more, trade less, and take a long-term approach—not chase trends and churn their portfolios.</p>

        <div>
                <h5><p>Has Vanguard made similar decisions in the past?</p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><b>Jackson:</b> There have been several investment trends in the past—the internet funds in the late 1990s for example—that Vanguard could have capitalized on. But we always ask ourselves, “Does this meet our investors’ long-term needs?” In hindsight, in nearly all cases, I believe we made the right call, ultimately benefiting our clients.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> The same line of thinking applies to our brokerage platform. In 2019, we decided to remove access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs. These products are often misunderstood and misused by investors and can magnify losses. Similarly, in 2022, we stopped offering most over-the-counter stocks, which are prone to high risk, low liquidity, and potential fraud.</p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> We understand that our decision on crypto is not popular among some investors, but many know that we’re being consistent with our philosophy and past practice.<sup>4 </sup>Our mission statement to give investors the best chance for investment success isn’t just a saying for us. It’s built into our DNA and we’re staying true to our mission by making this decision.&nbsp;</p>

The results show that these models can accurately retrieve hidden information from documents containing up to 1M tokens, with only minor errors observed in the 7B model.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/passkey_retrieval.png#center" width="100%"></figure><p>For more complex long-context understanding tasks, we select <a href="https://github.com/hsiehjackson/RULER">RULER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/infinigence/LVEval">LV-Eval</a>, <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign">LongbenchChat</a> used in <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-turbo/#more-complex-long-text-tasks">this blog</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/ruler.png#center" width="80%"></figure><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/lv-eval.png#center" width="80%"></figure><p>From these results, we can draw a few key conclusions:</p><ul><li><strong>Significantly Superior to the 128k Version:</strong> The Qwen2.5-1M series models significantly outperform their 128K counterparts in most long-context tasks, especially for sequences exceeding 64K in length.</li><li><strong>Notable Performance Advantage:</strong> The Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M model not only beats Qwen2.5-Turbo but also consistently outperforms GPT-4o-mini across multiple datasets, offering a robust open-source alternative for long-context tasks.</li></ul><h2 id="short-context-tasks">Short-Context Tasks</h2><p>Besides performance on long sequences, we’re equally interested in how these models handle short sequences. So, we compare the Qwen2.5-1M models and their 128K versions on widely used academic benchmarks, throwing in GPT-4o-mini for comparison.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/short_result.png#center" width="80%"></figure><p>Here’s what we find:</p><ul><li>Both Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M maintain performance on short text tasks that is similar to their 128K versions, ensuring the fundamental capabilities haven’t been compromised by the addition of long-sequence processing abilities.</li><li>Compared to GPT-4o-mini, both Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-Turbo achieve similar performance on short text tasks while supporting a context length that’s eight times longer.</li></ul><h2 id="key-techniques">Key Techniques</h2><p>Here, we’ll briefly introduce the key techniques behind building Qwen2.5-1M. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/Qwen2_5_1M_Technical_Report.pdf">technical report</a>.</p><h2 id="long-context-training">Long-Context Training</h2><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/training_stages.png#center" width="70%"></figure><p>Training with long sequences demands substantial computational resources, so we adopt a progressive approach to expand the context length for Qwen2.5-1M through multiple stages:</p><ul><li>We begin with an intermediate checkpoint of pre-trained Qwen2.5, which had a 4K token context length.</li><li><strong>In Pretraining</strong>, we gradually increase the context length from 4K to 256K tokens while using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039">Adjusted Base Frequency</a>, raising the RoPE base from 10,000 to 10,000,000.</li><li><strong>In Supervised Fine-tuning</strong>, we split this into two stages to preserve performance on shorter sequences:<ul><li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Fine-tuned only on short instructions (up to 32K tokens) using the same data and steps as the 128K versions of Qwen2.5.</li><li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Mixed short (up to 32K) and long (up to 256K) instructions to enhance long-context task performance while maintaining short-task quality.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In Reinforcement Learning</strong>, we train models on short texts up to 8K tokens, which sufficiently improves alignment with human preferences and generalizes well to long-context tasks.</li></ul><p>The final instruction-tuned models are capable of handling sequences up to 256K tokens.</p><p>During training, we develop an instruction-tuned model with a context length of 256K tokens. To extend this to 1M tokens, we employ length extrapolation techniques.</p><p>The degradation of LLMs based on RoPE in long-context tasks is mainly due to unseen, large relative positional distances between queries and keys in computing attention weight. We employ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17463"><strong>Dual Chunk Attention</strong></a> (DCA), which addresses this issue by remapping relative positions to smaller values, avoiding the large distances not seen during training.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/dca.png#center" width="70%"></figure><p>We evaluat the Qwen2.5-1M models and their 128K counterparts with and without the length extrapolation method. We can find:</p><p>Even models trained on just 32K tokens, such as the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieve nearly perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval tasks with 1M-token contexts. This underscores the remarkable ability of DCA to extend supported context lengths, without any training required.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/dca_ablation.png#center" width="40%"></figure><h2 id="sparse-attention">Sparse Attention</h2><p>For long-context language models, inference speed is crucial for user experience. We introduce a sparse attention mechanism based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02490"><strong>MInference</strong></a> to accelerate the prefill phase. Furthermore, we propose several improvements:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Integrating with Chunked Prefill:</strong> Directly processing sequences of 1M tokens results in substantial memory overhead to store the activations in MLP layers, consuming 71GB of VRAM in Qwen2.5-7B. By integrating with chunk prefill with a chunk length of 32,768 tokens, activation VRAM usage is reduced by 96.7%, leading to a significant decrease in memory consumption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrating with Length Extrapolation:</strong> We integrate DCA with MInference in long-context processing, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and achieving greater accuracy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sparsity Refinement on Long Sequences:</strong> MInference requires an offline search to determine the optimal sparsification configuration for each attention head. Due to the computational demand of full attention weights, this search is typically conducted on short sequences, which may not generalize well to longer sequences. We developed a method to refine the sparsification configuration specifically for sequences up to 1M tokens, which significantly reduces the accuracy loss brought by sparse attention.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Optimizations:</strong> We introduce additional optimizations, such as enhanced kernel efficiency and dynamic chunked pipeline parallelism, to fully unlock the potential of the entire framework.</p></li></ul><p>With these enhancements, our inference framework results in a 3.2x to 6.7x acceleration in the prefill speed across different model sizes and GPU devices for sequences of 1M token length.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/speed.png#center" width="85%"></figure><h2 id="deploy-qwen25-1m-models-locally">Deploy Qwen2.5-1M Models Locally</h2><p>Here we provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the Qwen2.5-1M models on your local devices.</p><h3 id="1-system-preparation">1.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Date: 2025-01-26 <br>
Git: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md">https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I read this blog post:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/generic-internet-user/e8eec46ce159571032115f6fb064523c">Wayland Cursor Lag: Just give me a break already...</a>,
where a Linux user discusses their frustration with input latency under Wayland.
They detailed their own subjective experience of the problem,
but failed to produce hard evidence.</p>
<p>Even though I'm a very happy user of wayland overall,
I share the blog post's author's subjective impression that there's more
cursor lag under Wayland than under X11.
In my opinion, their experiment was limited by their phone camera's 90 FPS,
which really doesn't feel like it's enough to get conclusive numbers
when we're talking about differences which are probably on the order of
single screen refresh cycles.</p>
<p>So I thought: hey, I have a phone with a 240 FPS camera mode,
I bet that's enough to get some conclusive results!</p>
<p>Spoilers: I was right.</p>
<h2>Experimental design</h2>
<p>I simply pointed my phone's camera at the screen and desk using my left hand,
made sure to get the mouse cursor, the mouse and my right hand in frame,
and recorded myself repeatedly flicking the mouse with my finger.
I recorded myself flicking it 16 times under Wayland,
logged out of the GNOME Wayland session and into a GNOME X11 session,
then did the same there.</p>
<p>I then converted the two resulting video files into a series of JPEGs
using ffmpeg (<code>ffmpeg -i &lt;input file&gt; %04d.jpg</code>),
and counted from the first frame where I could see the mouse move
until the first frame where I could clearly see that the cursor had moved.</p>
<p>I elected to include the start and end frame;
so if I saw the mouse move in frame 1045,
then I saw the cursor move in frame 1047,
I would count that as 3 frames.</p>
<p>Here's an example which depicts a latency of 3 frames (requires JavaScript):</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-1.jpg" alt="before 1"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a frame from before the mouse has begun moving.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-2.jpg" alt="before 2"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse still hasn't moved.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-1.jpg" alt="mouse moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the mouse has just about started moving,
so I consider this "frame 1".
The cursor hasn't moved yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-2.jpg" alt="still moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse moves a bit further, but the cursor still hasn't moved.
This is "frame 2".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-cursor.jpg" alt="cursor moved"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the frame where the cursor starts moving.
This is "frame 3", so I would note down this sequence
as taking 3 frames.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hardware details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distro: Fedora Workstation 41</li>
<li>GNOME version: 47</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900XT</li>
<li>Monitor: Gigabyte M32U (4k IPS @ 144.99, no DPI scaling)</li>
<li>Mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed</li>
<li>Camera: iPhone 15 Pro, slo-mo 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The main limitations of this experiment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>240 FPS still isn't <em>that</em> much. With my 144Hz screen, I have less than
two camera frames per screen refresh. This introduces some random variance.</li>
<li>Pixels don't switch instantly, so there are ambiguous frames where the cursor
is <em>barely</em> starting to become visible in its new location.
I decided to count the cursor as "having moved" when there is a clearly visible
cursor in a new location on the screen, even if the pixels haven't fully lit up.</li>
<li>For some reason, the video recording from my phone contains some duplicate frames.
I don't know why this happens. I decided to interpret these duplicate frames
as a representation of a frame's worth of time passing, so I counted them as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors introduce some uncertainty in the results.
However, they <em>should</em> affect Wayland and X11 equally, so with enough data,
it should all even out.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another caveat I should clearly point out is that there are
many other Wayland compositors out there than GNOME's, and I have not tested them.
For that matter, there are other GPU drivers out there than AMD's.
Other compositors and other GPU drivers may show different results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here's the data I captured:</p>

<p>Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system.
I don't have the statistics expertise necessary to properly analyze
whether this difference is statistically significant or not,
but to my untrained eye, it looks like there's a clear and consistent difference.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh.
I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers in chart form:</p>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-chart.svg" alt="Latency chart"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my mind, these results are conclusive proof that there <em>is</em> a difference
in input latency between X11 and Wayland, at least with my hardware,
and that the difference is large enough that it's plausible for some people to notice.</p>
<p>Further testing on more varied hardware and refresh rates is necessary
to get a clear picture of how wide-spread the problem is and how large it is.
It's likely that the magnitude of the difference varies based on factors
such as which compositor is used and what the refresh rate of the screen is.</p>
<p>I probably won't undertake that further testing,
because this is all very time intensive work.
My goal was only to see if I could conclusively measure <em>some</em> difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I want to add a note here about what this testing does <em>not</em> show.
It does not show that there's higher input latency <em>in general</em>
in Wayland compared to X11 in a way which affects, for example, games.
It is possible that this added latency is entirely cursor-specific
and that Wayland and X11 exhibit the exact same input latency
in graphical applications and games.
It is my understanding that the cursor is handled very differently from
normal graphical applications.
Further testing would be necessary to show whether Wayland has more input latency
<em>in games</em> than X11.</p>

Maybe, before trying another rollout, they might talk to a few customers, do some focus groups, even ask a few members of the press and analyst community for their advice.</p><p>But no.</p><p>Shortly after the New Year, someone in Redmond pushed a button that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">raised the price</a> of its popular (84 million paid subscribers worldwide!) Microsoft 365 product. You know, the one that used to be called Microsoft Office? Yeah, well, now the app is called Microsoft 365 Copilot, and you're going to be paying at least 30% more for that subscription starting with your next bill.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-365-copilot-rebranding" width="740" height="870.8703703703703" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft 365 gets a new logo, a new name, and a higher price.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as I can tell, the response from customers has been overwhelmingly negative. I monitor Microsoft-focused online forums obsessively, and I read hundreds of complaints without seeing a single compliment. Seriously, the reaction to this rollout was an Excel #DIV/0 error.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>What went wrong? Where do I begin?</p><h2>They botched the price increase</h2><p>Let me bend over backward to Microsoft here. They launched Office 365 (which later became Microsoft 365) more than a dozen years ago, and in that time they have not raised the price once. In case you haven't noticed, we are living through some inflationary times right now.</p><p>So, there was plenty of room for Microsoft to roll out a gentle price increase. "Hey y'all, we know this isn't welcome news but we need to bump up the Microsoft 365 subscription price by two bucks a month. It's still a great deal!"</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-in-2025/">How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 in 2025</a></strong></p><p>Netflix does that every year or two and no one shows up at Netflix HQ with pitchforks and torches.</p><p>But no. Instead, they made it a 30% price increase and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">blamed it all on artificial intelligence</a>. Bad idea. Why? Because...</p><!----><h2>No one wants to pay for AI</h2><p>There's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code-what-it-does-well-and-what-it-doesnt/">writing code</a> and finding patterns in large databases.</p><p>But in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ai-for-coding-in-2025-and-what-not-to-use/">The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)</a></strong></p><p>To top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.</p><p>But good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, "As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-entra-a-new-identity-and-access-family-of-products/">Entra ID</a>) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available."</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="m365-copilot-error" width="740" height="994.2798353909466" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>If you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.</p><h2>The announcement was bungled, too</h2><p>I pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.</p><p>Instead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="price-change-for-microsoft-365" width="740" height="1178.5185185185185" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>This po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change.&nbsp;</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>That notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.</p><p>It could be worse, I suppose. Just ask the French and Spanish subscribers who got a similar pop-up message telling them their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/1i75h77/microsoft_365_from_10_to_1300_a_month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price had gone from €10 a month to €13,000</a>. (Those pesky decimals.)</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>Oh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.</p><h2>Well, surely you can just turn it off. Right?</h2><p>The smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, "We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!"</p><p>Instead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-support-in-windows-10-ends-in-october-too-what-that-really-means/">Microsoft Office support in Windows 10 ends in October too - what that really means</a></strong></p><p>As for the other Office apps? "Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe."</p><p>Seriously, the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-turn-off-copilot-in-microsoft-365-family-and-personal-subscriptions-bc7e530b-152d-4123-8e78-edc06f8b85f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page that explains where you can find that box in Word</a>&nbsp;says, "We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025." Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As&nbsp;<a href="https://laurenhough.substack.com/p/there-are-some-swear-words-in-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one writer pointed out</a>&nbsp;(with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.</p><h2>How long will the Classic option last?</h2><p>If you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription  management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-top-10-brands-exploited-in-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/">The top 10 brands exploited in phishing attacks - and how to protect yourself</a></strong></p><p>That's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Microsoft doing this?</h2><p>I have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.</p><p>So, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-copilot-dows-math" width="1280" height="1176.167832167832" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year. It's almost like someone was given instructions at the end of the calendar year to bump up that revenue line for the Office Consumer division.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-easily-added-ai-to-my-favorite-microsoft-office-alternative/">How I easily added AI to my favorite Microsoft Office alternative</a></strong></p><p>Here's the funny thing: The price increase is so big that there will still be a huge positive impact even if 10% of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family customers cancel rather than pay the extra monthly fee. Copilot walked me through the math and concluded, "So, even with 10% of your customers canceling their subscriptions, you would still generate an additional $1.714 billion annually due to the price hike. How do you feel about this adjustment?"</p><p>I feel like I understand why all those complaints are going to go unheard.</p><div id="pinbox-684151ed-848f-4f0d-a5f9-d91e36c294b3"><h4>More Microsoft</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" alt="Two caricatures of top-hatted millionaires whose bodies are bulging money-sacks. Their heads have been replaced with potatoes. The potatoes' eyes have been replaced with the hostile red eye of HAL 9000 from Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' They stand in a potato field filled with stoop laborers. The sky is a 'code waterfall' as seen in the credit sequences of the Wachowskis' 'Matrix' movies." src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/big-potato.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1"></p>
<h2>It's not a crime if we do it with an app (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>The core regulatory proposition of the tech industry is "it's not a crime if we do it with an app." It's not an unlicensed taxi if we do it with an app. It's not an illegal hotel room if we do it with an app. It's not an unregistered security if we do it with an app. It's not wage theft if we do it with an app.</p>
<p>Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade, and so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app, with impunity for the criminals. The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an "efficient market."</p>
<p>Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about "Pepsi pricing power," and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power">https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power</a></p>
<p>You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering</a></p>
<p>But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to "significantly higher selling prices" and "our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on</a></p>
<p>But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In <em>The Lever</em>, Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/">https://www.levernews.com/the-rise-of-big-potato/</a></p>
<p>These companies have been hiking prices for years, but <em>really</em> started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else.</p>
<p>Big Potato controls <em>97%</em> of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal pricing."</p>
<p>This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they <em>admit it</em>. A director at McCain said that "higher ups" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone "behaving themselves," chortling that they'd "never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry." Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to "pricing actions."</p>
<p>Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like "Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory":</p>
<p><a href="https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ">https://app.tegus.co/guest/document/view/67Hf3DiMGQ944SkfpRhLfNeiqekjA67sm2dxTCYtjoggUaJXk2chDg9wxMnZ</a></p>
<p>This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same "recommendations" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy">https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy</a></p>
<p>Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: "four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market."</p>
<p>The "price fixing is legal if we do it with an app" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/27/ai-conspiracies/#epistemological-collapse</a></p>
<p>And private equity companies have rolled up all the <em>fire truck</em> companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll</a></p>
<p>This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are "efficient" – find in their favor if they do?</p>
<p>Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion, <em>any</em> source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.</p>
