    <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>A critical </span><span>component</span><span> of healthcare, blood transfusions play a vital role in saving lives around the globe every day. Maintaining an adequate blood supply, though, is no easy task, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The demand for O</span><span>–</span><span>negative blood — the universal donor type — often exceeds supply and donations have a limited shelf life. Looking to address the issue are a group of Japanese scientists led by Hiromi Sakai at <a href="https://www.naramed-u.ac.jp/university/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nara Medical University</a>. </span><span>They’ve</span><span> developed a new type of artificial blood that can be used in patients of any blood type. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>The artificial blood is created by extracting hemoglobin — a protein </span><span>containing</span><span> iron that </span><span>facilitates</span><span> the transportation of oxygen in red blood cells — from expired donor blood. It is then encased in a protective shell to create stable, virus-free artificial red blood cells. As these artificial cells have no blood type, there is no need for compatibility testing. The synthetic blood can </span><span>reportedly be</span><span> stored for up to two years at room temperature and five years under refrigeration. That is a significant improvement over donated red blood cells, which can only be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of </span><span>42 days</span><span>. </span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 id="683d47927a6cd"><span data-contrast="auto">Artificial Blood Trials </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Small-scale studies began in 2022. Three groups of four healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 50 received a single intravenous injection of hemoglobin vesicles — artificial oxygen carriers that mimic the structure of red blood cells — in increasing amounts, up to 100 milliliters. While some participants experienced mild side effects, there were no significant changes in vital signs, including blood pressure. Building on that success, Sakai announced that his team was accelerating the process last July. In March, it started administering between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cell solution to volunteers. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>If no side effects are confirmed, the trial will shift to examin</span><span>ing</span><span> the treatment’s efficacy and safety. It aims to put the artificial red blood cells into practical use by around 2030. While these studies are taking place, Professor Teruyuki Komatsu of Chuo University’s Faculty of Science and Engineering is also working on the development of artificial oxygen carriers, using albumin-encased hemoglobin to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke. So far, animal studies have shown promising results. As a result, researchers are now eager to move to human trials.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p>A heartfelt provocation about AI-assisted programming.</p>
<p>Tech execs are mandating LLM adoption. That’s bad strategy. But I get where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>Some of the smartest people I know share a bone-deep belief that AI is a fad —  the next iteration of NFT mania. I’ve been reluctant to push back on them, because, well, they’re smarter than me. But their arguments are unserious, and worth confronting. Extraordinarily talented people are doing work that LLMs already do better, out of  spite.</p>

<p>All progress on LLMs could halt today, and LLMs would remain the 2nd most important thing to happen over the course of my career.</p>
<p><strong>Important caveat</strong>: I’m discussing only the implications of LLMs for software development. For art, music, and writing? I got nothing. I’m inclined to believe the skeptics in those fields. I just don’t believe them about mine.</p>
<p>Bona fides: I’ve been shipping software since the mid-1990s. I started out in boxed, shrink-wrap C code.  Survived an ill-advised <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Design-Generic-Programming-Patterns/dp/0201704315" title="">Alexandrescu</a> C++ phase. Lots of Ruby and Python tooling.  Some kernel work. A whole lot of server-side C, Go, and Rust. However you define “serious developer”, I qualify. Even if only on one of your lower tiers.</p>
<h3 id="level-setting"><a href="#level-setting" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>level setting</span></h3><p>† (or, God forbid, 2 years ago with Copilot)</p>
<p>First, we need to get on the same page. If you were trying and failing to use an LLM for code 6 months ago †, you’re not doing what most serious LLM-assisted coders are doing.</p>

<p>People coding with LLMs today use agents. Agents get to poke around your codebase on their own. They author files directly. They run tools. They compile code, run tests, and iterate on the results. They also:</p>

<ul>
<li>pull in arbitrary code from the tree, or from other trees online, into their context windows,
</li><li>run standard Unix tools to navigate the tree and extract information,
</li><li>interact with Git,
</li><li>run existing tooling, like linters, formatters, and model checkers, and
</li><li>make essentially arbitrary tool calls (that you set up) through MCP.
</li></ul>
<p>The code in an agent that actually “does stuff” with code is not, itself, AI. This should reassure you. It’s surprisingly simple systems code, wired to ground truth about programming in the same way a Makefile is. You could write an effective coding agent in a weekend. Its strengths would have more to do with how you think about and structure builds and linting and test harnesses than with how advanced o3 or Sonnet have become.</p>
<p>If you’re making requests on a ChatGPT page and then pasting the resulting (broken) code into your editor, you’re not doing what the AI boosters are doing. No wonder you’re talking past each other.</p>
<h3 id="the-positive-case"><a href="#the-positive-case" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>the positive case</span></h3>
<p><img alt="four quadrants of tedium and importance" src="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/assets/code-quad.png?2/3&amp;center"></p>

<p>LLMs can write a large fraction of all the tedious code you’ll ever need to write. And most code on most projects is tedious. LLMs drastically reduce the number of things you’ll ever need to Google. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they don’t get tired; they’re immune to inertia.</p>

<p>Think of anything you wanted to build but didn’t. You tried to home in on some first steps. If you’d been in the limerent phase of a new programming language, you’d have started writing. But you weren’t, so you put it off, for a day, a year, or your whole career.</p>

<p>I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the bookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An LLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it will drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost works, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing things work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.</p>

<p>There’s a downside. Sometimes, gnarly stuff needs doing. But you don’t wanna do it. So you refactor unit tests, soothing yourself with the lie that you’re doing real work. But an LLM can be told to go refactor all your unit tests. An agent can occupy itself for hours putzing with your tests in a VM and come back later with a PR. If you listen to me, you’ll know that. You’ll feel worse yak-shaving. You’ll end up doing… real work.</p>
<h3 id="but-you-have-no-idea-what-the-code-is"><a href="#but-you-have-no-idea-what-the-code-is" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but you have no idea what the code is</span></h3>
<p>Are you a vibe coding Youtuber? Can you not read code? If so: astute point. Otherwise: what the fuck is wrong with you?</p>

<p>You’ve always been responsible for what you merge to <code>main</code>. You were five years go. And you are tomorrow, whether or not you use an LLM.</p>

<p>If you build something with an LLM that people will depend on, read the code. In fact, you’ll probably do more than that. You’ll spend 5-10 minutes knocking it back into your own style. LLMs are <a href="https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules" title="">showing signs of adapting</a> to local idiom, but we’re not there yet.</p>

<p>People complain about LLM-generated code being “probabilistic”. No it isn’t. It’s code. It’s not Yacc output. It’s knowable. The LLM might be stochastic. But the LLM doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you can make sense of the result, and whether your guardrails hold.</p>

<p>Reading other people’s code is part of the job. If you can’t metabolize the boring, repetitive code an LLM generates: skills issue! How are you handling the chaos human developers turn out on a deadline?</p>
<p>† (because it can hold 50-70kloc in its context window)</p>
<p>For the last month or so, Gemini 2.5 has been my go-to †. Almost nothing it spits out for me merges without edits. I’m sure there’s a skill to getting a SOTA model to one-shot a feature-plus-merge! But I don’t care. I like moving the code around and chuckling to myself while I delete all the stupid comments. I have to read the code line-by-line anyways.</p>
<h3 id="but-hallucination"><a href="#but-hallucination" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but hallucination</span></h3>
<p>If hallucination matters to you, your programming language has let you down.</p>

<p>Agents lint. They compile and run tests. If their LLM invents a new function signature, the agent sees the error. They feed it back to the LLM, which says “oh, right, I totally made that up” and then tries again.</p>

<p>You’ll only notice this happening if you watch the chain of thought log your agent generates. Don’t. This is why I like <a href="https://zed.dev/agentic" title="">Zed’s agent mode</a>: it begs you to tab away and let it work, and pings you with a desktop notification when it’s done.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are still environments where hallucination matters. But “hallucination” is the first thing developers bring up when someone suggests using LLMs, despite it being (more or less) a solved problem.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-code-is-shitty-like-that-of-a-junior-developer"><a href="#but-the-code-is-shitty-like-that-of-a-junior-developer" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the code is shitty, like that of a junior developer</span></h3>
<p>Does an intern cost $20/month? Because that’s what Cursor.ai costs.</p>

<p>Part of being a senior developer is making less-able coders productive, be they fleshly or algebraic. Using agents well is both a both a  skill and an engineering project all its own, of prompts, indices, <a href="https://fly.io/blog/semgrep-but-for-real-now/" title="">and (especially) tooling.</a> LLMs only produce shitty code if you let them.</p>
<p>† (Also: 100% of all the Bash code you should author ever again)</p>
<p>Maybe the current confusion is about who’s doing what work. Today, LLMs do a lot of typing, Googling, test cases †, and edit-compile-test-debug cycles. But even the most Claude-poisoned serious developers in the world still own curation, judgement, guidance, and direction.</p>

<p>Also: let’s stop kidding ourselves about how good our human first cuts really are.</p>
<h3 id="but-its-bad-at-rust"><a href="#but-its-bad-at-rust" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but it’s bad at rust</span></h3>
<p>It’s hard to get a good toolchain for Brainfuck, too. Life’s tough in the aluminum siding business.</p>
<p>† (and they surely will; the Rust community takes tooling seriously)</p>
<p>A lot of LLM skepticism probably isn’t really about LLMs. It’s projection. People say “LLMs can’t code” when what they really mean is “LLMs can’t write Rust”. Fair enough! But people select languages in part based on how well LLMs work with them, so Rust people should get on that †.</p>

<p>I work mostly in Go. I’m confident the designers of the Go programming language didn’t set out to produce the most LLM-legible language in the industry. They succeeded nonetheless Go has just enough type safety, an extensive standard library, and a culture that prizes (often repetitive) idiom. LLMs kick ass generating it.</p>

<p>All this is to say: I write some Rust. I like it fine. If LLMs and Rust aren’t working for you, I feel you. But if that’s your whole thing, we’re not having the same argument.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-craft"><a href="#but-the-craft" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the craft</span></h3>
<p>Do you like fine Japanese woodworking? All hand tools and sashimono joinery? Me too. Do it on your own time.</p>
<p>† (I’m a piker compared to my woodworking friends)</p>
<p>I have a basic wood shop in my basement †. I could get a lot of satisfaction from building a table. And, if that table is a workbench or a grill table, sure, I’ll build it. But if I need, like, a table? For people to sit at? In my office? I buy a fucking table.</p>

<p>Professional software developers are in the business of solving practical problems for people with code. We are not, in our day jobs, artisans. Steve Jobs was wrong: we do not need to carve the unseen feet in the sculpture. Nobody cares if the logic board traces are pleasingly routed. If anything we build endures, it won’t be because the codebase was beautiful.</p>

<p>Besides, that’s not really what happens. If you’re taking time carefully golfing functions down into graceful, fluent, minimal functional expressions, alarm bells should ring. You’re yak-shaving. The real work has depleted your focus. You’re not building: you’re self-soothing.</p>

<p>Which, wait for it, is something LLMs are good for. They devour schlep, and clear a path to the important stuff, where your judgement and values really matter.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-mediocrity"><a href="#but-the-mediocrity" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the mediocrity</span></h3>
<p>As a mid-late career coder, I’ve come to appreciate mediocrity. You should be so lucky as to  have it flowing almost effortlessly from a tap.</p>

<p>We all write mediocre code. Mediocre code: often fine. Not all code is equally important. Some code should be mediocre. Maximum effort on a random unit test? You’re doing something wrong. Your team lead should correct you.</p>

<p>Developers all love to preen about code. They worry LLMs lower the “ceiling” for quality. Maybe. But they also raise the “floor”.</p>

<p>Gemini’s floor is higher than my own.  My code looks nice. But it’s not as thorough. LLM code is repetitive. But mine includes dumb contortions where I got too clever trying to DRY things up.</p>

<p>And LLMs aren’t mediocre on every axis. They almost certainly have a bigger bag of algorithmic tricks than you do: radix tries, topological sorts, graph reductions, and LDPC codes. Humans romanticize <code>rsync</code> (<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-749/READINGS/required/cas/tridgell96.pdf" title="">Andrew Tridgell</a> wrote a paper about it!). To an LLM it might not be that much more interesting than a SQL join.</p>

<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. It doesn’t matter. If truly mediocre code is all we ever get from LLM, that’s still huge. It’s that much less mediocre code humans have to write.</p>
<h3 id="but-itll-never-be-agi"><a href="#but-itll-never-be-agi" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but it’ll never be AGI</span></h3>
<p>I don’t give a shit.</p>

<p>Smart practitioners get wound up by the AI/VC hype cycle. I can’t blame them. But it’s not an argument. Things either work or they don’t, no matter what Jensen Huang has to say about it.</p>
<h3 id="but-they-take-rr-jerbs"><a href="#but-they-take-rr-jerbs" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but they take-rr jerbs</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43776612" title="">So does open source.</a> We used to pay good money for databases.</p>

<p>We’re a field premised on automating other people’s jobs away. “Productivity gains,” say the economists. You get what that means, right? Fewer people doing the same stuff. Talked to a travel agent lately? Or a floor broker? Or a record store clerk? Or a darkroom tech?</p>

<p>When this argument comes up, libertarian-leaning VCs start the chant: lamplighters, creative destruction, new kinds of work. Maybe. But I’m not hypnotized. I have no fucking clue whether we’re going to be better off after LLMs. Things could get a lot worse for us.</p>

<p>LLMs really might displace many software developers. That’s not a high horse we get to ride. Our jobs are just as much in tech’s line of fire as everybody else’s have been for the last 3 decades. We’re not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_port_strike" title="">East Coast dockworkers</a>; we won’t stop progress on our own.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-plagiarism"><a href="#but-the-plagiarism" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but the plagiarism</span></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence is profoundly — and probably unfairly — threatening to visual artists in ways that might be hard to appreciate if you don’t work in the arts.</p>

<p>We imagine artists spending their working hours pushing the limits of expression. But the median artist isn’t producing gallery pieces. They produce on brief: turning out competent illustrations and compositions for magazine covers, museum displays, motion graphics, and game assets.</p>

<p>LLMs easily — alarmingly — clear industry quality bars . Gallingly, one of the things they’re best at is churning out just-good-enough facsimiles of human creative work.  I have family in visual arts. I can’t talk to them about LLMs. I don’t blame them. They’re probably not wrong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, software developers spot code fragments <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17035">seemingly lifted</a> from public repositories on Github and lose their shit. What about the licensing? If you’re a lawyer, I defer. But if you’re a software developer playing this card? Cut me a little slack as I ask you to shove this concern up your ass. No profession has demonstrated more contempt for intellectual property.</p>

<p>The median dev thinks Star Wars and Daft Punk are a public commons. The great cultural project of developers has been opposing any protection that might inconvenience a monetizable media-sharing site. When they fail at policy, they route around it with coercion. They stand up global-scale piracy networks and sneer at anybody who so much as tries to preserve a new-release window for a TV show.</p>

<p>Call any of this out if you want to watch a TED talk about how hard it is to stream <em>The Expanse</em> on LibreWolf. Yeah, we get it. You don’t believe in IPR. Then shut the fuck up about IPR. Reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p>It’s all special pleading anyways. LLMs digest code further than you do. If you don’t believe a typeface designer can stake a moral claim on the terminals and counters of a letterform, you sure as hell can’t be possessive about a red-black tree.</p>
<h3 id="positive-case-redux"><a href="#positive-case-redux" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>positive case redux</span></h3>
<p>When I started writing a couple days ago, I wrote a section to “level set” to the  state of the art of LLM-assisted programming. A bluefish filet has a longer shelf life than an LLM take. In the time it took you to read this, everything changed.</p>

<p>Kids today don’t just use agents; they use asynchronous agents. They wake up, free-associate 13 different things for their LLMs to work on, make coffee, fill out a TPS report, drive to the Mars Cheese Castle, and then check their notifications. They’ve got 13 PRs to review. Three get tossed and re-prompted. Five of them get the same feedback a junior dev gets. And five get merged.</p>

<p><em>“I’m sipping rocket fuel right now,”</em> a friend tells me. <em>“The folks on my team who aren’t embracing AI? It’s like they’re standing still.”</em> He’s not bullshitting me. He doesn’t work in SFBA. He’s got no reason to lie.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of things I can’t trust an LLM with. No LLM has any of access to prod here. But I’ve been first responder on an incident and fed 4o — not o4-mini, 4o — log transcripts, and watched it in seconds spot LVM metadata corruption issues on a host we’ve been complaining about for months. Am I better than an LLM agent at interrogating OpenSearch logs and Honeycomb traces? No. No, I am not.</p>

<p>To the consternation of many of my friends, I’m not a radical or a futurist. I’m a statist. I believe in the haphazard perseverance of complex systems, of institutions, of reversions to the mean. I write Go and Python code. I’m not a Kool-aid drinker.</p>

<p>But something real is happening. My smartest friends are blowing it off. Maybe I persuade you. Probably I don’t. But we need to be done making space for bad arguments.</p>
<h3 id="but-im-tired-of-hearing-about-it"><a href="#but-im-tired-of-hearing-about-it" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>but i’m tired of hearing about it</span></h3>
<p>And here I rejoin your company. I read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/" title="">Simon Willison</a>, and that’s all I really need. But all day, every day, a sizable chunk of the front page of HN is allocated to LLMs: incremental model updates, startups doing things with LLMs, LLM tutorials, screeds against LLMs. It’s annoying!</p>

<p>But AI is also incredibly — a word I use advisedly — important. It’s getting the same kind of attention that smart phones got in 2008, and not as much as the Internet got. That seems about right.</p>

<p>I think this is going to get clearer over the next year. The cool kid haughtiness about “stochastic parrots” and “vibe coding” can’t survive much more contact with reality. I’m snarking about these people, but I meant what I said: they’re smarter than me. And when they get over this affectation, they’re going to make coding agents profoundly more effective than they are today.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Typing became my therapy. Not even kidding.</p>

    <p>Started at 60 WPM, felt like dragging my feet through mud every time I had to write code comments or documentation. Now? 118 WPM. No home row bullshit. No "proper finger placement." Just pure, chaotic rhythm. <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/h2mhhp0" target="_blank">Proof here</a> because I know you don't believe me.</p>

    <h2>My Daily Brain Reset Ritual</h2>

    <p>Every morning, before I even think about opening VS Code, before Slack starts destroying my soul, before the daily standup where we pretend we know what we're doing, I just <strong>type</strong>. Five minutes. That's it.</p>

    <p>It's like meditation but actually useful. Resets my brain, calms the static from yesterday's debugging session, and gets me in the zone. Way better than staring at my ceiling wondering why I chose this career.</p>

    <h2>Speed is Useless if You're Wrong</h2>

    <p>Here's the thing that took me way too long to figure out: rushing makes everything worse. Every time I tried to go fast, I'd mess up, backspace like crazy, and end up slower than when I started. Classic developer move, honestly.</p>

    <p>So I slowed down. Focused on hitting every key right. And boom — speed just... happened. 90 WPM, 100 WPM, 118 WPM. All came when I was hitting 100% accuracy consistently.</p>

    <p><img src="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blogs/top-speed.png" alt="top-speed"></p><p>It's like debugging. You can't just randomly change stuff and hope it works. You gotta be methodical, get it right, then optimize. Same energy.</p>

    <p>Some words still absolutely wreck me though. "Obviously" keeps coming out as "obviousily" and I want to throw my keyboard every time. So now I just slow down for those demon words and blast through the rest. Strategic speed management or whatever.</p>

    <h2>Screw the Rules, Find Your Flow</h2>

    <p>Plot twist: I don't type "correctly" at all. My fingers just go wherever they want. It's like anarchist typing. My left pinky probably hasn't touched the 'A' key in months, but somehow I'm still in the 99.5 percentile.</p>

    <p>Turns out the "proper way" is just a suggestion. Like following PEP 8 or using semicolons in JavaScript. Sure, it's nice, but if your way works better, who cares?</p>

    <h2>When Your Brain is Fried</h2>

    <p>You know those days when you've been staring at the same bug for 3 hours and your brain feels like mush? Or when you've been doomscrolling Twitter instead of working and feel dead inside?</p>

    <p>That's when I open <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="_blank">Keybr</a>. It's like going to the gym but for your neurons. Good typing session = instant mood boost. Small win = dopamine hit. Better than coffee, honestly.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I use it as a break between coding sessions. Brain getting foggy? Type for 2 minutes. Stuck on a problem? Type. Deployment failed and you want to quit tech forever? You guessed it.</p>

    <h2>The Inevitable Skill Issue Moments</h2>

    <p>Not gonna lie, there were weeks where I absolutely tanked. Bad accuracy, slow speeds, feeling like I'd forgotten how to use a keyboard. Classic imposter syndrome but for typing.</p>

    <p>"Maybe I'm not actually good at this. Maybe 118 WPM was just a fluke. Maybe I should just stick to hunt-and-peck like a normal person."</p>

    <p>But then I'd bounce back. Always. Usually harder and faster than before. It's like when you're stuck on a bug for days and then suddenly the solution is obvious. The struggle makes the breakthrough better.</p>

    <p><img src="http://balaji-amg.surge.sh/blogs/typing-profile.png" alt="typing-profile"></p><h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>

    <p>Been doing this for over a year now. 7,000+ lessons completed on Keybr. My brain genuinely feels different. Not just the typing speed, but focus, discipline, the ability to sit down and just <em>do the thing</em>.</p>

    <p>It's one of those weird habits that seems pointless but somehow fixes everything else. Like how learning vim makes you better at thinking about text editing, or how writing tests makes you better at designing APIs.</p>

    <p><strong>Real talk:</strong> This stupid little habit has probably made me a better developer. Faster at writing code, better at documentation, less frustrated when I have to type out long variable names or commit messages.</p>

    <p>Plus, there's something deeply satisfying about watching words appear on screen at the speed of thought. It's like having a direct brain-to-computer interface, but with more finger movement.</p>

    <p>So yeah. Typing fixed my brain. And probably made me less annoying in code reviews because I can actually write coherent comments now.</p>

    <p>End of story. Now go find your own weird productivity hack that makes no sense but somehow works.</p>

Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic all had major releases, and one clear throughline was the push toward </span><strong>increasingly autonomous coding agents</strong><span>. So we figured this was the perfect moment to talk about </span><strong>how</strong><span> </span><strong>unreliable Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong><span> </span><strong>are as a base technology</strong><span>, and </span><strong>what that means for builders</strong><span> trying to work with them.</span></p><p><span>Unreliability is the core bottleneck to unlocking the full power of LLMs. For all the deserved excitement around LLMs, most users still engage with them only </span><a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/5/25/genais-adoption-puzzle" rel="">occasionally</a><span>. Daily active use remains comparatively low. You could read that as limited utility or slow dispersion, but we think a major contributor is unreliability. When a system can’t be trusted to work consistently, its real-world utility collapses. It’s no coincidence that the clearest value from LLMs so far has come from code generation, where outputs are not only useful, but highly verifiable. You can run the code, test it, compile it. It either works or it doesn’t. And the product it supports—software—is deterministic by design. </span></p><p>This piece explores:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The core challenge:</strong><span> LLMs are fundamentally unreliable, a characteristic we believe is unlikely to change soon.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Implications for builders:</strong><span> Success in building AI-powered products doesn’t come from waiting for perfect models, but rather from from building around their inherent variance.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Framework:</strong><span> We outline four distinct approaches builders can take to manage variance. We'll map the core characteristics of each, offering a clearer lens for assessing whether a given team's capabilities and chosen strategy align.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>We’ve spent the past few years closely tracking the LLM space, following the research, watching how companies are deploying them, how users interact with them, and using the models extensively ourselves. These observations have made one thing abundantly clear: large language models are </span><strong>fundamentally unreliable</strong><span>.</span></p><ul><li><p>Their outputs often deviate significantly from the intended result.</p><ul><li><p>This unreliability is persistent. It might be low in some cases, but it never fully disappears, and it’s largely unpredictable ahead of time.</p></li><li><p><span>Even in the most constrained, well-defined tasks, LLM behavior</span><strong> is not deterministic. </strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Crucially, when LLMs are asked to perform tasks that involve any kind of real agency—multi-step actions, tool use, autonomy—these reliability issues get far worse. Failure rates spike to levels that make these systems unusable in real-world scenarios.</p></li><li><p>We believe these core reliability dynamics of LLMs aren’t likely to change meaningfully in the short to medium term.</p></li></ul><ol><li><p><strong>LLMs hallucinate</strong><span>—that is, they generate incorrect outputs. The most </span><a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/lite/v1.13.0/#/leaderboard" rel="">reputable </a><span>benchmarks we have, including those </span><a

We won’t dive into the full complexity of the alignment discussion here—it’s a deep and important topic—but the basic idea is this: alignment is the discipline concerned with making sure that models behave, at a high level, the way we intend them to. It’s what tries to prevent scenarios where an LLM blackmails its developer to avoid being shut off, or gives users instructions on how to build bioweapons.

Beyond just illustrating how fundamentally opaque these systems still are, unsolved alignment directly impacts the viability of agentic LLM use cases. But as noted, this is a topic worthy of its own deep dive, so we’ll leave it at that for now. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>Forecasting AI progress is notoriously difficult</strong><span>, especially in a domain evolving this quickly. That said, we have reason to believe that the core reliability dynamics of LLMs aren’t likely to change meaningfully in the short to medium term.</span></p><p>Here’s why:</p><ol><li><p><span>A key reason we believe these reliability issues will persist is the way LLM errors interact with task complexity. Our own observations (and interpretations of much of the available research and empirical findings), suggest that LLM failure modes compound with task length in ways that </span><a href="https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life#:~:text=increasing%20time%20periods%3A-,Intriguingly,-%2C%20this%20human%20survival" rel="">exceed</a><span> typical human error patterns. This tendency for AI errors to multiply and cascade will, we suspect, remain a fundamental barrier for truly reliable agentic systems for the foreseeable future. </span></p></li><li><p><span>The fact that no LLM use case has demonstrated true determinism in real-world applications is significant. It strongly supports the theoretical arguments discussed earlier, which posit that </span><strong>hallucinations are an unavoidable, and likely unsolvable</strong><span>, aspect of current LLM architectures. </span></p></li><li><p><span>A striking example of LLMs' operational opacity comes from Anthropic's research, illustrated by how a model might calculate 36+59=95. Internally, it uses a sophisticated, multi-path strategy, approximating the sum with one heuristic while precisely determining the final digit with another. Yet, if asked to explain its calculation, the LLM describes the standard 'carry the one' algorithm taught to humans. This suggests the model lacks the mechanism to introspect and articulate the actual computational path it took. This inability to reflect post hoc—even to itself—underscores the black-box nature of LLMs. While speculative, we suspect </span><strong>this missing self-awareness contributes to their unreliability</strong><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png" width="1456" height="754" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:754,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde692a44-d80d-4209-9f9b-0acaeaf4d6f3_1600x829.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>“Claude </span><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model" rel="">seems </a><span>to be unaware of the sophisticated "mental math" strategies that it learned during training.

The key concept here is allowing the system to 'run without babysitting', requiring additional capacity for when the system flags </span><strong>exceptions </strong><span>(usually means you need manpower) doesn't change this underlying dynamic. </span></p><p>This is the only category that enables fully autonomous usage, systems that can operate without human intervention. That makes it arguably the highest-margin path, with the clearest ROI story: either an existing process becomes faster, cheaper, and more scalable, or a new one becomes viable, and in both cases, the value is easy to measure. You can point to what the system does, what it improves, and what it costs.</p><h5>This can be pursued in several ways: </h5><p><span>The aim here is to engineer an LLM-based system that, for all practical purposes, achieves complete determinism, mirroring the reliability of traditional software. Realizing this requires a system capable of exhaustively testing its outputs against rigorous criteria and, critically, remediating nearly all conceivable LLM-generated issues. Companies like </span><a href="https://www.skyramp.dev/" rel="">Skyramp</a><span>, focusing on deterministic AI for test generation, are exploring aspects of this space.</span></p><p>In practice, attaining this level of comprehensive determinism is extraordinarily challenging. It necessitates absolute confidence in having identified and addressed all potential edge cases and failure modes, a feat few if any have achieved in practice. </p><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ul><li><p>This approach demands deep AI technical expertise. Getting an LLM-based system to behave deterministically is extremely hard, and being confident that it actually does requires a sophisticated understanding of how and where LLMs can fail. Unless the problem is already widely solved, teams must be able to both achieve high accuracy and rigorously validate it across edge cases. </p></li><li><p>Such a system likely requires a very sophisticated engineering layer, IP-worthy at that, this dynamic serves as a moat from both “models getting better" and competitors.</p><ul><li><p><span>This does mean that there are likely serious demands for quality engineering talent as well, and depending on specifics, specialized talent (who </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare" rel="">else</a><span> has experience in thinking about a system’s weak points?).</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Your customer needs to trust you, really trust you that your tech does what it says it does, earning their trust may not be easy, but if you do, that is another source of competitive advantage.</p></li></ul><p>This path focuses on achieving a level of accuracy that is 'good enough' for a particular application where direct, instance-by-instance user verification is not part of the primary workflow, and occasional errors are within acceptable tolerance. </p><p>A critical requirement is achieving and validating a high degree of confidence that you have thoroughly accounted for all significant edge cases and the varied ways your LLM product can fail within the specific operational context.</p><h5>Examples: </h5><ul><li><p><span>An </span><strong>AI classifier</strong><span> designed for very large, unstructured datasets, used for broad-based trend analysis. Here, occasional misclassifications can be tolerated as they are unlikely to skew the overall insights significantly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Automated </span><strong>structured data extraction</strong><span> from documents (like invoices or forms), where the system achieves a </span><a href="https://rossum.ai/customer-stories/adyen/" rel="">high enough accuracy for</a><span> direct use in downstream processes, with the understanding that a very small residual error rate is acceptable.</span></p></li><li><p><span>AI-powered </span><strong>note-takers</strong><span> for meetings. In many common usage patterns, there's no explicit human check on the generated notes. The underlying logic is often that notes with minor errors or omissions still offer greater utility than the alternatives of laborious manual note-taking or having no record at all.</span></p></li></ul><h5>What defines this approach: </h5><ol><li><p><span>For this strategy, it's critical to </span><strong>deeply analyze the user's workflow</strong><span> and the actual consequences of different AI failure modes (e.g., overgeneralization vs. complete fabrication, missed information vs. incorrect information). This involves an in-depth mapping of how various errors will impact the user's objectives and risk exposure. </span><strong>Crucially, developers must recognize that users themselves can be poor judges of these risks or may be overly trusting</strong><span>, as evidenced by ongoing issues like professionals misusing LLMs in critical fields despite widely known failure patterns (e.g., </span><a href="https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/" rel="">at least 20 cases</a><span> of legal decisions where AI produced hallucinations just this month, despite hallucinations in law being a high-profile failure mode for </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-ai-fake-cases.html" rel="">years</a><span>). The onus is on the product team to anticipate these issues, understand the true (not just stated) risk tolerance, and design accordingly, rather than solely relying on users to self-regulate their trust.</span></p></li><li><p><span>While perhaps less demanding than striving for proper determinism, it still requires </span><strong>strong enough AI skills to know what accuracy actually means in context</strong><span>, how to measure it, interpret it, and design around it. </span></p></li><li><p><span>For this strategy, the central aspect of product design is ensuring the product's </span><strong>core AI performance</strong><span> (its accuracy and reliability) is properly calibrated. While usability is always a factor, it's secondary here to achieving the target performance level. </span></p></li><li><p><span>Customers must </span><strong>trust the product's defined level of accuracy</strong><span>. This requires demonstrating consistent performance within those bounds, which can then become a key differentiator and competitive moat. </span></p></li></ol><p>Unlike approaches that strive to engineer out all AI variance, the second broad strategy for LLM product development accepts a degree of inherent model variability and focuses on managing its impact by integrating human verification into the process. </p><p><span>This common approach involves creating products where the </span><strong>end-user directly reviews, validates, and potentially corrects the AI's output as part of their workflow</strong><span>. To succeed, the value proposition must clearly justify the user's verification effort; the AI's assistance, even if imperfect, must be preferable to alternatives. </span></p><ul><li><p>Examples</p><ul><li><p><strong>Search &amp; discovery tools</strong><span> (e.g., web search, shopping search): Users often don't need every possible correct answer and can tolerate some irrelevant results if the tool quickly surfaces useful or intriguing information.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Information triage</strong><span> (e.g., "important document" finders in email): An AI might flag potentially missed invoices or critical communications. The user quickly verifies if the flagged items are indeed relevant, a task easier than manually sifting through everything.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful general-purpose chatbots</strong><span>: LLMs via the chat interface are so broadly capable that users find ways to derive utility despite needing to critically evaluate responses and manage occasional errors.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>"Copilot" paradigms</strong><span> (e.g., coding assistants like Cursor, legal tools like Harvey, etc.): The AI generates drafts or suggestions (code, legal clauses, analyses), and the expert user, who is "in the loop" at the right time, can quickly identify and correct issues.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Creative “content generation”</strong><span>: These are the canonical examples. Users can easily assess if the output’s style and basic coherence are suitable.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ul><li><p><strong>Workflow augmentation:</strong><span> These products almost always enhance a specific user persona’s workflow rather than fully automating a standalone function (there’s also a small class of “alerting” use cases, but we assess that category to be relatively limited). This stems directly from the need for human verification: when humans are in the loop, they’re usually using the AI to do their job better, not babysitting it. In other words, the AI augments the human, not the other way around. While you can design a system where a human simply verifies AI outputs, that pattern rarely proves compelling in practice. The output has to be so valuable that it justifies paying someone to check it, and most applications don’t clear that bar. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Ceiling more than floor</strong><span>: Since this approach often involves users adopting new ways of working, the "ceiling" of value, the significant benefit derived from the AI's best or most insightful contributions, must be exceptionally high. This potential for substantial gains (e.g., speed, unique insights, quality improvements) is instrumental in justifying a change in work pattern and earn the user's verification effort. The focus is less on average AI accuracy ("floor") and more on the transformative potential of the AI's peak contributions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Usability is central</strong><span>: Since user interaction and verification are integral, nailing the UI/UX for verification, correction, and seamless integration into the user's existing or new workflow is vital. Quality of user experience is then the primary differentiator and source of competitive advantage.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Designed for verifiability</strong><span>: A central characteristic is the design of AI outputs that are easily and reliably verifiable by the intended skilled end-user. This involves careful consideration of information presentation, the nature of the AI’s output, and ensuring the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2505.08063v1#:~:text=3.1.,Task%20Performance" rel="">right </a><span>user is targeted (e.g., AI accounting tools for accountants who can vet the suggestions).</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This distinct model places the responsibility for </span><strong>verification and</strong><span> </span><strong>ensuring the quality of the final output squarely on the product or service provider</strong><span>. This involves the provider's own internal human review processes, often working in concert with AI and specialized software to deliver a "done-for-you," result. From the customer's perspective, the AI's imperfections are handled "behind the curtain."</span></p><p>The end-user perceives this as an "AI-powered service". Usually, this involves the provider taking over a specific, often narrow, function previously handled by the client, fulfilling it in a third-party services style. The client receives a completed task or a digestible deliverable, effectively outsourcing the complexity of managing the AI and its potential variance.</p><h5>What defines this approach</h5><ol><li><p><strong>Specialized, narrow-scope offerings with optimized playbooks</strong><span>: Real value and defensibility are typically unlocked when a provider identifies a narrow scope—a specific, well-defined problem or function that can be demonstrably and massively improved with AI. This focus is critical because:</span></p><ol><li><p>Identifying such improvable functions and developing effective playbooks is a key capability in itself; achieving this across broader, more general functions is significantly more challenging.</p></li><li><p><span>As empirical findings to date </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/making-ai-work-leadership-lab-and" rel="">suggest,</a><span> simply layering AI onto existing broad processes (as some "</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/khosla-ventures-among-vcs-experimenting-with-ai-infused-roll-ups-of-mature-companies/" rel="">rollup</a><span>" strategies might attempt) often falls short of delivering significant productivity gains. True transformation typically requires a fundamental redesign of how work is done, which is most feasible within a narrow, provider-controlled scope.</span></p></li><li><p>Investing in a dedicated software layer around the LLM for a provider-managed workflow (e.g., specialized internal UIs, tailored integrations, automation scripts) typically yields a high return on investment. However, this level of impactful, specialized engineering is generally only feasible when the operational scope is narrowly defined; it becomes impractical or offers diminishing returns for overly broad, general-purpose applications.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>AI integration &amp; workforce management</strong><span>: The provider's operational ability to effectively integrate AI tools with their skilled human workforce to genuinely maximize productivity and quality is essential.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The pivotal role of domain expertise</strong><span>: This expertise is necessary for designing effective AI-augmented workflows, facilitating effective quality control, and ensuring the final output meets exacting client standards.

		📰 Penny‑1.7B · Irish Penny Journal Style (GRPO)
	</span>
</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>style transfer</strong> from the Irish Penny Journal (1840) to Smollm2 using GRPO. For example, this response to "What is the capital of France"</p>
<pre><code>Verily, in the grand tapestry of European monarchies, the city of Paris, the seat of the mighty Emperor Napoleon, holds a place of singular distinction. This city, which hath borne the name of 'La Ville Lumière' for nigh on two centuries, doth shine forth as a beacon of art, culture, and intellect, its very existence a testament to the ingenuity and brilliance of its people. And so, it is with great honour and reverence that we declare Paris, the majestic capital of the French realm, to be our noble question's answer.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Penny‑1.7B</strong> is a 1.7 billion‑parameter causal language model fine‑tuned with <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong> to emulate the 19ᵗʰ‑century prose of the <em>Irish Penny Journal</em> (1840). The RL stage ran for <strong>6,800 policy steps</strong>, using a reward model trained to classify sentences as <em>original IPJ</em> vs <em>modern translation</em>. Maximizing this score nudges generations toward authentic Victorian‑era diction while retaining the general reasoning ability of the base SmolLM2 model.</p>

<p dir="auto">Project Overview</p>
<p dir="auto">Vanta is a lightweight, fast, command-line-based network behavior analyzer. It reconstructs protocol-level flows and extracts structured activity from captured data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike full-featured GUI tools like Wireshark, Vanta focuses on clarity, structure, and simplicity — ideal for custom scripting and minimal setups.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Features</p>
<p dir="auto">Protocol-Level Parsing</p>
<p dir="auto">Supports HTTP, DNS, TLS (with partial fingerprinting)</p>
<p dir="auto">Connection Tracking</p>
<p dir="auto">Automatically reconstructs bidirectional flows</p>
<p dir="auto">Behavior Exporting</p>
<p dir="auto">Outputs clean JSON-formatted summaries</p>
<p dir="auto">Portable &amp; Dependency-Free</p>
<p dir="auto">Single binary, no external dependencies</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Quick Start (See usage/ folder for full guide)</p>
<p dir="auto">go run main.go</p>
<p dir="auto">Refer to the usage folder for complete usage documentation in Chinese.</p>

<p dir="auto">Why I Built This</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is not just code — it's a response. Amid political pressure, some universities like Harvard, MIT, and CMU stood up for international students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’m just an ordinary undergraduate with no resources or background. This is my way of responding — not by petition, but through code. Vanta may be small, but it’s real, and it’s mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I know Vanta is a "toy version" of Wireshark — I still use Wireshark myself in real scenarios.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to Professors and Schools</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you for standing up for students.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project might not be perfect, but it is heartfelt.</p>

We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country.

We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models [2].

Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy &amp; we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can "choose their own loss function". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders &amp; problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)</p><p>We're currently hiring for full-stack engineers to help build our product, field engineers that work directly with our customers to solve their business needs with computer vision, and several technical roles on the sales team.</p><p>We raised our Series B round at the end of last year, led by GV.

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.</p><p>We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.</p><p>Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.</p><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-junior-software-engineer-global-remote">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j...</a></p><p>--</p><p>Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more.

Hi, I'm Harry Altman! I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger (<a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/debugger">https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package...</a>), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things.</p><p>I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.)</p><p>I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys).</p><p>I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire!</p></div></td></tr>

I’m a recent graduate and spend most days hopping between React/Next.js, Node/Flask backends, and Unity projects that mix AI with mixed reality. My toolbelt leans JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, plus C# for anything 3-D. I’m comfortable shipping to AWS or GCP, containerizing with Docker/K8s, and dabbling in LangChain/LangGraph whenever LLMs can save time. I’m open to relocating to a good tech hub if it means tackling something inventive.</p></div></td></tr>

I've built applications in just about every language you can think of. In 2021 I built an algorithmic market making company in the NFT space. I scaled that to &gt; $50M GMV in the first year. We traded tens of thousands of NFT's using the algorithms and systems I built.  During that time I hosted services on just about every cloud provider, used a network of residential proxies, was constantly fighting evolving anti-scraping/botting tech, and built front end browser automations to place bids/buys on NFT marketplaces. Most recently I built a series of automations for a company that imports gourmet food from Europe into the US. This involved OCR of documents, using AI to automate various manual stages, and creating visibility dashboards for goods across the entire pipeline. Previously built 70+ mobile apps as well as worked with startups and larger orgs on frontier tech products.</p></div></td></tr>

I am currently seeking roles that combine coding and communication – developer relations, automation design, or documentation engineer. I have a unique mix of software development and writing skills, with 8+ years of experience building business automation tools and internal systems (primarily JavaScript, with some Python and Ruby). Additionally I have 14 years of writing experience, creating software docs, marketing material, business policy, procedural manuals, and more. My experience combined with a PMP background allows me to bridge the gap between technical teams and stakeholders. Interested in hearing more about my skills? Let's chat!</p></div></td></tr>

Hi HN! I'm Eric, a senior software engineer who has worked in the intersection of the databases and compilers spaces.
I have nearly 10 years experience at Microsoft as a developer on a partially-lazy functional query language.
Before that, I concentrated heavily on compilers, programming language theory, and formal logic in college
(with some OS kernel and computer algebra stuff on top), and I remain passionate about them. In the years since I've gained knowledge of modern OLAP database internals.
Recently I've worked on Parquet integration and optimization in this query language and Microsoft more broadly.</p><p>On the side I experiment with programming language design, especially with applying math-inspired ideas to low-level programming.
I'm looking for a fully-remote position. If any of this sounds interesting, please reach out.</p></div></td></tr>

I'm a DevOps/Platform/Infra/Backend generalist with ~13.5 years of experience and a bachelor's in CS and about a decade of farting around prior to that. I'm finishing up migrating and modernizing a major product for the Department of Veterans Affairs, and I'm looking to exit the civic tech space.</p><p>I'm interested in machine learning and AI, ideally HPC and/or scientific/research computing. My idea has been to move into MLOps, then move from there into HPC, and my longterm goal (5-10 years) is to move into deep tech research (possibly get my PhD).</p><p>But I have broad interests and my feelings about AI are complicated. I don't think I'm searching for a destination, but searching for a journey and companions. I don't know much more than that, except that it probably doesn't involve me doing frontend.</p><p>My current fun-time project is writing an LLM agent to personify my Raspberry Pi research cluster, and write tools, MCP plugins, etc to embody that simulated consciousness within the infrastructure. It feels weirdly like stapling a ghost to a circuit board.</p><pre><code>    Q. Where do you see yourself in five years?

I've programmed in many languages and environments over the years. Some of my current interests are:</p><p>• Aviation and geographic data. For example, airspace and obstacle data importers for Wing; election results and voter information maps for Google; many interactive maps for other companies.</p><p>• Hardware interfacing. In a way, I am a "full stack" developer, but my stack may involve a front end to a piece of hardware rather than the cloud. I first got into programming via ham radio, so RF hardware remains an interest.</p><p>• Designing and building APIs. Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build.</p><p>• Talk with users! I don't like to sit in a back room cranking out code. I want to make sure it's the right code for what my users need, and that it's easy to maintain and improve as we learn more about what they want.</p><p>Open to full time or contract.</p><p>I look forward to talking with you!</p></div></td></tr>

Customer-Facing Engineer / DevRel / Support Leader — Built multiple 0→1 functions at early YC startups.</p><p>I'm a customer-facing technical leader with 10+ years in tech and a track record of building customer experience functions from scratch. Most recently, I was the first customer-facing hire at Pythagora (YC W24), a startup building an AI software engineer. I owned everything outside of engineering: support, developer relations / developer advocate, docs, YouTube demos, influencer outreach, blog posts, and building + open-sourcing demo apps.</p><p>Before that, I was the first remote hire at Streak (YC S11) and spent several years owning customer onboarding, support, and automation. I also learned to code on the side, eventually completing the Capstone program at Launch School.</p><p>I’m especially strong in early-stage chaos, where startups need someone who can do a bit of everything, talk to users, squash bugs, clean up docs, spin up demo apps, handle a support queue, write content, and generally make the founders’ lives easier.</p><p>I’m looking for a startup where I can either be the first customer engineer or support leader, or join a small team as a DevRel/Community Engineer and help ship content + build trust with technical users.</p><p>What I’m best at:</p><p>* Translating user feedback into roadmap clarity</p><p>* Turning vague “customer needs” into structured, scalable systems</p><p>* Writing fast, clear docs + building content users actually read</p><p>* Jumping into startup Discords and building real community</p><p>* Owning support and success systems without needing hand-holding</p></div></td></tr>

I’ve built entire systems from the ground up, delivered physical products in a matter of weeks, and kept Oil Rigs working offshore, built departments filled with the best people to produce top results and make the wonderful dreams reality.</p><p>With a background in Electro Mechanical Engineering, I’ve designed products for the consumer, offshore, military markets, so I know what good hardware looks like. I’ve built prototypes for many markets, and architected complex systems from concept to retirement, in a complete cradle to grave manner. I’ve worked closely with software teams to guide development of new features to protect marine vessels from GPS jamming, developed APIs for integration and dug through code by hand to reverse engineer old products that haven’t been touched in decades to determine their operation and how they will be supported and upgraded to turn them into the feature they should be.</p><p>As an Engineering Manager, I’ve been the driving force behind teams. I build teams based on two key ideas - is the team one full of individuals that are valued for their expertise, and is the culture one that I would like to be a part of? I make it a matter of pride that everyone should feel like an integral part of the team, and that mentality comes from the top down. I’ve worked with remotely distributed teams across many different disciplines, all working towards the end goal without ego getting in the way. My job has always been simple as the EM, give the team the tools and trust they need to do their absolute best.</p><p>Your idea is your baby, it’s precious to you. I’ve worked at startups, small companies and mega corporations and I’ve always maintained a very simple philosophy when it comes to work - “are we doing what the customer needs with the best people we can get?”</p><p>I’m your mechanical engineer, engineering manager, product manager, systems engineer, R&amp;D specialist, market analyst and head of technology in one, and I’m ready to make your dream the product it needs to be, hardware or software.</p></div></td></tr>

Robotics is a place where multiple fields converge and if you find a good team they will help you to grow.</p><p>Embedded is the adjacent field after you complete the course. Maybe something like zephyr project.</p><p>If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper.</p><p>As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank.</p><p>Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are.</p><p>And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Microcontrollers and PLC are historically different fields that have some overlap as the fields converge somewhat. PLC come from relay logic and so learning Ladder Logic and playing with a cheaper Automation Direct PLC might be good if you're looking to do control systems like industrial machines and those robotics. RPi series micros are good to learn embedded electronics, servo controls and Realtime OS. Computer Engineering and Control System Engineering are treated differently even in the California State Engineering License Exams, so they tend to be different paths but the skills have some overlap.

So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours.</p><p>I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons.</p></div></td></tr>

Courses, ROS, Programs etc. Just picking one is a fine start and you will learn something, but you may not have fun or appreciate the context for what you are learning, which makes it hard to care.</p><p>It also depends on what you're trying to learn. Programming? control? electronics? mechanism design? There are many different aspects that require their own expertise. I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch.</p><p>This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot. You are doing the whole thing from scratch, no kit. (kits are super useful, but I personally like building everything and making hardware that works for me). In my eyes, if you haven't built it in hardware, it probably isn't a robot.</p><p>As a research roboticist, my best advice is forget Learning it all up front and just start building. You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more "formal" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist.</p><p>My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT!</p><p>For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for &lt;$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive.</p><p>For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all.</p><p>For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running.</p><p>As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach.</p></div></td></tr>

Throughout these API calls, ThorVG effectively serializes drawing commands among volatile paint nodes. Subsequently, it undertakes synchronous or asynchronous rendering via its backend raster engines. Additionally, ThorVG is adept at handling vector images, including formats like SVG, and it remains adaptable for accommodating additional popular formats as needed. In the rendering process, the library may generate intermediate frame buffers for scene compositing, though only when essential. The accompanying diagram provides a concise overview of how to effectively incorporate ThorVG within your system.</span></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div id="comp-llsqwmc6"><p><img loading="lazy" sizes="846px" srcset="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b144cf_1c4861b661034313b797cc06c25be907~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_846,h_262,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/example_flow.png 1x, https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b144cf_1c4861b661034313b797cc06c25be907~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1182,h_366,al_c,q_90,enc_avif,quality_auto/example_flow.png 2x" id="img_comp-llsqwmc6" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b144cf_1c4861b661034313b797cc06c25be907~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_846,h_262,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/example_flow.png" alt="thorvg integration " width="846" height="262"></p></div><!--/$--></div><!--/$--><!--$--><div data-mesh-id="comp-m89rohulinlineContent" data-testid="inline-content" id="comp-m89rohul" tabindex="-1" data-block-level-container="ClassicSection"><!--$--><p id="comp-m89romqb" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span><span>Render Backends</span></span></h2></p><!--/$--><!--$--><div id="comp-m89rpbv8" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Today, ThorVG provides its own implementation of multiple raster engines, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your app and system preferences.</span></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial domain has opened new avenues for quantitative trading, particularly through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the challenge of effectively synthesizing insights from diverse data sources and integrating both structured and unstructured data persists. This paper presents TradeExpert, a novel framework that employs a mix of experts (MoE) approach, using four specialized LLMs, each analyzing distinct sources of financial data, including news articles, market data, alpha factors, and fundamental data. The insights of these expert LLMs are further synthesized by a General Expert LLM to make a final prediction or decision. With specific prompts, TradeExpert can be switched between the prediction mode and the ranking mode for stock movement prediction and quantitative stock trading, respectively. In addition to existing benchmarks, we also release a large-scale financial dataset to comprehensively evaluate TradeExpert's effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate TradeExpert's superior performance across all trading scenarios.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>As you progress in your career, understanding the difference between being useful and being valued is very important. At first glance, they might look similar because the signals you get are more or less the same: a promotion, a higher than expected bonus, a special stock award. This is why it’s important to dig deeper and try to detect subtler signals.</p><p><span>Being </span><em>useful</em><span> means that you are good at getting things done in a specific area, so that people above you can delegate that completely. You are reliable, efficient, maybe even indispensable in the short term. But you are seen primarily as a gap-filler, someone who delivers on tasks that have to be done but are not necessarily a core component of the company strategy. “Take care of that and don’t screw up” is your mission, and the fewer headaches you create for your leadership chain, the bigger the rewards.</span></p><p><span>Being </span><em>valued</em><span>, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction. This comes with opportunities to grow and contribute in ways that are meaningful to you and the business.</span></p><p>It took me a few years to truly grasp the difference. If you’re valued, you’ll likely see a clear path for advancement and development, you might get more strategic roles and involvement in key decisions. If you are just useful, your role might feel more stagnant. </p><p>Let me walk you through two contrasting experiences from my own career that made this difference clearer to me.</p><p>When I was an IC, there was a period when my company was going through a tough time. We missed earnings guidance by a lot in one quarter, and layoffs were inevitable. Entire teams were disbanded, and my own manager was among those let go, so I was quite nervous. But instead of being on the chopping block, I was not only retained but also offered a significant retention bonus: 50% of my total comp, with a one year vesting schedule. </p><p>Leadership made it clear that they saw me as critical to the company’s future, not just because of what I had delivered in the past, but to help shape what came next. The business was changing, becoming more digital, and they needed the skills I was bringing to the table. Interestingly, this validation didn’t come from a performance review or a bonus alone. It came in a moment of crisis, when hard choices had to be made about who mattered most to the mission ahead.</p><p>Later on, I found myself in a role that, on the surface, looked like a success story. I was consistently hitting targets, getting recognition from leadership, and receiving generous bonuses and retention grants. The company clearly saw me as someone worth keeping around. But over time, I started to notice that while I was being rewarded, I wasn’t really being asked to take on new kinds of problems or invited into strategic conversations. No one was talking to me about where I wanted to go next or how I could grow. </p><p>I had become the go-to person for making things run smoothly, for fixing urgent problems, for delivering. But every time I pushed toward more strategic and ambitious directions, there was a lot of can-kicking and “let’s think about it” that went nowhere. I was incredibly useful to the organization, but not necessarily valued, and at some point, I started feeling a sense of stagnation. Compensation was good, the actual job was aligned with my interests, but that sense of being just a useful caretaker was hitting my motivation. In the end, I had to move on to another role.</p><p>If you’re reading this and wondering which side of the line you are on, I encourage you to take a moment to step back and look beyond the surface. Are you valued, or just useful?</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>MicroSD cards seem to be the preferred storage for Raspberry Pis and many other SBCs.  Of course, there's other applications for microSD cards -- cameras, smart phones, gaming consoles...and other stuff I'm sure.  But sooner or later, people start to run into issues with their microSD cards, which begs a question -- just how reliable are they?</p>

<p>When I first started searching around for an answer, I got a range of different answers -- some people said "modern flash should last practically forever"; others said "they should last for at least a million program/erase cycles"; while more pessimistic sources said "don't expect them to last more than a few thousand program/erase cycles".  But empirical data seems to be hard to come by.</p>

<p>So...about a year and 10 months ago, I set out to answer this question.  (Well, truth be told, I was actually trying to answer a slightly different question -- but it quickly morphed into this one.)  And since then, I've acquired 256 microSD cards of various brands, product lines, and sizes.  I've at least started testing 223 of them by continuously writing to them (and reading back the data and verifying that it's correct).  I've tested 105 of them to the point of failure.  I've written over 47 <em>petabytes</em> of random data to them so far -- trying to sus out just how reliable they are.</p>

<p>The results are pretty interesting.  I'll spare the finer details here (see <a href="https://www.bahjeez.com/the-great-microsd-card-survey/">my website</a> for more info), but some of the highlights?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Occasional errors seem to be a fact of life with microSD cards, even for name-brand cards:</strong> Of the cards I've tested, 82% have experienced at least one error so far.  The results seem to run the gamut: some cards experienced their first error before completing even 10 read/write cycles (and yes, there are a couple name-brand cards included in that), while others went for several thousand read/write cycles.  (I have one card that's closing in on 100,000 read/write cycles and still hasn't experienced a single error -- but that one is an outlier.)  So far, the average time to first error is around 2,400 read/write cycles.  The median value is just 1,450 read/write cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Overall, the reliability of microSD cards has been pretty poor:</strong> I arbitrarily chose 0.1% -- as in "0.1% of the card's sectors have experienced errors" -- as the point where you'd likely have noticed that something is wrong with your card.  And of the cards that I've tested so far, almost half have reached that point -- with the average being around 4,500 read/write cycles.  The median value is just 3,100 read/write cycles.  The caveat here is that this doesn't include cards that are still going and haven't failed yet -- but we should be able to infer from this that about a quarter of all microSD cards will fail completely or hit the 0.1% failure threshold before they hit 3,100 read/write cycles -- a pretty depressing figure if you ask me.</li>
<li><strong>Some brands have surprised me:</strong> Before I started this project, I admittedly had some bias towards/against certain name brands.  Others were brands I'd never heard of or had any experience with, so I didn't have much in terms of a bias.  However, as this project has gone on, those biases have shifted, and new biases have been formed.  Here's a quick run-down on how some of the more notable brands did:

<ul>
<li><strong>ADATA:</strong> This is a brand that I didn't have much experience with before starting this project, but I had come across their name several times and assumed that they were a decent brand (and also they're listed as a member of the SD Association -- so that lent a little bit of credibility to them, at least in my mind).  However, all three failed at a point that was below average (at an average of just 2,352 read/write cycles).</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Basics:</strong> These cards have actually been surprisingly good in terms of reliability.  I have four of them, and they've been in testing for almost a year now -- and none of them have failed.  All four are well below the 0.1% failure threshold, while two of them haven't experienced a single error yet.</li>
<li><strong>Delkin Devices:</strong> Another brand I didn't have any personal experience with beforehand.  I picked up three of these, and while they've only been in testing for 6-8 months, they've all made it past the average time to first error and haven't experienced a single error so far.</li>
<li><strong>Gigastone:</strong> Meh.  I've tested 9 of their cards so far (and I still have two more in the package), and 8 of them have failed completely -- with the best performer failing after only 6 months.  That should tell you something right there.</li>
<li><strong>Kingston:</strong> Like many of you, I've have had issues with Kingston cards in the past, but the data seems to indicate that Kingston has changed their tune.  Of the 15 Kingston cards I have right now, only one has completely failed -- and many of those cards have been in testing for a year or more now.  Even their industrial grade cards have fared better than SanDisk's -- whereas the 3 SanDisk Industrial cards I bought all failed before hitting the 21,000 read/write cycle mark, my 3 Kingston Industrial cards have gone 2-3x that number and are still going strong.  Overall, Kingston has been above average in terms of reliability (even if you don't include the industrial-grade cards in that mix).  (On an unrelated note: I do a little bit of performance testing on these cards before I start doing endurance testing on them, and my top performer so far is a Kingston -- specifically, the Kingston Canvas Go! Plus.)</li>
<li><strong>Kioxia:</strong> This one has been a little bit of a mixed bag.  I have 10 of their cards -- four Excerias, three Exceria Plus's, and three Exceria G2s.  As a whole, the Excerias didn't do very well: all four have failed completely, and three of the four were below average in terms of endurance.  The Exceria Plus's and the Exceria G2s, on the other hand, have done pretty well: all 6 of them have been in testing for over a year now, all 6 have made it more than 10,000 read/write cycles, and all 6 are well below the 0.1% failure threshold.  One of the G2s has yet to experience its first error.  Overall, Kioxia's cards have scored above average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Lexar:</strong> I have 6 Lexar cards -- three that date to before their Micron days, and three that date after Lexar's sale to Longsys.  Two of the three Micron-made cards experienced a strange issue: in almost every round of testing, there would be a handful of sectors where 4 bytes -- in the same location (within the sector) every time -- would be completely off from what they were supposed to be.  On top of that, it was the same 4 bytes on both cards -- which tells me that this was more of a manufacturing issue.  Due to what I can only assume was wear leveling, different sectors would be affected by this issue every time.  (The third card wasn't actually made by Micron -- it was made by Phison.)  Regardless, all 6 cards have been in testing for over a year now, and all of them are well below the 0.1% failure threshold.  Overall, Lexar has been above average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>onn.:</strong> This is Walmart's private label.  I saw these while in one of their stores, and picked up four of them on a whim.  I was pretty disappointed by the results: they all failed before hitting even 2,000 read/write cycles, with the average point of failure being just 1,400 read/write cycles.</li>
<li><strong>OV:</strong> This is a brand I found on AliExpress.  While I don't want to call this a <em>good</em> brand (they're actually pretty terrible in terms of read/write performance), I have three of their cards -- one has been in testing for over a year and a half, while the other two are a little shy of that -- and they've done pretty well in endurance tests, with all three completing over 10,000 read/write cycles and staying far shy of the 0.1% failure threshold.  Overall, these cards have scored above average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>PNY:</strong> I have 9 of their cards in testing right now.  Six of them have been in testing for over a year, while the other three have only been in testing for a couple of months.  All of them are well below the 0.1% failure threshold, but I just don't have enough data yet to say whether they're above average or below average in terms of endurance.</li>
<li><strong>Samsung:</strong> Samsung has actually done pretty well in terms of endurance.  I have 9 of their cards; all of them have been in testing for more than a year now, and all of them are well below the 0.1% failure threshold -- with 5 of them not having even experienced their first error yet.  However, these cards actually have pretty bad sequential write speeds -- meaning that I don't have enough data yet to say whether they're above average or below average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>SanDisk/WD:</strong> My bias at the start of this project was <em>in favor</em> of SanDisk -- I have a few Raspberry Pi's, and a lot of Orange Pi's, and I've been using SanDisk Ultra's with almost all of them.  However, I've noticed a rather disturbing trend with SanDisk cards: they tend to fail suddenly and without warning.  Of course, this is true of a lot of cards -- but what's unusual is that one company (<a href="https://support.embeddedts.com/support/solutions/articles/22000202866-sd-card-testing">who did a similar test</a>) noticed that they were sensitive to brownouts; and frankly, I've found the same to be true in my testing: a few cards suddenly quit working after a power failure, while a couple others stopped working after I plugged in a new card reader into a nearby USB port.  Overall, I have 29 SanDisk cards that I've tested (including 3 WD-branded cards), and 14 of them have failed completely (with two more on their way out the door as of the time of this writing).</li>
<li><strong>Silicon Power (SP):</strong> I didn't have any personal experience with Silicon Power before starting this project, but I've heard anecdotes from a few people saying that they like their cards.  However, the data seems to show that they're actually below average in terms of reliability: out of the 8 cards that I've tested so far, 5 of them have failed completely.  The average point at which they failed was just under 2,000 read/write cycles, putting them well below average in terms of reliability.  And out of those five, four of them failed at or near the point at which they experienced their first error -- so I guess the lesson here is, if you start to notice issues with your SP card, replace it immediately!</li>
<li><strong>Transcend:</strong> I have three of their cards, and they've been in testing for 10 months now.  All three of them have made it well past the average time to the 0.1% failure threshold (with one of them having yet to experience its first error), but I don't have enough data yet to say whether they're above average or below average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>XrayDisk:</strong> Another random brand I found on AliExpress.  I have three of their cards: one has failed completely, while the other two are still going.  While not great in terms of read/write performance, they've all done above average in terms of reliability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Off-brand cards have done about as well as name-brand cards:</strong> Of the cards I've tested (not including any that I've labelled as "fake flash"), I have 111 name-brand cards and 91 that I've labelled as "off-brand" -- brands that a tech-savvy consumer wouldn't necessarily recognize or who wouldn't normally be associated with SD cards or flash memory in general.  (And yes -- I have a few HP cards in my mix that I've labelled as "off-brand", because you don't normally associate HP with SD cards or flash memory.)  However, the data so far seems to indicate that there isn't much of a difference -- in terms of reliability -- between name-brand cards and off-brand cards.  In fact, the data right now is leaning slightly in favor of off-brand cards: the average number of read/write cycles to the 0.1% failure threshold for name-brand cards is currently sitting at about 5,300; for off-brand cards, it's about 4,900.  Of course, fake flash did significantly worse: the average for fake flash is currently sitting at about 2,200.</li>
<li><strong>There's a variety of ways in which cards can fail:</strong> SD cards have a register called the CSD register.  This register stores information about the card's capabilities, its timing parameters, and its performance characteristics; it also stores the size of the card and couple of write-protection bits: a "permanent" write-protect bit and a "temporary" write-protect bit.  If you're lucky, the permanent write-protect bit will get flipped, and you'll find yourself unable to write anything new to the card -- but this is kind of a best case scenario, because it means that most (if not all) of your data is still intact and you have time to back it up.  But this isn't the only way in which cards fail -- I've had cards whose CSD register was completely corrupted, causing the reader to believe it was only 127MB in size; and I've had cards where every sector returns corrupt data.  But the most common failure mode?  To explain that requires a little bit of explanation.  When a card reader is initializing an SD card, the reader sends a command to the card indicating which voltages it supports.  Once the card receives this command, it's supposed to start its initialization and power-up sequence, and it's supposed to complete it within one second.  Most cards, when they fail, will respond to basic commands, but when instructed to start their power-up sequence, never finish it.  Some of them will reset themselves during this process -- which makes me wonder if the failure is due to something shorting out within the card.</li>
<li><strong>Cards from Amazon did better than cards from AliExpress:</strong> Amazon and AliExpress have been my two main suppliers (although I've gotten cards from a few other places) -- and there does seem to be at least a little bit of a difference between the two.  Admittedly, a bigger chunk of the cards I ordered from AliExpress were fake flash or off-brand cards; but even if I narrow it down to just name-brand cards, the same holds true.</li>
</ul>

<p>So...this is an ongoing project -- which I imagine won't be done for quite some time still.  But hopefully this helps you when deciding what microSD card to put in your Raspberry Pi!</p>
