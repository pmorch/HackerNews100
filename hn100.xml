<p>Is this a legacy thing or does a tilted cursor serves a purpose? I can tell that, the angle provides a totally vertical left edge which helps when highlighting text but what else apart from that?</p>

<p>EDIT: When cursor is swapped by the little hand cursor when hovered over buttons, the angle seems to be smaller. Why the difference?</p>

<p>This is the historical reason:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e1zH5.png" alt="Concept drawing of the standard mouse cursor at an angle"></p>

<p>(Concept drawing taken from document: <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/VLSI-81-1_The_Optical_Mouse.pdf">VLSI-81-1_The_Optical_Mouse.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>The mouse, and therefore the mouse cursor, was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/features/2005/05/gui/2/">invented by Douglas Engelbart</a>, and was initially <a href="http://origin.arstechnica.com/images/gui/4-NLSgui.jpg">an arrow pointing up</a>. </p>

<p>When the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/features/2005/05/gui/3/">XEROX PARC</a> machine was built, the cursor changed into a tilted arrow. It was found that, given the low resolution of the screens in those days, drawing a straight line (left edge of arrow) and a line at a 45 degree angle (right edge of arrow) was easier to do and more recognizable than the straight cursor.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/52338/43668">Bart's answer</a>, I'd like to add one more reason. </p>

<p>The reason the arrow was tilted to the left was so that the click position was easier to calculate, because the origin of the cursor's bitmap was in the upper left.  This saved the mouse tracking subroutine a calculation on every click (its not much but it helped on older machines).  </p>

<h2>Low level visual cognition</h2>
<p>In addition to the various answers given, there is also sense in a tilted mouse pointer if one considers the visual processes in our brain.</p>
<p>Visual information arriving from our eyes is first processed in the primary visual cortex by the V1 area, then by the V2 area. These two areas recognise low-level visual features (hue, lightness, size, orientation, etc.).</p>
<h2>The popout effect</h2>
<p>As visual information is processed by these areas, some visual irregularities truly pop out (ie, they are highly distinguishable), which greatly helps visual search (trying to find an item in a visually busy field). The popular name for this phenomenon is <strong>the popout effect</strong>.</p>
<p>A famous research from 1988 - <a href="http://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/hollingworth/prosem/Treisman_Gormican_88_PR_FeatureAnalysisIn.pdf" rel="noreferrer">A. Treisman, and S. Gormican: Feature analysis in early vision: Evidence from search asymmetries</a> summarises many of these popout effects, and the irregularities they involve.</p>
<h2>Orientation</h2>
<p>One such irregularity is <strong>orientation</strong>, and it is neatly explained by the following illustration:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4xWaH.png" alt="3 images showing many vertical lines and how a tilted line pops out"></p>
<p>You should find it next to impossible to find the search target in 1 (a straight line in a group of straight lines). But rather easy in 2 - finding a tilted line in a group of straight lines. In 3 it should be equally next to impossible to find the tilted line in a group of tilted lines (of the same angle).</p>
<p>Since vertical and horizontal orientations are the most common ones on screens (and in life in general) a tilted mouse pointer will be more easily found.</p>
<p>More information can be found in Chapter 2 (What we can easily see) of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Thinking-Kaufmann-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123708966/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384303964&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=visual+thinking+for+design" rel="noreferrer">Visual Thinking for Design</a>, Ware 2008.</p>

<p>I've always thought that the arrow cursor is shaped similarly to your hand if you were point (naturally) at the screen with your (as typically dominant) right hand.</p>

<p>I have no support of this other than my own subjective experience but it strikes me as a natural shape when trying to relate real world interaction into a low resolution computer screen where rendering something resembling a hand would be impossible.</p>

<p>Also, there is another answer to this question. As a rule, the <strong>arrow</strong> mouse cursor must have one sharp tip (vertex) - because it is an arrow :) </p>

<p>On the other hand, it is better for a mouse cursor to look good and slick. </p>

<p>But drawing sharp tip on a rectangular pixel based display is very hard, especially without anti-aliasing. </p>

<p>The 0 degrees (horizontal or vertical) and 45 degrees lines are the only possible lines that look smooth without anti-aliasing. </p>

<p>That is why almost all arrow mouse cursors are based on one straight and one 45 degrees lines. As a result, the bisector line has angle of 45/2 = 22.5 degrees.</p>

<p>The tail of the arrow is much harder to be drawn well, but it is not so important as well. </p>

<p><strong>It is a right-handed world.</strong> </p>

<p>It used to be that if you switched our right/left click buttons the arrow would point towards the right (opposite of the images cited). </p>

<p>This supports that the arrow mimics a hand pointing while providing angular contrast. Without a reference, it is an extension of the <em>desktop</em> metaphor.</p>

<p>The fact that the mouse cursor is slightly tilted to the left makes a lot of sense. 
A very interesting fact:</p>

<p>If it were straight, it would take a nanosecond more to place the cursor on the desired object. Human mind is generally used to perceiving elements from left to the right, that is why the cursor is designed into the opposite direction, anticipating the intent of interaction with the element you are about to click on.</p>

<p>A nanosecond of time optimization is the closest thing to the absolute idea of irrelevance. With that I agree. However, on a perception level, it makes a huge difference. </p>

<p>The tilted cursor becomes similar to an athlete who's always on the start position, ready to take off towards anything you want to click on at any time.</p>

<p>It's a sensation that gives you so much comfort without you realizing why.</p>

<p>Semiotics, Cognitive Science and Psychology are all embedded into the simple and subtle decision of keeping the tilted cursor, just to simplify by a bit your experience.</p>

<p>Why was it tilted in the first place? Well, in its history, it seems like it was only an accident determined by some technical limitations:</p>

<p>The angle, the cursor is inclined at gives a better feeling of pointing something. A cursor straight at 90 degree would not provide a good effect.It provides  improved appearance on low resolution screens.</p>

<p>Also the position calculation would become a lot easier when done from the top left corner of the pixel.</p>

<p>Well, the cursor is a pointer, and mimics pointer angles from real life (~30-45° to the vertical).</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J8xzk.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J8xzk.png" alt="Pointers in the real-world"></a></p>
<p>Importantly, that angle serves to <strong>guide the eye down the length of the pointer</strong>, in the direction going "into" the screen, <strong>towards a single point</strong>, in the same way as perspective drawings do:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mKdC5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mKdC5.png" alt="Perspective drawing"></a></p>
<p>On the contrary, a straight arrow seems to point in the general up-direction, targeting no one point in particular. Have you ever used, or seen someone use, a pointer stick vertically upwards? That is indeed awkward, and reserved for moments where the object being pointed to is high up and well beyond the height of the person and the length of the stick combined, and can be vague in conveying what is actually being pointed at.</p>

<p>The strangest thing about the Vision Pro is also the thing that makes it most uniquely Apple: it’s got a big shiny bubble glass front, which makes it stand out from the aluminum- and plastic-shrouded competition, even when it’s off. And when it’s on, it’s even stranger—instead of being fully transparent, behind the glass, an odd lenticular screen displays a 3D-ish video of the user’s eyes, emulating their gaze. Apple calls it the EyeSight display, and when the user is looking at you, it kind of, sort of, almost looks like you can see through smokey glass.</p>



<p>Tech journalists have called EyeSight “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-vision-pro-eyesight-feature-fans-reaction-2024-1">bizarre</a>,” “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">uncanny</a>,” and “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro">of highly dubious utility</a>.” But from a repair perspective, it seems like an achilles heel. Why introduce another screen, more connectors, and <em>so many </em>more points of failure—all for the sake of a slightly creepy feature? Of course, we had to dig in and figure out how it works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We knew it would be tough to get inside (it was). We hoped we wouldn’t break anything (we did). But we knew it would be worth it to see all the new technology Apple squeezed into this thing, from the EyeSight display to the sensor array, the external battery back to the R1 chip. We brought in the heavy hitters for this teardown, including x-ray views of the frame and high-resolution microscope shots of the displays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve got a lot of observations, some opinions, and a couple educated guesses about <em>why</em> we got the Vision Pro we have today on the teardown table. There is a lot in this device, so we’re splitting our analysis into two, with more detail on the lens system and silicon coming in a few days.</p>



<p>Let’s go spelunking into a never-before-explored cave of glass.</p>

<p>The glass panel is glued on, of course, and it took a <em>lot</em> of heat and time, but we removed it without breakage. Granted it didn’t come out unscathed—the glass has a protective plastic film that got a little peeled up and maybe a bit melted. Apple’s retail fixers <em>might</em> have faster hands than us—but they’ll <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair">charge you $799</a> to replace broken front glass.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pSsMhfg7AtK_QktOMHv41PAHvhhDs7kS"><strong></strong></a><strong>Heavy Metal</strong></h3>



<p>At 34 grams, the glass may not be heavy on its own, but fully kitted out with the battery the Vision Pro weighs over a kilogram.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s where Apple has a performed a bit of a sleight of hand. Carefully hidden in most publicity shots is the external battery, which rides along in your pocket rather than on your headset. As in the early days of VR, integrating the battery as it is now would make the device crazy heavy.&nbsp;And hey, we’re big fans of modular batteries, when the battery inevitably stops holding a charge in <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-801b-how-to-define-battery-life">a year or three</a>, you can replace it painlessly. Apple’s hardware team may also be anticipating the <a href="https://repair.eu/news/big-win-for-right-to-repair-with-new-eu-rules-for-batteries-but-legislators-must-get-the-implementation-right/">upcoming EU battery regulation</a>, which will require all electronics to have user-replaceable batteries by 2027. </p>

<p>The battery pack alone weighs 353 grams and is made of three iPhone-sized batteries, delivering a grand total of 35.9 Wh, more than double an iPhone 15 Pro’s 17.3 Wh. The cells themselves are 184 g apiece, surprisingly only about half the weight of the full battery pack. To get inside, we had to soften some perimeter adhesive and release a set of single-use metal clips—then twist open Torx screws galore.<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pSsMhfg7AtK_QktOMHv41PAHvhhDs7kS"></a></p>

<p>Add the weight of the battery pack and the headset together and you get, as mentioned above, over a kilogram—which would be a really heavy pair of glasses. For comparison, the Quest Pro weighs 722 g and the Quest 3 clocks in at 515 g.</p>



<p>But weight isn’t just about how it tips the scales. It’s about balance. The weight of the Vision Pro largely rests on your face, all the tech is at the front and even the Pro Dual Loop Band can’t overcome it all without a counterbalance. <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2023/11/apple-invents-a-battery-mount-on-the-back-of-vision-pros-headband-to-help-counterbalance-the-weight-of-the-hmd-that-causes-n.html">Apple patented a design</a> for a rear-mounted battery pack, which might’ve helped balance out the heavy front—though it’s hard to imagine wanting to wear something 150% as heavy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if we’re just counting the weight on your face—the display module, sans battery, in the Meta Quest Pro is 522 grams. The same assembly in the Vision Pro is 532 grams, effectively the same. The key difference in these units is in the weight distribution, and a much heavier pocket battery in the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>First impressions, though, are pretty good. “The weight isn’t as bad as expected, although it’s definitely on my forehead/cheeks as opposed to my head which feels weird, like someone is pushing on my head to tilt it down,” says iFixit teardown veteran <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/524640/Sam+Goldheart">Sam Goldheart</a> from the teardown lab.</p>



<h3><strong>Headbands</strong></h3>



<p>The Vision Pro comes with both a 3D-knitted Solo Knit Band and a Dual Loop Band. These attach to the ends of the stems, just behind the speakers. The now-iconic Solo Knit Band is the one that seen in all the publicity shots, and it does look cool. It wraps around the back of your head, and you adjust the fit with a dial on the side, similar to how you might tighten a bike helmet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how does it feel? “The fabrics are sooo nice,” says Sam. There’s a very fine, cushy weave on the Solo Knit Band, and it is stretchy enough to accommodate a ponytail and still support the face unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The speakers are fixed onto the two rigid bands that join to the main headset. To release these, you use our old friend, the SIM-card removal tool. The holes are inside the temples of the main headset, and the removable bands have a row of electrical contacts, just like Lighting connectors, again. Easily removable parts? Only demands tools you’ve probably already got? We love to see it. This makes us hope that opening the headset might not be as daunting as we first assumed.<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pSsMhfg7AtK_QktOMHv41PAHvhhDs7kS"></a></p>



<p>This modular design is similar to the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Max+Teardown/139369">AirPods Max</a>, which we quite liked. Wearables are so easy to damage that it makes good sense to have easily swappable speaker modules. We tried to go further and pry the speaker out of the silicon frame, and instantly broke the molded cables inside. That’s all right, you’re not going to need to pry the speaker modules open. </p>

<p>The speakers themselves point back towards your ears. This is a pretty clear indication that you’re not meant to wear this anywhere noisy. You can wear your AirPods Pro if you prefer—and if you want lossless, low-latency audio, they’ll have to be the latest USB-C version.</p>



<p>On the left side is the proprietary battery cable connection, which snaps into place with a magnet and then twists to lock. We understand why Apple used a non-standard connector here, even if we don’t love it—at least it can’t be yanked out by a passing child, or when the cord inevitably catches on your chair. But the plug at the other end of the cable is unforgivable. Instead of terminating with a USB-C plug, it connects to the battery pack with what looks like a proprietary oversized Lightning connector, which you release using a paperclip or SIM-removal tool.</p>

<p>This connector means that you can’t just swap in the USB-C battery pack you already own. Lame.</p>

<h3><strong>Light Seals and Face Cushions</strong></h3>



<p>Every face is different, and Apple is selling<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/19ardw5/all_light_seal_sizes/">&nbsp;28 different light-seal parts</a> to cover all the different face sizes and shapes. Your seal size also changes if you need Zeiss lens inserts. That’s because the seals and cushions are also used to make sure you have the correct eye position relative to the stereo screens and eye sensors. This is why Apple is hand-packing every Vision Pro order—there’s just no “standard” setup. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-1200x800.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-324x216.jpg 324w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03091739/makeup-2-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Guess who was wearing makeup?</figcaption></figure>



<p>The seals attach to the main headset using magnets, which is Apple through-and-through—it’s either glued in place, or extremely easy to swap. This modularity is a brute force attempt to get an ideal fit on your face. It will be interesting to see if this is required long-term, or if future devices find a simpler way to accomplish this. For the time being, magnets are better than velcro because they can snap the seals into exact alignment. Think how MagSafe snatches the charger and lines it up perfectly over the iPhone’s inductive charging coil.</p>



<p>As for cleaning the seals, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213964">Apple recommends</a> water and unscented dish soap, which will help stop these sweat-soaking parts from getting too gross, and will be especially good for anyone wearing makeup. In her <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/vision-pro-review-24-hours-in-apples-mixed-reality-headset/05CD2E77-897D-49A9-A87E-9B8A93E3E45F">Wall Street Journal video</a> where she selflessly wore the headset for 24 hours, Joanna Stern said her makeup caked the inside of the seals. And our own Sam Goldheart had the exact same problem this morning.</p>



<p>Under the magnetic seals is a permanent seal, also wrapped in a knit fabric, but less likely to get smudged. It also happens to be the way into the interior of the headset. Removing it reveals another surprise: a thin stretchy sheet of plastic. Whether it’s to compensate for gaps in the knit, or to keep particulates out of the innner workings, we’re not to sure. But we are certain this bit looks <em>very</em> masked superhero.</p>

<h3><strong>EyeSight Display</strong></h3>



<p>The front-facing gogglebox is the defining feature of the Vision Pro, and, now that reviews are pouring in, one of its most controversial.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/51/03/12/4b7f034c90465c/US20240012601A1.pdf">patent for the EyeSight</a> describes three display modes: “internal focus,” “external engagement,” and “do not disturb.” The patent has pages and pages of images that might be displayed on the screen—all kinds of cartoon animal eyes, biometric analysis captured by other sensors, hearts when the user is talking to a loved one. The internal camera might read emotional states and project images based on those emotional states.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1906" height="766" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03085115/pasted-image-0-1.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03085115/pasted-image-0-1.jpeg 1906w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03085115/pasted-image-0-1-1536x617.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1906px) 100vw, 1906px"></figure>



<p>Cool thought. In practice, the EyeSight display is so dim and low-resolution that reviewers say it’s hard to see much on it. The WSJ’s Joanna Stern <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xI10SFgzQ8&amp;t=211">called it</a> “hard to see,” and Marques Brownlee (aka MKBHD)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtp6b76pMak&amp;t=1826"> said</a>, “You can barely see my eyes when I’m wearing the headset.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It turns out that when the EyeSight displays your eyes, it isn’t just displaying a single video feed of your eyes; it’s showing a <em>bunch</em> of videos of your eyes. Exploring inside the glass shell, we found three layers for the front-facing display: a widening layer, a lenticular layer, and the OLED display itself.</p>

<p>Apple wanted to achieve something very specific: an animated, 3D-looking face with eyes. They had to make very strategic design choices and compromises to accomplish this.</p>



<p>Human brains are very sensitive to faces and expressions, its why the uncanny valley is a thing, and part of that is depth sensing. Apple needed to create a believable 3D effect. One reason why 3D renderings don’t look truly 3D is because they lack a stereoscopic effect. For something to look 3D, we need to see subtly different images with each eye. The Vision Pro tackles this problem with lenticular lenses.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03035750/card-movement.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>A lenticular lens displays different images when viewed from different angles. You can use this effect to simulate movement with two frames of an action. Or, you can create a stereoscopic 3D effect with images of the same subject from different angles.</p>



<p>The Vision Pro has a lenticular layer on top of the exterior OLED panel. VisionOS renders multiple face images—call them A and B—slices them up, and displays A from one angle serving your left eye, and  B from another serving your right eye. This creates a 3D face via the stereoscopic effect. And those angles are tiny, and they are legion, it takes a fancy <a href="https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/">Evident Scientific microscope</a> to really see what we mean.</p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03035754/AVP_017.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1106" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03035754/AVP_017.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03035754/AVP_017.jpg 2000w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03035754/AVP_017-1536x849.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03035754/AVP_017-1627x900.jpg 1627w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></a><figcaption>The curved ridges of the lenticular lens layer.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03120833/EyeSight-no-filter.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1880" height="1040" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03120833/EyeSight-no-filter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03120833/EyeSight-no-filter.jpg 1880w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03120833/EyeSight-no-filter-1536x850.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03120833/EyeSight-no-filter-1627x900.jpg 1627w" sizes="(max-width: 1880px) 100vw, 1880px"></a><figcaption>Pixels bending and shining through the lenticular layer</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are compromises to this approach. The horizontal resolution is dramatically reduced, being divided between each of the multiple images. For example, if two images are displayed on a 2000 pixel wide display, each image only has 1000 horizontal pixels to work with. Even through we don’t know the resolution of the display, nor do we know the number of images being interwoven, the resolution is necessarily reduced. And that is a major reason why EyeSight eyes seem blurry.</p>



<p>In front of the lenticular layer is another plastic lens layer, with similarly lenticular ridges. This layer appears to stretch the projected face wide enough to fit the width of the Vision Pro. Removing this layer and booting the Pro showcases some very oddly pinched eyes.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03044324/dsc_7495.mov.00_00_27_13.still002_720.jpg" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/03103510/Display-Stack_sm.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Additionally the lens likely limits the effective viewing angle. Limiting the effect to directly in front of the Vision Pro limits artifacting you might see at extreme angles, sort of like a privacy filter. The downside is that you’re passing an already complex, blurry image through yet another layer of lens. This makes it even blurrier and darker.</p>

<p>The Vision Pro itself performs an <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/important-safety-information-c0c84db82a44/visionos">automatic interpupillary distance adjustment</a> when you first put it on, with motors adjusting the positioning of the lenses. For everything else there’s prescription lenses. </p>



<p>Apple Stores have a machine to determine approximate prescription glasses strength when you come in for a demo.  For users with eye conditions (like strabismus) that might interfere with eye tracking, the Vision Pro offers <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213965">alternative interaction controls</a> in the accessibility features. However, we have heard that lenses are not available for people who have astigmatism, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10045990/">40% of the population</a>. If you know anything more about that, leave it in the comments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prescription insert lenses themselves require “pairing” with the headset. The decision has already borne poor UI, John Gruber received an <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro">incorrect calibration code</a> with his review unit that made eye tracking perform poorly. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82867/iphone-15-teardown-reveals-software-lockdown">We hate parts pairing</a> on principle, and there’s got to be a way to enable calibration while still allowing third party lenses.</p>



<p>Oh, and Creative Electron was bored after one photo so they shot us a 360 spin. Sweet!</p>

<h3><strong>R1 and M2 Chips</strong></h3>



<p>The headset runs on an M2 Mac chip, in tandem with the new R1 chip—which is specifically responsible for processing the input from 12 cameras, the LiDAR sensor, and the TrueDepth camera, all with a minimum of latency. With AR, you need to project the camera view of the real world into the user’s eyes as fast as possible, otherwise their perceived motions won’t match up with what they see, which is a fast ticket to Vomitsville.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep up, the R1 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23733874/apple-vision-pro-visionos-augmented-reality-os-specs-wwdc-2023">uses</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system">real-time operating system</a>. That means that tasks are always executed in a fixed amount of time. Most of our computers run on a time-sharing operating system, which schedules tasks on the fly, and can result in slowdowns. Think about jittery mouse cursors, or spinning beach balls, and you’ve got the idea. That won’t fly with something as critical as pass-through video and object rendering. Any glitch there would be like a glitch in the Matrix, and would be jarring at best, and utterly nauseating at worst. It might even cause you to stumble and fall.</p>

<h3>An Incredible Feat, With One Really Weird Design Decision</h3>



<p>The original iPhone did something similar. When its underpowered chips couldn’t keep up with rendering a fast-scrolling page, it would <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2008/10/iphone_3g">switch to a gray-and-white checkerboard</a>, which kept up with all your flicks and swipes. Apple prioritized responsiveness over graphical fidelity. This time around, they have prioritized graphics fidelity <em>and</em> responsiveness, and taken the hit on battery life, weight, and heat. Given how important the experience is to Apple’s AR experience, this is probably the right choice for a first generation device.</p>



<p>The Vision Pro is insanely ambitious. Yes, it’s heavy, and the glass is fragile, and that tethered battery might get annoying. But Apple has managed to pack the power of a Mac, plus the performance of a new dedicated AR chip, into a computer that you can wear on your face.</p>



<p>Repairability-wise, it’s not great, but on the plus side, some of the connections are quite delightful. You should have seen our teardown team jump up when they realized that the side arms could be popped out using the SIM-removal tool, for example, and the magnetic cushions are yet more user-friendly.</p>



<p>So why, when this thing clearly took years and years to create—and is Apple’s latest bet on the future of computing—did Apple fail to live up to their own standards with the EyeSight screen? </p>



<p>It’s dim, it’s low-resolution, and it adds a lot of bulk, weight, complexity, and expense to the most weight-sensitive part of the headset. Did they finally hit the drop dead date and miss their targeted performance? Could it be a late-stage manufacturing error? Regardless, we’re sure bringing it to market was a difficult decision.</p>



<p>We’ve been disassembling VR headsets since the original <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Oculus_Rift">Oculus</a>, and they continue to surprise and delight. There is so much fascinating mechanical and optical design packed in here. Apple’s seamless integration of sensors for rock-solid location tracking is just phenomenal, and we’re eager to dive into how they did it.</p>



<p>We’re not done with our analysis: there’s lots more to investigate inside this device. Next time, we’ll dive into the internal displays, sensor arrays and we’ll award a repairability score. </p>



<p>What else are you excited to see? IPD calibration motors, cooling, specific chips or circuitry? Follow along on social media, or check back here in a few shakes, we’ve got plenty more coming.</p>

<p><em>TCC is a Tiny C Compiler for 64-bit RISC-V (and other platforms)…</em></p>
<p><em>Can we run TCC Compiler in a Web Browser?</em></p>
<p>Let’s do it! We’ll compile <a href="https://github.com/sellicott/tcc-riscv32"><strong>TCC (Tiny C Compiler)</strong></a> from C to WebAssembly with <a href="https://ziglang.org/"><strong>Zig Compiler</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we talk about the tricky bits of our <strong>TCC ported to WebAssembly</strong>…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We compiled <strong>TCC to WebAssembly</strong> with one tiny fix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we hit some <strong>Missing POSIX Functions</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So we built minimal <strong>File Input and Output</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hacked up a simple workaround for <strong>fprintf and friends</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And TCC produces a <strong>RISC-V Binary</strong> that runs OK</p>
<p>(After some fiddling and meddling in RISC-V Assembly)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why are we doing this?</em></p>
<p>Today we’re running <a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/tinyemu2"><strong>Apache NuttX RTOS</strong></a> inside a Web Browser, with WebAssembly + Emscripten + 64-bit RISC-V.</p>
<p>(<strong>Real-Time Operating System</strong> in a Web Browser on a General-Purpose Operating System!)</p>
<p>What if we could <strong>Build and Test NuttX Apps</strong> in the Web Browser…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We type a <strong>C Program</strong> into our Web Browser (pic below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile it into an <strong>ELF Executable</strong> with TCC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the ELF Executable to the <strong>NuttX Filesystem</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And <strong>NuttX Emulator</strong> runs our ELF Executable inside the Web Browser</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning NuttX becomes so cool! This is how we made it happen…</p>

<p><em>Zig Compiler compiles TCC without any code changes?</em></p>
<p>Inside TCC, we stubbed out the <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/commit/e30454a0eb9916f820d58a7c3e104eeda67988d8"><strong>setjmp / longjmp</strong></a> to make it compile with Zig Compiler.</p>
<p>Everything else compiles OK!</p>
<p><em>Is it really OK to stub them out?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp.h"><strong>setjmp / longjmp</strong></a> are called to <strong>Handle Errors</strong> during TCC Compilation. Assuming everything goes hunky dory, we won’t need them.</p>
<p>Later we’ll find a better way to express our outrage. (Instead of jumping around)</p>
<p>We probe the Magical Bits inside our Zig Wrapper…</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/images/tcc-posix.jpg" alt="TCC Compiler in WebAssembly needs POSIX Functions"></p>
<h2 id="posix-for-webassembly"><a href="#posix-for-webassembly">3 POSIX for WebAssembly</a></h2>
<p><em>What’s this POSIX?</em></p>
<p>TCC Compiler was created as a <strong>Command-Line App</strong>. So it calls the typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX"><strong>POSIX Functions</strong></a> like <strong>fopen, fprintf, strncpy, malloc,</strong> …</p>
<p>But WebAssembly running in a Web Browser ain’t <strong>No Command Line</strong>! (Pic above)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">(WebAssembly doesn’t have a <strong>C Standard Library libc</strong>)</a></p>
<p><em>Is POSIX a problem for WebAssembly?</em></p>
<p>We counted <a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/tcc#appendix-missing-functions"><strong>72 POSIX Functions</strong></a> needed by TCC Compiler, but missing from WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Thus we fill in the <a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/tcc#appendix-missing-functions"><strong>Missing Functions</strong></a> ourselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/tcc#appendix-missing-functions">(About the <strong>Missing POSIX Functions</strong>)</a></p>
<p><em>Surely other Zig Devs will have the same problem?</em></p>
<p>Thankfully we can borrow the POSIX Code from other <strong>Zig Libraries</strong>…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/marler8997/ziglibc"><strong>ziglibc</strong></a>: Zig implementation of libc</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><em>72 POSIX Functions? Sounds like a lot of work…</em></p>
<p>We might not need all 72 POSIX Functions. We stubbed out <strong>many of the functions</strong> to identify the ones that are called: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L776-L855">tcc-wasm.zig</a></p>

// Functions. If TCC calls them,

// implement them. The Types don't

  @panic("TODO: atoi");
}

  @panic("TODO: exit");
}
pub export fn fopen(_: c_int) c_int {
  @panic("TODO: fopen");
}

// And many more functions...

<p>Some of these functions are especially troubling for WebAssembly…</p>

<h2 id="file-input-and-output"><a href="#file-input-and-output">4 File Input and Output</a></h2>
<p><em>Why no #include in TCC for WebAssembly? And no C Libraries?</em></p>
<p>WebAssembly runs in a Secure Sandbox. <strong>No File Access</strong> allowed, sorry! (Like for Header and Library Files)</p>
<p>That’s why our Zig Wrapper <strong>Emulates File Access</strong> for the bare minimum 2 files…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the <strong>C Program</strong>: <strong><code>hello.c</code></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the <strong>RISC-V ELF</strong>: <strong><code>a.out</code></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading a Source File <code>hello.c</code></strong> is extremely simplistic: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L104-L118">tcc-wasm.zig</a></p>
<div><pre><code>/// Emulate the POSIX Function `read()`

  const len = read_buf.len;
  assert(len &lt; nbyte);
  @memcpy(buf[0..len], read_buf[0..len]);
  buf[len] = 0;

<p><a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L26-L32">(<strong>read_buf</strong> is populated at startup)</a></p>
<p><strong>Writing the Compiled Output <code>a.out</code></strong> is just as barebones: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L128-L140">tcc-wasm.zig</a></p>
<div><pre><code>/// Emulate the POSIX Function `write()`

<p><em>Can we handle Multiple Files?</em></p>
<p>Right now we’re trying to embed the simple <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm#rom-fs-filesystem-for-tcc-webassembly"><strong>ROM FS Filesystem</strong></a> into our Zig Wrapper.</p>
<p>The ROM FS Filesystem will be preloaded with the Header and Library Files needed by TCC.</p>

<p><img src="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/images/tcc-format.jpg" alt="Our Zig Wrapper uses Pattern Matching to match the C Formats and substitute the Zig Equivalent"></p>
<h2 id="fearsome-fprintf-and-friends"><a href="#fearsome-fprintf-and-friends">5 Fearsome fprintf and Friends</a></h2>
<p><em>Why is fprintf particularly problematic?</em></p>
<p>Here’s the fearsome thing about <strong>fprintf</strong> and friends: <strong>sprintf, snprintf, vsnprintf</strong>…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>C Format Strings</strong> are difficult to parse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variable Number of Untyped Arguments</strong> might create Bad Pointers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence we hacked up an implementation of <strong>String Formatting</strong> that’s safer, simpler and so-barebones-you-can-make-<em>soup-tulang</em>.</p>
<p><em>Soup tulang? Tell me more…</em></p>
<p>Our Zig Wrapper uses <a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/tcc#appendix-pattern-matching"><strong>Pattern Matching</strong></a> to match the <strong>C Formats</strong> and substitute the <strong>Zig Equivalent</strong> (pic above): <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L189-L207">tcc-wasm.zig</a></p>
<div><pre><code>// Format a Single `%d`
// like `#define __TINYC__ %d`
FormatPattern{

  // If the C Format String contains this...
  .c_spec = "%d",
  
  // Then we apply this Zig Format...
  .zig_spec = "{}",
  
  // And extract these Argument Types
  // from the Varargs...
  .type0 = c_int,
  .type1 = null
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This works OK (for now) because TCC Compiler only uses <strong>5 Patterns for C Format Strings</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L189-L207">tcc-wasm.zig</a></p>
<div><pre><code>/// Pattern Matching for C String Formatting:

    .type0  = c_int, .type1 = null
  },

  // Format a Single `%u`, like `L.%u`
  FormatPattern{ 
    .c_spec = "%u",  .zig_spec = "{}", 
    .type0  = c_int, .type1 = null 
  },

  // Format a Single `%s`, like `.rela%s`
  // Or `#define __BASE_FILE__ "%s"`
  FormatPattern{

    .type0  = [*:0]const u8, .type1 = [*:0]const u8
  },

  // Format `%s:%d`, like `%s:%d: `
  // (File Name and Line Number)
  FormatPattern{
    .c_spec = "%s:%d", .zig_spec = "{s}:{}",
    .type0  = [*:0]const u8, .type1 = c_int
  },
};

<p>That’s our quick hack for <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm/blob/main/zig/tcc-wasm.zig#L209-L447"><strong>fprintf and friends</strong></a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/tcc#appendix-pattern-matching">(How we do <strong>Pattern Matching</strong>)</a></p>
<p><em>So simple? Unbelievable!</em></p>
<p>Actually we’ll hit more Format Patterns as TCC Compiler emits various <strong>Error and Warning Messages</strong>. But it’s a good start!</p>
<p>Later our Zig Wrapper shall cautiously and meticulously parse all kinds of C Format Strings. Or we do the <a href="https://github.com/marler8997/ziglibc/blob/main/src/printf.c#L32-L191"><strong>parsing in C</strong></a>, compiled to WebAssembly. (160 lines of C!)</p>

<p>NuttX politely accepts the RISC-V ELF (produced by TCC). And says that <strong>printf</strong> is missing.</p>
<p>Which makes sense: We haven’t linked our C Program with the <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/tcc-riscv32-wasm#how-nuttx-build-links-a-nuttx-app"><strong>C Library</strong></a>!</p>

<p><em>How else can we print something in NuttX?</em></p>
<p>To print something, we can make a <a href="https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/app#nuttx-app-calls-nuttx-kernel"><strong>System Call (ECALL)</strong></a> directly to NuttX Kernel (bypassing the POSIX Functions)…</p>
<div><pre><code>// NuttX System Call that prints
// something. System Call Number
// is 61 (SYS_write). Works exactly
// like POSIX `write()`
ssize_t write(
  int fd,           // File Descriptor (1 for Standard Output)
  const char *buf,  // Buffer to be printed
  size_t buflen     // Buffer Length
);

// Which makes an ECALL with these Parameters...
// Register A0 is 61 (SYS_write)
// Register A1 is the File Descriptor (1 for Standard Output)
// Register A2 points to the String Buffer to be printed
// Register A3 is the Buffer Length

<p>That’s the same NuttX System Call that <strong>printf</strong> executes internally.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tps_slideContainer_15454">

<p>Nearly two decades ago, British anesthesiologist John Carlisle published an <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004125.pub3/information#versionTable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on preventing postoperative nausea in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Afterwards, however, Carlisle wasn’t celebrating his publication. Instead, he decided to look more closely at some of the papers included in his literature review. A staggering 68 of the 737 papers reviewed were written by a researcher named Yoshitaka Fujii.</p>



<p>“Peculiar patterns were evident in his papers,” Carlisle tells Analyst News. Rates of headaches or dizziness, for instance, were often precisely the same across groups of patients in Fujii’s clinical trials. “That makes one suspicious. If you see it in not just one paper but lots of papers, then something can’t be right.”</p>



<p>Statistically, Carlisle’s investigation showed, such results were near-impossible — and the data in Fujii’s trials was much more likely fabricated. Indeed, of the 68 papers that Fujii had authored and Carlisle had included, 63 were ultimately retracted from the journals in which they were published.</p>



<p>“We need to be looking out for poor science, whether it’s fabricated or whether it’s unintentionally false,” says Carlisle, a longtime editor for the journal <em>Anaesthesia </em>who has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed statistical techniques</a> to help identify problematic medical research. His methods have been adopted by at least two top medical journals — and have exposed scientific misconduct and errors in hundreds of papers that have been corrected or retracted.</p>



<p>Experts say a rampant culture of “publish or perish,” plus the rise of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00191-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-based writing tools</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/paging-dr-fraud-the-fake-publishers-that-are-ruining-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predatory science journals</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fake-scientific-papers-are-alarmingly-common" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper mills</a>, has tainted scientific publication. Per some estimates, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer than half</a> of research studies published each year are credible. Such misconduct wastes time and money, damages trust in science, and can even <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.362.6413.394-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endanger patients</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, more than 10,000 research papers were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03974-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retracted</a>, marking an all-time high. These retractions could have occurred for a number of reasons: The results in the paper may be considered inaccurate, the paper may have contained plagiarized work, or the authors may have conflicts of interest or used unethical research practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retractions themselves are a good sign, experts say, demonstrating that inaccurate or unethical research is being caught. But scientists worry the retracted articles are only a fraction of all the fraudulent work out there. And a small but growing number of researchers have devoted themselves to investigating and exposing this bad science.</p>



<h2>Meet the science sleuths</h2>



<p>Microbiologist Elisabeth Bik was a researcher at Stanford University when she stumbled across a few cases of unethical science. First her own work had been plagiarized by another scientist, and then she came across a paper reusing the same image to represent two separate experiments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade later, Bik is now a full-time “science integrity consultant,” sleuthing out fraudulent work in research papers. Her speciality: identifying falsified images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bik says one of the biggest sources of fraudulent research is paper mills, which she describes as “networks or cartels of people who make a profit selling fake or very low-quality papers to authors who need an authorship.” Per <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03464-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> <a href="https://publicationethics.org/node/55256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a>, about 2% of papers are produced by paper mills.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You just can’t work in a field like that. It’s like swimming in garbage. What you have to do is get out of the pool and start trying to clean it up.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These paper mills may plagiarize PhD theses found online or offer general templates for research articles, making modifications for customers. Some researchers even pay paper mills to help boost their citation index, which indicates how often their work has been cited by other scientists (generally, more established or well-reputed researchers have high citation indices). Paper mills can generate articles that contain multiple citations to a specific scientist’s work and thus serve as “vessels for citations,” Bik says.</p>



<p>Cancer biology professor Jennifer Byrne, the director of biobanking at New South Wales Health Pathology, began researching publication integrity and research fraud after becoming overwhelmed by the amount of bogus research in her field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel like I didn’t have any choice, because now in the field that I used to work, I would estimate that there are far more paper mill papers than general papers,” says Byrne, who now works with the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science (AIMOS), an international organization promoting trustworthy research practices.</p>



<p>The sheer volume of fraud was appalling, she says, with many repetitive papers and fatal errors.</p>



<p>“You just can’t work in a field like that. It’s like swimming in garbage. What you have to do is get out of the pool and start trying to clean it up.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why fraud flourishes</h2>



<p>In a community that values scientific reasoning and evidence, it may be hard to believe that paper mills and fraudulent research can thrive. But there are financial incentives at play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For journal editors and publishers, it’s economically advantageous to publish papers, so research is sometimes published without thorough screening. The false information in fraudulent papers can be nuanced or well-disguised, making it difficult for journals to quickly distinguish fraudulent papers from authentic ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts point to a clear incentivization of quantity, rather than quality, of research output — both with the publishing industry and academic institutions. Publishing articles is critical for success and distinction in scientists’ fields. Universities often require PhD candidates or faculty members to publish a certain number of papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many researchers, however, end up finding negative results —&nbsp;those that do not support their initial hypotheses. While such studies are crucial to the scientific literature, the “whole industry” of journals encourages scientists to publish positive results, Bik explains. Facing pressure to get published but with no compelling results of their own, researchers may turn to paper mills instead.</p>



<p>“The second problem is increasing commercialization of the publication enterprise, where more journals are owned by very, very large companies who are profit-driven,” says Byrne. “Paper mills … are poised to step in when all journals and publishers really care about is that bottom line. Because they will produce for money.”</p>



<p>Part of the problem also lies in the increasing popularity of open-access journals, which do not require readers to pay subscriptions. These open-access journals have helped democratize access to scientific knowledge, experts say, but some publishers are misusing this model and publishing nearly everything they are sent.</p>



<p>“Many open-access publishers publish on a ‘pay-per-paper’ model that drives a much more commercial mindset within publishing,” Bik tells Analyst News. The end result is that journals have compromised the quality of articles for the quantity that they can publish.</p>



<h2>‘A work in progress’</h2>



<p>Experts say systemic changes are needed to reduce the number of fraudulent papers.</p>



<p>Bik says that journals should move towards publishing more negative results — in fact, understanding negative results in one’s field is critical for researchers to design future experiments of their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Governments and regulators, too, can work to remove ads for paper mills across social media sites, she says. And open communication about better science research and research practices — such as through conferences like the ones AIMOS organizes — can enable scientists to together uphold ethical standards in their fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up until recently, it was largely individuals like Carlisle, Bik and Byrne detecting fraudulent research on their own. More recently, larger organizations are playing key roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analytics company Clarivate, for example, maintains a list of reputable journals in its Web of Science platform. Periodically, the list is reviewed, and journals that fail to adhere to Clarivate’s standards are removed. Back in March 2023, about 50 journals were <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fast-growing-open-access-journals-stripped-coveted-impact-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled</a> from the Web of Science, including well-known journals like the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>, which had published over 17,000 articles the year prior.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The reality is science is constructed by humans who are doing the best that they can. And it’s a work in progress.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Public trust in science has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-26/covid-public-health-mistakes-fueled-mistrust-in-scientists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eroded</a> in recent years with several high-profile missteps during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, experts emphasize the need for continuing to trust the scientific process, acknowledging the limitations of scientific publishing while understanding that the majority of scientists are honest and well-intentioned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her own work debunking scientific misconduct, Bik treads carefully to ensure her work doesn’t promote dangerous anti-science narratives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a double-edged sword because on one hand, I am worried about fraud in science,” she says. “On the other hand, I also think it’s a relatively small fraction, and I do not want to give the impression that all science is fraudulent. This is, I think, the danger of what I do.”</p>



<p>These scientists’ message to the public is to examine scientific information with a critical eye. Consumers of information in any field should strive to look for credible sources, cross-reference studies and consult experts.</p>



<p>The scientific method is a self-correcting system of inquiry that aims to uncover truths about the universe, experts remind. Overcoming the errors that are inevitably introduced to the scientific body of knowledge — whether from human error, bias or misconduct — demands skepticism and scrutiny from both researchers and the public.</p>



<p>“The world that we live in at the moment doesn’t have a lot of certainty — there are a lot of scary things happening,” Byrne says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That can lead people to look at science and think, ‘Oh, here’s some certainty at last.’ But the reality is science is constructed by humans who are doing the best that they can. And it’s a work in progress.”</p>

<p><span><span>It’s been a weird week </span>for America’s most valuable company—a firm whose tech products have such consumer goodwill they got away with </span><em><span>forcing us to listen to U2</span></em><span>—who is poised to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/"><span>go to court against its own government over its users’ right to privacy</span></a><span>. The government is invoking</span><span><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/writs-and-giggles">&nbsp;an obscure law</a>&nbsp;</span><span>dating back almost to the founding of the country to force the company to comply. It’d be a pretty good movie. </span></p>
<p><span>But it’s just the most dramatic flare-up in a lengthy battle between government officials, cybersecurity experts, and the tech industry over how consumer’s technical data is protected, and whether or not the government has a right to access that information. </span></p>
<p><span>In fact, the government has actually won this fight before—secretly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout 2015, U.S. politicians and law enforcement officials such as FBI director James Comey have publicly lobbied for the insertion of cryptographic “backdoors” into software and hardware to allow law enforcement agencies to bypass authentication and access a suspect’s data surreptitiously. Cybersecurity experts have unanimously condemned the idea, pointing out that such backdoors would fundamentally undermine encryption and could exploited by criminals, among other issues. While a legal mandate or public agreement would be needed to allow evidence obtained via backdoors to be admissible in court, the NSA has long attempted—and occasionally succeeded—in placing backdoors for covert activities.</span></p>

For years, rumors have persisted that the NSA (then SSA) and their British counterparts in the Government Communications Headquarters collaborated with the Enigma’s manufacturer, Crypto AG, to place </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080202225034/http://www.inteldaily.com/?c=169&amp;a=4686"><span>backdoors into Enigma machines provided to certain countries</span></a><span> after World War II. Crypto AG has repeatedly denied the allegations, and in 2015 the </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33676028"><span><em>BBC</em> sifted through 52,000 pages of declassified NSA documents</span></a><span> to find the truth. </span></p>
<p><span>The investigation revealed that while no backdoors were placed in the machines, there was a “gentlemen’s agreement” that Crypto AG would keep American and British intelligence appraised of “the technical specifications of different machines and which countries were buying which ones,” allowing analysts to decrypt messages much more quickly. Consider it a security “doggy-door.”</span></p>
<p><span>Next, in 1993, the NSA promoted “Clipper chips,” which were intended to protect private communications while still allowing law enforcement to access them. In 1994, researcher Matt Blaze </span><a href="http://www.crypto.com/papers/eesproto.pdf"><span>uncovered significant vulnerabilities in the “key escrow” system that allowed law enforcement access</span></a><span>, essentially making the chips useless. By 1996, </span><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/what-the-government-shouldve-learned-about-backdoors-from-the-clipper-chip/"><span>Clipper chips were defunct</span></a><span>, as the tech industry adopted more secure, open encryption standards such as </span><a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html"><span>PGP</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In more recent years, the NSA was unequivocally caught inserting a backdoor into the Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm, a cryptographic algorithm that was supposed to generate random bit keys for encrypting data. The algorithm, developed in the early aughts, was championed by the NSA and included in NIST Special Publication 800-90, the official standard for random-number generators released in 2007. Within a matter of months, researchers discovered the backdoor, and awareness that the algorithm was insecure quickly spread, although it continued to be implemented in consumer software </span><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/12/dual_ec_drbg_ad.html"><span>Windows Vista</span></a><span>. What was really odd, as crypto expert Bruce Schneier explained i</span><a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/11/securitymatters-1115/"><span>n a 2007 essay published in </span><em><span>Wired</span></em></a><span>, was that Dual_EC_DRBG wasn’t even worth the NSA’s effort:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>It makes no sense as a trap door: It’s public, and rather obvious. It makes no sense from an engineering perspective: It’s too slow for anyone to willingly use it. And it makes no sense from a backwards-compatibility perspective: Swapping one random-number generator for another is easy.</span></p>

<p><span>Although the NSA’s effort puzzled crypto experts, </span><a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/all/"><span>documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013</span></a><span> proved that the NSA did indeed build a backdoor into Dual_EC_DRBG and paid RSA, a computer security company, to include the compromised algorithm in its software.</span></p>
<p><span>These are the incidents that have been proven. There are, of course, numerous theories and insinuations that the NSA has made many more efforts along these lines—from </span><a href="http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/hacks/lotus-nsa-key.html"><span>backdoors in Lotus Notes</span></a><span> to </span><span><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2458706/microsoft-subnet/about-those-alleged-backdoors-in-microsoft-products.html">persistent</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000520001558/http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/backdoor.asp"><span>allegations</span></a><span> that Microsoft routinely includes backdoors in its software. Additionally, the Snowden leak </span><a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption"><span>proved that the NSA is constantly working to decrypt common encryption standards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>As our lives become more and more dominated by the digital, security experts have become </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/01/11/the-debate-over-government-backdoors-into-encryption-isnt-just-happening-in-the-u-s/"><span>increasingly vocal</span></a><span> in their calls for truly secure encryption, and some governments have begun to listen. </span><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/04/dutch_government_says_no_to_backdoors/"><span>Holland’s government</span></a><span> has agreed not to use backdoors and support open encryption standards, and despite calls to do so in response to the Paris terrorist attacks, </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/13/france-encryption/"><span>France refuses to implement a backdoor mandate</span></a><span>. Even former NSA director </span><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/02/19/hayden-apple-fbi/"><span>Michael Hayden has said that backdoors are a bad idea</span></a><span> (and he would know). As Apple vs. FBI wends its way through the courts, we are probably far from the end of this public battle. Whatever the results of this landmark case, the NSA’s classified efforts to subvert cryptography will likely continue.</span></p>

<p><strong>hint:</strong> <em>Apparently the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</em> does not actually say <em>that you can launch a conventional rocket into orbit around an arbitrarily large and massive body.</em></p>

<p>I'm looking for a number based on scaling the earth radius and maintaining the same average density. Must attain LEO, <em>which also gets faster</em> as the planet grows. Don Pettit's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html" rel="noreferrer">Tyranny</a> mentioned in <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/a/17426/12102">this nice answer</a> is fun, but does not present enough math.</p>

<p>On <em>this</em> Earth, rockets barely work. Payloads can only be a few percent of the total mass for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit" rel="noreferrer">LEO</a>, and less than one percent for deep space.</p>

<p>If we define slightly heavier Earths, say Earth<sub>1.1</sub>, Earth<sub>1.2</sub>... where the radii were 1.1, 1.2, etc. times that of Earth and the masses were 1.1<sup>3</sup>, 1.2<sup>3</sup>, etc. times the Earth's mass (in other words same average density, same "iron/rock ratio") what happens? Is there some point where chemical rockets simply will no longer be able to put things in space, or does the payload mass simply become ridiculously tiny? If there is a cut-off, is it different for LEO and deep space?</p>

<p>For our purposes, let's not explore alternative or hybrid launch systems or boost systems (such as balloons, planes, laser beams, space elevators etc.). Just stick to chemical propellant rockets.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> here is a guide. So for a scaling factor <span>$f$</span>:</p>

<p><span>$$
r = f r_{earth}
$$</span>
<span>$$
m = f^3 m_{earth}
$$</span>
<span>$$
g = G \frac{m}{r^2} = \frac{f^3}{f^2}g_{earth} = f g_{earth}
$$</span>
<span>$$
H = \frac{kT}{gm_{molecule}} = f^{-1}H_{earth}
$$</span></p>

<p>We catch a little break here. Assuming same surface atmosphere composition, temperature and pressure (STP), the <a href="http://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/astrob/7Page15.pdf" rel="noreferrer">scale height</a> H actually <em>decreases</em> with increasing <span>$f$</span>. (If we were "world builders" we should probably increase pressure to get more oxygen needed for moving in the higher gravity, but that's <a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/">a different Stack Exchange</a>.)</p>

<p>As far as LEO <strong>altitude</strong> is concerned (thanks @Lex for <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/14383/how-much-bigger-could-earth-be-before-rockets-wouldt-work?noredirect=1#comment73460_14383">catching</a> that) one might define it as the same number of scale heights as would be on Earth. That's not really so useful because the density profiles of the bits of the atmosphere responsible for drag (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere" rel="noreferrer">Thermosphere</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere" rel="noreferrer">Exosphere</a> are affected by many phenomenon, including the solar wind, and don't scale at all like the lower layers. Nonetheless for historical reasons I'll leave the following, as it is not essential to the question:</p>

<p><span>$$
h_{LEO} = h_{LEOearth} \frac{H}{H_{earth}} = f^{-1} h_{LEOearth}
$$</span>
<span>$$
v_{LEO}=fv_{LEOearth}
$$</span></p>

<p>The LEO period is independent of the size of a planet, if the average density is fixed. However, the velocity of LEO <em>does</em> scale with radius!</p>

<p>Because linear increases in delta-v require exponential increases in mass, small changes to the assumptions you make about fuel tank structural mass and engine thrust-to-weight ratio start to make very large changes in the final size of the rocket.</p>

<p>For example, if you're getting off a 3.6g planet with a 7-stage rocket, the difference between 88% fuel fraction and 92% fuel fraction yields about a 10:1 difference in the total mass of the rocket.</p>

<p>So I don't think it's really reasonable to talk about ultimate theoretical limits; too many engineering factors are involved.</p>

<p>Locking down a lot of variables, I can tell you what kind of rocket you'd need for a given surface g, though. Let's make these assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are placing 1 ton of payload into low planetary orbit.</li>
<li>Required delta-v to reach orbit, including atmospheric and gravity losses, is 10,000m/s per surface g. Seems to hold for Earth, Mars, and the "Earthtoo" which was discussed <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/17457/can-planet-earthtoo-put-a-tooian-in-orbit-too/17459#17459">in another Q/A</a>. </li>
<li>We can build rocket stages of arbitrary size, with a tankage propellant fraction of 90%; the rocket stage mass is the tank mass plus the engine mass -- ullage rockets, interstage, etc. is all handwaved out.</li>
<li>We have an infinite supply of Apollo-era rocket engines: RL-10, J-2, M-1, H-1, and F-1.</li>
<li>First-stage TWR at ignition must be at least 1.2 (relative to local gravity)</li>
<li>Middle-stage TWR at ignition must be at least 0.8</li>
<li>Final-stage TWR at ignition must be at least 0.5</li>
</ul>

<p>Given those assumptions, here is a table of surface gravity, stage count, first-stage engines, and total rocket mass.</p>

<pre><code>Surface                         First        Total       Saturn V

<p>Up above 10g, something really interesting happens that is kind of a theoretical limit. The mass of the rocket reaches <em>a measurable fraction of the mass of the entire planet</em> it's launching from.</p>

<p>At 10.3g, rocket mass is 0.035 of the mass of the planet.
10.4g, rocket mass is one fifth of the mass of the planet. This doesn't actually alter the ∆v requirement -- we're going into orbit around the rocket/planet barycenter!
At 10.47g, the rocket <em>is</em> the planet, and we're... just... chewing it up entirely, pulverizing it in a dust cloud expanding at 4km/s.</p>

<p>These extreme conclusions appear to be corroborated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11384.pdf" rel="noreferrer">this independently derived paper</a>, which explores some other related aspects of super-Earth-based chemical rockets. </p>

<p>Another consideration recently brought up by user @uhoh is that as the linear scale of a given rocket stage increases, its mass, and thus the required thrust force to lift it, goes up by the cube of the scale, but the area available at the base of the rocket to mount engines goes up only by the square of the scale; this problem is made even worse here by the increasing surface gravity. The Saturn V was just about at the point where this relation starts to become problematic; the outboard engines on its first stage are mounted at the very edge of the stage in order to make room for their nozzles to gimbal. </p>

<p>Solid rockets don't have the same dimensional constraints, and have very good thrust-to-weight and thrust-to-cost ratios, so they're probably more likely to be used in lower stages for these very large rockets.</p>

<p>Stages much larger than the Saturn V first stage would need to address this with some combination of being shorter and squatter, or compromising engine gimbal range, or mounting engines in pods surrounding the tankage, and there might be fairly hard engineering limits at some point for those reasons. At the 3g mark, for example, the 274 first-stage engines would require a stage about 90 meters in diameter and 9 meters tall, at which point the engineering inefficiencies associated with the fuel tank proportions will be becoming serious.   </p>

<p>First, let us look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rocket equation</a>:</p>
<p><span>$$\Delta v=\ln \left(\frac{m_0}{m_f}\right)v_e$$</span></p>
<p>That tells how much a rocket can change its velocity (the <span>$\Delta v$</span>). The requirements for reaching a higher velocity for a minimal orbit would increase on your heavier Earth. (For constant density it is proportional to the radius.)</p>
<p>How can we increase the <span>$\Delta v$</span> of the rocket to keep up? We can increase the exhaust velocity, <span>$v_e$</span>, of the engine, but that cut-off is around 5000 m/s for chemical engines. The other thing we could do is increasing the mass ratio of the rocket <span>$\left(\frac{m_0}{m_f}\right)$</span>. That is problematic too, as we can not really make the fuel tanks out of soap bubbles. Staging is the option left, you could place a big rocket under a small rocket to get a little more change in velocity. Then you are getting a linear benefit for an exponential expense.</p>
<p>As an example, the Saturn V rocket got into LEO (~9000 m/s), sent a payload towards the Moon (3120 m/s), the service module slowed the stack into LMO (820 m/s), and finally the LM landed and took off again (2*1720 m/s). There are still some unused fuel left in the service module then, so let us just call the total <span>$\Delta v$</span> of the Saturn V/Apollo 17 km/s. That is less than the requirements for a 2x radius Earth. The Apollo program was pretty expensive [citation needed], so it may take a while before a nation of a 2x Earth world attempts to go into orbit. The limit is, as you state, the ridiculously low payload ratio.</p>
<p>Another consideration is the increased surface gravity. (That scales linearly with diameter at constant density). That requires the rocket to have a higher thrust to weight ratio, and that will increase the dry mass, reducing the possible <span>$\Delta v$</span>. (It also increases gravity losses, but that is mostly compensated by the lower scale height of the planet, reducing drag losses).</p>
<p>Eventually, the gravity is so high that even the most powerful engine can not lift itself from the ground. That at least is a definitive limit.</p>
<p><strong>A more theoretical consideration, is <span>$\Delta v$</span> requirements actually a finite limit?</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, it is not. Remember what I said about staging earlier: "you are getting a linear benefit for an exponential expense". But there is not limit to what we can expend! Consider the following scenario: We add more and more stages at the bottom of the rocket, each of them has the same mass as all the stages on top of it. Then burning each of them gives the same mass ratio between before and after, therefore each of them are supplying
the same amount of <span>$\Delta v$</span>. To add 10 times that amount, you need 10 stages each doubling the mass. To add 100 times that amount, you need to double a hundred times. The mass grows ridiculously fast, even doubling 10 times are over a thousand times more. But why should we stop :)</p>
<p><strong>But can we <em>really</em> continue to add exponentially larger stages for ever?</strong></p>
<p>After a while, other problems show up. For instance: Rockets are long and thin, to minimize drag. That shape can not be kept for very large rockets. The reason not is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law" rel="nofollow noreferrer">square cube law</a>. Conserving the same dimensional proportions, a rocket twice the height has 8 times more mass. But the base area of the rocket has only increased 4 times. That means that each unit of area has to support more mass. Sooner or later, even the strongest materials must give up, and you must give up the traditional rocket shape in favour of a wider base. That adds a lot to the drag! Problems like that are going to continue to show up:</p>
<p>"More mass means more problems, exponentially more mass means exponentially more problems."</p>
<p><strong>Summarized:</strong></p>
<p>A modern design, larger rocket than the Saturn V, with modifications to increase the T/W ratio could probably make it to orbit on a 2x radius, 8x mass Earth. That is a feasibility limit, rockets that are ridiculously much larger may have a few km/s extra <span>$\Delta v$</span>, but that does not alter the numbers a lot. In theory though, rockets can grow until the drag stops them, or the engines can no longer lift even themselves.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you at some point want to use the available resources of the planet to launch a single rocket to orbit.</p>

<p><strong>note:</strong> I've accepted an answer 2.5 years ago. This paper was published recently so I thought I would add this <em>supplemental answer</em> since it may be an interesting reference for future readers.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Space.com article <a href="https://www.space.com/40375-super-earth-exoplanets-hard-aliens-launch.html" rel="noreferrer">No Way Out? Aliens on 'Super-Earth' Planets May Be Trapped by Gravity</a> links to Michael Hippke's ArXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04727" rel="noreferrer">Spaceflight from Super-Earths is difficult</a>.</p>

<p>While the calculation is based on escape velocity rather than LSEO (Low Super-Earth Orbit) the conclusion is similar, the problem is exponential and it gets really difficult quickly.</p>

<p>The author uses the example of the planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-20b" rel="noreferrer">Keppler-20b</a> (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06836" rel="noreferrer">here</a>), and although there is some uncertainty, the planet's size is roughly 1.9 that of earth, and it's mass is almost 10 times that of Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a mass ratio of 83, the minimum rocket (1 t to <span>$v_{esc}$</span>) would carry 9,000 t of fuel on Kepler-20b, which is 3× larger than a Saturn V (which lifted 45 t). To
  lift a more useful payload of 6.2 t as required for the James Webb Space Telescope on Kepler-20 b, the fuel mass would increase to 55,000 t, about the mass of the largest ocean battleships. <strong>For a classical Apollo moon mission (45 t), the rocket would need to be considerably larger, ∼ 400,000 t. This is of order the mass of the Pyramid of Cheops, and is probably a realistic limit for chemical rockets regarding cost constraints.</strong> (emphasis added)</p>

<p>Not a planetological exposition in sight so, I'll add my two cents to this rather theoretical discussion.</p>
<p>Amongst exoplanetologists, the consensus has emerged that 1.6 Earth radii and 5 Earth masses is likely <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4457" rel="nofollow noreferrer">to be the upper limit to rocky planets</a>. Simulations have shown that above these figures, the bodies develop <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Neptune" rel="nofollow noreferrer">increasingly Mini-Neptune</a> like characteristics. This means very thick Helium Hydrogen atmospheres and crushing surface pressure.</p>
<p>Also since <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04727" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Michael Hippke's slightly whimsical paper</a> was referenced in one of the answers it seems appropriate to mention Ocean worlds at Super Earth masses. Ocean worlds present a host of habitability hurdles including a paucity of certain life critical elements like phosphorus, lack of volcanism, no water rock interface due to high pressure ice on the marine floor and others. These conditions will likely limit or even prevent the establishment of the vibrant prebiotic chemical environments that are necessary for biogenesis.</p>
<p>If the first assumption holds true, the highest gravity on a potentially  habitable world will not exceed approximately 2.5g.(edit: and thus making it not quite so difficult to reach orbit with chemical rockets as would have been the case with a higher g value)</p>

<p>Great answers have been given, but one of the major themes is they assume a fixed wet to dry mass ratio of 10:1 (ish). The justification is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to fix this as: there are no meaningful answers with without <em>a</em> value and, <em>which</em> value is subject to engineering nuances, which are difficult to handle.</p></li>
<li><p>10:1 is a good pick. (We can't do much better than this and still have everything work so it seems sensible to stick at this)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that's the limit of what we can make work <em>on earth</em>. A lot of the dry mass of a rocket is either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>directly related to the thrust-to-mass ratio (i.e. number/size of engines)</p></li>
<li><p>indirectly related to TMR (i.e. supports the structural loads)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note, to keep gravity loses equivalent in practice the accelerations needed, hence TMR, is linear with the surface gravity. Hence so is a part of the the wet/dry mass ratio.</p>

<p>Once we take that into consideration things look a lot bleaker for the high g super-earths getting something into orbit using chemical rockets.</p>

<p>The actual numbers here are a little difficult to know, but if 5g world leads to a rocket with a w/d mass ratio of 5 to 1 (which I think is about right but...), you're staring down the barrel of a <span>$10^{20}$</span>t type figure for launch mass. To put that into perspective, the 'moon rocket' is no longer a good comparison. That's the mass of the moon it got to.</p>

<p>Theoretical limit? <strong>I'd say so</strong>.</p>

<p>At that mass things start taking a turn for the 'XKCD'. Forget the practical issues they're clearly long gone at "moon-sized-anything". We hit cold hard theoretical limits.
<strong>You start having to deal with your own gravity</strong>.</p>

<p>Firstly those practical issues are big ones even if we laugh a little 'engineering' problems (like money, and where we might find <span>$10^{19}$</span>t of aerospace grade materials). For example that's the sort of size that when you're made out something solid and are already floating in space under 0G, you deforming under you own gravity into a ball. Trying to make that out of mostly liquid fuel and subject it to 5-10g..., you're not staying the shape you started. Doesn't matter what mass-ratio 'hit' you are willing to take. But we've got this far, we aren't going to let a lack of unobtainium stop us.</p>

<p>No the <em>real</em> hard limit is how being so heavy effects your exhaust velocity. At the risk of getting too meta here if you're heavy enough, its difficult to get things to come apart from you. It applies to planet sized rockets as much as it does planets.</p>

<p>If you're a few million kilos, your 'exhaust velocity' is the velocity you can get your propellant to get to. If you have more mass than the moon, your propellant will have lost a lot of momentum by the time it's left your gravitational influence. And this is the fate our rocket meets.
LOX/H2 has an exhaust velocity of about <span>$4,400ms^{-1}$</span>, about as good as we can do.  Let's just say our moon-sized rocket has the density of the moon too, and so has a similar escape velocity of <span>$2,380ms^{-1}$</span>. Then the useful exhaust velocity of our rocket (initial less escape) is less than half. hence half the delta-v. You won't be going to space to day.</p>

<p>"Ok", I hear you say, "that just mean's you can't go to space in <em>that</em> rocket.", "How about a <strong>bigger</strong> one?". Well "No". This is another one of those "Even if everything sort of worked as before, you want go twice as fast, which is going to be a <em>lot</em> more mass." type problems. Except now we really can't just take the "make in 10 orders of magnitude bigger" approach. Apart from the fact that our rocket is now lot bigger than the planet which means we couldn't possibly construct it, now we have no chance of using chemical rockets to propel us anywhere.
To gain any momentum we need to chuck something out of our gravity well, and the exhaust velocity of chemical rockets don't make when we are this big.
We are now <em>truly</em> stuck.</p>

<p>But wait: directly the exhaust doesn't make it out, but I wonder if you could try different way of getting mass out of a very deep gravity well. Shouldn't be too hard. Even if it was only a little bit, we could always just scale it up...</p>

<p>On a practical engineering side of things.  Ultimately you are limited by exhaust velocity.  In theory you can always just make a bigger engine, bigger tanks, etc.  Ridiculously expensive, but possible.  This would seem to set the real limit to material strength.  Material strength is likely to give out before the gravity wells pull exceeds the exhaust velocity of even moderately modern fuels. </p>

<p>For example, LF+LOX typically has an exhaust velocity of around 4,400 m/s.  Which will fight up to 448 G of gravity.  Literally more than the sun.  Practically however much less than that.  So size of the planet itself presents no real deal killers, it just makes  the payloads mass fraction very VERY low.</p>

<p>At some point though other technologies, like nuclear bomb drives (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)</a>), become the only feasible affordable way off the planet. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Low-Power Wi-Fi Extends Signals Up to 3 Kilometers" data-elid="2667126316" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/wi-fi-halow" data-authors="Edd Gent" data-page-title="Low-Power Wi-Fi Extends Signals Up to 3 Kilometers - IEEE Spectrum"><p> Most people have probably experienced the frustration of weak Wi-Fi signals. Even getting a network to cover every corner of a fairly modest house can be a challenge. That’s not a problem for Wi-Fi technology developed by the Australian startup <a href="https://www.morsemicro.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Morse Micro</a>, which just demonstrated a Wi-Fi signal with a 3-kilometer range.<strong></strong></p><p> Morse Micro has developed a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/system-on-chip" target="_blank">system-on-chip</a> (SoC) design that uses a wireless protocol called <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-certified-halow" target="_blank">Wi-Fi HaLow</a>, based on the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7920364" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE 802.11ah standard</a>. The protocol significantly boosts range by using lower-frequency radio signals that propagate further than conventional Wi-Fi frequencies. It is also low power, and is geared toward providing connectivity for <a data-linked-post="2659970239" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/iot-for-arson-forensics" target="_blank">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) applications.</p><p> To demonstrate the technology’s potential, Morse Micro recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xlUijXucoM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducted a test</a> on the seafront in San Francisco’s Ocean Beach neighborhood. They showed that two tablets connected over a HaLow network could communicate at distances of up to 3 km while maintaining speeds around 1 megabit per second—enough to support a slightly grainy video call.</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="8cf36374a19b908e5344979ec4cf4af5"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xlUijXucoM?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Wi-Fi HaLow Shatters Limits with a 3-Kilometer Range</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">
            
    Morse/Micro/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xlUijXucoM" target="_blank">youtube</a></small></p><p> “It is pretty unprecedented range,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakashguda/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prakash Guda</a>, vice president of marketing and product management at Morse Micro. “And it’s not just the ability to send pings but actual megabits of data.”</p><p> The HaLow protocol works in much the same way as conventional Wi-Fi, says Guda, apart from the fact that it operates in the 900-megahertz frequency band rather than the 2.4-gigahertz band. Lower-frequency signals are able to propagate further and are better at penetrating solid objects, which is the secret to HaLow’s much longer ranges.</p><p> The protocol also allows channel bandwidths as narrow as 1 MHz, compared with the 20-MHz channels that are standard in Wi-Fi. Guda says this makes it possible to have many more dedicated channels that don’t interfere with one another, which is useful for IoT applications where you want to connect several devices to the same network.</p><p> The trade-off is lower throughput, says Guda, but as their test shows, HaLow can still support data-intensive applications like video. The technology is also much lower power than conventional Wi-Fi, as it has in-built features that allow devices to remain dormant for long periods and wake only when they need to transmit data. This makes it feasible to power HaLow devices using batteries. Guda says Morse Micro is working with partners building battery-powered IoT devices that will need to operate for years, and in those cases, HaLow won’t run the battery down too soon.<strong></strong></p><p>But IoT connectivity is a crowded space, says <a href="https://www.ictp.it/member/ermanno-pietrosemoli" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ermanno Pietrosemoli</a>, a scientific consultant at the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy, who specializes in wireless networks. “[HaLow] is a viable competitor, but there are many players in this field,” he says.</p><p> The technology has a considerable range advantage over IoT-specific alternatives like <a data-linked-post="2650250203" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/busy-as-a-zigbee" target="_blank">ZigBee</a> or <a data-linked-post="2650280437" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/apptricity-beams-bluetooth-signals-over-20-miles" target="_blank">Bluetooth</a>. And while the <a data-linked-post="2650278012" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/loras-bid-to-rule-the-internet-of-things" target="_blank">LoRa standard</a> is capable of distances of tens of kilometers, its throughput is too low to enable video or even real-time voice, says Pietrosemoli. HaLow’s high data rates could be useful for more data-heavy applications, like wirelessly connecting lots of security cameras, he adds.</p><p> Despite the HaLow<strong></strong>standard being ratified in 2017, the technology has very low adoption, says Pietrosemoli, which might give developers pause due to concerns around whether the technology will continue to be supported. In contrast, competing technologies like <a data-linked-post="2650277753" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/stopping-a-wildfire-with-a-lowcost-sensor-network" target="_blank">SigFox</a>, which operates on principles similar to those of HaLow, and <a data-linked-post="2650276476" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/italy-launches-a-new-wireless-network-for-the-internet-of-things" target="_blank">Narrowband IoT</a> (NB-IoT)—a low-power cellular technology—are already widely deployed.</p><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/61747" target="_blank">Bill Ray</a>, a VP analyst at Gartner, is even more circumspect. While Morse Micro has built some impressive technology, he says HaLow has failed to gain any significant traction in the industry. The fact that Qualcomm, which was an early booster of the technology, has lost interest is indicative, he adds.</p><p> “We are not optimistic about the standard, even if it can be stretched to 3 km,” says Ray. “Bluetooth offers greater interoperability, while LoRa offers greater range, putting HaLow in a middle position with limited application.”</p><p>“It is pretty unprecedented range. And it’s not just the ability to send pings but actual megabits of data.” <strong>—Prakash Guda, Morse Micro</strong></p><p> Guda puts a different spin on it. By combining high data rates and long ranges, he says, the technology can serve the whole gamut of IoT applications. “It’s the best of both worlds,” he says.</p><p> He acknowledges the lack of adoption does raise concerns about interoperability and overreliance on a single vendor, but he says things are changing. California-based <a href="https://newracom.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Newracom</a> now also produces a HaLow SoC, and in 2021 the Wi-Fi Alliance <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-certified-halow-delivers-long-range-low-power-wi-fi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched a certification program</a> for the standard that Guda says will improve interoperability.</p><p> “If you’re trying to make some equipment based on a new technology, you want to make sure that there’s interoperability and there’s more than one supplier,” he says. “That’s the critical mass that we have now.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
Almost five years ago I wrote <a href="https://two-wrongs.com/dotnet-on-non-windows-platforms-brief-historic-summary.html">a brief history about <abbr>.net</abbr> on non-Windows
platforms</a>. I stumbled over that article now and it resurfaced traumatic
memories of navigating <abbr>.net</abbr> development on Linux and MacOS.
</p>

<p>
Even back in 2019, it was mostly fine to <i>run</i> <abbr>.net</abbr> code on Linux (in
production) but the documentation and tooling for development was not there at
all.<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> I got into <abbr>.net</abbr> development when my then-new employer was in the
middle of transitioning from <abbr>.net</abbr> Framework to <abbr>.net</abbr> Core, so my non-Windows
work computer ended up being a lab rat for all sorts of unexpected compatibility
problems. I still don’t fully understand why I thought it was a good idea to try
to port applications I wasn’t even able to <i>compile</i> – much less run – to the
new framework, but it worked out fine in the end. (It was not just that these
applications used the <abbr>fcl</abbr>, they also integrated with Windows functionality.)</span>
</p>

<p>
That experience was, and the article was written, when <abbr>.net</abbr> Core 2.1 was the
latest production-friendly release. In some sense, it was just yesterday, but in
another, it’s a world away. Even just two or three years later, the tooling and
documentation had improved to levels I didn’t anticipate. Today, I still write
<abbr>.net</abbr> code (for a different employer) and I can barely tell whether I’m on
Windows or Linux.
</p>

<p>
It speaks to how much an organisation with a big wallet and willingness to
invest can shift things in a brief amount of time – but also, I think, how other
companies (I’m looking at you, JetBrains) can set a standard for cross-platform
tooling that the original company is forced to live up to in order not to lose
too much market share.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dansalva.to/apple-vision-pro-and-adhd/">https://dansalva.to/apple-vision-pro-and-adhd/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39242662">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Apple Vision Pro reminds me that computers have become too efficient.</p>
<p>I'm currently typing this blog post in a floating window in the middle of
snow-covered Yosemite. I am a floating body manifested into the transcendental
Tim Cook matrix. I look into the sky and follow the soft clouds as they pass
overhead. They slowly part, revealing Steve Jobs' smiling face watching over me
from the heavens above. I am merely one more thing.</p>
<p>When I walked into the Apple Store yesterday, the first question I had for the
assistant was the return policy on Apple Vision Pro. I have about 13 days left
to decide if this thing is worth $3,500. My early conclusion is that if you're
an enthusiast for entertainment and you have a lot of money to spend on it, the
Apple Vision Pro might be for you. Even the folks at the Apple Store seemed
convinced that "entertainment" is the current selling point of this device.</p>
<p>I don't fall into that category, so I'm currently trying to figure out what the
hell to use it for.</p>
<p>I tried watching a YouTube video placed over my countertop while making coffee.
The display quality is stunning, but the video pass-through is starkly
disappointing—granted, it's probably the best there is, but the world around me
appears grainy and poorly-lit. On top of that, I'm definitely a bit clumsier
with my hands.</p>
<p>iPad apps also feel clumsy. In visionOS, buttons highlight as your eyes pass
over them, indicating they're selected. This does not always happen in iPad
apps. In Octal (a Hacker News reader), I have to guess whether I'm looking hard
enough at the correct element to bring up the story or the comments. In
Obsidian, pressing the corner buttons to expand the sidebar is nearly
impossible.</p>
<p>If I'm staring at the center of a window, the window edges tend to shimmer as I
move my head around. This tells me visionOS uses higher-quality anti-aliasing
wherever your eyes are focused. Cool performance trick, but human peripheral
vision is highly sensitive to motion, which makes the shimmering somewhat
distracting.</p>
<p>I'm sure I sound pretty underwhelmed by my experience. Perhaps, but the most
exciting thing to me about Apple Vision Pro is that it has flaws like this.
Flaws bring charm to gadgets. They make you use them more selectively and
deliberately. Computers, phones and tablets have gotten boring because there is
no longer such deliberate use—they are always there, able to do anything and
instantly switch tasks as fast as your fingers can move.</p>
<h2>That's where ADHD comes in</h2><p>It's not strictly an ADHD problem that technology has gotten unbelievably
distracting. But as someone with ADHD, I feel acutely aware of my relationship
to technology in this way. It is incredibly hard to focus on a single task and
clear my mind of the "itch to screw around" when all the technology around me is
so goddamn fast and easy to use.</p>
<p>That's what makes Apple Vision Pro interesting for me. Navigating with your eyes
and fingers is (currently) not as fast or easy as using a mouse or a
touchscreen. Positioning windows in 3D space also takes time.</p>
<p>This has an interesting effect. I feel less inclined to mindlessly open and use
apps, because it has become a fundamentally mindful gesture to do so. I actually
have to go out of my way to bring up the Home Screen, launch an app, position it
where I want it, and interact with it by looking directly at it. I can't do
these things on autopilot.</p>
<p>Putting myself in an "environment" also seems to have the effect of eliminating
distractions from the outside world. I'm not glancing around at the stuff in my
office every time I pause to think.</p>
<p>There is an amusing irony here, the way that strapping a $3,500 computer to my
face is making my interaction with the digital world more deliberate and
mindful.</p>
<p>So, am I going to keep this thing after all?</p>
<p>It's still a toss-up. I have a decent idea for a productivity app I want to
build for Apple Vision Pro. If I make solid progress on it this week, I might
keep the headset under justification for business.</p>
<p>However, 14 days is unfortunately not enough time for me to decide whether Apple
Vision Pro is a true quality-of-life improvement for an ADHD lifestyle. Maybe
I'm still swept up in the novelty of it all. If I do end up keeping it, I'll
definitely write a follow-up in the near future. But for this price tag, I can't
justify the purchase on a "maybe".</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/0.svg" width="2160"></p>
<p>Adobe Illustrator introduced the pen tool back in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT8Y7o-zsVw">1987</a> as a tool for creating and modifying paths. Since then the pen tool has become incredibly widespread, so much so that is has become the de facto icon of the graphic design industry.</p>
<p>The pen tool's functionality hasn't changed significantly in the 30 years since its introduction. Just click and drag to create smooth curves. Designers have learned to work with it, and around its idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/1.svg"></p>
<p>The pen tool</p>
<p>But Figma felt like they could improve some aspects of how the pen tool worked, so they had a go at redesigning it. Instead of it being used to work with traditional paths, they improved the pen tool by creating what they call Vector Networks.</p>
<p>In this post we will go through what Vector Networks are and what problems they try to solve. After we've defined what Vector Networks are, we will take a look at some of the engineering challenges you would face if you were to take a stab at implementing them.</p>
<p>This post can be thought of as an introduction to a really interesting problem space, and as a resource for people interesting in making use of some aspects of Vector Networks for future applications. I hope it succeeds in providing value to both developers being introduced to new concepts and ideas, and to designers interesting in learning more about the tool they know and love.</p>
<p>I will start off by laying out the core concepts behind the pen tool, and from there we will move onto Figma's Vector Networks.</p>
<h2>Paths</h2>
<p>The pen tool is used to create and manipulate paths.</p>
<p>If you've every worked with graphics software like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> before, you've worked with paths. Paths are a series of lines and curves that may or may not form a loop.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/2.svg"></p>
<p>Some paths</p>
<p>The path to the left loops, while the path to the right doesn't. Both of these are valid paths.</p>
<p>The main characteristic of paths is that they form a single continuous unbroken chain. This means that each node can only be connected to one or two other nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/3.svg"></p>
<p>Not valid paths</p>
<p>However, you could construct these shapes from multiple paths if you position them correctly together.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/4.svg"></p>
<p>Multiple paths are used to create more complex shapes</p>
<p>From a combination of paths, you can create any shape imaginable.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/5.svg"></p>
<p>This beer glass, for example, is just a combination of five different paths positioned and scaled a certain way.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/6.svg"></p>
<h3>The building blocks of paths</h3>
<p>A path is made up of two things, points and lines.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/7.svg"></p>
<p>Points and lines</p>
<p>The points are known as <strong>nodes</strong> (or vertices) and the lines are called <strong>edges</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/8.svg"></p>
<p>Together, they make a path</p>
<p>Any path can be described as a list of nodes and edges.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/9.svg"></p>
<p>This path can be described as the series of nodes <code>(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)</code>. It could also be thought of as the series of the edges that composed it. That list of edges would be <code>(0, 1)</code>, <code>(1, 2)</code>, <code>(2, 3)</code>, <code>(3, 4)</code>, <code>(4, 0)</code>.</p>
<p>You can think of this like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dot+to+dot+for+kids&amp;tbm=isch">dot to dot puzzles</a> that you used to do as a kid: Draw the edges of the path in the order that the points lay out.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/10.svg"></p>
<p>But instead of a kid drawing lines between numbered points on a paper, a cold calculating machine does it along the cartesian coordinate system.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/11.svg"></p>
<h2>Edges</h2>
<p>An edge is a connection between a pair of nodes. Visually, edges are a line from node <code>a</code> to node <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>But that line can be drawn in a lot of different ways. How do you describe those different types of lines?</p>
<p>Edges fall into two categories, straight and curvy.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/12.svg"></p>
<p>Straight edges are as simple as they seem, just a line from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>. But how are those curvy edges defined?</p>
<h3>Bezier curves</h3>
<p>Curvy edges are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">bezier curves</a>. Bezier curves are a special type of curve defined by four points.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/13.svg"></p>
<p>The positions of the two nodes in our edge make up the start and end points of the curve. Each of the two nodes has a <em>control point</em>.</p>
<p>In most applications, these control points are shown as <em>handles</em> that extend from their respective node. These handles are used to control the shape of the curve.</p>
<p>Bezier curves can be chained to make more complex shapes that a single curve can't draw on its own. They can also be combined with straight lines to make some cool designs.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/14.svg"></p>
<p>But what exactly are the handles doing? How do the handles tell the computer to draw the curve like it does?</p>
<p>Computers draw curves by splitting them into straight lines and drawing the individual lines.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/15.svg"></p>
<p>The more lines you split a curve into, the smoother the curve becomes.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/16.svg"></p>
<p>So to draw the curve we need to know how to get the different points that make up the curve. If we compute enough of them, we get a smooth curve.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/17.svg"></p>
<h3>Computing a point on a bezier curve</h3>
<p>Let's compute the point at 25% point of the curve. We can start by connecting the control points with a third blue line.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/18.svg"></p>
<p>Then for each blue line, we draw a blue dot at the 25% point of the line.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/19.svg"></p>
<p>Next, draw two green lines between the three blue dots.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/20.svg"></p>
<p>And we repeat the same step as we did with the blue dots. Draw green points at the 25% points of the green lines.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/21.svg"></p>
<p>And then one more red line between the newly created green points.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/22.svg"></p>
<p>Then we add a red point at the 25% point of the red line.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/23.svg"></p>
<p>And just like that, we've computed the point at the 25% point of the curve.</p>
<p>From now on we'll refer to points on curves through a <code>t</code> value, where <code>t</code> is a number from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>. In the above example, the point would be at <code>t=0.25</code> (25%).</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/24.svg"></p>
<p>t=0.25, t=0.5 and t=0.75</p>
<p>This way of computing the point at <code>t</code> is called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm">De Casteljau's algorithm</a> and can also be used to subdivide a bezier curve. Using the points we created along the way, we can also subdivide the bezier curve into two smaller bezier curves.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/25.svg"></p>
<p>Bezier curves are pretty amazing things. Shaping the curve by adjusting the handles feels surprisingly natural, and chaining them together allows you to create detailed and complex shapes.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/26.svg"></p>
<p>And for computers, they're stable and inexpensive to compute. For this reason they're used for everything from <a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/drawing-pen-curvature-or-pencil.html#draw_curves_with_the_pen_tool">vector graphics</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.austinsaylor.com/blog/2015/3/20/4-after-effects-graph-editor-basics-you-need-to-know">animation curves</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier#B%C3%A9zier_curve">automobile bodies</a>.</p>
<p>You can see an interactive demo of bezier curves at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/">Jason Davies' site</a>. It's fascinating to watch a series of straight lines trace out a smooth curve.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/27.png"></p>

<h2>The creative constraints of paths</h2>
<p>Earlier in this post, paths were defined as a continuous series of lines and curves that may or may not form a loop.</p>
<p>The fact that paths are a single continuous chain is a pretty big limitation.</p>
<p>It means three way intersections are not possible using a single path. To create a three way intersection, two or more paths will have to be used. This means dealing with positioning and grouping different paths together. It also means that changes to a single path can lead to changes to multiple other paths.</p>
<p>But that's simply the routine. Seasoned designers know how paths behave, they can plan around it without really thinking about it. For a static design it doesn't really matter how many paths and layers you have to create if the piece is planned properly upfront.</p>
<p>But for some situations the constraints that paths impose cause a lot of friction.</p>
<h2>Vector Networks</h2>
<p>In 2016, Figma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/">introduced Vector Networks</a>. They lift the “single continuous” limitation by allowing any two nodes to be joined together without restrictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A vector network improves on the path model by allowing lines and curves between any two points instead of requiring that they all join up to form a single chain.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/">https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/</a></p>
<p>The cube is the quintessential example for demonstrating Vector Networks.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/29.svg"></p>
<p>Via traditional paths, you would have to create at minimum 3 different paths to describe this shape.</p>

<p>This creates a lot of friction for a seemingly simple and common shape. To modify the cube, you would have to modify two or three different paths. But with Vector Networks you can simply grab an edge and move it around, and the shape behaves like you would expect.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/31.svg"></p>
<p>So if you would want to increase the extrusion of the cube, you could just grab the two appropriate edges and move them together.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/32.svg"></p>
<p>This is the big selling point for Figma's Vector Networks. Ease of use.</p>
<p>Vector Networks don't enable you to create something that you couldn't create with other tools, but it does remove a lot of the friction in the process of creating things.</p>
<p>And you can take this even further. Say you want to add a hole to the side of the cube.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/33.svg"></p>
<p>Just start off by selecting and copying the sides of the cube. You can then duplicate those edges and scale them to the size you want them to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/34.svg"></p>
<p>And just like that, you have a cube with a hole.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/35.svg"></p>
<p>And to make this hole believable, you just need the inner edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/36.svg"></p>
<p>Again, Vector Networks may not allow you to create something you couldn't otherwise. Instead, they enable workflows that weren't previously possible.</p>
<h2>Creating Vector Networks</h2>
<p>With an understanding of what Vector Networks are, we can now take a look at how we would go about implementing them.</p>
<h3>Graph</h3>
<p>The main data structure behind Vector Networks is a graph. A graph can be thought of as a collection of nodes and edges.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/37.svg"></p>
<p>A graph</p>
<h3>Nodes</h3>
<p>A graph may have any number of nodes. For our purposes nodes have two properties, a unique <code>id</code> and a <code>position</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/38.svg"></p>
<h3>Edges</h3>
<p>Edges are the connection between two nodes. Each edge is a composed of two <em>edge parts</em>. An edge part contains a node's id and an optional control point.</p>
<p>The labels <code>n0</code> and <code>n1</code> will be used to refer to the nodes at the start and end of an edge, respectively. The control points will be labeled <code>cp0</code> and <code>cp1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/39.svg"></p>
<p>If the control points of the edge are omitted, the edge becomes a straight line.</p>
<h2>Filling the holes</h2>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/40.gif"></p>
<p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/">https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/</a></p>
<p>When working with vector networks, the Fill tool allows you to “toggle” the fill of different “areas” of the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/41.svg"></p>
<p>These areas can be defined as a sequence of node <code>id</code>s that go in a circle, a loop, if you will.</p>
<p>This loopy sequence is referred to as a <em>cycle</em>. In the above example, the cycle would consist of the nodes <code>n0</code>, <code>n1</code>, <code>n3</code>, <code>n4</code>, <code>n5</code>, <code>n6</code> and <code>n7</code>. These cycles will be written like <code>(0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)</code>.</p>
<p>If you were to count the different visually distinct “areas” of the cycle your answer would probably be three, but you could easily find more than three cycles.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/42.svg"></p>
<p>What makes this correct or incorrect?</p>
<p>The sequence <code>(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)</code> is a cycle and it loops, but it is not what we're looking for. The problem can be illustrated with the “how many triangles” puzzle you might have seen on Facebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/43.svg"></p>
<p>How many triangles are in this image?</p>
<p>You should be able to count 24 different triangles depending on which areas you choose to include.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/44.svg"></p>
<p>But that's not what we want. What we need to find are the 16 small areas.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/45.svg"></p>
<p>We need a way to find the <em>“small cycles”</em> in the graph.</p>
<h2>Minimal cycle basis</h2>
<p>This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/MinimalCycleBasis.pdf">paper on Minimal Cycle Basis</a> is a bit less dense than most others academic papers (and it has pictures!). Its goal is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…to compute a minimal number of cycles that form a cycle basis for the graph.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What does “Minimal Cycle Basis” mean?</h3>
<p>It's just a fancy way to refer to all of the “small areas” of a graph. You can think of these as the “visually distinct” areas of a graph. Enclosed areas.</p>
<h3>Left or right?</h3>
<p>The main tool for finding the “minimal cycle basis” will be determining which edge to choose based on left- or rightness.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/47.svg"></p>
<p>Should we go to <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>?</p>
<p>We'll think of this in terms of clockwise and counter clockwise.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/48.svg"></p>
<p><code>curr</code> for current, <code>prev</code> for previous</p>
<p>When traveling left, we choose the counter clockwise most edge (CCW) relative to the previous one.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/49.svg"></p>
<p>CCW</p>
<p>When traveling right, we choose the clockwise most edge (CW) relative to the previous one.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/50.svg"></p>
<p>CW</p>
<h3>The algorithm</h3>
<p>We will be finding the minimal cycle basis for the graph we saw earlier.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/51.svg"></p>
<p>The first step is choosing the leftmost node in the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/52.svg"></p>
<p>When traveling from the first node, we want to go clockwise (CW). But relative to which edge?</p>
<p>For the first node, we imagine that the previous edge is “below” the current one. We then pick the CW edge relative to that.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/53.svg"></p>
<p>In this case <code>a</code> is more CW relative to <code>prev</code> than <code>b</code>, so we'll walk to <code>a</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/54.svg"></p>
<p>After the first walk, we start picking the CCW edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/55.svg"></p>
<p>In this case, that's <code>b</code>. We repeat the previous step and keep selecting the CCW edge until we reach the original node.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/56.svg"></p>
<p>When we reach the original node again, a cycle is found.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/57.svg"></p>
<p>We now have the first small cycle in the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/58.svg"></p>
<p>When a cycle has been found, the first edge of the cycle is then removed from the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/59.svg"></p>
<p>The first edge, <code>(n0 n1)</code>, is removed</p>
<p>Then, the <em>filaments</em> of the first two nodes in the cycle are removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/60.svg"></p>
<p>In this case, we only have a single filament</p>
<p>Filaments are nodes that only have one adjacent edge. Think of these as dead ends. When a filament is found, we also check whether or not the single adjacent node is a filament. This ensures that the first node of the next cycle has two adjacent nodes. We'll see an example of this later.</p>
<p>Now we pick the first node in the next cycle. In our graph, there are two equally left most nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/61.svg"></p>
<p>When this happens, we pick the bottom node, <code>n1</code> in this case.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/62.svg"></p>
<p>We then repeat the process from before. CW from the bottom for the first node, then CCW from the previous node until we find the first node.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/63.svg"></p>
<p>We find the cycle <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/64.svg"></p>
<p>Now we have the cycles <code>(0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)</code> and <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/65.svg"></p>
<p>Then we remove the first edge of the cycle and filaments like before. We start by removing the filaments connected to the first two nodes of the cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/66.svg"></p>
<p>We keep going until there aren't any filaments left.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/67.svg"></p>
<p>Finding the next cycle is pretty obvious.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/68.svg"></p>
<p>CW then CCW</p>
<p>We now have all the cycles of the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/69.svg"></p>
<p>This is the minimal cycle basis of our graph! Now we can toggle the fills of these cycles as we please.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/70.svg"></p>
<h2>The math</h2>
<p>I want to dig into how the clockwise-ness of an edge relative to another edge is determined.</p>
<p>The only prerequisite for understanding this section are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html">vectors</a>; arrows pointing from one point of a 2D coordinate system to another.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/71.svg"></p>
<p>i = (1, 0), j = (0, 1)</p>
<p>With two vectors sitting at the origin, <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, we can create a square like so.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/72.svg"></p>
<p>For the unit vectors <code>(1, 0)</code> and <code>(0, 1)</code> the square has an area of 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/73.svg"></p>
<p>We can do this with any two vectors.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/74.svg"></p>
<p>This shape is called a <em>parallelogram</em>. Parallelograms have one property that we care about, which is that their area is equal to the absolute value of their determinant.</p>
<p>That may sound like jargon, but the determinant happens to be really useful for us. Take a look at what happens when we move the vectors of the one-by-one square closer together.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/75.svg"></p>
<p>When the vectors get closer, their area gets smaller. And when the vectors are parallel, the determinant and area become 0.</p>
<p>At this point the natural question to ask is what happens when we keep going and the blue arrow is to the right of the green arrow?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/76.svg"></p>
<p>The determinant becomes negative!</p>
<p>When the blue vector <code>j</code> is to the left of the green vector <code>i</code> the determinant of the parallelogram becomes negative. When the opposite is true it becomes positive.</p>
<p>The implication for our use case is that we can check whether the determinant of two vectors is positive or negative to determine whether or not a vector is to the left or right of another vector.</p>
<p>And we can do this no matter the direction because the area of a parallelogram does not change depending on the orientation of the vectors that create it.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/77.svg"></p>
<p>The determinant changes when the orientation of the vectors change <strong>relative to each other</strong>.</p>
<p>With this knowledge as our weapon, we can create a function, <code>det(i, j)</code>, that takes in two vectors and returns the determinant.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/78.svg"></p>
<p>The function will return a positive value when <code>j</code> is to the left (CCW) of <code>i</code>.</p>
<h3>Applying the math</h3>
<p>Say we're in the middle of the finding a cycle and we're deciding whether or not to move to <code>n0</code> or <code>n1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/79.svg"></p>
<p>Let's move this into the coordinate system.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/80.svg"></p>
<p>We'll start off with <code>a</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/81.svg"></p>
<p>We want to get the vector from <code>curr</code> to <code>a</code>, which we do by subtracting <code>curr</code> from <code>a</code>. We'll call this new vector <code>da</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/82.svg"></p>
<p>We can do the same for <code>curr</code> using <code>prev</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/83.svg"></p>
<p>Now we can determine whether <code>a</code> is left of <code>curr</code> by computing the determinant of the parallelogram that <code>da</code> and <code>dcurr</code> form.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/84.svg"></p>
<p>Note that the order is important. If we use <code>da</code> as <code>i</code> the area is negative. If we use it as <code>j</code> it becomes positive.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/85.svg"></p>
<p>We can do the same with <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/86.svg"></p>
<p>With this information as our weapon, we know whether or not <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>curr</code> are left or right of each other.</p>
<p>What do we do with this information?</p>
<h2>The green zone</h2>
<p>We will be focusing on determining whether <code>da</code> is more CCW than <code>db</code> relative to <code>curr</code>. Simply put, is <code>da</code> left of <code>db</code>?</p>
<p>If <code>da</code> is more CCW than <code>db</code> relative to <code>dcurr</code>, <code>da</code> can be said to be <em>better</em> than <code>db</code>.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine whether the angle between <code>dcurr</code> and <code>db</code> is convex.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/87.svg"></p>
<p>This “convexity” can more easily visualized by shifting <code>dcurr</code> back and imagining an arc like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/88.svg"></p>
<p>The angle is convex</p>
<p>If the angle is convex, we we use the following expression to check whether <code>da</code> is better than <code>db</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/89.svg"></p>
<p>The ∨ symbol represents the logical OR operator in math.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the individual parts of this expression.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/90.svg"></p>
<p>Is <code>da</code> CCW of <code>dcurr</code>?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/91.svg"></p>
<p>Is <code>da</code> CCW of <code>db</code>?</p>
<p>I find that it's pretty hard to visualize this mentally, so I think of the two different expressions creating a “green zone” where <code>da</code> is better than <code>db</code>.</p>
<p>For the first part of the expression (is <code>da</code> left of <code>dcurr</code>), the green area looks like so.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/92.svg"></p>
<p>The second part of the expression asks if <code>da</code> is left of <code>db</code>. The green area look looks like so.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/93.svg"></p>
<p>And since it's an OR expression, either of these sub-expressions being true would result in <code>a</code> being better than <code>b</code>. Thus, the green area looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/94.svg"></p>
<p>Is <code>a</code> better than <code>b</code>?</p>
<p>We use this to determine the better-ness of <code>a</code> when the angle is convex.</p>
<p>But what if the angle from <code>dcurr</code> to <code>db</code> is concave?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/95.svg"></p>
<p>Then the expression looks like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/96.svg"></p>
<p>The only thing that changed here is that the logical OR operator (∨) changed to the logical AND operator (∧).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what happens with the green zones using this expression.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/97.svg"></p>
<p>Is <code>da</code> left of <code>dcurr</code>?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/98.svg"></p>
<p>Is <code>da</code> left of <code>db</code>?</p>
<p>And since these sub-expressions are joined by logical AND, the green zone looks like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/99.svg"></p>
<p>Using this method, we can always get the CCW or CW most node. And the great thing is that this method is independent of rotation and really cheap to compute.</p>
<h3>Computing the determinant</h3>
<p>Given two vectors, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant">determinant</a> can be computed with this formula:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/100.svg"></p>
<h2>Intersections in the graph</h2>
<p>Let's go back to our graph for a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/101.svg"></p>
<p>This graph is the simplest, most optimistic case. This graph only has straight lines, and no two lines cross each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/102.svg"></p>
<p>This box shape has an intersection. The edge <code>(0, 2)</code> crosses the edge <code>(1, 3)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/103.svg"></p>
<p>With the intersection, the above area looks fillable. But defining the “filled area” is pretty difficult.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/104.svg"></p>
<p>What makes defining this area so difficult? Consider this rectangle and line.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/105.svg"></p>
<p>There are two intersections with the edge <code>(4, 5)</code> intersecting <code>(0, 1)</code> and <code>(2, 3)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/106.svg"></p>
<p>Say the area left of the line is filled. What happens if we move the line left?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/107.svg"></p>
<p>Obviously the area shrinks, but what if we keep going and move the line outside of the rectangle? Which of these outcomes below should be the result, and why?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/108.svg"></p>
<p>In this case kinda feels like the rectangle should be empty. But what if we move the line right?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/109.svg"></p>
<p>Should it then be filled? Sure, but what if we move the line up or down instead? Should the rectangle fill or empty when the line is no longer separating the two sections?</p>
<h2>Expanding the graph</h2>
<p>This is how I believe Figma solves this problem. I call it “expanding the graph”, but the engineers at Figma probably use a different vocabulary to describe it.</p>
<p>Expanding the graph means taking each intersection, creating a node at the point of the intersections, and then splitting the edges that intersected each other at that point.</p>
<p>This is the original graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/110.svg"></p>
<p>The edge <code>(0, 2)</code> intersects the edge <code>(1, 3)</code>. When expanded, the graph would look like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/111.svg"></p>
<p>A new node, <code>5</code> would be added at the point of the intersection.</p>
<p>The edges <code>(0, 2)</code> and <code>(1, 3)</code> have been removed and replaced by the edges <code>(0, 5)</code>, <code>(5, 2)</code>, <code>(1, 5)</code>, and <code>(5, 3)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/112.svg"></p>
<p>The structure of the graph has been changed</p>
<p>Here's a graphic that should illustrate this a bit more clearly.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/113.svg"></p>
<p>Expanding an intersection</p>
<h3>Multiple intersections</h3>
<p>These steps are pretty simple for line edges with a single intersections. But each edge can have multiple other edges intersecting it, and two cubic bezier curves can create 9 intersections.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/114.svg"></p>
<p>This complicates things a bit. Let's take a look at a bezier-line intersection.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/115.svg"></p>
<p>The best way to go about this is to treat the intersections for an edge as separate from the edge that intersected it.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/116.svg"></p>
<p>The <code>t</code> values go from 0 at the start of the curve to 1 at the end of it</p>
<p>The line has two intersections at <code>t = 0.3</code> and <code>t = 0.7</code>. The bezier has two intersections, but at <code>t = 0.25</code> and <code>t = 0.75</code>.</p>
<p>Before we move on with this example, I want to introduce a different way of thinking about edges since I believe it will help with the overall understanding of the problem.</p>
<h3>Duplicate edges</h3>
<p>Two nodes may be connected multiple times by different edges.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/117.svg"></p>
<p>In this graph, an edge represented by the node pair <code>(2, 3)</code> could represent either of the two edges that connect <code>n2</code> and <code>n3</code>.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, we will give each edge a unique <code>id</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/118.svg"></p>
<p>For most future examples, I will still refer to edges by the nodes they connect since I feel it's easier to think about. But for the next example it's better to separate nodes and edges.</p>
<h3>Intersection map</h3>
<p>We can structure the data for the intersections of the edges like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/119.svg"></p>
<p>Creating nodes at the intersection points of edges</p>
<p>When we encounter an intersection, we create a node whose position is at the intersection. We then add intersections to an <em>intersection map</em> that will contain the intersections for each edge with a corresponding <code>t</code> value and a <code>nodeId</code>. These intersections are sorted by the <code>t</code> value.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/120.svg"></p>
<p>For the intersection with the lowest <code>t</code> value, we create an edge with the first <em>edge part</em> having the <code>nodeId</code> of the first edge part of the original edge. The second edge part should contain the <code>nodeId</code> of the intersection. This creates the edge <code>(2, 4)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/121.svg"></p>
<p>Subsequent edges will have the first edge part's <code>nodeId</code> be the <code>nodeId</code> of the previous intersection and the second <code>nodeId</code> be the <code>nodeId</code> of the current intersection. In this example, that edge is <code>(4, 5)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/122.svg"></p>
<p>One additional edge will be created for each edge with any intersections.</p>
<p>The first edge part's <code>nodeId</code> will be the <code>nodeId</code> of the last intersection and the second edge part's <code>nodeId</code> will be the <code>nodeId</code> of the second edge part of the original edge.</p>
<p>This was a bit of a mouthful, so hopefully this graphic helps a bit with understanding that alphabet soup.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/123.svg"></p>
<p>Separating the intersections of an edge from the edges that created those intersections makes it easier to think about. It alleviates some of the complexity that might arise from multiple edges intersecting with each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/124.svg"></p>
<h2>Self-intersection</h2>
<p>Cubic beziers can self-intersect.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/125.svg"></p>
<p>This, unfortunately, means that every single cubic bezier edge has to be checked for self-intersection. It's an interesting problem that involves finding the two different <code>t</code> values that the bezier intersects itself at, but I won't be covering how to find those values here.</p>
<p>Once you have the <code>t</code> values, a self-intersecting bezier can be expanded like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/126.svg"></p>
<p>The blue node should be invisible to the user</p>
<p>We insert <code>n3</code> since having a node with an edge that has itself on both ends of the edge is problematic, but it should be hidden from the user.</p>

<p>Intersecting the loop of a self-intersecting bezier</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/128.svg"></p>
<p>Removing n3 at the first opportunity</p>
<h2>Curvy edges</h2>
<p>Earlier we covered the CW - CCW graph traversal algorithm to find the minimal cycle basis (small areas).</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/129.svg"></p>
<p>Finding the better (counter clockwise most) point adjacent to <code>curr</code></p>
<p>But the algorithm described in the paper was designed to work with nodes connected by straight lines that don't intersect. Introducing edges defined by cubic beziers introduces significant complexity.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/130.svg"></p>
<p>Which edge to choose, blue or green?</p>
<p>In the example above, we can find out that the blue edge is better than the green one by using the determinant. We are stilling defining better to mean the CCW most edge.</p>
<p>When working with cubic bezier curves, the naive solution would be to just convert the bezier to a line defined by the points at the start and end of the curve.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/131.svg"></p>
<p>But that idea breaks down as soon as one edge curves over the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/132.svg"></p>
<p>Oops</p>
<p>Let's take a fresh look at a bezier curves and try to work from there.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/133.svg"></p>
<p>Looking at this, we notice that the tangent at the start of the curve, <code>n0</code>, is parallel to the line from <code>n0</code> to <code>cp0</code>. So to get the direction at the start of the edge we can use the line <code>(n0, cp0)</code>.</p>
<p>For clarity, the start of our edge, <code>n0</code>, is the same node as <code>curr</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/134.svg"></p>
<p>So by converting edges defined by cubic beziers into a line defined by <code>(n0, cp0)</code>, we get the <em>initial</em> angle of the curve.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/135.svg"></p>
<p>This seems like a good solution when looking at the “curve around” case.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/136.svg"></p>
<p>Looks like we've solved the problem. Right?</p>
<h3>No intersections</h3>
<p>Before we move on to further edge cases, it helps to understand that any solutions assume that no two edges may intersect when deciding which edge to travel.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/137.svg"></p>
<p>This is not allowed</p>
<p>The edges of the graph we're traversing must not have any intersections when we compute the cycles (minimal cycle basis) of the graph.</p>
<p>We can only operate on an <em>expanded graph</em>.</p>
<p>Like we covered earlier, an expanded graph is a graph that has replaced all intersections with new nodes and edges. So if the original, user-defined graph has any intersections, they would have to be expanded before we can find the graph's cycles.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/138.svg"></p>
<p>The same edges as above, but expanded</p>
<h2>Parallel edges</h2>
<p>The next edge case is two edges being parallel (pointing in the same direction).</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/139.svg"></p>
<p>If the lines go in the same direction, determining which is better is impossible without more information.</p>
<p>Here are a few possible solutions for the cases where the control points of the curves are parallel.</p>
<h3>Point at <code>t</code></h3>
<p>What if we just take the point on the curve at, for example, <code>t = 0.1</code>?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/140.svg"></p>
<p>This produces the correct result for curves of a similar length, but we can easily break this with one curve being significantly bigger than the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/141.svg"></p>
<p>This is effectively the same problem as the “curve around” case we saw earlier.</p>
<h3>Point at length</h3>
<p>Instead of taking a point at a fixed <code>t</code> value, we could take a point at some length along the curve. The length would be determined by some point on the smaller curve, e.g. at <code>t=0.1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/142.svg"></p>
<p>I have not tried implementing this since I have another working solution, but this could possibly be a viable and performant solution if it works for all edge cases.</p>
<h3>Lasers!</h3>
<p>The next solution is a bit esoteric but produces the correct result. This is the solution I'm currently using.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/143.svg"></p>
<p>We begin by splitting each bezier at <code>t = 0.05</code> (image above is exaggerated). We then tesselate each part into n points.</p>
<p>Then, for each point of the tesselated bezier, we check whether a line from <code>n0</code> to that point intersects the other edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/144.svg"></p>
<p>It's pretty hard to see what's going on at this scale, so let's zoom in a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/145.svg"></p>
<p>When a point intersects the other edge, we use the point before it.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/146.svg"></p>
<p>Found an intersection</p>
<p>Let's zoom in a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/147.svg"></p>
<p>The intersection close up</p>
<p>For the other edge, we have no intersection.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/148.svg"></p>
<p>In that case, we just use the end of the edge as the direction line.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/149.svg"></p>
<p>With this method we've produced lines that seem to represent their respective curves.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/150.svg"></p>
<p>And this also works for the “curve around” case.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/151.svg"></p>
<p>But it fails for a “curve behind” case.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/152.svg"></p>
<p>This would produce the green edge as the more CCW edge, which is wrong.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to shoot an infinite laser in the direction of the previous edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/153.svg"></p>
<p>We then check whether the points of the tesselated bezier intersect this laser.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/154.svg"></p>
<p>But a line from <code>n0</code> to the points would never intersect the laser.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/155.svg"></p>
<p>Passes right through</p>
<p>Instead, we can create a line from the current point to the previous point and use that for the intersection test.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/156.svg"></p>
<p>When we intersect the laser, we use the previous point. The previous point will always be on the correct side of the laser.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/157.svg"></p>
<p>The point we use</p>
<p>And like that, we have a solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/158.svg"></p>
<h2>Parallel, but in reverse!</h2>
<p>It could also be the case that the blue or green edges, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> respectively, could be parallel to the edge from <code>curr</code> to <code>prev</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/159.svg"></p>
<p><code>a</code> is parallel to <code>prev</code></p>
<p>The process for finding the better edge follows a process similar to the one described above so we will cover this very quickly.</p>
<p>There are two cases:</p>
<h3>A or B are parallel to <code>Prev</code> , but not both</h3>
<p>If either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>, but not both, are parallel to <code>prev</code>, we can simply compare the parallel edge to <code>prev</code>.</p>
<p>If the parallel edge is CW of <code>prev</code>, the parallel edge is better.</p>
<p>If the parallel edge is CCW of <code>prev</code>, the other edge is better.</p>
<p>Think a bit about why this is true.</p>
<p>If one edge is parallel to <code>prev</code> and curves CW, and the other is not parallel to <code>prev</code>, then the parallel edge is as CCW as can be. This means that the green zone for the other edge is completely empty.</p>
<p>The reverse is true if the parallel edge curves CCW, since it would be as CW as possible. This means that the green zone for the other edge is the whole circle.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/160.svg"></p>
<h3>Both A and B are parallel to Prev</h3>
<p>Using the same laser solution as before, this case is covered.</p>
<h2>Cycles inside of cycles</h2>
<p>Now we're going to look at fills for a bit.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a basic example of a graph with a cycle inside of another cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/161.svg"></p>
<p>You would expect the graph's areas to be defined like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/162.svg"></p>
<p>But as it stands, if you hover over the outer area you get a different, unsatisfactory result.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/163.svg"></p>
<p>But this makes sense. Let's take a look at the nodes of the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/164.svg"></p>
<p>The cycle <code>(0, 1, 2, 3)</code> describes the outer boundary of the area we want, but we aren't describing the “inner boundary” of the area yet.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how we can do that.</p>
<h3>Even-odd rule</h3>
<p>Telling a computer to draw the outline of a 2D shape is simple enough. But if you want to fill that shape, how do you tell the computer what is “inside” and what is “outside”?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/165.svg"></p>
<p>One way of finding out whether a point is inside a shape or not is by shooting an infinite laser in any direction from that point and counting how many “walls” it passes through.</p>
<p>If the laser intersects an odd number of walls, it's inside of the shape. Otherwise it is outside of the shape.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/166.svg"></p>
<p>Intersects 1 wall, we're inside of the shape</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/167.svg"></p>
<p>Intersects 4 walls, we're outside of the shape</p>
<p>This works for any 2D shape, no matter which point you choose and which direction you shoot the laser in.</p>
<p>This also helps in the case of nested paths.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/168.svg"></p>
<p>This gives us an idea for how we can define the “inner boundary” of a shape.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/169.svg"></p>
<h3>Reducing closed walks</h3>
<p>Let's look at a graph with a cycle nested inside of another cycle, but with an edge connecting two nodes of the cycles.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/170.svg"></p>
<p>This will lead back to how we can think about nested cycles and give us a deeper understanding on how to think about them.</p>
<p>Let's find the cycles. We use the same CW-CCW method as usual.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/171.svg"></p>
<p>With this method, we go on what looks like a small detour around the inner cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/172.svg"></p>
<p>When we reach the node we started at, this is what the cycle looks like.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/173.svg"></p>
<p>This is the first cycle we've seen where we cross a node twice (both <code>n3</code> and <code>n4</code>). Something interesting appears when we take a look at the direction that the cycle takes throughout the graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/174.svg"></p>
<p>We start off traveling CCW, but when we cross the edge from the outer cycle to the inner cycle the orientation we travel seems to flip.</p>
<p>I will state for now that we want to separate the outer cycle from the inner cycle and treat the edge between them as if it didn't exist. I will go into the <em>why</em> later and explain the <em>how</em> here.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/175.svg"></p>
<p>We take all repeated nodes, in this case <code>n3</code>, and remove them from the cycle. We also remove any nodes that are between the two repeated nodes.</p>
<p>You might notice that <code>n4</code> is also repeated, but since it's “inside” of the part of the cycle that <code>n3</code> removes, we can ignore it.</p>
<p>We leave one instance of the repeated node, and then we have the cycle that would have been found if the <em>crossing</em> didn't exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/176.svg"></p>
<p>We then mark the edge that connected the outer cycle from the inner cycle. I call these marked edges <em>crossings</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/177.svg"></p>
<p>It could also be the case that an outer-inner cycle combo has multiple crossings.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/178.svg"></p>
<p>In that case, we mark all edges adjacent to the node connected to the outer cycle as a crossing.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/179.svg"></p>
<p>And after all this is done, our cycles look like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/180.svg"></p>
<h2>Subcycles</h2>
<p>Instead of referring to “inner” and “outer” cycles, I will refer to subcycles and parent cycles. This will make it easier to think about multiple cycles relative to each other.</p>
<p>Having said that, let's introduce a third cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/185.svg"></p>
<p>When we hover over the outermost cycle, what do you expect to happen?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/186.svg"></p>
<p>Because of the even-odd rule, the innermost cycle is filled too!</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/187.svg"></p>
<p>To fix this, we can introduce the concept of <em>direct subcycles</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/188.svg"></p>
<p>Parent cycles (blue) and their direct subcycles (green)</p>
<p>A parent cycle may have multiple direct subcycles. But due to the non-intersection rule, a subcycle may only have a single parent cycle.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how this works.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/189.svg"></p>
<p>This graph has a a rectangle, our outermost cycle, which has two direct subcycles: a diamond and an hourglass. The diamond has two direct subcycles of its own, and the hourglass has three direct subcycles.</p>
<p>We will begin with the rectangle and its direct subcycles. We will name them, <code>c0</code>, <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/190.svg"></p>
<p>The user has decided to fill some of these cycles, and leave some of them empty.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/191.svg"></p>
<p><code>c0</code> and <code>c1</code> are filled, and <code>c2</code> is empty</p>
<p>Let's draw the graph without a stroke and with a gray fill. When drawing this graph we start with the outermost cycle, <code>c0</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/192.svg"></p>
<p>The graph to the left with the render to the right</p>
<p>Since <code>c0</code> is filled, we draw it. If it were not filled we could skip drawing it. We can shoot a laser out of the rectangle and see that it intersects the walls of the rectangle once, so we can expect it to be filled considering the even-odd rule.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/193.svg"></p>
<p>This may seem really obvious, but it's good to have the rules of the game laid out clearly before we move on.</p>
<p>Next we want to draw <code>c1</code>, the diamond in our graph. It was filled, just like the rectangle so we should draw it as well. But if we try to draw the diamond as well, we get the wrong result.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/194.svg"></p>
<p>Our laser is intersecting two walls as a result of drawing both of the shapes when the have the same fill setting.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/195.svg"></p>
<p>We intersect an even number of walls, so we're “outside” of the shape</p>
<p>So to draw the image the user wanted we can simply skip drawing the diamond since the parent cycle implicitly draws direct subcycles with the same fill setting.</p>
<p>The hourglass, <code>c2</code>, is supposed to be empty. With that being the case, just not drawing it seems like a reasonable conclusion. But since the parent cycle (rectangle) has already drawn the hourglass as if it were filled we need to “flip” the fill by drawing the hourglass.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/196.svg"></p>
<p>And again, if we try to use the laser intersection method we see that the number of intersections is 2, an even number. And with the even-odd rule, an even number of walls means you're “outside” of the shape.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/197.svg"></p>
<p>Now that we've drawn the rectangle and its direct subcycles, we can move onto the direct subcycles of those.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/198.svg"></p>
<p>When working with <code>c3</code> and <code>c4</code>, the direct subcycles of <code>c1</code>, we can treat them as if they're direct subcycles of <code>c0</code> since <code>c1</code> had the same fill setting.</p>
<p>For <code>c3</code>, we want to “flip” the fill setting so we draw it. But <code>c4</code> has the same fill setting as its parent cycle so we don't draw it.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/199.svg"></p>
<p>Even number of intersections so we're outside of the shape</p>
<p>And we can think of <code>c5</code>, <code>c6</code> and <code>c7</code> in the same way. We don't care whether they're filled or empty when rendering them. We care whether or not they have the same fill as their parent cycle.</p>
<p>We only need to draw cycles if their parent cycle has the opposite “fill setting” as themselves. If they have the same fill setting, we don't have to draw them.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/200.svg"></p>
<p>This means that when drawing cycles, start by drawing the outermost “filled” cycle and then look at that cycle's subcycles. If a subcycle has the same fill setting as its parent cycle, it should not be drawn.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/201.svg"></p>
<h2>Contiguous cycles</h2>
<p>A graph may have multiple “clusters” of cycles.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/202.svg"></p>
<p>I use the phrase <em>contiguous cycles</em> to describe the “togetherness” of the cycles, if you will. I often think of these contiguous groups of cycles as being in different colors.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/203.svg"></p>
<p>Finding these contiguous cycles can be done with a depth-first traversal:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/204.svg"></p>
<p>Start at the first node of the cycle</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/205.svg"></p>
<p>Color each node you find</p>
<p>But remember the <em>crossings</em>? In the search, you may not crawl to adjacent nodes by edges marked as crossings.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/206.svg"></p>
<p>So in the end, our colors actually look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/207.svg"></p>
<p>Take this group of contiguous cycles nested inside another group of contiguous cycles:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/208.svg"></p>
<p>Because of the non-intersection rule we know that if one of the nodes in a group of contiguous cycles is inside of a cycle not in the group, all of them are.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/209.svg"></p>
<p>This “contiguous cycles” idea is maybe not the most interesting part of this post on the surface, but I've found it to be useful when working on Vector Networks.</p>
<h2>Partial expansion</h2>
<p>When hovering an area defined by intersections, we are showing a cycle of the expanded graph.</p>
<p>Take this triangle as an example.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/210.svg"></p>
<p>If we hover over one of its areas, we see an area defined by nodes that don't exist yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/211.svg"></p>
<p>What the blue striped area represents is the area whose fill state would be “toggled” if the user clicks the left mouse button. This area does not exist on the graph as the user defined it. It exists as a cycle on the expanded version of the original graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/212.svg"></p>
<p>The expanded graph</p>
<p>When the user clicks to toggle the fill state of the area, we would first have to expand the graph for the nodes and edges that make up that area to exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/213.svg"></p>
<p>The expanded graph</p>
<p>But by doing that we've expanded two intersections that we didn't need to expand to be able to describe the area. These expansions are destructive in nature and should be avoided when possible.</p>
<p>Instead, we can <em>partially expand</em> the graph by only expanding the intersections that define the selected cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/214.svg"></p>
<p>Partially expanded graph</p>
<p>This allows us to maintain as much of the original graph as possible while still being able to define the fill.</p>
<h3>Implementing partial expansions</h3>
<p>The basic implementation is reasonably simple. When you create the expanded graph, just add a little metadata to each expanded node that tells you which two edges of the original graph were used to create it and at what <code>t</code> values those intersections occurred.</p>
<p>Then when the cycle is clicked, iterate over each node. If the node exists in the expanded graph but not the original graph, add it to a new partially expanded graph.</p>
<p>There are edge cases, but I will not be covering them here.</p>
<h2>Omitted topics</h2>
<p>Here are some of the topics that I decided to omit for this post. Go have a stab at them yourself!</p>
<h3>Joins</h3>
<p>Figma offers three types of joins. Round, pointy and square. How could these different types of joins be implemented?</p>
<p><img src="https://alexharri.com/images/posts/vector-networks/215.svg"></p>
<h3>Stroke align</h3>
<p>Figma also offers three ways to align the stroke of a graph: center, inside and outside.</p>
<p>How do you determine inside- or outside-ness and what happens when the graph has no cycles?</p>
<h3>Boolean operations</h3>
<p>Figma, like most vector graphics tools, offers <a target="_blank" href="https://help.figma.com/article/65-boolean-operations">boolean operations</a>. How could those be implemented?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://paperjs.org/">Paper.js</a> is open source and has boolean operations for paths, maybe you can start there?</p>
<h2>Future topics</h2>
<p>These are some of the more open-ended features and ideas I want to explore in the future.</p>
<h3>A different way of working with fills</h3>
<p>There are alternatives to how Figma allows the user to work with fills.</p>
<p>One possible solution I'm interested in exploring is multiple different “fill layers” that use one vector object as a reference. This would solve the “<a target="_blank" href="https://spectrum.chat/figma/feature-requests/paint-bucket-tool-with-multiple-colors~1b55179b-f911-468b-9355-fd361564fda0">one graph, multiple colors</a>” problem without having to duplicate the layer and keep multiple vector objects in sync if you want to make changes later on.</p>
<h3>Animating the graph</h3>
<p>Given an <a target="_blank" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-basics.html">expression</a> and reference based system similar to After Effects, what could you achieve when you combine it with Vector Networks?</p>
<p>Or maybe we could make use of a node editor similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/shader_editor/index.html">Blender's shader editor</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/visualeffects">Fusion's node based workflow</a>?</p>
<p>There's a lot of exploration to be done here and I'm really excited to dive into this topic.</p>
<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading this post! I hope it served as a good introduction to what I think is a really interesting problem space. I've been working on this problem alongside school and work for a good while. It's part of an animation editor plus runtime for the web I'm working on. I intend for a modified version of Vector Networks to be the core of a few features.</p>
<p>I've been working on implementing Vector Networks for a bit over half a year now. The vector editor is pretty robust when it comes to creating, modifying and expanding the graph. But the edge cases when modifying the fill state have been stumping me for quite a while now.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a fully working demo before publishing this post, but it's going to be a few months until it's stable enough for it to be usable for people that are not me.</p>
<p>The big idea behind the project is to be a piece of animation software that's tailor-made for creating and running dynamic animations on the web. I'll share more about this project at a later date.</p>
<p>I also just think that Figma's Vector Networks are super cool and it's really hard to find material about it online. I hope this post helps fix the lack of information that I encountered when attempting to find information about Vector Networks.</p></main></div></div>]]></description>

    <div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
          <p data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3r1e21000hpam3f90hzlx3@published">“<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/05/ticketmaster-why-do-so-many-music-venues-use-it-when-everyone-hates-it.html">Why Do So Many Music Venues Use Ticketmaster?</a>” “<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/06/whats-it-like-to-train-to-be-a-sushi-chef.html">What’s It Like to Train to Be a Sushi Chef?</a>” “<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/03/how-do-martial-artists-break-concrete-blocks.html">How Do Martial Artists Break Concrete Blocks?</a>” If you were looking for answers to such questions 10 years ago, your best resource for finding a thorough, expert-informed response likely would have been one of the most interesting and longest-lasting corners of the internet: Quora.</p>

  <p data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re69m001f3b6ytxcd9hx2@published">Most people have encountered Quora in some form, whether they know it or not: in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora#/media/File:Google_Search_popularity_of_Quora.png">Google search results</a>, in writing samples <a href="https://twitter.com/PtakTestKitchen/status/1723809343076696275">from famous authors</a>, or perhaps in reprints of certain Q&amp;As in digital publications, <a href="https://slate.com/author/quora-contributor">like Slate</a>. One of those <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/04/can-you-have-a-rational-opinion-against-gay-marriage-and-not-be-homophobic.html">Slate-via-Quora contributors</a>, author and researcher <a href="http://quora.com/profile/Erica-Friedman">Erica Friedman</a>, joined the site back in 2011, when it was “starting to get a little bit of new traffic” thanks in part to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/yahoo-answers-hits-300-million-questions-but-qa-activity-is-declining-127314">Yahoo Answers’ decline</a> in reliability and activity. This, she said, allowed Quora to stand out as an accuracy-focused, knowledge-centric text platform. That was a unique offering in an age when Facebook and Twitter were coming to dominate the social internet, and <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/6787/5517">YouTube was doing</a> its own thing.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6bf001g3b6yqyneatsa@published">Friedman was so enamored of the quirky Q&amp;A monolith that she—and many, many others—contributed answers for free. “There was a period of time, for a number of years in the mid-2010s, that a lot of us were really dedicated to a particular mission,” she said. “That was: ‘Let’s make Quora the place on the internet that says you can’t be a jerk here. Let’s put those policies into action, and let’s make it impossible for people to come here in bad faith and act in bad faith.’ ” A smart and passionate community dedicated to maintaining a positive and affirmative space where the most curious netizens could gather—what sounded more ideal than that? No wonder Quora had such a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/uniquorn/">growth spurt in the 2010s</a>.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6d9001j3b6y1tikthmz@published">Today’s Quora, however, hardly meshes with those utopian aims. The once-beloved forum is now home to a never-ending avalanche of meaningless, repetitive sludge, filled with <a href="https://twitter.com/PoojaIsNagpal/status/1726045612901331196">bizarre</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Zeronelite/status/1743449094360596802">nonsensical</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/3DrakaiNa/status/1743993622737863056">straight-up hateful</a>, and A.I.–generated entries along with a slurry of <a href="https://www.quora.com/qemail/tc?al_imp=eyJ0eXBlIjogMzMsICJoYXNoIjogIjY1MTU3NDk0MjQ5NjgzMzA0NHwxMnwxfDE0Nzc3NDM3MDg2NTEyMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;al_pri=1&amp;aoid=YMFq83qCG68&amp;aoty=2&amp;aty=4&amp;cp=12&amp;et=2&amp;id=be140b4cf1c147b8a77b16e99fa8ace0&amp;q_aid=8wxTj0iwhqF&amp;uid=VBcXXrgmmw2">all-caps non-questions</a> like “OMG! KING CHARLES SHOCK the WORLD with ROYAL BAN ON PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE. SAD?” (The answer to this “question,” which garnered about <a href="https://hollywoodactress02.quora.com/OMG-KING-CHARLES-SHOCK-the-WORLD-with-ROYAL-BAN-ON-PRINCE-HARRY-AND-MEGHAN-MARKLE-SAD">7 million views</a>, links to a bizarre, barely functional royals-watching website called red-carpett.com.) Whereas once you could Google a question about current events and find links to thoughtful Quora answers near the top of the results, you’re now more likely to come upon, say, a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+trump+racism+site%3Aquora.com&amp;sca_esv=602396836&amp;ei=0ue3ZZbuOb6bptQPpouDgA0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWn-roloOEAxW-jYkEHabFANAQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=donald+trump+racism+site%3Aquora.com&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiImRvbmFsZCB0cnVtcCByYWNpc20gc2l0ZTpxdW9yYS5jb21IgwxQmQJYgAhwAXgAkAEAmAE4oAHTAqoBATe4AQPIAQD4AQHiAwQYASBBiAYB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp#ip=1">bunch of folks</a> asking in the year of our Lord 2024 whether the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/01/trump-debuts-new-racist-name-for-nikki-haley.html">consistently racist Donald Trump</a> is, in fact, racist. Or, maybe, the featured Google snippet will tell you that <a href="https://genius.com/Westside-gunn-margiela-split-toes-lyrics">eggs can melt</a>, thanks to a nonsense Quora answer caught in the search crawler.</p>

  


  

  


  <p data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6f7001k3b6yv9lotim9@published">Quora’s still-strong SEO has only brought more attention to the issue. <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/1/27/2219870/-Boosting-Biden-on-Quora#comment_87913421">Commenters across</a> a <a href="https://sitejabber.com/reviews/quora.com">variety of forums</a> have <a href="https://reddit.com/r/quora/comments/17otfiw/why_does_every_question_on_quora_seem_from_bots/">bemoaned Quora’s downgrade</a> in quality, and the Atlantic recently asked, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/01/quora-tragedy-answer-websites/677062/">If There Are No Stupid Questions, Then How Do You Explain Quora?</a>” Just scroll through the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InsanePeopleQuora/comments/18oq0xi/this_ridiculous_question_was_asked_by_the_quora/">Insane People Quora</a>” subreddit if you’d like more examples of this pronounced decline in quality.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6h7001l3b6yx6k4zkcu@published">Quora’s shrinking utility isn’t due entirely to A.I.: Longtime writers cite issues with moderation and functionality that started well before the ChatGPT era. But its decline has been accelerating—much to the chagrin of the uniquely attached and now-fraying community—with the rise of this new knowledge broker. Earlier this month, the A.I.–accelerationist venture capital hub <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/openai-sam-altman-ai-microsoft-eacc-effective-altruism.html">Andreessen Horowitz</a> blessed Quora with a much-needed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/quora-75m-funding-a16z-poe-ai-chat/">$75 million investment</a>—but <em>only</em> for the sake of developing its on-site generative-text chatbot, Poe.</p>

  
  <p data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6kl001m3b6yqmewtg4l@published">The early advantage Quora had over the (many) other Q&amp;A sites in the late 2000s was that it was <em>designed</em> with social networking in mind. Co-founders Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever were both early Facebook employees who quit in 2009 in order to build a website where, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/28/quora-has-the-magic-benchmark-invests-at-86-million-valuation/">they told TechCrunch</a> at the time, “we’re trying to get information out of people’s heads, so it’s not on sources that are hard to access on the internet, and get it into a really useful format to make a valuable database.” Their plan was to persuade experts in specialized fields to share their insights with knowledge-seekers and, from there, build a vibrant community around this free exchange of authentic information. “There were a lot of high-quality answers from people who wanted to just share their experiences,” said Friedman—a feature that stood in stark contrast with Yahoo Answers, which “never built up that community.”</p>

  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6ky001n3b6y0efypg19@published">Ariel Williams, one of Quora’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Ariel-Williams">first 500,000 members</a>, agreed. “You had Yahoo Answers, and the quality was horrible: People would write a question and somebody would just say something disgusting,” she told me. “Quora had a focus on quality, and they were looking for quality answers, they were looking for quality questions, there was active moderation, and the whole site was set up around the people, around the users.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6n2001o3b6yntpskce1@published">It didn’t take long for experts like <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stan-Hanks">Stan Hanks</a>, best known as a <a href="https://rule11.tech/history-of-networking-stan-hanks-and-gre/">pioneering network engineer</a> who <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-invented-virtual-private-networks-VPN">built the first</a> IP virtual private networks, to show up. In late 2012, he told me, he would log on to Quora, and “there would be something where I had personal experience where I knew the people involved, where I had backstories, and it would just light me up, and I would just write.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6oz001p3b6y2weychts@published">To keep the volunteer experts happy, Quora built out its perks. The company established a Top Writer program for Quora’s best and most fervent answer-writers, built a system that incentivized thoughtful discussion, and even invited these happy Quorans the opportunity to hang out at summits held at company headquarters. “The Top Writer program spanned from 2012 to 2018,” said Williams, herself a Top Writer in an elite crew of just a few hundred Quorans. “There was a physicist that had worked with Freeman Dyson. There were people that worked at NASA. There were people with doctorates.”</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6qs001q3b6yc6f23g28@published">There was also robust human backup for all these writers. “There was a moderation team, a review team, and a support team,” said Hanks. “Full-time paid moderators were employees of Quora, and part-time moderators had other jobs like writer engagement.” There were paid community managers who enforced a basic standard of BNBR (“Be Nice, Be Respectful”), customer service support staff, and a department for cross-publishing particular Q&amp;As to websites like Forbes and HuffPost.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6sk001r3b6yumiume2u@published">The social network racked up hundreds of millions of page views, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/09/quora-forever/">millions of dollars</a> from cash-happy investors, and carved out a corner of the internet distinct from Wikipedia, Reddit, or Facebook. It may not have had the ubiquity and fame of those sites, but that was fine—everyone touching Quora knew what it stood for.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6vl001s3b6yb6ovsx9b@published">But even then, there were issues plaguing Quora that would continue to fester. First, an anonymous former Quoran told me, the site started “shortening the length of questions.” The professed reason was to increase Quora’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">visibility on Google</a>, but that brevity came with a cost: It also made it difficult for users to ask the types of complex questions that could be addressed by specialists, including extremely specific <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-equity-should-I-get-as-a-co-founder-to-build-a-startup-from-scratch-I%E2%80%99ve-been-offered-10-subject-to-dilution-with-a-typical-CTO-salary-The-company-hasn%E2%80%99t-started-yet-they-don%E2%80%99t-have-a-prototype-10-for-a-CTO-is-very-low-What-is-fair">business-related queries</a> of the type Hanks would answer. (For example: “How much equity should I get as a co-founder to build a startup from scratch? I’ve been offered 10%, subject to dilution, with a typical CTO salary. The company hasn’t started yet, they don’t have a prototype. 10% for a CTO is very low. What is fair?”)</p>

  <p data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6xd001t3b6y0tomcaax@published">Then there was what <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-did-your-son-tell-you_b_12376218">former Top Writer J. Starr</a> (who has since <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/User-9909878588354538212">deleted her account</a>) characterized to me as “optimizing the feed.” At first, when a user signed in to Quora, they saw what they had come there to see: questions to be answered. But soon, the site started “putting ‘content’ articles into everyone’s feed,” flooding the site with articles that were, according to Starr, “just dreck, gossipy-rag articles about Hollywood figures.” A grim precursor, it seems, to the current-day all-caps PSAs around King Charles.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re6z9001u3b6y83lx3drt@published">There were early problems with ads and bots too. When Quora started putting ads on the site in 2016, Williams and other Top Writers suggested that there be some sort of creator revenue-sharing program, she told me. As a result, higher-ups created “the <a href="https://quorapartners.quora.com/">Quora partner program</a>, which I joined myself,” Williams said. But that “was all about trying to come up with questions that would draw in more views and more people,” she said—not about incentivizing high-quality answers. It was all about adding webpages of individual questions, for SEO purposes.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re70z001v3b6y57cgscfe@published">And Quora “partners” weren’t the only ones being recruited to this task—the site also attracted bots that would pull questions from Reddit threads onto Quora pages. They weren’t the type of questions the Quora community was looking for. “You would have people creating bots with templates of ‘What are the best places to eat at,’ and then it would put in city names, state, country names,” Williams said. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quora/comments/gb495s/bots_asking_the_questions/">Redditors on r/Quora</a> began to notice and complain about this practice.)</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re736001w3b6y7slbzmw4@published">“The quality of the writing had taken a back seat to a pure volume of traffic,” said <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Bethann-Siviter">Bethann Siviter</a>, another former Top Writer. “With the partner program, it became clear that quantity meant more than quality. You could report people over and over, and nothing happened.” Even though the partner program <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-hard-truth-about-the-new-quora-partner-program-5e3229ae83c5">didn’t earn participants</a> all that much money (maybe a few thousand dollars at most), the people who made bots soon learned that this was the easiest way to cash in quickly.</p>

  <p data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re754001x3b6y8hy1lv83@published">This was all downstream of the fact that Quora was also slow to monetize, and it didn’t help that the site, popular as it was, was aiming for pieces of the same digital-advertising pie that <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/journalists-facebook-google-advertising-monopoly-attack-destroy.html">was rapidly overtaken</a> by Facebook and Amazon (as well as its No. 1 traffic referrer, Google). Investors hesitated to <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18627157/quora-value-billion-question-answer">continue pouring cash</a> into Quora in light of its steep expenses. So, the company slashed budgets, shrinking the moderation teams, the customer support apparatus, and the Top Writer initiative. Other originating features—the requirement that Quorans use their real names, “<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Quora-remove-the-suggest-edit-to-an-answer-function-as-of-February-2021">Suggested Edits</a>” that readers could propose for answers that had mistakes or typos—were also cut. All these choices led to more unchecked spam and a <a href="https://communismisracistandacancertowethepeople.quora.com/?q=Democrats%20are%20a%20cancer">deluge of trolls</a>, which volunteer users could not hold off on their own.</p>

  


  


  


  


  
  <p data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re76y001y3b6ydb8ixg26@published"><a href="https://4horsemenpublications.com/our-authors/nelson-mckeeby/">Nelson McKeeby</a>, an author who joined Quora in 2013, said that things got worse in a post-Gamergate internet, with alt-right, Trump-loving trolls invading online forums, aided by anonymity and weakened moderation. “When real users tried to take down demonstrably false answers, troll farms with multiple servers were able to overpower users,” he wrote to me in an email. Further, as Quora launched “Spaces”—basically, private user–run community blogs—problems with moderation continued to spiral, with <a href="https://itsoktobewhite.quora.com/">ugly ideologies running rampant</a>. Loyal Quora users attempted to report <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Hafetz/You-cant-transition-that-impossible-youre-a-cross-dresser-passing-as-female-with-a-5-Oclock-shadow-and-dick-https-w">bigoted</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-matter-if-I-see-myself-as-a-woman-and-live-as-a-women-using-hormones-and-surgery-Does-it-affect-you-as-I-am-a-transgender-woman/answer/Robert-Hafetz">transphobic</a>, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-knotted">obscene</a> content without adequate support from the company.</p>

  <p data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re78x001z3b6ynm8kezc3@published">And then came A.I. As the spamming bots got even worse, Quora changed the terms of service and did away with BNBR, then automated the moderation process. Needless to say, it did not improve the situation on the site. Nor did the integrated A.I. chatbots offer good questions or answers. Instead, they “made up some really generic, and oftentimes first-grade-level questions,” wrote user <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-P-Robinson">Steven P. Robinson</a> in an email. “It is a good example of A.I. not being ready for prime time.” Now Quora is even offering A.I.–generated images to accompany users’ answers, even though the spanwed illustrations make little sense.</p>

  <p data-word-count="186" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7ay00203b6yk7zul4s4@published">To top it all off, after Quora began using A.I. to “<a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/15204996933780">generate machine answers</a> on a number of selected question pages,” the site made clear the possibility that human-crafted answers could be used for training A.I. This meant that the detailed writing Quorans provided mostly for free would be ingested into a custom large language model. Updated terms of service and privacy policies went into effect at the site last summer. As angel investor and Quoran <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dirtiest-fine-print-youve-seen-in-a-contract/answer/David-S-Rose">David S. Rose paraphrased</a> them: “You grant all other Quora users the unlimited right to reuse and adapt your answers,” “You grant Quora the right to use your answers to train an LLM unless you specifically opt out,” and “You completely give up your right to be any part of any class action suit brought against Quora,” among others. (Quora’s <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/15205064557844-Can-I-opt-out-of-having-my-Quora-content-used-to-train-LLMs-">Help Center claims</a> that “as of now, we do not use answers, posts, or comments added to Quora to train LLMs used for generating content on Quora. However, this may change in the future.” The site offers an opt-out setting, although it admits that “opting out does not cover everything.”)</p>

  


  


  

  <p data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7d300213b6ythekz333@published">This raised the issue of consent and ownership, as Quorans had to decide whether to consent to the new terms or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quora/comments/12p8vbl/are_people_still_using_quora/">take their work and flee.</a> High-profile users, like fantasy author Mercedes R. Lackey, are removing their work from their profiles and <a href="https://mercedesrlackeyspace.quora.com/Looks-like-I-m-going-to-be-leaving-Quora-gradually-over-the-next-several-weeks-or-months-as-I-slowly-work-my-way-through">writing notes explaining why</a>. “The A.I. thing, the terms of service issue, has been a massive drain of top talent on Quora, just based on how many people have said, <em>Downloaded my stuff and I’m out of there</em>,” Lackey told me. It’s not that all Quorans <em>want</em> to leave, but it’s hard for them to choose to remain on a website where they now have to constantly fight off errors, spam, trolls, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephanie-Martin-641/">even</a> <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephanie-Martin-639/activity">account</a> <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Stephanie-Martin-638">impersonators</a>.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7er00223b6yf1gjgbj2@published">Quora is far from the only digital community to face an existential battle for its identity in the age of A.I.—<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/06/reddit-protests-steve-huffman-api-chaos.html">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/18/why-is-google-search-so-bad-spam-links-seo-ai-algorithm/">Google</a> are facing related, if slightly distinct, concerns. The tragedy of Quora is not just that it crushed the flourishing communities it once built up. It’s that it took all of that goodwill, community, expertise, and curiosity and assumed that it could automate a system that equated it, apparently without much thought to how pale the comparison is.</p>

  <p data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cls3re7gh00233b6yzrfzgx98@published">McKeeby has a grim prediction for the future: “Eventually Quora will be robot questions, robot answers, and nothing else.” I wonder how the site will answer the question of why Quora died, if anyone even bothers to <span>ask.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>In an exciting new initiative to foster transparency and engagement with its community, Thunderbird has launched a monthly development digest. The first edition is already bringing thrilling news. Let’s dive into what’s in store.</p>



<h2 id="h-revamping-the-global-message-database">Revamping the Global Message Database</h2>



<p>Thunderbird’s significant focus in 2024 will be overhauling its Global Message Database, which is currently based on the outdated Mork framework. This is crucial for eliminating existing limitations and paving the way for modern functionalities, such as genuine threaded conversation views.</p>



<p>The team is deep into replacing this core component, which is pivotal in Thunderbird’s message and folder interaction.</p>



<h2>Rust and Exchange Support</h2>



<p>Finally! After many, many, many years of anticipation, there’s a thrilling development that could propel Thunderbird to new heights and attract countless new users, rejuvenating its well-deserved reputation as a top-tier email client.</p>



<p>Get ready for it: Thunderbird is on the verge of introducing native support for Microsoft Exchange! This is a game-changer and a much-awaited feature that’s sure to delight many. But even more interesting is how it will be achieved.</p>



<p>In a landmark development, Thunderbird has enabled the use of Rust, facilitating the native support for the Exchange protocol. This major leap involves building and vendoring a Rust crate, which, upon completion and stabilization, will be shared publicly on GitHub.</p>



<p>This is a large-scale project, and detailed updates are expected to be shared soon on the tb-planning and tb-developers mailing lists.</p>



<h2>The Final Sprint for Cards View</h2>



<p>Users of Thunderbird’s Daily or Beta versions may have noticed significant changes in the Cards View. The development team is now in the final sprint, focusing on polishing this feature and integrating additional functionalities.</p>



<p>For more information, check out the <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/01/thunderbird-monthly-development-digest-january-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a>. If you’re curious about what Thunderbird has in store for 2024, you can find detailed information about the desktop client <a href="https://developer.thunderbird.net/planning/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. The roadmap for the Android version can be found <a href="https://developer.thunderbird.net/planning/android-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<section><p>A new generation of observatories is enabling detailed study of exoplanetary atmospheres and the diversity of alien climates, allowing us to seek evidence for extraterrestrial biological and geological processes. Now is therefore the time to identify the most unique planets to be characterized with these instruments. In this context, we report on the discovery and validation of TOI-715 b, a <span>|$R_{\rm b}=1.55\pm 0.06\rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> planet orbiting its nearby (42 pc) M4 host (TOI-715/TIC 271971130) with a period <span>|$P_{\rm b} = 19.288004_{-0.000024}^{+0.000027}$|</span> d. TOI-715 b was first identified by <em>TESS</em> and validated using ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging and statistical validation. The planet’s orbital period combined with the stellar effective temperature <span>|$T_{\rm eff}=3075\pm 75~\rm K$|</span> give this planet an installation <span>|$S_{\rm b} = 0.67_{-0.20}^{+0.15}~\rm S_\oplus$|⁠</span>, placing it within the most conservative definitions of the habitable zone for rocky planets. TOI-715 b’s radius falls exactly between two measured locations of the M-dwarf radius valley; characterizing its mass and composition will help understand the true nature of the radius valley for low-mass stars. We demonstrate TOI-715 b is amenable for characterization using precise radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy. Additionally, we reveal a second candidate planet in the system, TIC 271971130.02, with a potential orbital period of <span>|$P_{02} = 25.60712_{-0.00036}^{+0.00031}$|</span> d and a radius of <span>|$R_{02} = 1.066\pm 0.092\, \rm R_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>, just inside the outer boundary of the habitable zone, and near a 4:3 orbital period commensurability. Should this second planet be confirmed, it would represent the smallest habitable zone planet discovered by <em>TESS</em> to date.</p></section>

<p>At long last the era of <em>JWST</em> has arrived, and with it the age of detailed exoplanetary atmospheric characterization (The <em>JWST</em> Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team <span id="jumplink-bib173"></span>2023). This achievement was unlocked just as the community hit another significant milestone: the discovery of the 5000th planet beyond the solar system.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn1"></span>1</sup> This ever-growing sample combined with the might of <em>JWST</em> is now set to deepen our understanding of planets, including those in our solar system, on a sub-population level.</p><p>One sub-population of particularly enduring interest consists of small, potentially habitable planets orbiting cool M-type stars. With current instrumentation, M dwarfs represent our best hope of finding temperate terrestrial planets, the best example being the seven Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an M8V type star (Gillon et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib64"></span>2017). The reduced radii of M dwarfs enable small planets to produce large transit depths; this combined with the shorter orbital periods of these more compact systems makes photometric monitoring from ground and space-based facilities considerably more feasible (e.g. Nutzman&nbsp;&amp; Charbonneau <span id="jumplink-bib129"></span>2008; Reiners et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib143"></span>2018; Sebastian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib156"></span>2021; Triaud <span id="jumplink-bib178"></span>2021). In the context of atmospheric characterization by transmission spectroscopy, bright, nearby M dwarfs are ideal planetary hosts as small temperate planets will transit frequently, enabling high signal-to-noise detections of atmospheric features with fewer hours of telescope time (Charbonneau&nbsp;&amp; Deming <span id="jumplink-bib22"></span>2007; Dressing&nbsp;&amp; Charbonneau <span id="jumplink-bib46"></span>2015; Morley et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib121"></span>2017). Additionally, these low mass stars appear more likely to host small planets from a theoretical and observational point of view (Montgomery&nbsp;&amp; Laughlin <span id="jumplink-bib120"></span>2009; Bonfils et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib13"></span>2013; Dressing&nbsp;&amp; Charbonneau <span id="jumplink-bib45"></span>2013; Mulders, Pascucci&nbsp;&amp; Apai <span id="jumplink-bib124"></span>2015; Alibert&nbsp;&amp; Benz <span id="jumplink-bib3"></span>2017; He, Triaud&nbsp;&amp; Gillon <span id="jumplink-bib73"></span>2017; Sabotta et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib149"></span>2021).</p><p>The so-called ‘habitable zone’ is a circumstellar region where an Earth-like planet could sustain liquid water on its surface (Kasting, Whitmire&nbsp;&amp; Reynolds <span id="jumplink-bib87"></span>1993). With sometimes contradictory definitions of its boundaries, which depend on stellar spectral type, planetary albedo, mass and even cloud cover (Underwood, Jones&nbsp;&amp; Sleep <span id="jumplink-bib182"></span>2003; Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib94"></span>2014; Ramirez&nbsp;&amp; Kaltenegger <span id="jumplink-bib141"></span>2016), it can be challenging to categorise planets using this metric. However, the most widely applicable and conservative definition comes from Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib93"></span>2013), stating that rocky planets receiving between <span>|$0.42\,\mathrm{ and}\,0.842\, S_{\oplus }$|</span> are in their star’s HZ, irrespective of all other factors.</p><p>The activity of the M-dwarf host stars themselves is an additional factor to consider in the habitability of planets orbiting M dwarfs, as the effect of their frequent flaring is not fully known (O’Malley-James&nbsp;&amp; Kaltenegger <span id="jumplink-bib130"></span>2017). Stellar flares could destroy a nascent atmosphere entirely (Davenport et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib36"></span>2016; Dong et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib41"></span>2017), or they might provide the energy needed to catalyse biological processes (Buccino, Lemarchand&nbsp;&amp; Mauas <span id="jumplink-bib18"></span>2007; Patel et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib136"></span>2015; Lingam&nbsp;&amp; Loeb <span id="jumplink-bib105"></span>2017; Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib147"></span>2018). Additionally, we must look beyond our own terrestrial version of habitability, by exploring the possibility that biology might arise on water-worlds (Madhusudhan, Piette&nbsp;&amp; Constantinou <span id="jumplink-bib111"></span>2021) or temperate sub-Neptunes (Seager et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib155"></span>2021), as both of these may have different HZ boundaries.</p><p>We owe much of our current understanding of exoplanetary demographics to the <em>Kepler</em> mission (Borucki et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib15"></span>2010), and one of the most influential results to come out of statistical studies of the <em>Kepler</em> sample was the bimodal radius distribution of sub-Neptune sized planets, with a gap between <span>|$1.5\,\mathrm{ and}\,2\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> (Fulton et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>2017; Van Eylen et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib184"></span>2018). The current best explanations for this bimodality are core-powered mass loss (Lopez&nbsp;&amp; Fortney <span id="jumplink-bib106"></span>2013; Ginzburg, Schlichting&nbsp;&amp; Sari <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>2018; Gupta&nbsp;&amp; Schlichting <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>2019), photo-evaporation (Owen&nbsp;&amp; Wu <span id="jumplink-bib133"></span>2013, <span id="jumplink-bib134"></span>2017) and volatile-poor formation (Lee, Chiang&nbsp;&amp; Ormel <span id="jumplink-bib97"></span>2014; Venturini&nbsp;&amp; Helled <span id="jumplink-bib186"></span>2017). While the exact location of this so-called ‘radius valley’ depends on stellar mass among other things (Wu <span id="jumplink-bib190"></span>2019; Gupta&nbsp;&amp; Schlichting <span id="jumplink-bib71"></span>2020), it is still unclear whether it is present around M dwarfs or not (Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou <span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020). Therefore, planets with sizes within the radius valley (e.g. Cloutier et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib26"></span>2020, <span id="jumplink-bib27"></span>2021; Luque et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib109"></span>2022) help us to understand the shape and depth of this gap around M dwarfs. A recent study by Luque&nbsp;&amp; Pallé (<span id="jumplink-bib108"></span>2022), however, indicates that M-dwarf planets may have a density gap rather than a radius gap separating two populations of small planets (rocky and water worlds), and that these observations are also well explained by formation pathways that include disc-driven migration (Venturini et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib187"></span>2020).</p><p>At present <em>TESS</em> (Ricker et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib145"></span>2015) is providing the community with ample new planets to improve our understanding of exoplanetary demographics, including by populating the habitable zone. Notably, while several ‘habitable zone’ planets discovered by <em>TESS</em> have been confirmed (e.g. Gilbert et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib62"></span>2020; Vach et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib183"></span>2022), none yet have fallen within the conservative habitable zone as described by Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib93"></span>2013) – until now.</p><p>In this context, we report on the discovery of TOI-715 b, a small planet orbiting a nearby M4 star (TOI-715/TIC 271971130). The planet’s relatively long orbital period and cool host provide it with a mild installation, placing TOI-715 b comfortably within its star’s conservative habitable zone. We additionally find a second candidate in the system that, if confirmed, could be <em>TESS</em>’s smallest habitable zone planet discovered to date.</p><p>Our paper is organised as follows: we begin by characterizing the host star using its spectral energy distribution and reconnaissance spectroscopy in Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec2"></span><a href="#sec2">2</a>.

<p>TOI-715 (TIC 271971130) is a nearby (<span>⁠|$\rm 42\, pc$|⁠</span>; Bailer-Jones et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib10"></span>2021) M dwarf of spectral type M4. It is a high-proper-motion target with right ascension 07:35:24.56 hms and declination −73:34:38.67 dms (J2000, epoch 2015.5), placing it within <em>TESS</em>’s continuous viewing zone (CVZ).

<p>We collected an optical spectrum of TOI-715 on 2022 January 7 (<span>ut</span>) using the Low Dispersion Survey Spectrograph on the 6.5-m <em>Magellan</em><span>ii</span> (Clay) Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. With its upgraded red-sensitive CCD (Stevenson et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib167"></span>2016), this instrument is now known as ‘LDSS-3C’. We used LDSS-3C in long-slit mode with the standard setup (fast readout speed, low gain, and 1&nbsp;×&nbsp;1 binning) and the VPH-Red grism, OG-590 blocking filter, and the 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>75&nbsp;×&nbsp;0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime}}$|</span>4 center slit. This setup provides spectra covering 6000–10 000 Å with a resolution of <em>R</em> ∼ 1810, which is insufficient to produce a notable constraint on <em>v</em>sin <em>i</em><sub>⋆</sub>.</p><p>We observed TOI-715 during clear conditions with seeing of 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>5. We collected six exposures of 300 s each, totaling 30 min on-source, at an average airmass of 1.445. Afterwards, we collected three 1-s exposures of the nearby F8 V standard star HR 2283 (Maiolino, Rieke&nbsp;&amp; Rieke <span id="jumplink-bib113"></span>1996) at an average airmass of 1.360. At each pointing, we collected a 1-s HeNeAr arc lamp exposure and three, 10-s flat fields with the ‘quartz high’ lamp. We reduced the data with a custom, <span>python</span>-based pipeline, which includes bias removal, flat field correction, and spectral extraction. For wavelength calibration, the HeNeAr arc exposure was used, which was extracted similarly to the science spectrum. For flux calibration, we used the ratio of the spectrum of the flux standard HR 2283 with an F8 V template from Pickles (<span id="jumplink-bib138"></span>1998) to compute a relative flux correction; no correction was made to address telluric absorption. The final science spectrum has a maximum SNR per resolution element of 193 at 9202 Å and a mean SNR per resolution element of 124 in the 6000–10 000 Å range.</p><p>The reduced spectrum (Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig1"></span>1) was analysed using <span>kastredux</span>.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn2"></span>2</sup> We compared the spectrum to Sloan Digital Sky Survey templates from Kesseli et&nbsp;al.

This classification was verified through spectral classification indices from Reid, Hawley&nbsp;&amp; Gizis (<span id="jumplink-bib142"></span>1995), Lépine, Rich&nbsp;&amp; Shara (<span id="jumplink-bib98"></span>2003), and Riddick, Roche&nbsp;&amp; Lucas (<span id="jumplink-bib146"></span>2007), all of which measure consistent spectral classifications of M4.

<p>The lack of detectable H α emission in its optical spectrum, and absence of any significant flaring activity in its <em>TESS</em> light curve, both suggest a relatively old age for TOI-715 given the persistent emission of most mid-type M dwarfs (Newton et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib127"></span>2017; Kiman et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib90"></span>2019). We estimated the age of TOI-715 by comparing its <em>UVW</em> velocities and metallicity to local stars with previously determined ages from isochrone fitting and metallicities from high resolution spectroscopy (cf. Burgasser&nbsp;&amp; Mamajek <span id="jumplink-bib21"></span>2017; Delrez et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>2022). Our comparison sample was drawn from the GALAH Data Release 3 catalogue (Buder et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib19"></span>2021), for which ages are estimated using the Bayesian Stellar Parameter Estimation (<span>bstep</span>) code (Sharma et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib158"></span>2018). A matched GALAH sample was selected by requiring a distance ≤200&nbsp;pc, and agreement with TOI-715 in individual <em>UVW</em> velocities to within 10&nbsp;km s<sup>−1</sup> and metallicity to within 0.20 dex. The age distributions of the full GALAH sample and matched stars are shown in Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig3"></span>3. The latter shows a broad peak with a maximum probability at 7&nbsp;Gyr; the median age of the distribution and 25 and 75 &nbsp;per cent quantiles yields an age estimate of 6.6<span>|$^{+3.2}_{-2.2}$|</span> Gyr. TOI-715 is likely to be as old or older than the Sun, consistent with its low degree of magnetic activity.</p>                    <div data-id="fig3" data-content-id="fig3" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Figure 3.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/mnras/527/1/10.1093_mnras_stad1439/1/m_stad1439fig3.jpeg?Expires=1709837503&amp;Signature=loxMFP84pwNwsPeT~JC6l8KjRq8C38PyR5pxSvCA315IA9h87WtOEggVmcPPganlLvbnd~WlXkwcahgji30~NAkSS47E1O5Pa4cPX8uyOQ6GHDR6cGM8IlJNdOYzLHnv6y~dydgv0r8R2KxYovxikF27j1u3fTZKSZJGzpwsfnBzv~IWTzIHEfrZ3NT2BRwaU88LTSw5o3oULxP5MQnSYKkRaD4be8fBgmL1O03fdj7FicEuefgBK6VKgiBY0lzmI-pa7Et6w7fKCkbFjh9DNj5YorOyUnX0k7lGn6~agpb~tqj8AddT1Pz5MTaB2Oe5KPf9eJxgmYq8LtpKZbSYEg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Distribution of ages for all sources in GALAH Data Release 3 (light grey histogram) and those GALAH sources that match the UVW velocities and metallicity of TOI-715.

This range falls within the detectable period range for the full <em>TESS</em> data set; however, the absence of detectable H α emission suggests a lack of significant spotting, so even if the period were within this range <em>TESS</em> measurements may not be sufficient to detect variability.

<p>We make use of the custom pipeline <span>sherlock<sup><span id="jumplink-fn7"></span>7</sup></span>, presented in Pozuelos et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib140"></span>2020) and Demory et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib39"></span>2020), to search the <em>TESS</em> data for additional transiting candidates, as was done in Dransfield et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib43"></span>2022a). <span>sherlock</span> downloads all light curves from MAST and, using <span>Wotan</span> (Hippke et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib75"></span>2019), applies a bi-weight function with varying window sizes to detrend the data. Each detrended light curve and the original PDCSAP light curve are then searched for transit-like signals using <span>Transit Least Squares</span> (Hippke&nbsp;&amp; Heller <span id="jumplink-bib74"></span>2019). We use only the 2-min cadence in our candidate search, applying a Savitzky–Golay (SG) digital filter (Savitzky&nbsp;&amp; Golay <span id="jumplink-bib151"></span>1964) previously following the strategy described in Delrez et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib38"></span>2022)<sup><span id="jumplink-fn8"></span>8</sup> and we test 11 window sizes between 0.19 and 1.9&nbsp;d when detrending with the bi-weight filter. We thus carry out our transit search on the PDCSAP light curve and the 11 detrended light curves and only consider signals with SNR &gt; 7 for further investigation.</p><p>We recover TOI-715.01 at a period of <span>|$\rm 19.29\, d$|</span> in the first instance in all 12 light curves, and we find that the highest SNR and SDE are achieved in the PDCSAP flux without any detrending with <span>Wotan</span>.</p><p>We additionally find two other periodic signals in the data. Of these, the signal with highest SNR is at a period of <span>|$\rm 25.61\, d$|⁠</span>, putting it within 0.4 &nbsp;per cent of the first order 4:3 commensurability. The signal is detected in nine of the searched light curves with a maximum SNR of 13.81 and SDE of 11.6; it has a depth of <span>|$\rm \sim \, 1\, ppt$|⁠</span>, making this a <span>|$\rm \sim \, 1.16\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> candidate. In order to ensure this signal is not an artefact produced by the SG filter, we additionally search the untreated PDCSAP light curve and recover the signal with an SNR of 6.81. We adopt this candidate as TIC 271971130.02<sup><span id="jumplink-fn9"></span>9</sup> and highlight the positions of transit events on Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig4"></span>4 with dark green arrows. In Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig5"></span>5, we present the <em>TESS</em> light curve folded on this signal, along with the Lomb–Scargle periodogram.</p>                    <div data-id="fig5" data-content-id="fig5" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Figure 5.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/mnras/527/1/10.1093_mnras_stad1439/1/m_stad1439fig5.jpeg?Expires=1709837503&amp;Signature=tNV8tf3JI~zFkHCblpIYEw6eKV8BmEgXAQH8iRVlW0gnlsURsjOUbyKqjtICpIbSc4i6d4MHzAvPRNnk-uwlGbpEv7iNo2p3gYG7FvMZ56B8blHMstgPyBSv2XqF66PLMXcoeOYx93VeuVC1oR8NXnsx6mQRp-ml6Zqx3t9IktlK2rZQuhnnHR5ET-eyayt-qH2FTnjU6KLmLFKp4ldoXJwdw0V-6J-FxQ3JOP4xiXMCyQuqeLVKgrZY31l48574vU3BZzRmylHALUVN4n3i49jfjVoaA4LwLQ5aKIuxsvbL4IQDR8Q1id6kUdRt6nMDgiemvenGeWHGPsxH8Jc7Tw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Results of our search for additional candidates in the data, using Transit Least Squares as implemented by Sherlock.

We note that the errorbars on the binned points are smaller than the markers, and that the light curve shown here is the one treated with the SG Filter.</p></div><p>Given the large amount of data in Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig4"></span>4, it is not apparent by eye how much pre- and post-transit baseline each transit has. We therefore note that the total number of in-transit points for TIC 271971130.02 is 1371, while the total number of points before and after the transits are 1349 and 1369 respectively (counted up to 1 transit duration). Thus on average the pre-transit baseline is 98.4 &nbsp;per cent of a transit duration, while the post-transit baseline is 99.9 &nbsp;per cent.</p><p>The SPOC ran the Data Validation module at the ephemeris for the second signal and obtained an SNR of 5.5σ, and additionally identified other sub-threshold transit-like signals at higher SNR.</p><p>The second signal we recover has a period of <span>|$\rm 7.17\, d$|</span> and a depth of <span>|$\lt 1\, \rm ppt$|⁠</span>; it has a maximum SNR of 9.63 and SDE of 8.17. The very low SNR of the signal makes it challenging to discern by eye whether or not the shape is consistent with that of a planetary transit. We also note that this signal is only found in four of the detrended light curves (with window sizes between 0.38–0.65&nbsp;d, but not the PDCSAP light curve, indicating that the signal could be dependent on detrending. The duration of a transit at this period on a circular orbit is should be of order 0.065&nbsp;d, and all tested windows are at least 3&nbsp;× this duration. We therefore do not believe the detrending will have suppressed the transit in other light curves if it is real. When <em>TESS</em> returns to the southern skies in its second extended mission, the additional photometry will provide further insight into the nature of this signal.</p><p>It is important to note that the SNR and SDE yielded by <span>sherlock</span> are inherited from the <span>transit least squares</span> algorithm, which uses a simple estimation that cannot be compared with values provided by other pipelines, such as SPOC. Instead, these values are used internally in <span>sherlock</span> to compare the signals found and select the most prominent among them.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951100" id="422951100" data-legacy-id="sec4">4 VETTING AND VALIDATION</h2>

<p>Close stellar companions (bound or in the line of sight) can confound derived exoplanet properties in a number of ways. The detected transit signal might be a false positive due to a background eclipsing binary and even real planet discoveries will yield incorrect stellar and exoplanet parameters if a close companion exists and is unaccounted for (e.g. Ciardi et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib24"></span>2015; Furlan&nbsp;&amp; Howell <span id="jumplink-bib54"></span>2017, <span id="jumplink-bib55"></span>2020). Additionally, the presence of a close companion star leads to the non-detection of small planets residing within the same exoplanetary system (Lester et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib101"></span>2021). Approximately 25 &nbsp;per cent of M dwarfs are part of binary or multiple star systems (e.g. Cortes Contreras et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib30"></span>2015; Winters et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib188"></span>2019), though fewer than 5 &nbsp;per cent of known spectroscopic binaries include an M-dwarf primary star (Pourbaix et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib139"></span>2004).<sup><span id="jumplink-fn10"></span>10</sup> None the less, high resolution imaging provides crucial information towards our understanding of exoplanetary formation, dynamics, and evolution (Howell et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib78"></span>2021).</p><p>TOI-715 was observed on 2020 December 26 <span>ut</span> using the Zorro speckle instrument on the Gemini South 8-m telescope (Scott et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib153"></span>2021). Zorro provides simultaneous speckle imaging in two bands (<span>⁠|$562~\rm nm$|</span> and <span>|$832~\rm nm$|⁠</span>) with output data products including a reconstructed image with robust contrast limits on companion detection (see Howell&nbsp;&amp; Furlan <span id="jumplink-bib76"></span>2022). TOI-715 was found to be a single star to within the angular and brightness contrast levels achieved. Eight sets of 1000&nbsp;×&nbsp;0.06 s images were obtained and processed by our standard reduction pipeline (Howell et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib77"></span>2011). Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig6"></span>6 shows our final contrast curves and the <span>|$832~\rm nm$|</span> reconstructed speckle image. These high-resolution observations revealed no companion star brighter than 5 magnitudes below that of the target star from the 8-m telescope diffraction limit (<span>⁠|$20~\rm mas$|⁠</span>) out to 1.2 arcsec. At the distance of TOI-715 (<span>⁠|$42.4~\rm pc$|⁠</span>) these angular limits correspond to spatial limits of 0.84 to <span>|$50.9~\rm au$|⁠</span>.</p>                    <div data-id="fig6" data-content-id="fig6" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Figure 6.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/mnras/527/1/10.1093_mnras_stad1439/1/m_stad1439fig6.jpeg?Expires=1709837503&amp;Signature=pm6AmDShhJbqLyB0apWBuv4gWkYH813Hm82Srzq4iQ5EWqepgyxVOy1kiMFRhWWZMoCkJWymlusQElTehItdgDkTAg5ZcahgDFhnrwTc0wXgqejCLTIFaqCtGPdLi8-H8TFyY9ETE3kdA3JMrD~7K0QjWJdUUNZGUh1Q2slyxB~MlH4HG2unQXHwDAaZFWUrjnEaTqqyq1tuaw2Y773QzGY53jxOwvBOdgQvE5wic7Kk8QaEqCYgTmZnlhK33JjhdIw~MWGI5c1uVFrOL3GDf1xK-AbALZXqqDlWyiRQlkEH3fKTM~rZOcPjSysSbIB4yLLVZs8asd3R~kDF2bPAgw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Plot showing the 5σ speckle imaging contrast curves in both filters as a function of the angular separation out to 1.2 arcsec, the end of speckle coherence.

<p>We used the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescopes (LCOGT; Brown et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib17"></span>2013) 1.0-m network nodes at South Africa Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory to observe three transits of TOI-715.01. First and second transits were observed with LCO-SAAO on 2020 May 13 and 2020 October 15, and third was observed with LCO-CTIO on 2021 April 25. All observations were carried out with the Sloan-<em>i</em>′ and an exposure time of 180 s.</p><p>Photometric brightness was measured using an uncontaminated target aperture of 4.3 arcsec (11 pixels). We used the <span><em>TESS</em> transit Finder</span>, which is a customized version of the <span>Tapir</span> software package (Jensen <span id="jumplink-bib85"></span>2013), to schedule our photometric time series. The 1.0-m telescopes are equipped with 4096&nbsp;×&nbsp;4096 SINISTRO cameras with an image scale of 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>389 per pixel, resulting in a 26 arcmin&nbsp;× 26 arcmin field of view.

<p>The SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) is comprised of four Ritchey-Chrétien 1.0 m-class telescopes installed at ESO Paranal in the Atacama desert (Delrez et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib37"></span>2018). Designed to hunt for small, habitable-zone planets orbiting ultra-cool stars (Sebastian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib156"></span>2021), all four telescopes are equipped with a deep-depletion Andor CCD camera with 2048&nbsp;×&nbsp;2048 13-<span>|$\rm{\mu m}$|</span> pixels. Each telescope therefore has a field of view of <span>|$12\,\mathrm{arcmin} \, \times \, 12\,\mathrm{arcmin}$|</span> and a pixel scale of 0<span>|${_{.}^{\prime\prime}}$|</span>35 (Burdanov et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib20"></span>2018).</p><p>All SPECULOOS observations are scheduled using the <span>python</span> package <span>spock</span>.<sup><span id="jumplink-fn12"></span>12</sup> (Sebastian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib156"></span>2021), and processed in the first instance by an automatic data reduction pipeline, described in detail in Murray et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib125"></span>2020). Successful observations of <em>TESS</em> targets are then reprocessed using <span>prose</span>, a publicly available <span>python</span> framework for processing astronomical images<sup><span id="jumplink-fn13"></span>13</sup> as described in Garcia et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib58"></span>2021, <span id="jumplink-bib59"></span>2022). Images are calibrated and aligned before performing aperture photometry on the 500 brightest sources detected; <span>prose</span> then performs differential photometry (Broeg, Fernández&nbsp;&amp; Neuhäuser <span id="jumplink-bib16"></span>2005) on the target star to extract the light curve. Individual light curves are detrended for airmass, sky background and FWHM (full width at half maximum) using second order polynomials in time, and they are then modelled using <span>exoplanet</span> (Foreman-Mackey et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib51"></span>2021b).</p><p>We observed TOI-715.01 for the first time on the night of 2021 September 26 with all four telescopes simultaneously (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) using the <em>Sloan-r′</em> filter and <span>|$\rm 120$|</span>-s exposures. Cloudy skies during the transit caused some large systematics in three out of four telescopes, although this did not prevent the transit from being detected.

<p>ExTrA (Bonfils et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib14"></span>2015) is a near-infrared (0.85–1.55 <span>|$\rm \,\mu m$|⁠</span>) multi-object spectrograph fed by three 0.6 m telescopes located at La Silla observatory. We observed four full transits of TOI 715.01 on 2021 February 26, 2021 April 25, 2022 February 8, and 2022 April 7. We observed the first three transits using two telescopes, and the fourth using three; all observations were carried out with 8 arcsec aperture fibers. For both nights, we used the spectrograph’s low resolution mode (<em>R</em> ∼ 20) and 60s exposures. Five fibre positioners are used at the focal plane of each telescope to collect light from the target and four comparison stars. As comparison stars, we also observed 2MASS J07381369−7347351, 2MASS J07410628−7341297, 2MASS J07393394−7330535, and 2MASS J07372328−7321411 with <em>J</em>-magnitude (Skrutskie et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib159"></span>2006) and <em>T</em><sub>eff</sub> (Gaia Collaboration <span id="jumplink-bib57"></span>2021) similar to TOI-715.

<p>We make use of the statistical validation package <span>triceratops</span><sup><span id="jumplink-fn14"></span>14</sup> (Giacalone&nbsp;&amp; Dressing <span id="jumplink-bib60"></span>2020; Giacalone et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib61"></span>2021) to assess the probability of the planet hypothesis for TOI-715.01 and TIC 271971130.02. <span>Triceratops</span> calculates the flux contribution from nearby stars to check if any could be responsible for the transit signal. It then calculates the relative probabilities of a range of transiting planet (TP) and eclipsing binary (EB) scenarios using light curve models fitted to the phase-folded photometry. In the first instance we find that the false positive probabilities (FPP) are 0.403 and 0.592 for candidates .01 and .02, respectively when examining the <em>TESS</em> data, while the threshold for validation is 0.015. For candidate .01, we make use of our follow-up photometry by folding in the four TRAPPIST-South light curves. We choose these as they were observed with the custom <em>I&nbsp;+&nbsp;z’</em> filter (which is very similar to the <em>TESS</em> bandpass) and all four are at different epochs.</p><p>With this phase-folded subset of our follow-up photometry, we find that the false positive probability reduces to 0.0107, placing it below the threshold for statistical validation.

To allow the colour-dependent transit depth to be a free parameter in our models, we also fit each light curve for a dilution parameter (<em>D</em>) which we give a uniform prior between −1 and 1. We fix the dilution of the <em>TESS</em> observations at 0 as the PDCSAP light curve is already corrected for crowding (Stumpe et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib168"></span>2012), and use the transit depth as the reference depth; we then use <span>Allesfitter</span>’s ‘<span>|$\rm coupled\_with$|</span>’ functionality to ensure that the dilution and quadratic limb-darkening coefficients are fitted together for all observations taken in the same photometric band.</p><p>We use the <span>python</span> package <span>PyLDTK</span> (Parviainen&nbsp;&amp; Aigrain <span id="jumplink-bib135"></span>2015) and the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere library (Husser et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib79"></span>2013) to calculate quadratic limb-darkening coefficients for each photometric band. These are also adopted as normal priors in our models after we reparameterise them in the Kipping (<span id="jumplink-bib91"></span>2013) parametrization by converting from <em>u</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>u</em><sub>2</sub> to <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Finally, due to the complex instrument systematics present in the data obtained with the ExTrA telescopes, we model the correlated ‘red’ noise in these observations using a GP. We select the <em>Matérn 3/2</em> kernel as implemented by <span>Celerite</span> due to its versatility and its ability to model both long and short term trends. We fit for two GP hyperparameters for each ExTrA telescope: the amplitude scale, σ, and the length scale, ρ. We place wide uniform priors on these terms. For all other telescopes, we make use of a hybrid spline to model the baseline. <span>Allesfitter</span> also fits an ‘error scaling’ term to account for white noise in the data.</p><p>The initial fits (1-planet circular, and 1-planet eccentric) both confirm that TOI-715 b is a <span>|$\rm 1.550\pm 0.061\, \rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> planet with an equilibrium temperature of <span>|$\rm 234\pm 12\, \rm K$|⁠</span>.

We test two further models to seek evidence of a second planet in the system, starting by fixing the linear ephemerides of planet b and allowing the mid-time of each individual transit to vary. This model is motivated by the second candidate’s proximity to a 1<sup>st</sup> order 4:3 mean-motion resonance with the first planet. If the second candidate is real, we might expect for these planets to experience mutual gravitational interactions exciting transit timing variations (TTVs).</p><p>We place a wide uniform prior on each transit mid-time, corresponding to the linear predicted mid-time <span>|$\pm \, 60$|</span> min. We find that due to the low SNR of individual transits in the <em>TESS</em> data, the transit mid-times are not well constrained for events observed only by <em>TESS</em>. However, transits observed simultaneously by several ground-based observatories have significantly less scatter and smaller error bars. In these events, we see evidence suggesting TTVs of up to 5 min, although the Bayesian evidence for this model is lower than for the two linear models tested. Models with linear ephemerides are preferred, with Bayes Factors of ∼9.5 and ∼16 for the circular and eccentric models respectively. We note that we did not test a fixed linear ephemerides fit with a 2-planet model as the individual transits in <em>TESS</em> for the second candidate have even lower SNR and we have no ground-based transits at the time of writing.</p><p>The final model we test is a 2-planet circular Keplerian model. We fit for all the same parameters as before, but now additionally include the transit parameters for the second candidate.

<p>TOI-715 is host to at least one planet (TOI-715 b), with <span>|$R_{\rm b}= \rm 1.550\pm 0.064\, R_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>, receiving an installation <span>|$S_{\rm b} = \rm 0.67_{-0.20}^{+0.15}\, S_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>, which places it within the ‘conservative habitable zone’ defined by Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib93"></span>2013) as the circumstellar region where a rocky planet receives and installation flux of <span>|$0.42-0.842\, S_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>. Our model suggests that there is also a possibly second, smaller planet in the system, with size <span>|$R_{02} = 1.066\pm 0.092 ~\rm R_\oplus$|⁠</span>, just within the outer edge of the host’s habitable zone, at an installation <span>|$S_{\rm 02} = \rm 0.48_{-0.17}^{+0.12}\, S_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>.</p><p>Expectation of planet yield by <em>TESS</em> prior to launch showed <em>TESS</em> would detect of order 70&nbsp;±&nbsp;9 Earth-sized planets (<span>⁠|$\lt 1.25 ~\rm R_\oplus$|⁠</span>) and 14&nbsp;±&nbsp;4 conservative ‘habitable zone’ planets <span>|$\lt 2~\rm R_\oplus$|</span> (as in Kopparapu et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib93"></span>2013), but that <em>TESS</em> would identify of order 0 Earth-sized (<span>⁠|$\lt 1.25 ~\rm R_\oplus$|⁠</span>) ‘conservative habitable zone planets’ (Sullivan et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib171"></span>2015). More recent yield estimates (post-launch) by Kunimoto et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib96"></span>2022) appear more pessimistic, however, finding only 5&nbsp;±&nbsp;2 ‘conservative habitable zone planets’ <span>|$\lt 2~\rm R_\oplus$|</span> would be detected within the primary mission and first extended mission of <em>TESS</em>, a factor nearly three times lower than Sullivan et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib171"></span>2015).

We begin by revisiting the radius valley to understand what can be learned about the mass of TOI-715 b from current mass–radius relations. We then explore the prospects for a precise mass measurement of this planet with current spectroscopic instrumentation, followed by a discussion of the potential for atmospheric characterization with <em>HST</em> and <em>JWST</em>.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951152" id="422951152" data-legacy-id="sec6-1">6.1 TOI-715 b and the radius valley</h3>
<p>The radius valley, as identified in the <em>Kepler</em> sample by Fulton et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib53"></span>2017), shows a lack of close-in (<span>⁠|$P\lt 100~\rm d$|⁠</span>) planets with sizes between <span>|$1.5-2~\rm R_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>; TOI-715 b’s <span>|$1.55~\rm R_\oplus$|</span> appears just inside this underpopulated region of parameter space. The importance of the radius valley lies in its potential to teach us about planetary formation and post-formation evolution (e.g. Owen&nbsp;&amp; Wu <span id="jumplink-bib134"></span>2017; Ginzburg et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib65"></span>2018; Venturini et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib187"></span>2020), and hence planets inside this gap are crucial in furthering our understanding of the factors that sculpt it.</p><p>The location and slope of the radius valley has been shown to depend on the properties of the host star (e.g. Fulton&nbsp;&amp; Petigura <span id="jumplink-bib52"></span>2018; Gupta&nbsp;&amp; Schlichting <span id="jumplink-bib70"></span>2019; Berger et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib12"></span>2020), and Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020) and Van Eylen et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib185"></span>2021) recently re-examined this for low-mass stars. Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020) looked at the small, close-in planet distribution around stars cooler than <span>|$4700\, \rm K$|</span> and found that the slope is opposite in sign compared with FGK stars, and also that the peaks of the planet radius distributions are shifted toward smaller planets. According to this, the center of the radius valley also shifts towards smaller radii. The sample examined in this study contained planets discovered by <em>Kepler</em> and <em>K2</em>, and was corrected for completeness. This work states that planets falling between their measured radius valley and the one measured by Martinez et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib116"></span>2019) for Sun-like stars are so-called ‘keystone planets’, crucial for further understanding the radius valley around low-mass stars. By this metric TOI-715 b’s radius of <span>|$\rm 1.55\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> is just below the boundary of <span>|$\rm 1.66\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> for a period of 19.288&nbsp;d, falling within the super-Earth category.</p><p>Van Eylen et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib185"></span>2021), however, used a significantly smaller sample, restricted to confirmed and well-characterized planets, with masses and radii measured to at least 20&nbsp;per cent precision, orbiting stars cooler than 4000 K. They found a slope in radius-period space opposite in sign compared with Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020), and therefore consistent in sign with FGK stars as measured by, for instance, Martinez et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib116"></span>2019). They do, however, find that the valley shifts towards smaller radii for later spectral types. Contrary to the work of Cloutier&nbsp;&amp; Menou (<span id="jumplink-bib25"></span>2020), the functional form of the radius valley derived in this study places TOI-715 b above the radius valley and with the population of sub-Neptunes.</p><p>In Fig. <span id="jumplink-fig11"></span>11 we present the current sample of exoplanets orbiting stars cooler than <span>|$T_\mathrm{eff}\, =\, 4000\, \rm K$|</span> with planetary radii measured to better than 10 &nbsp;per cent precision<sup><span id="jumplink-fn15"></span>15</sup> in radius-period space.

What is evident is that precise characterization of planets such as TOI-715 b that fall <em>between</em> the various definitions of the low-mass star radius valley is essential to understand whether or not this bimodality will eventually be borne out by the data.</p>                    <div data-id="fig11" data-content-id="fig11" swap-content-for-modal="true"><p>Figure 11.</p><div><p><img src="https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/mnras/527/1/10.1093_mnras_stad1439/1/m_stad1439fig11.jpeg?Expires=1709837503&amp;Signature=T4rTMM2q-ynuQ-ul9GKejC10NuymqfBpBHOuvo0fYUfhUksmXfaM7bPOCpl0hXjbp2~6ZV~X0adFGBCOG0BFdEVTxfUu-kU8yx3DxTJI10o3aOuN-Pz6YoylqlxrODPqEU5qwZruEP98qkpL~tP-dgyrY4bPXwQH2NO0bPFWPGWfnaDmajzezmXTTZQTYc8yl3YCC0bDYUUgAdS2VBlZJAYd0iIYGvOVCyuNsoe~JzCFpKZ7VPDnNPOtbpzHA3VOUuiXxL8gw5HdE1fUCMBQ-JXUx8Glt9~2-C~vFB1rX2TyL811dUs0Gd4BJSeiJPSAeAHnn-4xdkTxQd0q3UOK5Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA" alt="Plot of the current sample of planets orbiting hosts cooler than 4000 K in radius-period space.

<p>Luque&nbsp;&amp; Pallé (<span id="jumplink-bib108"></span>2022) recently demonstrated using a sample of planets with precisely measured radii (to at least &lt;8&nbsp;per cent) and masses (to at least &lt;25&nbsp;per cent) that small planets orbiting low-mass stars in fact likely have a density gap rather than a radius valley. The results of that study indicate that small planets come in three flavours: rocky, water-worlds and gassy. For planets smaller than <span>|$2\, \rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> they find a clear bi-modality in density which allow us to estimate the mass of TOI-715 b in both the rocky (<span>⁠|$\rm \sim \, 7M_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>) and water-world (<span>⁠|$\rm \sim \, 2M_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>) scenarios; both different from the Chen&nbsp;&amp; Kipping (<span id="jumplink-bib23"></span>2017) estimate of <span>|$\rm \sim \, 3.5M_{\oplus }$|</span> and the rocky and volatile-rich predictions from Otegi, Bouchy&nbsp;&amp; Helled (<span id="jumplink-bib132"></span>2020) (<span>⁠|$\rm \sim \, 4.1M_{\oplus }$|</span> and <span>|$\rm \sim \, 3.5M_{\oplus }$|</span> respectively). While this result is very promising for our understanding of the composition of small planets around low-mass stars, their sample contained only 34 planets; therefore continued systematic characterization of these systems with consistent sample selection criteria remains crucial to understand this distribution and ultimately the composition of planets around M dwarfs.</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951160" id="422951160" data-legacy-id="sec6-3">6.3 Prospects for a mass measurement of TOI-715 b</h3>
<p>Given the faintness of TOI-715, the only southern hemisphere instrument currently capable of the precision required to measure the mass of planet b is ESPRESSO at the VLT (Very Large Telescope Pepe et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib137"></span>2010). If the planet is rocky and has a mass of <span>|$\rm \sim 7\, M_{\oplus }$|⁠</span>, then we calculate a predicted RV semi-amplitude of <span>|$\rm 4.5\, m\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>. From ESPRESSO’s exposure time calculator (ETC) we find that we could achieve a precision of <span>|$\rm 7.4\, m\, s^{-1}$|</span> per measurement, meaning that for a 25&nbsp;per cent precision on the mass of the planet, 44 spectra need to be collected, with <span>|$\rm 1800\, s$|</span> exposures and SNR <span>|$\rm \sim$|</span> 14. For this, we assume that TOI-715 is a relatively slow rotator (<span>⁠|$\rm vsini \lesssim 2\, km\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>) which is not unusual for old M dwarfs that do not show significant stellar activity (Moutou et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib123"></span>2017; Reiners et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib144"></span>2022).</p><p>However the ETC is usually pessimistic. Based on observed radial-velocity precision of mid-M type planet-host stars obtained with ESPRESSO we expect a slightly better performance for this instrument. Observations of Proxima Cen (M5V) resulted in a mean precision of <span>|$\rm 0.6\, m\, s^{-1}$|</span> (Suárez Mascareño et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib170"></span>2020), which is about 40&nbsp;per cent better than the ETC predicts. A similar case is LHS 1140 (M3V), for which a mean precision of <span>|$\rm 0.8\, m\, s^{-1}$|</span> has been achieved (Lillo-Box et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib104"></span>2020), which is a precision twice better than expected. Empirical results<sup><span id="jumplink-fn16"></span>16</sup> for M dwarfs using the MAROON-X spectrograph at Gemini North (Seifahrt et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib157"></span>2020) found a more than 40 &nbsp;per cent increase in precision between M0 and M6 dwarf stars. The ESPRESSO ETC assumes an M2 spectral type to predict the RV precision. Thus, this apparent increase in RV precision for mid-M dwarfs, compared to early M dwarfs can explain the observed difference in performance.</p><p>Since TOI-715 is an M4 dwarf, we can conservatively expect a 20&nbsp;per cent better RV precision compared to the ETC (thus a precision of <span>|$\rm \sim 5.9\, m\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>). This means a 25&nbsp;per cent precision on the mass of the planet can be reached with only <span>|$\rm \sim 30$|</span> spectra (<span>⁠|$\rm 1800\, s$|</span> exposures; SNR ∼ 14). This amounts to 15&nbsp;h of telescope time, which is not unrealistic for a planet of this importance.</p><p>If however, TOI-715 b is in fact a ‘water world’, then a mass of <span>|$\rm \sim 2\, M_{\oplus }$|</span> would produce an RV semi-amplitude of just <span>|$\rm 1.3\, m\, s^{-1}$|⁠</span>. In this case 150&nbsp;h of telescope time are needed to constrain the mass with 25&nbsp;per cent precision. Should the density bi-modality for small planets around M dwarfs suggested by Luque&nbsp;&amp; Pallé (<span id="jumplink-bib108"></span>2022) be confirmed, a non-detection might enable us to infer the planet’s mass.</p><p>In Section&nbsp;<span id="jumplink-sec5"></span><a href="#sec5">5</a>, we found that there were small hints of transit timing variations (TTVs) in the ground-based transits of TOI-715 b. If the second planet is confirmed and the orbits are commensurate, the masses of both planets could be suitable for characterization using dynamical modelling. Given the low SNR of individual transits and the long orbital periods, such a campaign would be well suited to ASTEP (Antarctic Search for Transiting Exoplanets, Daban et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib35"></span>2010; Schmider et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib152"></span>2022), given its convenient Antarctic location (Dransfield et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib44"></span>2022b).</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951166" id="422951166" data-legacy-id="sec6-4">6.4 Prospects for detailed atmospheric characterization of TOI-715 b</h3>
<p>The Transmission Spectroscopy Metric (TSM) as established by Kempton et&nbsp;al. (<span id="jumplink-bib88"></span>2018) is often used to quantify the suitability of planets for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy. We calculate the TSM for TOI-715 b in both mass limits<sup><span id="jumplink-fn17"></span>17</sup> and for TIC 271971130.02, as well as the published sample of planets with <span>|$R_p\, \lt \, 2~\rm R_{\oplus }$|</span> and <span>|$S_p\, \lt \, 1.6~\rm S_{\oplus }$|</span><sup><span id="jumplink-fn18"></span>18</sup> The comparison sample contained 34 planets initially; we then removed the seven planets discovered via radial velocity as these are not known to transit.

We find that in the low-mass case atmospheric features could be detectable with a single <em>JWST</em> transit if the atmosphere is cloudless. In the higher mass case, we find that extracting meaningful features would require at least five transits, also in the cloud-free case. A secondary atmosphere with higher mean molecular mass could suppress the scale height by more than an order of magnitude, in turn making it challenging to detect atmospheric features of these planets (de Wit et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib189"></span>2016).</p><p>In both mass cases, the carbon dioxide feature centered on <span>|$\rm 4.5\, \,\mu m$|⁠</span>, the methane feature at <span>|$\rm 3.3\, \,\mu m$|</span> and multiple water bands are some of the most accessible atmospheric features with the NIRSpec PRISM, the most suitable instrument for <em>JWST</em> follow-up given the similar brightness of TOI-715 compared to TRAPPIST-1. Detection of these features will constrain the metallicity of the putative planetary atmospheres, providing first hints of the carbon-chemistry of the atmosphere itself (Madhusudhan <span id="jumplink-bib110"></span>2012), and insights into their formation history (Öberg, Murray-Clay&nbsp;&amp; Bergin <span id="jumplink-bib131"></span>2011).</p>                    <h3 scrollto-destination="422951172" id="422951172" data-legacy-id="sec6-5">6.5 Flares and habitability</h3>
<p>Both TOI-715 b and the candidate TIC 271971130.02 lie in an interesting location of the parameter space with regard to insolation, radius, and potential rocky composition, naturally posing questions of their habitability. Many recent prebiotic chemistry and astrobiology studies investigated how life may have originated on Earth and other planets (see e.g. Patel et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib136"></span>2015; Airapetian et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib2"></span>2016; Xu et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib191"></span>2018 and reviews by Sutherland <span id="jumplink-bib172"></span>2017; Kitadai&nbsp;&amp; Maruyama <span id="jumplink-bib92"></span>2018). The first processes leading from inorganic compounds towards RNA precursors likely require a liquid solution (e.g. liquid surface water) and an energy source. For the latter, the host star’s flaring may provide the necessary UV radiation (in the 200–280 nm range) to trigger these early steps (e.g. Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib147"></span>2018; Todd et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib177"></span>2018; Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib148"></span>2021).</p><p>On the other hand, stellar activity can also pose a significant danger to exoplanets. Strong stellar winds and XUV outbursts can contribute to atmospheric loss (e.g. Atri&nbsp;&amp; Mogan <span id="jumplink-bib9"></span>2020). Even if the atmosphere prevails, coronal mass ejections (charged particle streams) may interact with and dissociate atmospheric ozone (e.g. Tilley et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib176"></span>2019). Without the major atmospheric absorber of harmful UV radiation, the next flares might sterilize existing surface biology.</p><p>We investigate TOI-715’s 24 sectors of TESS data for signs of stellar flaring. We find an average rate of 7 flares per 100&nbsp;d of observations, with a maximum flare amplitude of 5 per cent in relative flux over nearly 2&nbsp;yr of data. This analysis was performed using the <span>stella</span> neural network (Feinstein et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>2020) and as part of the TESS flare catalog (Günther et&nbsp;al., in preparation), building on (Günther et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>2020). We also compare this flare frequency distribution with the theoretical potential for ozone sterilization (Tilley et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib176"></span>2019) and laboratory thresholds for prebiotic chemistry (Rimmer et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib147"></span>2018). We find that the flaring is likely too rare and not energetic enough to influence either of these effects.</p><p>As TOI-715 is an older star (6.6<span>|$^{+3.2}_{-2.2}$|</span> Gyr), its flaring is likely not as prominent as in younger years, when its planets were forming and prebiotic chemistry steps might have been triggered. Demographic studies of young (&lt;100&nbsp;Myr) and older M dwarfs show that flaring activity decreases with stellar age, likely due to spin-down and a decreasing stellar dynamo (e.g. Feinstein et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib47"></span>2020; Günther et&nbsp;al. <span id="jumplink-bib69"></span>2020). Thus, one could carefully speculate: if stronger flaring or other processes (volcanoes, impacts, or lightning) had led to astrobiology on TOI-715 b or TIC 271971130.02 several Gyr ago, there might be a chance it could still exist (pending, of course, all other criteria such as atmospheric composition, liquid water, etc. are fulfilled).</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951177" id="422951177" data-legacy-id="sec7">7 CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>In this work, we have presented the discovery, validation and characterization of TOI-715 b, a <span>|$R_{\rm b}= \rm 1.550\pm 0.064\, R_{\oplus }$|</span> habitable zone planet orbiting an M4 star with a period of <span>|$19.288004_{-0.000024}^{+0.000027}$|</span> d. We also demonstrated that there is possibly a second, smaller planet with radius <span>|$R_{02} = 1.066\pm 0.092 ~\rm R_\oplus$|</span> at a period of <span>|$25.60712_{-0.00036}^{+0.00031}$|</span> d, placing it just inside the outer edge of the circumstellar habitable zone. This system represents the first <em>TESS</em> discovery to fall within this most conservative and widely applicable ‘habitable zone’.</p><p>We have also demonstrated that TOI-715 b is amenable to further characterization with precise radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy; detailed follow-up of this planet is crucial to further our understanding of the formation and evolution of small, close-in planets. Given its location in radius-installation space, TOI-715 b could also help us understand the characteristics of the M-dwarf radius valley.</p><p>Confirmation of the existence of the TIC 271971130.02 in the coming months will also be crucial in planning further characterization of planet b, as disentangling the two planets in a putative radial velocity campaign could prove challenging if the orbit of a second planet is not well known.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination="422951181" id="422951181" data-legacy-id="ack1">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>

  <div><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This post intends to provide a brief overview of the algorithm described in Luc Maranget’s
“<a href="http://moscova.inria.fr/~maranget/papers/ml05e-maranget.pdf">Compiling Pattern Matching to Good Decision Trees</a>”.</p>
<p>I’m fond of this formalisation as it has a straightforward implementation and results
in reasonable decision trees for the majority of practical instances of pattern matching
encountered in functional programming.
Additionally, the resulting decision tree is easy to reason about and can be used as the basis
of related transformations - such as translating into matching over simple patterns (patterns without nesting), or directly into an intermediary
representation with join points (a potential way to express branching control flow in normal-form intermediate representations).</p>
<h3 id="the-matrix">The Matrix</h3>
<p>The central data structure in the algorithm is that of a pattern matrix and associated occurrence and
action vectors.</p>
<p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/main.svg" alt="pattern matrix and vectors"></p><ul>
<li>Pattern matrix - stores examinable patterns appearing on the left-hand side of pattern matching rules.
The “examinable” refers to the fact that each cell stores a pattern that can be scrutinised against a matching criteria (the refutable component of patterns) -
as we’ll see in this scheme, tuples do not directly appear in cells of the pattern matrix, but their components do (as it is assumed that the arity of a tuple cannot be refuted - otherwise prior typechecking would fail in ML).
The core compilation algorithm works by performing transformations on the pattern matrix, decomposing patterns that admit certain constructors (and values).</li>
<li>Occurrence vector - describes sequence of extractions required to fetch the associated value from a column in the pattern matrix. Occurrences must be maintained during decomposition of the pattern matrix as they
effectively describe the access paths to the scrutinees of the n-way branches of the interior nodes in the resulting decision tree.</li>
<li>Action vector - stores corresponding actions for each row in the pattern matrix. These are the expressions that appear on the right-hand side of pattern matching rules (or some other identifying value, as they may appear in multiple leaves of the decision tree). Upon successful matching of a pattern, the associated
action is executed (actions therefore appear as leaves in the decision tree or, as we’ll come to see, sink nodes in the associated DAG representation).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="matrix-operations">Matrix Operations</h3>
<p>The following sections describe the transformations performed during the algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>The construction of the pattern matrix and related action and occurrence vectors requires some care.
The primary difficulty comes from the inclusion of tuples.</p>
<p>In the case of tuples, they are never directly stored in cells of the pattern matrix - their components are.
This is exemplified by the first example in Maranget’s paper concerning the implementation of a canonical
<code>merge</code> function in an ML-like language:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>fun</span> <span>merge</span> xs ys = 
</span></span><span><span>  <span>case</span> <span>(</span>xs<span>,</span> ys<span>)</span> <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>     <span>(</span>Nil<span>,</span> <span>_)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span>   | <span>(_,</span> Nil<span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 2 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span>   | <span>(</span>Cons <span>(</span>x<span>,</span> xs<span>),</span> Cons <span>(</span>y<span>,</span> ys<span>))</span> =&gt; <span>(* 3 *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For clarity, I’ve opted to name <code>list</code> constructors explicitly (as <code>Nil</code> and <code>Cons</code>).</p>
<p>The initial pattern matrix and associated vectors will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/first.svg" alt="example initial pattern matrix"></p><p>The <code>v</code> appearing in the occurrence vector denotes the scrutinee of the <code>case</code> (<code>(xs, ys)</code>).
The <code>v.i</code> notation denotes a projection.
It’s written this way to make the presentation shorter. Furthermore, it is implicitly assumed that
the base of occurrences are not actually the original expressions themselves, but a variable that refers to them.
This is because, when generating code for each match case, you can bring the relevant pattern variables
into scope by introducing them with <code>let</code> bindings (that bind the result of translating occurrences into the relevant unwrappings and projections).
To avoid potentially duplicating an effectful operation when introducing these variables, it’s assumed a kind of
normalisation is performed to give a name to the expression being matched upon.
This kind of legalisation can be performed before match compilation
or potentially during a combined normalisation algorithm, where normalising the scrutinee of a <code>case</code> will yield an atomic value.</p>
<p>As you can see in the above illustration, the pattern matrix does not retain the structure of the tuples
appearing in each rule of the match. When translating a tuple pattern into a row for the pattern matrix,
you introduce a column for each component. Each component is additionally labelled with an occurrence that denotes
the projection from the relevant index of the tuple.</p>
<p>Another source of complexity comes from the fact that patterns in a <code>case</code> need not have the same shape.
This scenario is typified by catch-all pattern variables that may follow tuple patterns.
Consider the following snippet of SML code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> f <span>()</span> <span>of</span> 
</span></span><span><span>   <span>(</span>SOME x<span>,</span> <span>_)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | t =&gt; <span>(* 2 *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The problem with the above is that <code>t</code> will disappear when constructing the pattern matrix because columns
for components of the prior tuple are introduced instead.
A solution for this scenario may be a prior legalisation that moves top-level pattern variables to the right-hand
side of match rules:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>val</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> f <span>()</span> <span>in</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>case</span> v <span>of</span> 
</span></span><span><span>     <span>(</span>SOME x<span>,</span> <span>_)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span>   | <span>_</span> =&gt; <span>let</span> <span>val</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> v <span>in</span> <span>(* 2 *)</span> <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Doing this will ensure that <code>t</code> will be in scope for the code in <code>(* 2 *)</code>.</p>
<p>Another way of ensuring the shape of patterns don’t introduce annoying edge cases or require writing the program is to bookkeep each pattern in terms of its occurrences.
For example, in my own simple implementation of the match compilation algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/contificate/match">here</a>), construction of the pattern matrices is done by collecting
dictionaries (one for each pattern), mapping occurrences to their related pattern components. Then, a matrix is constructed by filling in a table whose columns are the occurrences traversed during the dictionary creation process (in the left-to-right order they were visited). From this perspective, much of the match compilation algorithm can be seen as building and decomposing tables (matrices).</p>
<h3 id="specialisation">Specialisation</h3>
<p>In order to transform the matrix and vectors into a state that represents the successful matching of a value or constructor upon a collection of rows, specialisation is performed. Specialisation is an operation that retains only the rows of the matrix that admit a specified value or constructor,
simultaneously decomposing value-carrying sub-patterns into their corresponding entries in the pattern matrix and occurrence vector (with requirements similar to that of the initial construction of the pattern matrix).</p>
<p>Consider the following code snippet and associated initial pattern matrix and vectors:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> v <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>   Some <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> x<span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | Some <span>(</span>y<span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 2 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | None =&gt; <span>(* 3 *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/2.svg" alt="initial pattern matrix"></p><p>Specialisation of the <code>Some</code> constructor yields the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/3.svg" alt="initial pattern matrix"></p><p>Here, <code>[v]</code>, denotes accessing the value held by the constructor.
The appeal of the matrix formalism for simultaneous matching is clear when you consider that the resultant matrix effectively models the inner <code>case</code> of the
following snippet:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> v <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>   Some z =&gt;
</span></span><span><span>     <span>case</span> z <span>of</span> 
</span></span><span><span>        <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> x<span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span>      | <span>(</span>y<span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 2 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span>     <span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span> | None =&gt; <span>(* 3 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>where <code>z</code> is a name given to the unwrapping occurrence.
It is not hard to see that the resultant decision tree can be used to rewrite pattern matching into matching over simple patterns.</p>
<p>Similarly, specialising the original matrix from above upon <code>None</code> yields the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/4.svg" alt="specialisation of None"></p><p>Note that, for consistency, nullary constructors such as <code>None</code> must be treated as though they carry unit, <code>()</code>, which - when introduced to the pattern matrix - will
construct a row with a single wildcard pattern. The reason for this is for consistency and to avoid a case of the algorithm (described in a later section)
that would treat an empty matrix as indicative of matching failure.</p>
<h3 id="defaulting">Defaulting</h3>
<p>Producing the <em>default</em> matrix of a given pattern matrix retains only the rows that match constructors or values not already present
in the column being scrutinised.
In other words, if the column being scrutinised contains an irrefutable (either a pattern variable or wildcard) entry, then its decomposition
is included in the default matrix.
Or, in the case where matching is inexhaustive, defaulting creates an empty pattern matrix (since there are no rows to admit any constructor or value).
Intuitively, if each interior node of the decision tree <code>switch</code>es on a column’s value (using the occurence for that column), then
defaulting is used to create the <code>default</code> case (to account for constructors or values not present).</p>
<p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/5.svg" alt="defaulting"></p><p>Note that specialisation and defaulting may produce matrices with rows in common.
Additionally, it may be important that defaulting retains variables and their occurrences (in order to introduce pattern variables into scope upon a sucessful match).
This concern is mitigated in Maranget’s explanation of the algorithm as their paper
dispenses of pattern variables, considering only wildcards (which can be thought of as locally unique pattern variables with no uses).</p>
<h3 id="swapping">Swapping</h3>
<p>To aid with implementation of the algorithm, an auxiliary operation that swaps columns of the pattern matrix (and, consequentially, the occurrence vector) must be implemented. As you will see in the following section that describes the algorithm, all prior references to the “column being scrutinised” actually refer only to the first column, as matching proceeds left-to-right; ensuring that there is always a refutable pattern in the first column by potentially swapping it for another.</p>
<p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/6.svg" alt="swapping"></p><h3 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h3>
<p>The algorithm is well described in the paper, but I will recite it here anyway.
It’s defined as recursive function that performs case analysis over the provided matrix.
The cases are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the pattern matrix is empty, that implies it was produced by a defaulting operation that could find
no row to include, so it is indicative of matching failure. A leaf node indicating failure is returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the first row of the pattern matrix is irrefutable (i.e. only pattern variables or wildcards), then
matching has succeeded and we return a leaf node containing a reference to the action vector entry the for the first row.</p>
<p>If there are other rows in the pattern matrix that are also irrefutable then that implies the pattern corresponding to the first row
subsumes them. In other words, those extra rows are redundant as they can never be reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If neither of the previous cases hold then we look for a column that contains at least one refutable entry.
If the found column is not the first one, we make it the first by swapping their positions.</p>
<p>Now that the first column is refutable, we collect a form of signature by analysing each entry.
If the column’s type is a variant, then we collect all the names of constructors from entries that contain
variant constructor patterns (for example, we would collect <code>Some</code> if we encounter <code>Some (1, x)</code>). A similar collection is done for other kinds of refutable patterns, such as integer constants.</p>
<p>Once the signatures are collected, a specialised matrix is produced for each one. Those matrices are then recursively compiled by the
algorithm and the resultant decision trees are recorded as targets of an n-way switching node in the decision tree.</p>
<p>If the signature is not complete, i.e. does not contain all potential constructors for a given type, then the default matrix is computed
for the original matrix - the resultant decision tree is then included among the alternatives of the returned switch node as the default case.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Below is a complete annotated example of the conceptual process of computing the decision tree for the following SML snippet:</p>

<p>Below are a few example SML snippets and their corresponding decision trees, produced by my implementation of the algorithm described above:</p>
<p>First, the example given in the paper (for <code>merge</code> or a similar function, such as <code>zip</code>):</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> e <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>(</span>Nil<span>,</span> <span>_)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/a-1.svg" alt="full example"></p><p>Secondly, a more compact presentation of the running example used in this article:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> e <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>   Some <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> x<span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>

</span></span><span><span> | None =&gt; <span>(* 3 *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/a-2.svg" alt="full example"></p><p>Finally, Okasaki’s red-black tree <code>balance</code> function (from “Purely Functional Data Structures”):</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> e <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>   <span>(</span>B<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>a<span>,</span>x<span>,</span>b<span>),</span>y<span>,</span>c<span>),</span>z<span>,</span>d<span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | <span>(</span>B<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>a<span>,</span>x<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>b<span>,</span>y<span>,</span>c<span>)),</span>z<span>,</span>d<span>)</span> =&gt; <span>(* 2 *)</span>

</span></span><span><span> | body =&gt; <span>(* 5 *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img id="rb" src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/rb.svg" alt="full example"></p><p>I include this example because it illustrates an important point - those aware of the implementation of <code>balance</code>
will know that every case, except the last, has the same body. So, in SuccessorML, one would write this as a disjunctive pattern:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sml"><span><span><span>case</span> e <span>of</span>
</span></span><span><span>   <span>(</span>B<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>a<span>,</span>x<span>,</span>b<span>),</span>y<span>,</span>c<span>),</span>z<span>,</span>d<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | <span>(</span>B<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>a<span>,</span>x<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>b<span>,</span>y<span>,</span>c<span>)),</span>z<span>,</span>d<span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | <span>(</span>B<span>,</span>a<span>,</span>x<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>b<span>,</span>y<span>,</span>c<span>),</span>z<span>,</span>d<span>))</span>
</span></span><span><span> | <span>(</span>B<span>,</span>a<span>,</span>x<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>b<span>,</span>y<span>,</span>T <span>(</span>R<span>,</span>c<span>,</span>z<span>,</span>d<span>)))</span> =&gt; <span>(* 1 *)</span>
</span></span><span><span> | body =&gt; <span>(* 2 *)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If compilation were to naively proceed by duplicating the body at <code>(* 1 *)</code> for each case, we would get the same decision tree as above.
A more involved approach would attempt to achieve sharing by constructing a DAG (directed acyclic graph) in order to deduplicate the repeated rule bodies.
However, naively doing this from the above tree may produce a DAG that contains redundant decisions (e.g. value and <code>default</code> branches that have the same destination).
A possible approach would be to attempt to optimise the DAG after-the-fact and then, when emitting code for the decision tree, the shared rule body becomes its own function that
receives its variables (those bound as pattern variables and free variables - similar to lambda lifting) as arguments. Then, dependent on the path followed to get there, the variables will be projected from the scrutinee and
provided as arguments to the deduplicated function.</p>
<p>The simple approach is to identify sharing upon construction of nodes in the decision tree, by means of hash consing.
This approach is described in Pettersson’s book “Compiling Natural Semantics” and the one I took for my own implementation.</p>
<p>Below, you can see the decision DAG (for the <code>balance</code> example) resulting from an implementation that uses hash consing:</p>
<p><img id="rb" src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/dag.png" alt="decision dag"></p><hr>
<h3 id="an-implementation">An Implementation</h3>
<p>In the time since writing this article, I’ve created a very simple implementation of the algorithm <a href="https://github.com/contificate/match">here</a>.
Along with providing a faithful implementation of the core ideas described in this article, it also provides a small user interface for playing around with seeing potential decision trees.</p>
<p><img id="rb" src="https://compiler.club/img/dt/repo.gif" alt="user interface"></p><hr>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~types/resources/a-fpca-1985.pdf">Augustsson 85</a>] - compiles pattern matching to backtracking automata, thus ensuring code size that is linear in the size of the original pattern matching expression, but potentially checking subterms multiple times.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2011/spring/22620-1/papers/pettersson92.pdf">Pettersson 92</a>] - models the match compilation problem as the construction of a DFA for a regular language, thus enabling
certain forms of optimisations (viewed as minimisation of the DFA) and checking of various matching properties such as exhaustiveness and redundancy.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b71652">Pettersson 99</a>] - Pettersson’s book “Compiling Natural Semantics” contains a more detailed retelling of the algorithm described in the work above.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/JohnReppy/compiling-pattern-guards">Reppy et al. 19</a>] - considers compilation of Successor ML guards. The linked repository also has several implementations of various approaches to the compilation
of pattern matching.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>
<p>In efforts to teach the core idea of the algorithm described in this blog article,
I’ve found that it’s beneficial to start with simpler examples - consisting purely of tuples of, say, integers patterns (no wildcards or variable patterns).
Then, once someone is familiar with the general approach (matrix specialisation), adding all the bookkeeping for pattern variables, defaulting of the matrix, deconstructing nested patterns into the matrix, etc. become reasonable extension projects for them to program around.</p>
<p>For example, in the OCaml compiler, pattern matching over constant strings actually follows the simpler subset of the match compilation algorithm described in this article. I hope to dedicate a future article to this - but, until then, an excellent description of the core idea has been given by Gabriel Scherer on the OCaml forum <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/constant-string-pattern-matching/10801/4">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I interact with Dockerfiles every day at work, have written a few myself, built containers, and all that. But never published one on the docker hub registry. I wanted to make <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit"><strong>ugit</strong> - a tool to undo git commands</a> (written as a shell script) available to folks who don’t like installing random shell scripts from the internet.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I know. REWRITE IT IN GO/RUST/MAGICLANG. The script is now more than 500+ lines of bash. I am not rewriting it in any other language unless someone holds a gun to my head (or maybe ends up sponsoring??). Moreover, ugit is close to being feature complete (only a few commands left to undo, which are not that commonly used).</p>

<p>Anyway, the rest of the article is about how I went about writing the official Dockerfile for <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit/blob/master/ugit"><strong>ugit (a shell script)</strong></a> and reduced the image size by almost <strong>40%</strong> (<em>going from 31.4 MB to 17.6 MB</em>) by performing step-by-step guided optimization attempts. I hope this motivates other shell enthusiasts to also publish their scripts as docker images!</p>

<h2 id="the-very-first-dockerfile-attempt">The very first <code>Dockerfile</code> ~attempt~</h2>

<span># Run ugit when the container launches</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["ugit"]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looks pretty simple, right? It is. You could copy-paste this Dockerfile and build the image yourself assuming you have ugit cloned in the current directory,</p>

<div><pre><code>docker build <span>-t</span> ugit <span>.</span>
docker run <span>--rm</span> <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span>:/app ugit
</code></pre></div>

<p>This should successfully run ugit inside the container.</p>

<!-- add screenshot -->

<p><code>ugit</code> requires binaries like <code>bash (&gt;=4.0)</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>xargs</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>fzf</code>, <code>tput</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We had to install <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/">findutils</a> because it ships with <code>xargs</code>.</li>
  <li>We had to install <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/coreutils">coreutils</a> because it ships with <code>tr</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>nl</code>.</li>
  <li><code>ncurses</code> is required by <code>tput</code> (which is used to get the terminal info).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all we need to run ugit on a UNIX-based machine or well, a container. The image size sits at <code>31.4 MB</code> at this point. Not bad for a first attempt. Let’s see how we can reduce it further.</p>

<h2 id="path-to-optimization---reducing-image-size-by-40">Path to optimization - reducing image size by 40%</h2>

<p>During our (desperate) micro-optimization attempts in the upcoming sections, we will be covering the following high-level goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.</li>
  <li>Get rid of binaries like <code>sleep</code>, <code>watch</code>, <code>du</code> etc. Anything that is not required by <code>ugit</code> to run.</li>
  <li>Get rid of unnecessary dependencies that these binaries bring in.</li>
  <li>Get a minimum version of all dependencies that are required by <code>ugit</code> to run.</li>
  <li>Load up only the required binaries and their dependencies in the final image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2nd-attempt---alpine-on-alpine">2nd attempt - <code>alpine</code> on <code>alpine</code></h2>

<p>I now choose to create a multi-stage build. The 2nd stage will be used to copy only the required binaries and their dependencies. I again choose to use <code>alpine</code> as the base image for this stage.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># First stage: Install packages</span>

<p>Just by a straightforward multi-stage build, we were able to reduce the image size to an impressive <code>20.6</code> MB. Now the image builds successfully, but it won’t run ugit yet.</p>

<div><pre><code>Error loading shared library libreadline.so.8: No such file or directory (needed by /bin/bash)

<p>Turns out, we are missing transitive dependencies. More about this on our <a href="https://bhupesh.me/publishing-my-first-ever-dockerfile-optimization-ugit/#3rd-attempt---using-scratch-at-2nd-stage">3rd attempt</a>.</p>

<p>Turns out, that both <code>xargs</code> and <code>awk</code> are present by default on the Alpine image. You can verify this by running the following commands:</p>

<div><pre><code>docker run <span>-it</span> alpine /bin/sh <span>-c</span> <span>"awk --help"</span>

<p>The image size is now down to <code>20 MB</code>. We are getting there. ugit still won’t run, though.</p>

<h2 id="3rd-attempt---using-scratch-at-2nd-stage">3rd attempt - Using <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/"><code>scratch</code></a> at 2nd stage</h2>

<p>This is the part, that most folks don’t attempt. It’s a bit scary and requires a huge commitment. I was a bit scared to go this route as well because I knew everything could be <del>SCRATCHED</del> 🙃.</p>

<p>A SCRATCH docker image is just an empty file system. It doesn’t have anything at all. To try out a SCRATCH image, you can refer to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch">docker hub’s README on it</a>.</p>

<p>The only thing you need to know is that everything has to be put together by us. Let’s keep our hands on our hearts and replace <code>alpine</code> with <code>scratch</code>.</p>

<p>Doing this reduced the size of our image to <code>12.4MB</code>, a 60% reduction?? Did we just rickroll ourselves? Let’s try to run ugit.</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/3KONHAjX7LAAAAAC/el-risitas-risitaslaughing.gif" alt="resitas laughing"></p>

<p>Turns out, we broke the bash binary by not shipping its dependencies. Let’s see what we can do about it.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-transitive-dependencies">Identifying transitive dependencies</h3>

<p>Okay, time to talk about transitive dependencies. Our script relies on binaries like <code>git</code>, <code>tput</code>, <code>bash</code>; now some of these utils may have their dependencies.</p>

<p>We technically call these dependencies, shared libraries. Shared libraries are <code>.so</code> (or in Windows <code>.dll</code>, or in OS X <code>.dylib</code>) files. <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html"><strong>ldd</strong></a> is a great tool to identify these dependencies. It lists all the libraries needed by a binary to execute. For example, if we run <code>ldd /bin/bash</code> on a fresh Alpine container, we get the following output:</p>

<div><pre><code>/ <span># ldd /bin/ls</span>
	/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffff8c9c0000<span>)</span>
	libc.musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffff8c9c0000<span>)</span>
/ <span># ldd /bin/bash</span>
	/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffffb905a000<span>)</span>
	libreadline.so.8 <span>=&gt;</span> /usr/lib/libreadline.so.8 <span>(</span>0xffffb8f06000<span>)</span>
	libc.musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1 <span>(</span>0xffffb905a000<span>)</span>
	libncursesw.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /usr/lib/libncursesw.so.6 <span>(</span>0xffffb8e95000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="primer-on-shared-libraries">Primer on shared libraries</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Each lib has a <em>soname</em>, which is the name of the library file without the version number. They start with the prefix <code>lib</code> and end with <code>.so</code>. For example, <code>libpcre2-8.so.0</code> has a soname <code>libpcre2-8.so</code>.</li>
  <li>A fully qualified lib includes the directory where it is located. For example, <code>/usr/lib/libpcre2-8.so.0</code>.</li>
  <li>Each lib has a real name, which is the name of the library file with the version number. For example, <code>libpcre2-8.so.0.3.6</code> could be a real name.</li>
  <li>The hexadecimal is the base memory address where this library is loaded in memory. Not useful for us. We are only interested in the library names. Let’s do it for all the binaries we need to run ugit.</li>
  <li>The path to the right-hand side of <code>=&gt;</code> symbol indicates the real path to that shared library.</li>
  <li>The lib name starting with <code>libc</code>is the C library for that architecture. Remember our “exec /bin/bash: no such file or directory” error? This is the reason we got it. We didn’t ship the C library for our architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an excerpt from <a href="https://twitter.com/dcreager/">Douglas Creager’s</a> article on <a href="https://dcreager.net/2017/10/shared-library-versions/">Shared library versions</a> which sums up shared libraries, please read the full article if you want to learn more about shared libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>With a shared library, you compile the library once and install it into a shared location in the filesystem (typically <code>/usr/lib</code> on Linux systems). Any project that depends on that shared library can use that shared, already compiled representation as-is.<br>
Most Linux distributions further reduce compile times by distributing <strong>binary packages</strong> of popular libraries, where the distribution’s packaging system has compiled the code for you. By installing the package, you download a (hopefully signed) copy of the compiled library, and place it into the shared location, all without ever having to invoke the compiler (or any other part of the build chain that produced the library).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We use a similar approach to identify all the unique dependencies for all the binaries we need to run ugit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ We did this by running a command like <code>for cmd in /bin/*; do echo $cmd; ldd $cmd; done</code></p>

<p>Notice, that we are copying <code>libc.musl-*</code> and <code>ld-musl-*</code> from the builder image. This is because the build for these libs depends on the architecture of the host machine.</p>

<h3 id="shebangs--are-useless">Shebangs <code>#!</code> are useless</h3>

<p>If you look at the very <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit/blob/master/ugit#L1">first line of ugit</a>, you’ll see a shebang <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code>. The use of <code>env</code> is considered a good practice when writing shell scripts, used to tell the OS which shell interpreter to use to run the script, this is ideal in an everyday dev machine. Linux (and older versions of macOS) get shipped with <code>sh</code>, <code>bash</code>, and on top of it, folks install <code>zsh</code> etc.</p>

<p>But since using shebangs is optional, and we already copy the <code>bash</code> binary, we just need to invoke our script using it. This saves us a couple of bytes in the image size as well. Close to 1.9 MB to be precise.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNWNmdHQ3bGQ0czN1eG9vYTlicGd0aXRjeDJqbXg5aXZreTNhM3hoeiZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/3o6Mbi2vzeke98ApAA/giphy.gif" alt="get rid of shebang"></p>

<div><pre><code><span># Run ugit when the container launches</span>

<h3 id="a-look-at-terminfo-db">A look at <code>terminfo</code> db</h3>

<p>ugit has colors, thanks to <code>tput</code>. We load up a bare-bones Alpine image with <code>bash</code> and head over to the <code>/etc/terminfo</code> directory. This directory contains the terminal info database.</p>

<div><pre><code>37a1a77f70ed:/app# <span>cd</span> /etc/terminfo/
37a1a77f70ed:/etc/terminfo# <span>ls
</span>a  d  g  k  l  p  r  s	t  v  x
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each of these letter-based “directories” represents different <code>$TERM</code> types. For example, <code>xterm</code> is a terminal type. If you run <code>tput -T xterm colors</code> on your local machine, you’ll get the number of colors your terminal supports. For <code>xterm</code> it should be <code>8</code>, and in the case of <code>xterm-256color</code> it should be <code>256</code>.</p>

<p>Now here’s our chance, to only support 1 terminal type amongst the 40+ that are present in the <code>terminfo</code> db. We can get rid of the rest of the terminal types. This saves us another 97Kb, very little but needed to clear up the clutter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># copy terminfo database for only xterm-256color</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> --from=ugit-ops /etc/terminfo/x/xterm-256color /usr/share/terminfo/x/</span>

<p>The final Docker image sits at 17.6 MB with no security vulnerabilities (as reported by <a href="https://docs.docker.com/scout/">docker scout</a>, at the time of writing this article).

<p>I decided to pin the version of <code>fzf</code> to <code>0.46.0</code> (the latest at the time of writing this article) because ugit requires a minimum <code>0.21.0</code> to run, and I figured what the heck, let’s pin it to the latest version.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ <code>docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app ugit</code> will run the ugit container. Make sure your current directory is a git repo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how the final file system tree looks like: <br></p>



<p>This is everything to make our shell app work. No more, no less. Time for a beer? 🍺</p>

  <p>PS: The final docker image came down to 16.2 MB. You can find the updated Dockerfile <a href="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/ugit/blob/master/Dockerfile">here</a>. For the sake of this article, I kept the image size at 17.6 MB.</p>

<h2 id="could-we-reduce-the-size-further">Could we reduce the size further?</h2>

<p>Yes, but there are 2 reasons why I didn’t go any further:</p>

<h3 id="reason-1-pin-minimum-version-of-fzf">Reason 1: Pin minimum version of <code>fzf</code>?</h3>

<p>At the time of writing ugit, the script relied on <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.20.0"><code>fzf</code> minimum version <code>0.20.0</code></a>, it’s granted that the latest version is going to be larger than the minimum required version. So we should pin the old version, right? No. because then it introduces security vulnerabilities with fzf’s dependencies, i.e., Golang. As reported by <code>docker scout quickview</code>, the older version of Golang has a total of 66 security issues. Maybe they affect the image, maybe they don’t. But I am not taking that risk, I want to keep the image as clean as possible.</p>

<p><img width="877" alt="security issues in golang" src="https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/Bhupesh-V.github.io/assets/34342551/f0edf2b9-063b-4fc3-b928-754eb7d7f9af"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ℹ️ In the Alpine ecosystem, it is generally not advised to pin minimum versions of packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="reason-2-use-the-latest-bash-features">Reason 2: Use the latest bash features?</h3>

<p>At the time of writing ugit, I relied on <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/"><code>bash</code> version <code>4.0</code></a>. Both tr and cut could be replaced, if I shifted to a newer version of bash. i.e, <em>5.0</em>. And that my friends is a breaking change. Getting rid of and would have saved me a couple of bytes, but I didn’t want to break the script for folks who are still on bash 4.0. It doesn’t matter if I am the only one left, my machine still has bash.</p>

<h2 id="you-didnt-try-docker-slim">You didn’t try <code>docker-slim</code>?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I did, it did slim down my image, but it also broke the script with missing dependencies. Slim is great, the reader should check it out. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get it to work for ugit in my limited time.</li>
  <li>Moreover, I wanted to learn how to do it with my own hands, rather than rely on a tool to do it for me.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-didnt-try-docker-squash">You didn’t try <code>docker-squash</code>?</h2>

<p>I did, and the size optimization was nearly negligible. Here’s a log of the squash process which I ran on a Linux (AMD) machine (ignore the size of the image, since we are on different architecture, the image size is different):</p>

<p>Microsoft's adoption of Rust continues apace if a posting on the IT titan's careers website is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Although headcount at Microsoft might currently be down – by two percent compared to the previous year – recruitment persists at the Windows giant. In this case, the company is forming a team of Rustaceans to tackle a platform move away from C#.</p>
<p>The job, a principal software architect for Microsoft 365, has responsibilities that include "guiding technical direction, design and implementation of Rust component libraries, SDKs, and re-implementation of existing global scale C# based services to Rust."</p>

    

<p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1633482/Principal-Software-Architect">post</a>, spotted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-forms-new-team-to-help-rewrite-core-windows-components-into-rust-from-c-c/">MSPowerUser</a>, the job lurks within the Substrate App Platform group, part of the Microsoft 365 Core Platform organization. The Substrate does the heavy lifting behind the scenes for Microsoft's cloud services, making a rewrite into Rust quite a statement of intent.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft said: "We are forming a new team focused on enabling the adoption of the Rust programming language as the foundation to modernizing global scale platform services, and beyond."</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/servo_returns/">Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The company has had an interest in Rust for a while. In 2023, the director of OS security for Windows <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/microsoft_windows_rust/">announced</a> the arrival of Rust in the Windows kernel and the language has been making its way into multiple components over the years.</p>
<p>Microsoft, alongside companies such as Meta and AWS, is a platinum member of the Rust Foundation. Considering the growing enthusiasm for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/26/memory_safety_mainstream/">memory-safe programming</a>, something Rust delivers with far less effort than the likes of C++, Microsoft's move is unsurprising. However, the company's desire to shift existing C#-based services to Rust will raise a few eyebrows among the developer community.</p>
<p>Memorably, a Microsoft engineer had to rapidly <span>backpedal</span> issue a clarification after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/06/18/microsoft_roundup/">proudly proclaiming</a> that Office 365 was being ported to JavaScript. In this instance, while Microsoft remains committed to C#, at least in public, its actions over the last few years and the job posting are indications that the company is keeping its options open.</p>

        

<p>It is also an indicator of the direction of travel for engineers mulling what new skills to pick up in an increasingly competitive world. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
       <p id="e5lGRE2sAR9">One day over the summer, Piers Corbyn picked up a punnet of strawberries in the Aldi supermarket in Greenwich. He then went to the help desk and placed £1.19 in change on the counter. The controversial climate change denier and anti-vaxxer (and brother of former Labour leader Jeremy)—who, during the pandemic, released an unspeakable music video in which he sang “wearing a mask is like trying to keep a fart in your trousers” (the research is awaiting peer review)—was making a political point. This particular branch does not accept cash payments but tracks customers as they shop, before charging them via an app as they exit. Welcome to the cashless utopia—or, as Corbyn calls it, dystopia.</p><p id="eR4jAqSDVA0">Corbyn wasn’t having this Orwellian development. “So you people take that money—£1.19—and I will take my strawberries outside,” he tells staff, who, on the video he released on social media, can be heard remonstrating with him. “You can’t take that,” shouts one worker off camera, who advises him the police have been called. “If you want to call the police, call the police. I’ve paid my legal tender,” Corbyn retorts as he pushes his way through security gates designed only to be activated by the app. “Don’t break the doors,” shouts the same Aldi worker.&nbsp;</p><p id="euI88QTvOwk">Once outside, Corbyn victoriously hands out strawberries to supporters, telling them: “I paid by legal tender in this dystopian place.” “You should be able to spend whatever you want. It’s an absolute joke,” claims one of his supporters in the video.</p><p id="eYunPanMAuk">There are several problems with what Corbyn did, not least pompously calling supermarket workers “you people”. First, there is a Sainsbury’s opposite that almost certainly does take cash and whose strawberries, I imagine, are no less tasty than Aldi’s. More importantly, as critics pointed out on social media, Corbyn doesn’t grasp the concept of legal tender. “Most people think it means the shop has to accept the payment form. But that’s not the case,” explains the Bank of England website. “Legal tender has a narrow technical meaning which has no use in everyday life. It means that if you offer to fully pay off a debt to someone in legal tender, they can’t sue you for failing to repay.” In everyday life, shop owners can choose what payment they accept. If, say, you produce a £50 note to pay for a bunch of bananas, it’s perfectly legal for the shopkeeper to make sarcastic remarks and refuse your offer.</p><div><p id="ehtnQfv-GPZ">Physical cash, to the chagrin of Piers Corbyn, is in decline. It’s in such short supply that, in August, the Treasury moved to protect public demand for physical money by announcing that banks would be fined for failing to provide free access to cash withdrawals for consumers and businesses. “Whilst the growing choice and convenience of digital payments is great, cash has an important and continuing role to play,” said Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury at the time. “People shouldn’t have to trek for hours to withdraw a tenner to put in someone’s birthday card—nor should businesses have to travel large distances to deposit cash takings.”</p></div><p id="enowLgIzX4Rv">But if the supply of cash is being safeguarded, is there really demand for it? When did you last put folding money inside a birthday card? According to research published in September by UK Finance, a trade association, nearly 22m Britons used cash only once a month or not at all in 2022. Just under one million mainly used cash. Since 2017, payments made by debit cards (including with phones and watches) have overtaken those made in physical cash. The trend may have been hastened by Covid: during lockdown, fewer retailers than ever wanted the loose change from Piers Corbyn’s or anybody else’s trousers, for fear that it could spread infection. But the decline is structural: the volume of UK payments that do not involve cash rose from 45 to 85 per cent in the decade to 2021.</p><p id="e4MTKlXkr_de">That said, something striking happened once the pandemic eased. For the first time in a decade, cash payments rose—admittedly only by 7 per cent, but bucking the longer-term trend. Why? UK Finance cites anecdotal evidence that, in a cost-of-living crisis and with inflation for a while into double figures, people were finding it easier to manage their money by paying in cash.</p><p id="eXa6-VaQ2Op">The long-term decline in the use of cash may be disappointing to one man in particular: King Charles III. After an unconscionable wait, the septuagenarian is finally getting his mug on the coins of the realm—only for fewer Britons to be using them than did during mummy’s reign. That, perhaps, is a shame, because these rather beautiful new coins that will enter circulation by the end of next year have been devised to nudge those who hold them in their hot little hands to behave in two socially interesting ways. Each coin has the denomination marked out in large numerals next to images of Britain’s flora and fauna, including threatened species. The 1p coin, for instance, depicts a hazel dormouse, which has seen its population halve since 2007. The 10p features a capercaillie, the world’s largest grouse, which can be found in a small part of Scotland and is threatened with extinction. Rebecca Morgan, director at the Royal Mint, explained the value of this new coinage: “The large numbers will be very appealing to children who are learning to count and about the use of money. Also, the animals and everything you see on these coins will appeal to children. They are great conversation starters.”</p><div><p id="e7gGGYCDGHx">One of the great joys of paying in cash is that it doesn’t leave a digital trail. Physical money can do things—encourage numeracy, make us realise that we need to act to save the capercaillie before it’s too late—that swiping a debit card on a soulless digital reader never will.</p></div><p id="eZYI0dWiZ7qH">The decline in cash is unwelcome, not just to Piers Corbyn, kings and the Mint’s design team, but to those who, voluntarily or otherwise, don’t have bank accounts. It may also create understandable worries regarding the drift of our digitised societies to a place where our every keystroke, phone call and eyeball roll is digitally harvested—by shady tech bros with shareholders to satisfy or authoritarian rulers with dubious agendas—in ways that would make Big Brother envious.&nbsp;</p><p id="ewkPaO3ab99">Cash, by contrast, is an “anonymous bearer instrument”, meaning it is traded without any records and payable to anyone (the opposite is an “order instrument” payable to a specific person). The Piers Corbynites apparently believe that cash liberates us from totalitarian oversight by the Man. Unless, of course, you decide, as Corbyn did when he took his stand in Aldi, to film the exchange and post it online.&nbsp;</p><p id="ez9ug1oQfPM">If the Orwellian ramifications of the rise of cashlessness seem far-fetched, consider what happened in Kenya last August. As Corbyn was paying for his strawberries in Greenwich, thousands were queuing in Nairobi to have their eyeballs scanned as part of the “Worldcoin” project, founded by OpenAI chief Sam Altman. In exchange for handing over their biometric data, some 350,000 Kenyans each received 25 free crypto tokens, worth approximately $50. Those tokens were transferred directly via Kenya’s main mobile payments app, M-Pesa.</p><p>

</p><p id="etk8c4Kcpcu">But Worldcoin faced what’s being called a techlash over this project, not least because it seems like dystopian ­science fiction. A hardware unit known as an orb scans irises to identify individuals and prove they are human. Being able to verify a person in that way will be a key part of the new digital economy when artificial intelligence is integrated into society, according to the company.</p><p id="eXQXFhlIwfG">When the Kenyan government stepped in a week after Worldcoin’s launch in the east African republic to establish “the authenticity and legality of the aforesaid activities”, it was possibly also motivated by revulsion for what looks like a neo-colonialist enterprise predicated on plundering human data in ways redolent of how British imperialists violently exploited Kenya’s natural resources and human beings.</p><p id="ehhmdS2KRvf">Rachel O’Dwyer, lecturer in digital cultures at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, argues that Altman’s Worldcoin project is symptomatic of a wider development of major digital platforms now trading your digital identity for “tokens”. “By tokens, I mean money-like things ranging from airtime credit and loyalty points to game tokens… and gift balances.” She also means NFTs—non-fungible tokens—unique digital assets that have turned the art world on its head, inducing it to value not boring old paintings and sculptures but works that exist only digitally.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
 <p id="egk217C73F">One of the great joys of paying in cash is that it doesn’t leave a digital trail</p>
</blockquote><p id="ebdBQY4Dd_cr">“Tokens have always ghosted the economy of publicly mandated currency, but now they are coming to the fore, threatening to replace money itself. It raises the question: was money only ever a blip?”</p><p id="e0BKfbKk5mmZ">In her riveting new book <em>Tokens: The Future of Money in the Age of the Platform</em>, O’Dwyer argues that online platforms are becoming the new banks. Handing over one’s biometric data can be the condition of admission to this new monetary regime—something O’Dwyer describes as a Faustian pact.</p><p id="eNX-kXUi0wSx">But what does it mean when online platforms become the new banks? The radical dream that began with bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto’s breakthrough 2008 paper, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, was to cut out untrustworthy middlemen—especially central bankers—and realise a radical future of decentralised authority. This would allow, for instance, Argentine citizens to escape hyperinflation by holding bitcoin, not pesos.&nbsp;</p><div>
    <p><img data-src="https://media.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prod/images/portrait_small_fit/59a462301f32-prospectmar24cover-rgb.jpg" alt="magazine block image" src="https://media.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prod/images/portrait_small_fit/59a462301f32-prospectmar24cover-rgb.jpg"></p>
  </div><p id="edVhsi1I7XK8">Nakamoto’s innovation was creating a distributed ledger, a global registry of transactions that was not held by a single bank—as with a credit card—but by thousands of independent bitcoin “miners”. Because this “blockchain” is held not by a single entity but—at least in theory—by thousands of independent users, the need for a central, third-party authority is obviated and banks might become obsolete.</p><p id="ecQkw47azhR1">Fifteen years on, the dreams behind bitcoin’s radical reinvention of money have not been realised, just as the vision of a decentralised, uncensored, free internet foundered with its commercialisation. The cryptocurrency space has been taken over by charlatans and swindlers.</p><p id="eecckgTWploj">The consequence of all this is that bank-controlled cash appears—at least to those of a dystopian temper—to be at risk of steady replacement by payment in tokens. And examples of that development are not limited to Worldcoin.</p><p id="ep2S_w73OQri">Consider Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a (bizarrely named) website owned by the vast retail multinational where humans are employed online to do tasks which, for the time being at least, are not suitable for artificial intelligence. This might include identifying specific content in an image or video, writing product descriptions or answering survey questions. The online ad reads: “Make money in your spare time. Get paid for completing simple tasks.” But, as O’Dwyer points out, thousands of Mechanical Turks without US bank accounts are not paid in cash—they are paid in Amazon gift cards.&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p id="e99vmCaNP114">O’Dwyer argues such closed loops of token-based remuneration constrain freedom, and they are becoming more commonplace. In the United States, for instance, food stamps—known as SNAP benefits—are pre-loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer cards. These tokens can be used for fresh produce, but not alcohol. When I suggest to O’Dwyer that this sounds like fairly benign social nudge theory in action, she counters that the tokens cannot be used to pay for hygiene products such as tampons, nor for vitamins or medicines. What’s more, tokens can be used for cold deli food, but not for hot meals. “Why cold, pre-cooked meat but not half a rotisserie chicken? It seems there is something too ‘easy’—too idle, maybe—about buying a hot meal for your family using benefits.”&nbsp;</p><p id="eM_xSZwMu-9D">But such nudging through state payments to change behaviour is not new. In 2003, for instance, the Bolsa Família card was released in Brazil, giving households below the poverty line a monthly stipend of around $20 per vaccinated child attending school. In 2016, the UN World Food Programme trialled a system that issued relief payments through the use of biometrics. Refugees were able to buy items from the supermarket using their biometric data as a credential: all they needed to do was scan their iris to pay for an item. The idea was to improve convenience and prevent fraud. Since that trial, the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks initiative has become the world’s largest humanitarian use of blockchain technology. The WFP estimates it is responsible for financially supporting four million people each month in countries including Bangladesh, Jordan and, since mid-2022, Ukraine. The WFP reckons this technology helps tailor its support to meet humanitarian needs.&nbsp;</p><p id="eAZUghu3cDcN">O’Dwyer, though, has worries about this trend. Tokens can also be programmed to specify not only an exchange value, but a whole range of other terms and conditions that must be met before an exchange will take place. “Whose values are these? We’re not at liberty to know,” O’Dwyer says. This, no doubt, is what worries Piers Corbyn and his followers.</p><p id="eCGGtBg3N1Lr">Unlike him, though, O’Dwyer takes heart from human subversiveness in undermining the values of state-­proffered tokens. In Ireland in the 1980s, she tells me, there was a surfeit of butter resulting from the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. There was so much butter—piled into great butter mountains, or stacked up like what O’Dwyer drolly calls “Kerrygold bullion”—that butter vouchers were issued to the poor and needy, effectively padding out dole money with food stamps. “MUST NOT BE EXCHANGED FOR ITEMS OTHER THAN BUTTER,” said the booklet that held the vouchers. But people did, with the assistance of sympathetic shopkeepers. The vouchers were accepted as payment for tobacco, alcohol and groceries. “They were passed around. People even put them to non-transactional uses—as a decoy for insurance discs displayed on a car’s windshield, one official paper masquerading as another.” You couldn’t have done that with physical money.&nbsp;</p><p id="eSBSrOaJvVP">I mention this phenomenon to Jen Parker, operations manager of the Oasis Partnership, a charity for supporting vulnerable people in Buckinghamshire. Six months ago, the partnership became involved in a project in High Wycombe to cut down on anti-social begging through the creation of three “diverted giving points”. These are card terminals allowing locals to make donations to groups offering assistance with shelter, food, and drugs and alcohol support. The hope for Thames Valley Police and local councillors backing the scheme was that scammers posing as beggars, deprived of cash handouts, would cease operations, thus reducing street unpleasantness in the town. “We thought it was a good way to ensure funds were given to the homeless community rather than going to services that wouldn’t help that community,” Parker tells me.</p><p id="eK9H_HcYzlB">The scheme also had the added benefit of encouraging locals to donate by swiping their cards—crucial when fewer people than ever have cash in their pockets. “I’m as guilty of this as anyone,” Parker says. “I just don’t carry cash around anymore. In the past I would have donated that way, but for a lot of people that’s not happening anymore, so initiatives like this are important.”&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p id="eI-DhyI2Lu0U">“We weren’t sure how much money we would make from these diverted giving points, but we planned to consult with homeless people through our… outreach workers and supply them with what they want—sleeping bags, food, whatever.”</p><p id="ewKqQLZZCng3">Sadly, Parker tells me, after six months, the scheme has only raised £200. “Whether that’s because people are not aware of them [the card terminals] I don’t know, but we haven’t much to spend on marketing. It might also be because High Wycombe is not that prosperous. There’s a similar scheme in Windsor which is probably more successful.”</p><p id="edjQZCbhRb2A">When I mention how Chinese beggars are equipped with QR codes, Parker surprises me by being enthusiastic. “It’s quite enterprising and it’s not as though anybody’s being coerced. If people want to give away their private data to help homeless beggars, that’s their choice. My concern would be, is the homeless person being paid a fair wage for effectively doing this work for these companies? If they are, then it seems quite a good system.</p><p id="eOiCPTNNd-Vy">“We have to think of new ways of financially supporting homeless people because their days of shaking a bucket for cash are over.”</p><blockquote>
 <p id="e8LhG1KQeAG">Some have rebelled against the money fetish by burning vast wodges of cash</p>
</blockquote><p id="ezgQyNQh96M">If so, that is a big change. Physical money has been part of human society for thousands of years. In early 2021, the world’s earliest known coin-minting site was uncovered in Henan Province, China—it dates back to 650BC.</p><p id="ecJOuoJUPMG">Karl Marx detected a downside to the monetary phenomenon, writing that “Money is the alienated essence of man’s labour and life; and this alien essence dominates him as he worships it.” In our godless age, the money fetish has replaced earlier deities, which has led some to rebel by burning vast wodges of cash. For instance, on 23rd August 1994, the chaotic music duo and performance artists Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty burned £1m of notes behind a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura. They are not alone in attempting to reduce money’s power by sacrificing it to the flames. Jonathan Harris, also known as MBG (Money Burning Guy), has been burning money since 2007. “I see it as a ritual of disenchantment,” he has explained, “a de-fetishisation of money, a rite that paves the way for a new narrative.” Harris, author of <em>The Money Burner’s Manual: A Guide to Ritual Sacrifice</em>, claims on burnyourmoney.org that he and like-minded cash destroyers have burned £7,266,157 since 1969.&nbsp;</p><p>

</p><p id="etBSIn8Fwa2N">Harris describes himself as high priest of the churchofburn.org, whose homepage is emblazoned with this quote from Charlie Waterhouse of Extinction Rebellion: “Church of Burn is a portal into a glorious world we’re not supposed to see. Where money’s power is revoked, reclaimed and reassigned. A sacrificial rite that rewrites our failing modern world. For once one has burnt money, what else is possible?” Such thinking suggests that Piers Corbyn doesn’t go far enough—he’s still championing physical cash.&nbsp;</p><div><p id="eKEr5fxi3Gm">For those who despise money itself, we should worry not just about the rise of cashless Aldis but such bizarre new phenomena as <em>Axie Infinity</em>. This is an online video game based around NFTs—themselves a mind-bending new development in the way society (or the very online parts of it) understands value—and developed by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis. The game involves breeding and trading cartoon axolotls (a type of salamander) which can be swapped for money and which earn tokens that can also be swapped for money. During the pandemic, players in the Philippines and elsewhere made this game their work, collecting digital cartoon characters and using them to cash out. They converted the airy nothings of cyberspace into pesos.</p></div><p id="etZq_2LIIgIn">O’Dwyer sounds an optimistic note. Irish butter mountain subversives from the 1980s have their spiritual descendants today. Tokens are “lively and subversive,” she writes. “Users online and on the ground remake them to be paid in informal economies, to communicate, to protest, and to reimagine money… Gig workers, streamers, gamers and sex workers still find ways of transforming online gift cards, wish lists… and gaming tokens into liquid cash.” The future of money, even if it doesn’t include the physical cash that Piers Corbyn romanticises, may not be entirely dystopian.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Ofsted inspectors have been forced to “make up” evidence because the computer system they use to record inspections sometimes crashes, ­wiping all the data, an <em>Observer</em> ­investigation has found.</p><p>Since 2018, <a href="https://educationinspection.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/07/ofsted-is-going-digital/" data-link-name="in body link">inspectors have made live notes on laptops</a> or tablets as they interview staff and observe ­lessons after Ofsted invested in a&nbsp;new ­electronic evidence gathering (EEG) digital platform. However, our investigation has discovered the technology has had serious issues from the beginning, sometimes crashing unexpectedly and losing all notes from interviews, or even whole days of evidence, so that inspectors have to replace those notes from memory without telling the school.</p><p>The <em>Observer</em> spoke to several current or recent inspectors on condition of anonymity who said such problems had been “common” for years, and that senior leaders within <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/ofsted" data-link-name="in body link">Ofsted</a> were aware of this, but “there has been a lot of covering up”.</p><p>After this story was initially published a spokesperson for Ofsted told The <em>Observer</em> that chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver “is initiating a rapid review to satisfy himself that the EEG and the guidance to inspectors is robust”. The spokesperson added that if schools or inspectors have concerns “we would want to hear about them directly, so we can respond appropriately”.</p><p>Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This has echoes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/post-office-horizon-scandal" data-link-name="in body link">the Post Office scandal</a>. The idea of inspectors making lost evidence up, or remembering what they can, is abhorrent. It’s not how schools are allowed to conduct themselves.” He&nbsp;argued that if such a practice has been commonplace, “essentially every inspection conducted over the past five years should be disregarded”.</p><figure id="fd200eb2-689e-4444-89bf-044a32002f17" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b52cb4c88a7a26b92a437f1da1ba6bd4231908/0_0_3982_2655/master/3982.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.70391762933195" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘This has echoes of the Post Office scandal’: Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union.</span> Photograph: PA Images/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>A spokesperson for Ofsted said: “We take the processes we use to come to an inspection judgment very seriously.” They stressed that “all judgments are backed up by sufficient evidence” from the inspection team and are also quality assured by senior staff in Ofsted.</p><p>The spokesperson described the EEG tool as a “simple platform used only for recording written evidence” and said: “All inspectors have been issued clear guidance on what to do if they are unable to access the system.”</p><p>One current inspector told the <em>Observer</em>: “In the middle of a meeting with a school, you might suddenly lose all your evidence. The advice is that you mustn’t let on and keep an inscrutable face.”</p><p>He recalled sitting in a hotel trying to input a day’s evidence after the system shut down and he lost everything: “You’re exhausted because the inspection day is long and non-stop and you have documents to read for the next day.”</p><p>Once colleagues at headquarters wanted to do a “rigorous check” on an “Outstanding” grade he had just given a school. “They were asking for evidence but it just wasn’t there,” he said. “There has been a&nbsp;lot of covering up.”</p><p>A second former inspector des­cribed how he sat and watched as evidence from a lengthy interview “just disappeared bit by bit from the screen, like a Banksy artwork self-destructing”. He said: “It’s very hard to avoid giving any body language clues while that’s happening.” And he added: “The instruction then was just to make it up.”</p><p>He added: “I know for a fact that there are senior leaders in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/12/ofsted-school-inspection-ruth-perry-sister" data-link-name="in body link">Ofsted who know about these problems</a>.”</p><p>Ofsted conducted an investigation into EEG last year, which inspectors say confirmed serious issues, but none was aware of any significant changes being made in response.</p><p>Education providers have largely been totally unaware of any of these problems. However, the <em>Observer</em> has seen Ofsted’s written response to a&nbsp;complaint from a school about missing evidence. It says: “You state that during the final meeting the lead inspector declared: ‘It’s all gone’, referring to the evidence on her computer.”</p><p>The response also notes that the draft report included a school motto “which was not actually your school motto”, and that the school had “little confidence in the evidence base”.</p><p>Ofsted rejected this, saying the lead inspector logged that the record of the final meeting had gone but all other evidence was recorded and “subject to enhanced quality assurance”. The <em>Observer</em> understands the school was never shown evidence of this.</p><p>A third former Ofsted inspector said: “I lost everything in the middle of a meeting with a coordinator at the start of a deep dive [into the teaching of a specific subject]. The lead inspector lost everything when she got back to the hotel that night, as did the new inspector on the team.”</p><p>Three inspectors reported that they or colleagues started making notes in Word because they didn’t trust the system, but Ofsted threatened disciplinary action if they didn’t use EEG.</p><p>Julie Price Grimshaw, a former inspector who now advises schools, said while she served in the pen-and-paper era, “lots of inspectors” had told her about times when the system crashed and they lost evidence.</p><p>She said: “It’s clear that substantial chunks, and possibly entire evidence bases, have been disappearing into the ether and are never seen again.”</p><p>Ofsted said that if the EEG system did not work, inspectors were advised to record their evidence in a “reasonable alternative way” and “transfer it to the system at the earliest opportunity”. Ofsted’s spokesperson added: “If during the quality assurance process there was insufficient evidence on the system to support the judgment, inspectors would be instructed to return to the school to gather and record further evidence.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
