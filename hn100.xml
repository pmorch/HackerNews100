<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>Elevate the beating heart of data systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our team has worked a lot on reliable real-time ingest, where <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying" target="_blank">The Log</a> is foundational. We loved the serverless experience of object storage, but it <a href="https://blog.schmizz.net/designing-serverless-stream-storage#heading-vision" target="_blank">simply did not exist</a> for streaming data.</p>
<p>We believe the humble log – the <em><strong>stream</strong></em> – deserves to be a cloud storage primitive.</p>
<p>With S2, we are previewing just that: S2 is the Stream Store, our interpretation of streaming for the cloud era.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-streams-had-the-primacy-of-objects"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#what-if-streams-had-the-primacy-of-objects">What if streams had the primacy of objects?</a></h3>
<p>Object storage has been nothing short of revolutionary. S3 broke ground in 2006 with simple storage operations on named objects – and 18 years later, S3 Express One Zone even allows appends. But ultimately, object storage is all about blobs and byte ranges. It is best for data at rest. Our vision of stream storage is predicated on the idea that the demands of <em>data in motion</em> need a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>With S2, you are elevated to the natural granularity of <em>records</em>. Writes to an S2 stream are appended at the tail, and even if multiple writers are acting a time, S2 will durably sequence all records. S2 takes care of serving your reads efficiently, whether you need to start streaming from seconds ago or years. Streams can also be tailed in real-time, which is not possible with a blob in S3.</p>
<div>





















<table><thead><tr><th>Object Storage</th><th>Stream Storage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blobs and byte ranges</td><td>Records and sequence numbers</td></tr><tr><td><code>PUT</code> / <code>GET</code> / <code>DELETE</code> value of a named <code>Object</code> in a <code>Bucket</code></td><td><code>APPEND</code> / <code>READ</code> / <code>TRIM</code> records on a named <code>Stream</code> in a <code>Basin</code></td></tr><tr><td>Cumbersome and expensive for granular appends</td><td>Easy and cheap to append records</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Just like buckets are a namespace for objects, <em>basins</em> play that role for streams in S2. Basins and streams lean into the scale of the cloud – there is no limit on how many you can have, or how long data can be retained.</p>
<p>Want to model streams per user? Do it, this isn't Kafka. There are no cluster limitations to wrangle, and no infrastructure to tune.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme="github-dark"><code data-language="bash" data-theme="github-dark"><span data-line=""><span>$</span><span> s2</span><span> ls</span><span> s2://copilot-rag-ingest</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  /user-foo/cool-project</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  /user-foo/another-project</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  /user-bar/fork-of-cool-project</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  # ... ∞</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This stream interface brought us closer to our vision, but we also wanted to liberate the superpower of <a href="https://blog.schmizz.net/disaggregated-wal" target="_blank">offloading durability</a> which databases like MemoryDB and Neon leverage. Decoupling compute and storage is safest when the storage service cooperates.</p>
<p>So we added a verb to <a href="https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/papers/osr2024.pdf" target="_blank">check the tail</a> of the stream with strong consistency, and support for concurrency control when writing. You can be a pessimist wielding a <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/04/25/memorydb.html" target="_blank">fencing token</a> or optimistically supply the sequence number you expect assigned – no judgment which side of the fence you find yourself on.</p>
<h3 id="serverless--at-what-cost"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#serverless--at-what-cost">Serverless – at what cost?</a></h3>
<p>S2 is architected around the infinite scale and unrelenting durability of object storage. That does not necessitate a slow or expensive offering – quite the opposite! We bridge the abstraction gap with a multi-tenant service so that you can have a truly serverless API for streaming data.</p>
<p>Durability is not negotiable for us in the undeniable <a href="https://materializedview.io/p/cloud-storage-triad-latency-cost-durability" target="_blank">cloud storage triad</a>. We allow users to navigate their latency vs cost tradeoff on a per stream basis, with <em>storage classes</em>. We are starting out with two:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>Standard</code></strong>, backed by S3 Standard in AWS. S3 Standard has a counterpart in all public cloud providers, so we will be able to ship it in all cloud regions as we grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>Express</code></strong>, backed by a quorum of three S3 Express One Zone buckets in AWS. Azure has had a regional <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-block-blob-premium" target="_blank">counterpart</a> for years, and it is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7170847492522061825" target="_blank">in the cards</a> at GCP, so we are optimistic about wider availability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our <code>Standard</code> storage class provides end-to-end p99 latencies of <strong>under 500 milliseconds</strong>. With <code>Express</code> you can expect <strong>under 50 milliseconds</strong> – in the realm of disk-based cloud streaming systems! S2 on the other hand is completely diskless, and all writes will be safe in S3 with regional durability before being acknowledged.</p>
<p>These latencies are supported at throughputs of <strong>hundreds of megabytes per second, per stream</strong>. The overhead of reading recently written data is negligible in S2 because of in-memory caching. Lagging readers can be particularly thirsty for throughput, and S2 serves them directly from object storage without a cap. We are initially throttling writes at 125 MiBps and reads against recent writes at 500 MiBps, per stream.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.dev/blog/20241219-latencies.svg" alt="Consistent low latency for S2 storage classes" title="Latencies at over 1 GiBps aggregate throughput"></p>
<p>The service is free during our preview period to optimize for feedback. We want to be transparent about our <a href="https://s2.dev/pricing" target="_blank">intended pricing</a>, and you will find that S2 comes in meaningfully cheaper than the norms of cloud streaming systems. This will be particularly stark in comparison to "serverless" offerings, which attract tiny ceilings on the number of streams and the throughputs you can push through them – at a very high premium.</p>
<p>There are no fixed costs in S2 like instances or cluster units. When we say serverless, we mean it!</p>
<h3 id="whats-next-for-s2"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#whats-next-for-s2">What's next for S2</a></h3>
<p>S2 stands on a foundation of battle-tested cloud infrastructure, and our own Rust codebase gets put through the wringer with deterministic simulation testing. That said, the system is young, and there will be kinks. We are working hard to mature towards general availability and an SLA you can count on in production.</p>
<p>We are now shipping a <a href="https://s2.dev/docs/interface/grpc" target="_blank">gRPC API</a>, <a href="https://github.com/s2-streamstore/s2-sdk-rust" target="_blank">Rust SDK</a>, and a <a href="https://s2.dev/docs/quickstart#get-started-with-the-cli" target="_blank">shiny CLI</a> – and we are going to get cracking on a REST API. Do <a href="https://discord.gg/vTCs7kMkAf" target="_blank">tell us</a> which language SDKs you would be most interested in.</p>
<p>To give you a bigger picture sense of our direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Kafka protocol compatibility</strong>. This will be an open source layer, and we will integrate certain features like key-based compaction directly in S2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-region basins</strong>. Once we expand into more cloud regions, we see a path towards basins that can span regions and even clouds, for the highest standard of availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Under 5 millisecond latencies</strong>. We are just getting started with the architectural flexibility of storage classes, and another 10x improvement over <code>Express</code> is achievable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you replace Kafka or Kinesis with S2 today? If you find yourself reaching for their “low-level” APIs, S2 is likely to be a fit, and even address your requirements more directly.</p>
<p>If you expect a lot more from the cloud than current norms for streaming data – like not being limited on how many streams you can have, 10-100x higher ordered throughput, and concurrency control – S2 is the missing piece.</p>
<p>We are beyond excited for all the innovative data systems S2 enables, and invite you to <a href="https://s2.dev/docs">build with us</a>!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<article id="post-244" class="page">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	<div>
		<p>We’ve already seen how <a href="https://recleudo.com/penalties-redirects-drop-domains-the-next-chapter-in-the-parasite-seo-arms-race/">Finixio/Clickout’s assets were hit with serious penalties</a> in the days following Google’s algorithm update. I have no idea whether those penalties were manual, or algorithmically applied, though I have a hunch they were manual. But they destroyed the ranking of pages that funnelled, collectively, millions of visits a month into a network of gambling and crypto sites. (We will be back with the lowdown on that later.) For now, we’re concerned with how Finixio’s parasite SEO system has weathered the storm, trimmed sails, and continues to get away with the loot.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, I have never seen anyone get out from under a penalty this fast. It’s honestly impressive, and apart from anything else it presents a real masterclass in getting away with it. These people are seriously good at what they do.</p>
<p>Just what is that, exactly?</p>
<p>They’ve used a mixture of redirects and cloaking to conceal the fact that in just a few days, they’re back in business in a way that’s fundamentally unchanged, <strong>deceiving Google once again</strong> and showing the capacity of well-developed parasite SEO operations to evade even crushing, sitewide penalties.</p>
<p>(If you’re unfamiliar with parasite SEO and Finixio/Clickout Media, and you’d like to read an increasingly wild story about it, check out my first post <a href="https://recleudo.com/under-googles-blind-eye-a-growing-parasite-ecosystem-is-flourishing/">here</a>.)</p>
<h2>Getting away with it</h2>
<p>In this post, I’m going to focus on a few of Finixio/Clickout Media’s websites to tell the wider story while still offering a decent level of detail.</p>
<p>Techopedia gets the most traffic (by a long way, when it’s not staggering under the load of a Google penalty), and ranks for a lot more keywords than other known Finixio assets like ReadWrite. And I’ve already done enough digging to go fairly deep into what they’ve done.</p>
<p>I’ll be looking at a couple of other sites, like cryptonews.com, newsbtc.com, pokerscout and cardplayer.com. As often happens, it’s very difficult to say for sure what level of involvement Finixio/Clickout has with these sites, though cryptonews.com is a known Finixio asset.</p>
<p>But I’ll also introduce you to CoinTelegraph. CoinTelegraph is a different beast because Finixio don’t own it (I don’t think). Instead it illustrates another part of their parasite operation and shows how adaptable and effective it’s possible to be when you’re determined to outwit Google and you have the resources to act fast and at scale.</p>
<h2>The penalties to Finixio/Clickout assets</h2>
<p>The penalties, as far as I can figure out, were applied on December 2 this year, and they hit several sites I covered in my original post, including readwrite.com, business2community.com and techopedia.com hard. I already <a href="https://recleudo.com/penalties-redirects-drop-domains-the-next-chapter-in-the-parasite-seo-arms-race/">covered the detail on this in a separate post,</a> so I’m going to give a really light touch here.</p>
<h3>Techopedia</h3>
<p>Techopedia started life as a solid tech site. Now, it’s a front for gambling and crypto. When it was penalized, it experienced a massive crash in traffic and rankings.</p>
<p>Obviously these are estimates, but SEMRush sees Techopedia’s traffic fall by 64% over the month from November 17, from over six million to just under three, and then down to just over one.<br>
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min.jpg" alt="Semrush reports a massive fall in traffic on techopedia" width="1628" height="726" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min.jpg 1628w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min-300x134.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min-1024x457.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min-768x342.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min-1536x685.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-semrush-traffic-wall-min-1200x535.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>Those red marks on the dates at the bottom show days when there were major changes, perhaps caused by Google’s actions.</p>
<p>This image from Ahrefs shows the picture even more starkly:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs.jpg" alt="Ahrefs reports a massive fall in traffic on techopedia" width="2048" height="1022" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs-300x150.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs-768x383.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs-1536x767.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-massive-ranking-drop-ahrefs-1200x599.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px">That’s not a ‘decline.’ That’s a cliff.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Ahref’s traffic estimates are probably more accurate. But traffic to a website you don’t own is always more difficult to ascertain. Ranking, on the other hand, is easier. And rankings were destroyed by this penalty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty.jpg" alt="Techopedia ranking drops after penalty" width="2048" height="740" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty-300x108.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty-1024x370.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty-768x278.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty-1536x555.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-ranking-drops-after-penalty-1200x434.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px">This is pages that used to rank in the top five, falling to page two or three. That’s nowhere, they may as well not exist.</p>
<h3>Readwrite</h3>
<p>It’s the same story over at ReadWrite:<span lang="EN"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-scaled.jpg" alt="ReadWrite: -98k traffic" width="2560" height="1127" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-300x132.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-1024x451.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-768x338.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-1536x676.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-2048x902.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/readwrite-traffic-stats-dec-2-min-1200x528.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></span>Keywords and traffic fell off a cliff here too, though it’s not as clear a picture.</p>
<h3>Business2community.com</h3>
<p>Business2Community suffered a similar fate:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/business2community-ranking-drops.jpg" alt="business2community ranking drops" width="1536" height="719" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/business2community-ranking-drops.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/business2community-ranking-drops-300x140.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/business2community-ranking-drops-1024x479.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/business2community-ranking-drops-768x360.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/business2community-ranking-drops-1200x562.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>Traffic and keywords fell hard. Because of the way Ahrefs calculates traffic, changes can look more spread out than they actually are, so sudden events get smoothed into the curve. But this is the sight of three quarters of the site’s traffic being lost.</p>
<h2>How Finixio/Clickout dealt with the penalty at first</h2>
<p>We can break down what they did to deal with the penalty in two broad ways:</p>
<p><strong>1:</strong> Gambling pages went down. Pages were just removed from the site, sometimes so quickly and clumsily that they remained in navigation or you could still follow internal links to them, you just got a 404 if you tried it. This was a necessary first step: in order to get out of a sitewide penalty, the company removed all the content that violated Google’s site reputation abuse policy, so the site was no longer in violation.</p>
<p><strong>2:</strong> SEO juice was redirected from penalized domains to other domains owned by the same company, Finixio/Clickout. 301 redirects, theoretically permanent, were used to shunt the domain authority of the sites they’re parasitizing on, over to other assets in their network. Interestingly, the focus on crypto and gambling actually became clearer here as they often redirected to single-purpose sites that looked more like squeeze pages than traditional websites.</p>
<h2>In less than a week, everything was back up</h2>
<p>Now, however, things have changed. All the gambling content that disappeared? It’s back up.</p>
<p>I thought this would happen. In fact, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7272883594459533312/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I was so sure about it I ran a poll</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/timothy-linkedin-poll.jpg" alt="My linkedin poll on techopedia" width="610" height="1101" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/timothy-linkedin-poll.jpg 610w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/timothy-linkedin-poll-166x300.jpg 166w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/timothy-linkedin-poll-567x1024.jpg 567w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 610px) 85vw, 610px">Over half of respondents thought it would be less than a week. (So did I.) It was actually just a few days before all their gambling content was simply back online.</p>
<p>It’s shot back up the rankings too, even if it hasn’t quite reached its old, dominant positions. Here’s the part of the site that targets the UK:</p>

And nearly half the pages here are new pages that didn’t exist before the penalty. They’ve responded to being penalized by actually expanding the operation!</p>
<h2><span lang="EN">Now that they’re out of penalty, are they abiding by Google’s guidelines? Uh… 404 </span></h2>
<p>Gambling is back up, all across the affected sites. It’s just cloaked to conceal it from the eyes of any manual reviewer.</p>
<p>Here’s the top search result for ‘Casino utan spelpaus,’ one of Techopedia’s core gambling terms. This page is about accessing casinos that don’t require licensing from the Swedish gambling authorities. The relevant page URL is <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/se/gambling/casino-utan-svensk-licens">https://www.techopedia.com/se/gambling/casino-utan-svensk-licens</a>, but you can see my search term here.</p>

<p>These are the top three results from a Swedish server.</p>
<p>Techopedia.com is definitely owned by Finixio/Clickout Media. spaceportsweden.com probably is, in my opinion. Casinon-utan-svensk-licens.bet, well, that is as blackhat as they come, using a very clever cloaking method to conceal factmata.com, but that is an article for another time.</p>
<p>As of December 19, techopedia.com/se/gambling/casino-utan-svensk-licens looked like this:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked.jpg" alt="Techopedia using cloaking methods for their casino utan svensk licens article" width="2048" height="647" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked-300x95.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked-1024x324.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked-768x243.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked-1536x485.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-casino-utan-svensk-licens-cloaked-1200x379.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>…if you went there from a German server.</p>
<p>That’s Swedish for ‘missing article.’ Which is interesting, partly because it’s not the vanilla 404 message from Techopedia. If I go to a deliberately dud URL that I know doesn’t exist on that site, here’s what I get:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404.jpg" alt="techopedia standard 404" width="2048" height="377" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404-300x55.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404-1024x189.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404-768x141.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404-1536x283.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-standard-404-1200x221.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>The URL <a href="http://techopedia.com/se/gambling/casino-utan-licens">techopedia.com/se/gambling/casino-utan-licens</a> doesn’t actually exist, so I get ‘sorry, we can’t find the page you’re looking for.’ The visual appearance is different too.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting because the only reason this looks like this is, their servers think I’m in Frankfurt. If I move the dial on my VPN so they think I’m in Sweden…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google.jpg" alt="techopedia cloaking content to hide from google" width="2048" height="526" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google-300x77.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google-1024x263.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google-768x197.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google-1536x395.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-cloaking-content-to-hide-from-google-1200x308.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>The content can be displayed after all. Funny.</p>
<p>Since I took these screenshots, Techopedia have added content to their non-Swedish versions of this page. Now, whether my IP is in Frankfurt or California, the page looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens.jpg" alt="techopedia non swedish version of casino utan licens" width="2048" height="664" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-300x97.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-1024x332.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-768x249.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-1536x498.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-non-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-1200x389.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>That’s the non-Swedish version.</p>
<p>The Swedish version is still markedly different though:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens.jpg" alt="techopedia swedish version of casino utan licens" width="2048" height="1084" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-300x159.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-768x407.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-1536x813.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-swedish-version-of-casino-utan-licens-1200x635.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>Those are the same section of the page. On non-Swedish location versions the visitor gets served a quick guide to the sort of stuff you should probably be looking for in a casino without a Swedish license. On the Swedish version, the visitor gets a toplist that contains several sites we’ll be meeting repeatedly throughout this post, including Mega Dice, Lucky Block, and Instant Casino. Some of these I strongly suspect are Finixio assets, while Lucky Block is <a href="https://www.cryptoaegis.io/audits/Due%20Diligence%20-%20Lucky%20Block%20-%202022-10-10.pdf">owned through a shell company</a> by Finixio’s Head of Business Development, Scott Ryder.</p>
<p>The page is showing different content depending on where you are in the world. I’m tempted to call this ‘geocloaking’ — like geolocking, but for a deliberately deceptive or evasive purpose. It’s definitely an example of <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies">cloaking as Google describes it</a>.</p>
<p>Showing people from different places different content makes sense. There’s normally no point showing me Japanese or US products and pricing, I live in Europe. And people often prefer their own language. So most big websites clock your IP and offer or just give you the local version. So far, so good.</p>
<p>That’s not what’s happening here. The global version of this page is an ‘oops, don’t know what you mean’ page, not the same text in a different language.</p>
<p>Makes sense: most people outside Sweden have no reason to care about Swedish gambling laws. But then, why conceal the content of the page? And why do it in <i>Swedish</i>? After all, it’s not like there’s a whole lot of people outside Sweden (OK, Finland and maybe Minnesota) who speak Swedish. No — if you’re talking Swedish, you’re talking to Swedish people.</p>
<p>To me, this looks a lot like a trick I’ve seen Finixio sites pull in the past. They’ll conceal a page from visitors in one location and reveal it in another, to bypass regulatory attention. There are pages for Dutch casinos on Techopedia that are visible on mobile or from outside Holland, but not on desktop from within Holland. These are pages in Dutch, about Dutch gambling laws. Who else but the Dutch could they reasonably be aimed at?</p>
<h3>Here’s a video of me coming to the Swedish page from outside Sweden, then from inside:</h3>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techopedia-SE-With-Without-VPN-copy.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<h3>Here’s one of me doing the same thing to the German page:</h3>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techopedia-DE-With-Without-VPN.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<h3>And the French page:</h3>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techopedia-FR-With-Without-VPN.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<p>In each case, the page is hidden from everyone outside the target country and Google’s automatic crawlers. So the pages are ranking everywhere, but their actual content is invisible outside their target countries.</p>
<h3>Why hide? Unless…</h3>
<p>As far as I know there’s no legitimate reason to conceal the content of pages this way. But there is an illegitimate reason: <strong><u>to conceal the content from manual enforcers at Google</u></strong>. This material <i>looks</i> like it’s still down, everywhere except in its target countries.</p>
<p>It’s not coincidence:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-german-page-geo-blocked-everywhere-but-in-germany.jpg" alt="techopedia german page geo blocked everywhere but in germany" width="1016" height="1131" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-german-page-geo-blocked-everywhere-but-in-germany.jpg 1016w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-german-page-geo-blocked-everywhere-but-in-germany-269x300.jpg 269w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-german-page-geo-blocked-everywhere-but-in-germany-920x1024.jpg 920w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-german-page-geo-blocked-everywhere-but-in-germany-768x855.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>Only German IPs are able to access this German-language, Germany-oriented gambling content.</p>
<p>Unless Google’s staff manually visit the site from Germany, they’ll never see this page and never know it’s back up, so there won’t be anything to alert them that Finixio’s parasite operations have resumed. At the same time, the page is still visible to <i>crawlers</i> everywhere. (Finixio sites, including Techopedia, are consistently taking up two or three of the top five spots for ‘casino utan licens’ even in international search.) That way, they get the best of both worlds: indexed like they have global, broad-spectrum content that should rank well, but invisibility to casual human checks. You’d have to be looking for this stuff to find it.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening with the Swedish version of Techopedia’s gambling content:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-SE-utan-licens-blocked-everywhere-but-in-sweden-country-list.jpg" alt="techopedia SE utan licens blocked everywhere but in sweden country list" width="508" height="1183" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-SE-utan-licens-blocked-everywhere-but-in-sweden-country-list.jpg 508w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-SE-utan-licens-blocked-everywhere-but-in-sweden-country-list-129x300.jpg 129w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-SE-utan-licens-blocked-everywhere-but-in-sweden-country-list-440x1024.jpg 440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 508px) 85vw, 508px"></p>
<p>Techopedia’s Swedish language gambling content is locked; only Swedish IP addresses will be served it.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a couple of lines of code on the page showing you different languages or different content based on where you’re from. And it’s not the substantive difference in the actual code on the page that we’ll see in CoinTelegtaph’s iGaming section further down.</p>
<p>It’s actually being done in a way I have never seen before, and just like this level of geolocking, I can’t see how there’s a legitimate reason to do this.</p>
<p>Rather than just 404 the page for visitors from certain locations, the site operators are using cookies to tell visitors’ browsers not to display the page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-404-with-cookie.jpg" alt="techopedia 404 with cookie" width="645" height="435" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-404-with-cookie.jpg 645w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-404-with-cookie-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 645px) 85vw, 645px"></p>
<p>By contrast, here’s a vanilla 404 page:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-404-without-cookie.jpg" alt="techopedia 404 without cookie" width="655" height="374" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-404-without-cookie.jpg 655w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-404-without-cookie-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 655px) 85vw, 655px"></p>
<p>See how there are no ‘cookie-set’ lines in this? That’s because Techopedia isn’t trying to hide that this page exists.</p>
<p>The same game is being played over at another Finixio asset, cryptonews.com. Again this is a site I know for sure is owned by Finixio/Clickout:</p>

<p>They are using very similar tactics to evade attention from Google while simultaneously doing everything they can to rank.</p>
<p>They’re also using cloaking.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there’s a toplist that includes links. And some sites that should be familiar by now. Lucky Block and MegaDice are just a bit further down:</p>

<p>Most telling of all, using Google’s own tool at <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/">https://search.google.com/test/rich-results/</a>, here’s what Google sees:</p>

<p>That’s the version with the hyperlinked toplist. The desktop version is cloaked.</p>
<p>Why the difference? If I had to guess, I’d say because gamblers are likely to be on mobile — and regulators are likely to be on desktop.</p>

<p>Here’s one of the most important gambling pages on Techopedia on November 26</p>

<p>That’s well before the penalty was applied.</p>
<p>Here’s the site getting out of the penalty:</p>

<p>The amber colour indicates that the pages were 404’d for these days.</p>
<h3>Then, on December 4…</h3>

<p>…it’s a redirect to casinoutanspelpaus.io. This was their stopgap method, to keep generating profit from the parasite network they’ve built while they dealt with the penalty. I still don’t know for sure who owns this site.</p>
<h3>Today, December 20, looks like…</h3>

<p>Last year, it was a philanthropy website focused on Wales.</p>
<p>I’d love to show you what it looks like now, but when you put that url into Chrome it immediately redirects you to…</p>

<blockquote data-secret="B7Y2KfHH5z"><p><a href="https://www.richmondreview.co.uk/">Best Non GamStop Casinos 2024 – Casinos Not On Gamstop UK</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The ‘best non gamstop casinos’ page is just the UK equivalent of ‘casinos utan spelpaus’ or ‘casino utan svensk licens’ but aimed at a UK audience.</p>
<p>These are drop domains, purchased partly because their relationship with local press, local government, charity activity and so on confers additional domain authority. (Richmond Review used to be a literary magazine.) They also usually have authoritative links. It’s the same reason sites used to fall over themselves to get inlinks from obscure American universities; those .edu domains translated to rank. Here, Finixio is refitting dead magazines and charity sites as nodes in a redirect network.</p>
<p>In this redirect chain, you eventually end up at CoinTelegraph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph.jpg" alt="techopedia redirect to cointelegraph" width="1899" height="1238" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph.jpg 1899w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph-300x196.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph-1024x668.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph-768x501.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph-1536x1001.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/techopedia-redirect-to-cointelegraph-1200x782.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>Here’s a video of the redirect in real time:</p>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Video-connecting-Techopedia-with-Cointelegraph.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<p>CoinTelegraph has a special place in this story, as I mentioned earlier. Finixio doesn’t own CoinTelegraph. Instead, I believe Finixio has entered into a financial partnership with them, paying to put their content on a site with high domain authority.</p>
<p>Why do I believe that?</p>
<p>First, the redirect. I don’t think Finixio is redirecting links to sites out of the goodness of their heart.</p>
<p>Second, there’s recently-added content on CoinTelegraph’s iGaming section that looks very familiar.</p>
<p>That page went up on December 15. What’s there?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th.jpg" alt="cointelegraph casino utan svensk licens live dec 15th" width="2048" height="730" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th-300x107.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th-1024x365.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th-768x274.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th-1536x548.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-casino-utan-svensk-licens-live-dec-15th-1200x428.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/casino/utan-svensk-licens/">https://cointelegraph.com/casino/utan-svensk-licens/</a></p>
<p>The text at the top of the page isn’t the same as the Techopedia page with the near-identical URL that I looked at further up. (And it’s hardly incriminating to use good URL practices.)</p>
<p>But what comes next is a list of best casinos by category:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist.jpg" alt="cointelegraph toplist" width="1880" height="1716" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist.jpg 1880w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist-300x274.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist-1024x935.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist-768x701.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist-1536x1402.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cointelegraph-toplist-1200x1095.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px">That’s ‘best casinos without a Swedish license’ (for the casino; you don’t need a license to gamble in Sweden); ‘casinos with fast signup’; ‘MGA (Malta Gaming Authority) casinos without a Swedish licence’: ‘new casinos’; ‘pay and play casinos’; and ‘betting sites without a Swedish licence.’</p>
<p>It’s cool to have such a wide choice.</p>
<p>Except that whichever one you click on, you wind up here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_.jpg" alt="toplist on cointelegraph takes you to topcasinosites.eu" width="2048" height="1384" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_-300x203.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_-768x519.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_-1536x1038.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/toplist-on-cointelegraph-takes-you-to-topcasinosites.eu_-1200x811.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><a href="https://topcasinosites.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://topcasinosites.eu</a>/</p>
<p>(Yes, I have tested them all.)</p>
<p>There are three versions of the toplist here, ‘Popular,’ ‘Telegram casino,’ and ‘Tax free.’ In the popular list, the top spot goes to Instant Casino, which is a fixture in the toplists of Finixio sites and which I strongly suspect they control through a shell company. I’ve seen redirected traffic from Finixio assets to Instant Casino too, which I cover in my original post.</p>
<p>That would fit the pattern, because the Telegram casino on offer (there’s just one) is Lucky Block.</p>

<p>Lucky Block isn’t owned by Finixio, but nearly all its C suite double as Finixio C suite, often in the same roles. James Thatcher is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-t-01538520/">Lucky Block’s CTO</a> — and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-t-01538520/">Head of Technology at Finixio</a> and Chief Technologist at Clickout Media; Nelson Campelo is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelson-campelo-2590ba90/">growth manager</a>, at Lucky Block, Finixio, and Clickout. The exception is Lucky Block’s&nbsp; CEO, Scott Ryder, who is Finixio’s head of business development. (Through a shell company in the Cayman islands, <a href="https://online.ciregistry.gov.ky/cos/faces/home?_adf.no-new-window-redirect=true">he also owns Lucky Block</a>.)</p>
<p>The sudden appearance of these pages on CoinTelegraph that link out to topcasinosites.eu strongly indicate that Finixio simply diverted the flow of its SEO efforts around the penalty it was subjected to.</p>
<h3>And the link profile of topcasinosites.eu is interesting too:</h3>

<p>Look what’s here: readwrite.com, spaceportsweden.com. Some of these are suspected Finixio assets, like casinoutanspelpaus.ltd, while others are known and confirmed. But something else is going on here.</p>
<h3>The strange case of the Augusta Free Press, and why it’s not even that unusual</h3>
<p>Is that another drop domain? No, it’s not:</p>

<p><a href="https://augustafreepress.com/">https://augustafreepress.com/</a></p>
<p>It’s a news site that still seems to be regularly updated, with stories on the front page of the site from just a few days ago. It covers the action in Augusta County and environs, in the Shenandoah Valley, in the US state of Virginia. So what’s the deal with its link to an EU casino site? Doesn’t seem like a natural link. And ‘online casino sites’ doesn’t seem like its normal remit. I’m saying amongst those local-news items about tax changes, sports and the odds of a white Christmas, it seems a little out of place.</p>
<p>Here’s the page:</p>

Two things really jump out at me here. First, this is on the site’s Korean section, which, again, seems a bit beyond their normal beat.</p>
<p>‘Covering Augusta County, western Virginia, and Seoul.’</p>
<p>See what I mean? Secondly, check out the list of casinos for some old friends: Instant Casino and Lucky Block both make the list.</p>
<p>Turns out the Augusta Free Press has a bunch of international pages, including Russia which for some reason is above the USA…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-international-pages-including-russia.jpg" alt="augusta free press international pages including russia" width="586" height="748" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-international-pages-including-russia.jpg 586w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-international-pages-including-russia-235x300.jpg 235w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 586px) 85vw, 586px">Here’s the Russian page:</p>

Sample page with the default sample text, and a dropdown nav that’s just OnlyFans? Class act.</p>
<p>OK, what about the other international pages?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page.jpg" alt="augusta free press 404 page" width="2048" height="437" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page-300x64.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page-1024x219.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page-768x164.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page-1536x328.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/augusta-free-press-404-page-1200x256.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></p>
<p>This is what we find. Canada is just missing, with gambling rather than OnlyFans at the top. Most other international pages are the same, with the odd exception like the Phillipines:</p>

Which consists of a single page, the one we’ve already seen. Put <a href="http://augustafreepress.com/ko">augustafreepress.com/ko</a> in your browser and check it out. You’ll instantly be redirected to that page.</p>
<p>By itself, this doesn’t matter much. But it’s part of a much bigger pattern.</p>
<p>Augusta Free Press is far from the only inlink to topcasinosites.eu that acts this way. In amongst sites like <a href="http://wallstreetonline-finixio.com/bitcoin-casino-im-vergleich-die-besten-drei-seriosen-btc-casinos/">wallstreetonline-finixio.com/bitcoin-casino-im-vergleich-die-besten-drei-seriosen-btc-casinos/</a>, which may be owned by Finixio, the list of inbound links includes:</p>
<p><a href="http://outlookindia.com/igaming/se/casino-utan-svensk-licens/">outlookindia.com/igaming/se/casino-utan-svensk-licens/</a>, Outlook India has been publishing marketing material for years. To get a post on there, you simply pay, and it then outperforms nearly every other piece of content on the web for that keyword.</p>
<p><a href="http://business2communitykorea.com/visit/crypto-casinos">business2communitykorea.com/visit/crypto-casinos</a>, and B2C is definitely a Finixio/Clickout asset.</p>
<p><a href="http://goldencasinonews.com/casino-utan-svensk-licens/">goldencasinonews.com/casino-utan-svensk-licens/</a>, previously owned by Finixio, now owned by Clickout Media, a distinction without a difference.</p>
<p>There’s also this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens.jpg" alt="east bay times casino utan svensk licens" width="2048" height="1680" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens-300x246.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens-1024x840.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens-768x630.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens-1536x1260.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/east-bay-times-casino-utan-svensk-licens-1200x984.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><br>

<p>Like Augusta Free Press, the East Bay Times is a regional paper gone digital: big enough to survive the destruction of local papers that took place in the 2000s, too small to live on its subscribers like the <i>NYT, </i>would be my guess. So like its Shenandoah cousin, and like Forbes and however many other media sites, it has a sponsored content section. And despite being based in San Francisco, where there isn’t… that big a Swedish community, it’s a Swedish-language page about Swedish gambling laws.</p>
<p>The author is Vlad Grindu, described as a ‘seasoned journalist.’ Let’s see his other work on the site.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles.jpg" alt="eastbaytimes Vlad Grindu all articles" width="1898" height="2048" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles.jpg 1898w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles-278x300.jpg 278w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles-949x1024.jpg 949w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles-768x829.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles-1424x1536.jpg 1424w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eastbaytimes-Vlad-Grindu-all-articles-1200x1295.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/author/vlad-grindu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.eastbaytimes.com/author/vlad-grindu/</a></p>
<p>What does this tell us? First, Vlad put in a day’s work on June 21. Second, this is just link farming for Finixio/Clickout assets.</p>
<p>This page:<a href="http://.eastbaytimes.com/2024/02/14/online-casinos-real-money-australia/">.eastbaytimes.com/2024/02/14/online-casinos-real-money-australia/</a> links to Lucky Block, among other casino sites. This page: <a href="http://eastbaytimes.com/2023/12/19/casinos-not-on-gamstop/">eastbaytimes.com/2023/12/19/casinos-not-on-gamstop/</a> links to Mega Dice, known to be affiliated with Finixio. And so on.</p>
<p>This is just placing content on sites, though — standard low-level parasite SEO.</p>
<p>CoinTelegraph is quite different, though.</p>
<h2>CoinTelegraph’s iGaming section and the Forbes Marketplace playbook</h2>

<p>That’s because the igaming portion of the site is separate from the rest of the site. One way you can check that is to click on the logo in the header to return to the homepage. Here’s what should happen:</p>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/normal-logo-cointelegraph.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<p>I’m on the homepage, navigate to another page, then click the logo and it takes me back to the homepage. That’s been a standard of web design for so long I can’t remember a time when you didn’t expect a site to work that way.</p>
<p>But watch what happens when I’m in the iGaming portion of the site:</p>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/igaming-logo-cointelegraph.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<p>Nothing. The logo isn’t responsive, but you can see the rest of the navigation bar works as normal.</p>
<p>Here’s the code, for the homepage:</p>

<p>The sources are different too. These are the sources for the actual CoinTelegraph:</p>

<p>The iGaming portion of the site doesn’t have many named authors, but it does have some. The English site has a ton of foreign language pages, all aimed squarely at gambling.</p>
<p>One named author stands out to me, so I took a look at her LinkedIn:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/graziella-calleja-seo-content-writer-clickoutmedia.jpg" alt="graziella calleja seo content writer clickoutmedia" width="915" height="1850" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/graziella-calleja-seo-content-writer-clickoutmedia.jpg 915w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/graziella-calleja-seo-content-writer-clickoutmedia-148x300.jpg 148w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/graziella-calleja-seo-content-writer-clickoutmedia-506x1024.jpg 506w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/graziella-calleja-seo-content-writer-clickoutmedia-768x1553.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/graziella-calleja-seo-content-writer-clickoutmedia-760x1536.jpg 760w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px">Yep, she’s a Clickout employee.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looked like when I went back today to get a better screenshot:</p>

<p>The ClickOut connection? Gone. Scrubbed. Should we look for multiple Clickout staff to be going undercover like this, hiding their affiliation with the organization? Not for now.</p>
<p>Here’s Lucas Wallman, author at business2community.com:</p>

<p>Watch this space, but it certainly looks like management-level Clickout staff aren’t hiding.</p>
<p>What we can say for sure is that CoinTelegraph is doing a Forbes, and Clickout is doing a Forbes Marketplace: using an established website with a good reputation as a cover for promoting gambling services that are totally unrelated to the site’s actual function. This is the definition of site reputation abuse, according to Google. Everyone else just calls it parasite SEO. Being penalized hasn’t stopped them, they’ve just shifted their operation slightly and kept on pulling in traffic and making money.</p>
<h2>Just buy some new websites</h2>
<p>We’ve already seen how Finixio/Clickout have leveraged their existing network of websites, continuing to profit from the parasite activities even while they’re under penalty and even stepping up their operations. They’ve moved into CoinTelegraph’s iGaming section and set up shop. But I think there’s reason to believe they’ve also bought a lot of new websites too.</p>
<p>For example, Cardplayer.com, a site previously focused on online poker. Here’s its original sitemap:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap.jpg" alt="cardplayer sitemap" width="1590" height="1226" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap.jpg 1590w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap-300x231.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap-1024x790.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap-768x592.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap-1536x1184.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-sitemap-1200x925.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><a href="https://www.cardplayer.com/sitemap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cardplayer.com/sitemap</a></p>
<p>Note the strong focus on poker. Now it has a new, Swedish subdirectory, with seven pages:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap.jpg" alt="cardplayer xml sitemap" width="2048" height="339" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap-300x50.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap-1024x170.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap-768x127.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap-1536x254.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cardplayer-xml-sitemap-1200x199.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><a href="https://www.cardplayer.com/se/page-sitemap.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cardplayer.com/se/page-sitemap.xml</a></p>
<p>None of these show up in Wayback at all, which isn’t proof that they’re new but does reinforce the idea. Yes, there’s still plenty of poker here, but /casino-utan-svensk-licens? Sounds familiar. I wonder where it links to.</p>
<p><video controls="controls" width="300" height="150"><source src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/clicking-on-toplist-cardplayer.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p>

<p>This also looks very familiar. Like as if Finixio has added some new sites to its network, all designed to funnel traffic (and ranking signals) to this casino page, which in turn leads visitors into a network of crypto gambling sites.</p>
<p>pokerscout.com is in a similar position. This is another site with a historical focus on, well, poker.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage.jpg" alt="pokerscout homepage" width="2048" height="1558" srcset="https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage.jpg 2048w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage-300x228.jpg 300w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage-1024x779.jpg 1024w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage-768x584.jpg 768w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage-1536x1169.jpg 1536w, https://recleudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pokerscout-homepage-1200x913.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><a href="https://www.pokerscout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pokerscout.com/</a></p>
<p>I feel like they’re not really hiding that fact either.</p>
<p>They have multiple country- and US state-specific pages in their homepage dropdown navigation:</p>

<p>Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>There are one or two weird things about topcasinosites.eu/. One is, a Google site: search doesn’t turn up anything.</p>

These are normally used by devs to prevent indexing of pages in progress or pages like checkout pages that shouldn’t be showing up in search. I get that this is a lander and they don’t want it to rank, but disappearing it from Google’s vision is not the normal approach.</p>
<h2>A complex ecosystem — optimized for parasites</h2>
<p>Finixio/Clickout have built an empire in the space Google has laid out for them. If it’s true that every complex ecosystem develops parasites, it’s also true that whoever administers that ecosystem lays out the parameters that will shape those parasites. And Google’s own algorithmic changes have shaped the space in which Finixio/Clickout thrive.</p>
<p>In some cases that means buying up teetering tech sites, often sites that have already changed hands and direction from their original owners and mission, and turning them into fronts for their real business, which is crypto and gambling. In some cases, it’s buying space on major websites to put up content that serves the same purpose.&nbsp; A bunch of the deals they’ve struck are with midsize, regional media outlets that are doing what Forbes was doing. They have the actual media website, covering local news, politics, sports, and so on; then they have a separate section of the website that’s basically a reputation auction, where anyone willing to stump up can get their content published. The website gets a replacement for the advertising revenue that’s been drying up, thanks to the Google-Facebook stranglehold on digital advertising. The marketers who use that section of the site get to parasitise on its domain authority to bypass the increasing impossibility of ranking on content alone.</p>
<p>And that’s the real issue. A slew of recent Google overcorrections first drove user-generated content to the top of search rankings, such that a random query’s search results is now almost certain to include Quora and Reddit results. There’s a theory that this was propelled by user requests, as Google become increasingly poor at delivering usable search results to users. My own feeling is that it was more about getting material to train their AI on. But in order not to just become a foyer to a couple of social media sites, Google then had to do something — and what they did was massively discount topical authority.</p>
<p>The loss of topical authority as a significant ranking signal compared to domain authority has been a process, it hasn’t happened overnight. But as it’s happened it has driven small and midsize websites and blogs into the ground and left domain authority as the main route to ranking and thus to traffic. You really can’t blame people for swimming with the tide on this. While domain authority outranks all, efforts to combat parasite SEO will just be pushing water uphill. Only the restoration of algorithmic respect for topical authority, eroded since the ‘helpful content’ update, will actually change the landscape.</p>
<p>To get back to specifics, I’ve tried to tell the story of how one major parasite SEO player got out from under penalties, and how they reoriented their assets to continue to make money from them even while they were penalized. This is impressive work, from a technical standpoint, and while the algorithm works the way it does, it’s inevitable. But will they be penalized again? Will Google catch them in the act a second time? And will they get out of it, in profit and in just a few days?</p>

So I published an article here called </span><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-fake-artists-problem-is-much" rel="">“The Fake Artists Problem Is Much Worse Than You Realize.”</a></p><p>I was careful not to make accusations I couldn’t prove. But I pointed out some puzzling facts.</p><p>Many of these artists live in Sweden—where Spotify has its headquarters. According to one source, a huge amount of streaming music originates from just 20 people, who operate under 500 different names.</p><p><span>Some of them were generating supersized numbers. An obscure Swedish jazz musician got more plays than most of the tracks on Jon Batiste’s </span><em>We Are</em><span>—which had just won the Grammy for Album of the Year (not just the best jazz album, but the best album in </span><em>any</em><span> genre).</span></p><p>How was that even possible?</p><p><span>I continued to make inquiries, and brooded over this strange situation. But</span><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/spotify-gives-49-different-names" rel=""> something even stranger happened a few months later</a><span>.</span></p><p>A listener noticed that he kept hearing the same track over and over on Spotify. But when he checked the name of the song, it was always different. Even worse, these almost identical tracks were attributed to different artists and composers.</p><p><span>He </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3wLm5nlYrHkbd29ilMRq89?si=e6f3299113e34bb9" rel="">created a playlist</a><span>, and soon had 49 different versions of this song under various names. The titles sounded as if they had come out of a random text generator—almost as if the goal was to make them hard to remember. </span></p><ul><li><p>Trumpet Bumblefig</p></li><li><p>Bumble Mistywill</p></li><li><p>Whomping Clover</p></li><li><p>Qeazpoor</p></li><li><p>Swiftspark</p></li><li><p>Vattio Bud</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/spotify-gives-49-different-names" rel="">I reported on this odd situation</a><span>. Others joined in the hunt, and </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2haHwyJ3pT5COriXW9z0dT?si=b9GjincIRYuiV5j1lXcE4w" rel="">found more versions</a><span> of the track under still different names. </span></p><p>The track itself was boring and non-descript, but it was showing up everywhere on the platform. </p><p>Around this same time, I started hearing jazz piano playlists on Spotify that disturbed me. Every track sounded like it was played on the same instrument with the exact same touch and tone. Yet the names of the artists were all different.</p><p>Were these AI generated? Was Spotify doing this to avoid paying royalties to human musicians?</p><p><span>Spotify </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/spotify-fake-artist-allegations-response-7858015/" rel="">issued a statement</a><span> in the face of these controversies. But I couldn’t find any denial that they were playing games with playlists in order to boost profits.</span></p><p>By total coincidence, Spotify’s profitability started to improve markedly around this time. </p><p>A few months ago, I spoke with an editor at one of the largest newspapers in the world. I begged him to put together a team of investigative journalists to get to the bottom of this. </p><p>“You need to send people to Sweden. You need to find sources. You need to find out what’s really going on.”</p><p>He wasn’t interested in any of that. He just wanted a spicy opinon piece. I declined his invitation to write it.</p><p>We now finally have the ugly truth on these fake artists—but no thanks to Spotify. Or to that prestigious newspaper whose editor I petitioned. </p><p><span>Instead journalist </span><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/" rel="">Liz Pelly has conducted an in-depth investigation, and published her findings in </a><em><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/" rel="">Harper’s</a></em><span>—they are part of her forthcoming book </span><em><a href="https://lizpelly.info/book" rel="">Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist</a></em><span>. </span></p><p><em>Mood Machine</em><span> will show up in bookstores in January and may finally wake up the music industry to the dangers it faces.</span></p><p>Pelly started by knocking on the doors of these mysterious viral artists in Sweden.</p><p>Guess what? Nobody wanted to talk. At least not at first. </p><p>But Pelly kept pursuing this story for a year. She convinced former employees to reveal what they knew. She got her hands on internal documents. She read Slack messages from the company. And she slowly put the pieces together. </p><p><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/" rel="">Now she writes</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>What I uncovered was an elaborate internal program. Spotify, I discovered, not only has partnerships with a web of production companies, which, as one former employee put it, provide Spotify with “music we benefited from financially,” but also a team of employees working to seed these tracks on playlists across the platform. In doing so, they are effectively working to grow the percentage of total streams of music that is cheaper for the platform. </p></blockquote><p>In other words, Spotify has gone to war against musicians and record labels. </p><p>At Spotify they call this the “Perfect Fit Content” (PFC) program. Musicians who provide PFC tracks “must often give up control of certain royalty rights that, if a track becomes popular, could be highly lucrative.”</p><p>Spotify apparently targeted genres where they could promote passive consumption. They identified situations in which listeners use playlists for background music. That’s why I noticed the fake artists problem first in my jazz listening.</p><p>According to Pelly, the focal points of PFC were “ambient, classical, electronic, jazz, and lo-fi beats.”</p><p><span>When some employees expressed concerns about this, Spotify managers replied (</span><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/" rel="">according to Pelly’s sources</a><span>) that “listeners wouldn’t know the difference.”</span></p><p>They called it payola in the 1950s. The public learned that radio deejays picked songs for airplay based on cash kickbacks, not musical merit.</p><p>Music fans got angry and demanded action. In 1959, both the US Senate and House launched investigations. Famous deejay Alan Freed got fired from WABC after refusing to sign a statement claiming that he had never taken bribes.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png" width="912" height="626" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:626,&quot;width&quot;:912,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:559897,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;News headline from 1959&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="News headline from 1959" title="News headline from 1959" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff629fd47-74e7-4346-99ac-b78e383e6621_912x626.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>They called it Payola, and people got fired</figcaption></figure></div><p>Transactions nowadays are handled more delicately—and seemingly in full compliance with the laws.

But we need more than that.</p><p>Congress should investigate ethical violations at music streaming businesses—just like they did with payola. Laws must be passed requiring full transparency. Even better, let’s prevent huge streaming platforms from promoting songs based on financial incentives.</p><p>I don’t do that as a critic. People sometimes try to offer me money for coverage, and I tell them off. It happened again this week, and I got upset. No honest person could take those payoffs.</p><p>Streaming platforms ought to have similar standards. And if they won’t do it voluntarily, legislators and courts should force their hand.</p><p>And let me express a futile wish that the major record labels will find a spine. They need to create an alternative—even if it requires an antitrust exemption from Congress (much like major league sports). </p><p>Our single best hope is a cooperative streaming platform owned by labels and musicians. Let’s reclaim music from the technocrats. They have not proven themselves worthy of our trust. </p><p>If the music industry ‘leaders’ haven’t figured that out by now—especially after the latest revelations—we are in bad shape indeed.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
