        <p>
            The discovery that other vertebrates have healthy, microbial brains is fueling the still controversial possibility that we might have them as well.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Bacteria are in, around and all over us. They thrive in almost every corner of the planet, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to high up in the clouds, to the crevices of your ears, mouth, nose and gut. But scientists have long assumed that bacteria can’t survive in the human brain. The powerful blood-brain barrier, the thinking goes, keeps the organ mostly free from outside invaders. But are we sure that a healthy human brain doesn’t have a microbiome of its own?</p>
<p>Over the last decade, initial studies have presented conflicting evidence. The idea has remained controversial, given the difficulty of obtaining healthy, uncontaminated human brain tissue that could be used to study possible microbial inhabitants.</p>
<p>Recently, a study published in <em>Science Advances</em> provided the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado0277">strongest evidence yet</a> that a brain microbiome can and does exist in healthy vertebrates — fish, specifically. Researchers at the University of New Mexico discovered communities of bacteria thriving in salmon and trout brains. Many of the microbial species have special adaptations that allow them to survive in brain tissue, as well as techniques to cross <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">the protective blood-brain barrier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/matthew-r-olm">Matthew Olm</a>, a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was not involved with the study, is “inherently skeptical” of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. “This is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,” he said. “And so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.”</p>
<p>While fish physiology is, in many ways, similar to humans’, there are some key differences. Still, “it certainly puts another weight on the scale to think about whether this is relevant to mammals and us,” said <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/christopher-d-link">Christopher Link</a>, who studies the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was also not involved in the work.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The human gut microbiome plays a critical role in the body, communicating with the brain and maintaining the immune system through <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-the-guts-second-brain-key-agents-of-health-emerge-20231121/">the gut-brain axis</a>. So it isn’t totally far-fetched to suggest that microbes could play an even larger role in our neurobiology.</p>
<h2><strong>Fishing for Microbes</strong></h2>
<p>For years, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/irenesalinasremiro/">Irene Salinas</a> has been fascinated by a simple physiological fact: The distance between the nose and the brain is quite small. The evolutionary immunologist, who works at the University of New Mexico, studies mucosal immune systems in fish to better understand how human versions of these systems, such as our intestinal lining and nasal cavity, work. The nose, she knows, is loaded with bacteria, and they’re “really, really close” to the brain — mere millimeters from the olfactory bulb, which processes smell. Salinas has always had a hunch that bacteria might be leaking from the nose into the olfactory bulb. After years of curiosity, she decided to confront her suspicion in her favorite model organisms: fish.</p>
<p>Salinas and her team started by extracting DNA from the olfactory bulbs of trout and salmon, some caught in the wild and some raised in her lab. They planned to look up the DNA sequences in a database to identify any microbial species.</p>
<p>These kinds of samples, however, are easily contaminated — by bacteria in the lab or from other parts of a fish’s body — which is why scientists have struggled to study this subject effectively. If they did find bacterial DNA in the olfactory bulb, they would have to convince themselves and other researchers that it truly originated in the brain.</p>

<p>To cover their bases, Salinas’ team studied the fishes’ whole-body microbiomes, too. They sampled the rest of the fishes’ brains, guts and blood; they even drained blood from the many capillaries of the brain to make sure that any bacteria they discovered resided in the brain tissue itself.</p>
<p>“We had to go back and redo [the experiments] many, many times just to be sure,” Salinas said. The project took five years — but even in the early days it was clear that the fish brains weren’t barren.</p>
<p>As Salinas expected, the olfactory bulb hosted some bacteria. But she was shocked to see that the rest of the brain had even more. “I thought the other parts of the brain wouldn’t have bacteria,” she said. “But it turned out that my hypothesis was wrong.” The fish brains hosted so much that it took only a few minutes to locate bacterial cells under a microscope. As an additional step, her team confirmed that the microbes were actively living in the brain; they weren’t dormant or dead.</p>
<p>Olm was impressed by their thorough approach. Salinas and her team circled “the same question, from all these different ways, using all these different methods — all of which produced convincing data that there actually are living microbes in the salmon brain,” he said.</p>
<p>But if there are, how did they get there?</p>
<h2><strong>Invading the Fortress</strong></h2>
<p>Researchers have long been skeptical that the brain could have a microbiome because all vertebrates, including fish, have <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">a blood-brain barrier</a>. These blood vessels and surrounding brain cells are fortified to serve as gatekeepers that allow only some molecules in and out of the brain and keep invaders, especially larger ones like bacteria, out. So Salinas naturally wondered how the brains in her study had been colonized.</p>

<p>By comparing microbial DNA from the brain to that collected from other organs, her lab found a subset of species that didn’t appear elsewhere in the body. Salinas hypothesized that these species may have colonized the fish brains early in their development, before their blood-brain barriers had fully formed. “Early on, anything can go in; it’s a free-for-all,” she said.</p>
<p>But many of the microbial species were also found throughout the body. She suspects that most bacteria in the fishes’ brain microbiomes originated in their blood and guts, and continuously leak into the brain.</p>
<p>“After that first wave of colonization,” she said, “you need to have specific features to go in and out.”</p>
<p>Salinas was able to identify features that let bacteria make the crossing. Some could produce molecules, known as polyamines, that can open and close junctions, which are like little doors in the barrier that allow molecules to pass through. Others could produce molecules that help them evade the body’s immune response or compete with other bacteria.</p>
<p>Salinas even caught a bacterium in the act. Looking under the microscope, she captured an image of a bacterium frozen in time within the blood-brain barrier. “We literally caught it right in the middle of crossing,” she said.</p>
<p>It is possible that the microbes don’t live freely in the brain tissue but are engulfed by immune cells. That would be the “most boring interpretation of this paper,” Olm said, and would suggest that the fish have adapted to bacterial inhabitants by containing them.</p>
<p>However, if the bacteria are free-living, they could be involved in the body’s processes beyond the brain. It’s possible that the microbes actively regulate aspects of the creatures’ physiology, Salinas suggested, the way human gut microbiomes help regulate the digestive and immune systems.</p>
<p>Fish, of course, are not humans, but they allow a fair comparison, Salinas said. And her work suggests that if fish have microbes living in their brains, it’s possible we have them, too.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <h2><strong>Impenetrable or Not?</strong></h2>
<p>Bacteria have been found living in just about every human organ system, but to many scientists the brain is a step too far. The blood-brain barrier has traditionally been seen as “impenetrable,” said <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/biotechnology/people/janosch-heller">Janosch Heller</a>, who studies the barrier at Dublin City University and was not involved in the new research. Plus, the brain has immune cells working overtime to zap any potentially harmful invaders. When microbes have been found in the human brain, they are are associated with active infections or typically linked to a breakdown in the barrier due to diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>This assumption was challenged in 2013, when scientists studying the neurological impacts of HIV/AIDS found genetic hints of bacteria in the brains of both sick and healthy people. The findings were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054673">the first to suggest</a> that maybe humans could have a brain microbiome in the absence of disease.</p>

<p>“No one believed it 10 years ago,” Heller said. Follow-up studies — there haven’t been many — have been inconclusive. “It is very easy to trick yourself into thinking microbes are present because microbial DNA is essentially everywhere,” Olm said. “So it would take a lot of evidence to convince me that it does exist.”</p>
<p>The fish experiment did convince him, and other researchers, that a human brain microbiome is not impossible. What is nearly impossible, however, is confirming that without harming healthy people. To build a case, Link suggested repeating the fish experiment in rodents. “This protocol should be able to be adapted really easily to mouse brains,” Salinas said — and indeed her team has started looking into it. They have found early hints that microbes exist in the olfactory bulbs of healthy mice and, to a lesser extent, throughout the brain.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason, if fish have them, that you wouldn’t have them, or that mice wouldn’t have them,” Link said. If microbes have adapted to cross the fish blood-brain barrier and survive in the fish brain, they could do the same in our bodies. It’s unlikely they would be present at the same levels as they are in fish, he added, “but that doesn’t mean there’s none.”</p>
        
        
<p>Even in small numbers, Link said, resident microbes could influence our brain metabolism and immune systems. If they are truly present, this would suggest an extra layer of neurological regulation that we didn’t know existed. We already know that microbes influence our neurobiology: Right now, microbes in your gut are <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-the-guts-second-brain-key-agents-of-health-emerge-20231121/">modulating your brain activity</a> through the gut-brain axis by producing metabolites that are sensed by enteric neurons winding through your digestive system.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating, though unproved, proposition that bacteria in the brain are directly impacting our physiology. However, thanks to research like Salinas’, more scientists are open to the idea that healthy human brains might also be home to microbes.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Heller said. “I’m not shocked anymore that they are there.” The more interesting question, he said, is: “Are they all there for a reason, or are they there by mistake?”</p>

We help developers give their software the sense of sight. Our end-to-end platform [1] provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.</p><p>Over 1 million engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models [2]. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill [3] and Supervision [4]. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog [5] and YouTube channel [6].</p><p>We have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy &amp; we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can "choose their own loss function". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders &amp; problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)</p><p>We're currently hiring for full-stack engineers to help build our product, field engineers that work directly with our customers to solve their business needs with computer vision, and several technical roles on the sales team.</p><p>We just raised our Series B round, led by GV. With this round, we will continue building the open source tools, platform, and community so developers and enterprises can deploy computer vision applications to production.

<p>During one of his “yes or no” Instagram Q&amp;As, Scott Rao lamented the declining quality of Kenyan coffees over the last three years—a sentiment I’ve heard echoed by buyers across Europe, the US, and Australia. He kicked a different question over to me about whether cultivar or microclimate or process has the greatest cup impact, and I demurred, offering that the relationship is gestalt but that processing ultimately had the final say —invoking Kenya’s declining cup quality as an example.</p>



<p>In our DMs, I shared with Scott my theory about the cause of this phenomenon—and noted that it was connected to some of the challenges of working there as a coffee buyer. He suggested I write a blog about it—a suggestion that I got from more than a dozen of my followers later that night.</p>



<p>So here it is.</p>



<p>Kenyan coffee holds a special place in the hearts and minds of specialty coffee buyers and roasters. Coffees from Kenya are prized for their physical density, long shelf life, vibrant acidity, intense cup profile, and often, distinctive aromatics like currant (or tomato—depending who you ask).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve written about the most memorable coffee I’ve ever cupped—<a href="https://christopherferan.com/2020/02/18/so-a-coffee-walks-into-a-sauna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the one that got away</a>. It was a Kenyan.</p>



<p>The most common theory explaining the apparent decline in quality of Kenyan coffees rests the blame with an increase in Ruiru 11 and Batian in the lots (and, concurrently, a decline in SL-28 and SL-34). I’ve <a href="https://christopherferan.com/2021/03/02/missing-the-forest-for-a-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written about that too</a> (about halfway through) and don’t buy that argument.</p>



<p>And besides—looking at the export lots available from many of the more famous estates and associations, as well as <a href="https://afca.coffee/african-taste-of-harvest/#kenya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">African Taste of Harvest</a> winners—it’s clear that many (if not most) contain at least some of these hybrids.</p>



<p>I don’t buy it.</p>



<hr>



<p>Kenya is a tricky place to work as a buyer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in some origins, a smallholder would be able to grow and process their coffee as they please and then have a choice to either sell that parchment or dried cherry to any exporter in the country for immediate payment—or even secure their own export license and self-export—producers in Kenya are removed from the commercial market, their coffee passing through a Byzantine and colonial export system that centralizes sales through an auction system with exporters in the position of greatest power, sacrificing traceability and financial transparency along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means we can’t work directly—not really, anyway—and have to navigate through the labyrinth of the auction system to secure the coffees we want, all the while wondering where the $5 or $6 or $7 per pound we’re paying is really going.</p>



<p>Coffee wasn’t something that was native to Kenya or even traditionally grown there—even as Kenya shares a border with Uganda (home of robusta) and Ethiopia (the birthplace of Arabica). Though first introduced to Kenya in 1893 by John Paterson on behalf of the Scottish Mission from seeds obtained from the British East India Company, the completion of the Ugandan Railway and arrival of European settlers ultimately led to the introduction of plantation agriculture and large-scale cultivation of cash crops like tea, wheat, sisal—and coffee. As a colony of the British crown, the settlers were tasked with paying for construction of the railway and the export of coffee was expanded rapidly to settle the debt. </p>



<p>By 1912, Kiambu-Kikuyu boasted plantations several hundred acres in size.</p>



<p>Of the larger export companies still operating in Kenya, many have their roots in the colonial period, such as Dorman’s, which was founded in the 1950s, and Taylor Winch in the 1960s. I’ll never forget the first time I walked into the offices of these two companies and noted that the managers and people in charge were all white—either Europeans or white, Kenyan-born descendents of British settlers—and everyone cleaning up the cupping table when we were done was an indigenous Kenyan person (<em>one of the bosses of one of the companies—a white man, of course—was even wearing a khaki safari shirt. You just can’t make this shit up)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within hours of arriving in Nairobi for the first time, it was clear to me that coffee in Kenya still largely operated as an extractive, neo-colonialist enterprise.</p>



<p>In Kenya, if a producer has less than 5 acres, they legally need a coop or society to process and market their coffees. Historically, around 30% of coffee in Kenya comes from estates, with the remainder coming from some 400+ cooperative societies—but in recent years that number has shifted to 45% from Kenya’s roughly 24,000 estates and the remainder from around 85,000 smallholders (according to the Kenya Coffee Traders Association’s <em>Kenya Coffee Directory</em>).</p>



<p>The best co-ops might have financing available to producers as well as traceability and receipt systems in place to maintain some transparency as coffee passes through the export system. The societies own and operate the washing stations (there called factories) where their members’ coffee is processed (according to the export standards in the country, all export coffee must be washed).</p>



<p>After coffee has been fermented, washed and dried, movement permits are pulled (a legal requirement to transport coffee anywhere in the country) and it’s sent to one of the country’s eight mills, which is paid to remove the husk and sort the coffee to prepare for sale through the auction or an exporter.</p>



<p>In Kenya, though, millers cannot export themselves; coffee must pass through a “marketing agent” to make the sale to an exporter — a <em>bonus</em> middleman special to Kenya’s system.</p>



<p>The miller selects and hires the marketing agent, which is, in practice, very often one and the same entity. This system is lubricated through bribery: marketing agents pay allowance to board members of societies to get them to agree to market their coffee through that agent, which in turn affiliates them with an exporter. (It’s likely illegal, and some marketing agents such as Coffee Management Services/Dorman’s <em>insist</em> they don’t engage in the practice).</p>



<p>From there, the marketing agent markets the coffee on behalf of the society and miller to exporters to earn their 1.76-3% commission. </p>



<p>In Kenya, though, the coffee remains the property of the society until its final sale through auction or export, with fees deducted along the way. The remainder is paid to the society, which in turn takes its own cut and pays out the farmers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In effect, this means that a farmer whose coffee was harvested and processed in October and exported in March would not get paid until March or April—some six months later, and well into the flowering period for main crop. Any nutrients, amendments, fertilizers, or pesticides the farmer needs—let alone the costs of food, housing and living for themselves or their families—would need to be financed for that 6 month period prior to final payment from the exporter to the society and from the society to the farmer.</p>



<p>Commercial financing rates for coffee producers in Kenya are higher than 20%, effectively making them agricultural payday loans. Co-ops often offer lower rates—but still higher than 10%. These financing costs compound the actual cost of production for smallholders and diminish their profits once that final sale is complete.</p>



<p>And if a miller isn’t honest or reputable, out turns from the mill may be low—80% is quite common—lowering yields and driving up costs to the grower even further—and creating an opportunity for the miller’s pocket to be lined (which is the most fucking colonial British thing ever—it sort of reminds me of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-executions.htm" target="_blank">Elizabethan England where you’d tip your executioner</a> to ensure they did good, clean work and removed your head in one swing).</p>



<p>In order to improve the speed of payment, a society <em>could</em> do its own milling (for example, if they’re larger or a union member with access to resources) by building a mill or reactivating an unused mill at which point a society could get a grower/marketing license (likely while paying absurdly high interest rates on the capital they invested to build the mill)—however, according to the <em>Kenya Coffee Directory</em>, only 9 of these licenses have been issued.</p>



<p>But even then—the society still can’t export; they just control their own milling and keep that process control and the fee that would otherwise pass to a third party.</p>



<p>Most of the coffee that flows through auction system comes from as few as eight marketing agents, four of which are vertically-integrated and owned by subsidiaries of the major export players (like CMS which is owned by Dorman’s, Tropical which is owned by Neumann Group, and SMS which is owned by ECOM).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In total, at the time of my last visit to Kenya in 2016 there were just 45 export licenses for coffee in the entire country. The amount of money passed between entities to establish blocks of power in otherwise competing businesses is otherwise pretty staggering—money passing from one hand to the other in a scheme that effectively fixes prices paid to producers across the country and limits the ability of producers to sell their coffee freely in a competitive market.</p>



<p>For example, Dorman’s, which was founded in 1950 and is the oldest exporter in Kenya, used to be a part of Taylor Winch and ED&amp;F Man. It’s now independent, or so it says—but ECOM is its shareholder and financier in spite of the fact that ECOM has its own export license and separate marketing agent pipeline.</p>



<p>No matter which demon you sell to, it all ends up in the devil’s pocket.</p>



<p>Dorman’s supplies coffee to many of the most famous third wave roasters in the world<em> (I once got kicked out of a Dorman’s cupping because a certain Scandinavian guest of honor arrived and wanted a chance to cup the coffees first</em>) and offers certain advantages to societies that hire CMS to market their coffees.</p>



<p>By selling cherry through Dorman’s, producers get access to loans and pre-financing below commercial rates, as well as training on good agricultural practices and assistance getting certifications. Dorman’s extends these benefits as a way to access producers directly rather than having them sell to societies, though roughly 30% of all coffee that Dorman’s exports comes through cooperatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dorman’s might pay a society something in the realm of 85 shillings per kilo of cherry, or around $0.75-0.80 USD per kg—significantly higher than the country average of 65 shillings per kilo ($0.57-0.60).</p>



<p>On the high end this translates, roughly, to the equivalent of around $1.85 per pound of green coffee—a pretty good price, to be sure—though it pales in comparison with the $5-7 per pound most roasters are used to paying for Kenyan coffee.</p>



<p>But the average price paid to producers for cherry translates roughly to $1.42 per pound.</p>



<p>The best coops, where premiums of 85 shillings per kg are paid, might retain 5% of the sale, but it’s extremely common for coops to retain roughly 20% from the sale, leaving, in the typical case, just $1.13 per pound to a producer—well below their costs of production, even before the marketing agent’s 3%, or milling fees (roughly $70 per metric ton), or out turns, or financing costs that float a producer between harvests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seriously: Why bother?</p>

<p>About 25 years ago, Kenya’s coffee production was about triple what it is today. Some of that has to do with politics—the second president of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi, took away the support system for coffee as a mechanism to suppress opposition—some has to do with competing exports (like tea) being more lucrative or liquid, but largely, urban sprawl consumed lands used for coffee cultivation as Nairobi exploded in population from just 850,000 in 1980 to nearly 5 million in 2021:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kenya’s acreage under coffee production has decreased by over 30 percent from about 170,000 hectares in early 1990s to about 119,000 hectare in 2020. The production of the cash crop has also decreased by a whopping 70 percent from a peak of 129,000 metric tons in 1983-84 coffee year to about 40,000 metric tons currently. </p>
<cite>[<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/06/c_1310044505.htm" target="_blank">source</a>]</cite></blockquote>



<p>Why bother, indeed: why grow coffee when you can make a better living by selling your land?</p>



<p>But that’s a problem: declining production means declining efficiency, and most of the factories in Kenya were built to accommodate massive volume.</p>



<p>Until <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/06/c_1310044505.htm" target="_blank">recent reforms</a> in 2021, the style and process of coffee was dictated to producers, limiting their ability to refine processes as volumes fluctuated or account for new techniques, technologies, or the evolving tastes of buyers (as I understand it, it was illegal until recently to export natural processed Kenyan coffees for this reason).</p>



<p>At peak production, Kenyan factories faced issues and bottlenecks familiar to many coffee producers around the world—most often as it entered the phase of processing requiring the most space and time: drying. Even if conditions were right and if the coffee were dried in full sun, it could take 7-9 days for coffee to dry enough to move into storage. To break down pulp in a dry fermentation—as is the standard in Kenya—it might only take 12-20 hours.</p>



<p>This means that as cherry was received, it would pile up, awaiting drying. It’s kind of like when you’re try to do three loads of laundry in a side-by-side washer and drier: the wash cycle might only take 30-35 minutes but the drier might take an hour. You have to wait for the drier to finish before you can move your clothes over and begin the next cycle. But if you wait too long—the clothes (the cherry) will rot.</p>



<p>So what do you do?</p>



<p>You <em>could</em> build more space for drying—or you could engineer workarounds to elongate the first part of the process to synchronize when coffee exits drying and more coffee enters, in essence creating a buffer for drying space.</p>



<p>In Kenya, this meant the introduction of the “double washed” or “double fermented” style of coffee many buyers are familiar with. Coffee would be fermented dry for 12-24 hours, washed, and then sent to a holding tank where it would be soaked in clean, cool water for up to an additional 24 hours or longer (the so-called “secondary fermentation”). In some mills, after the initial 12-24 hour dry fermentation and washing, a second dry fermentation would occur before soaking. A single pass through the fermentation step, though — ferment, wash, soak — could theoretically extend the amount of time that coffee could hang out before drying by a day or two, enough time to delay sending the coffee to dry and allowing the factory to make space on drying tables.</p>



<p>One thing Lucia Solis and I have long disagreed about is the necessity or efficacy of the “second fermentation” in Kenyan style washed processes. Lucia argues that it’s inefficient, creating an additional step and prolonging the processing time and therefore unnecessarily increasing costs. She believes the same flavor profile could be generated using other techniques. </p>



<p>I counter that it was a technique that was, in fact, introduced to engineer a solution to capacity issues and therefore <em>is </em>efficient because it requires no additional infrastructure — merely idle time.&nbsp;Further, I believe there is merit to the notion that the soak functions as a “secondary fermentation” (though really it should be called a “sequential” fermentation process) producing a flavor profile that would be more difficult and riskier to achieve in a less time-intensive manner.</p>



<p>Coffee fermentations are, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://christopherferan.com/2020/05/04/sourdough-sour-coffee/" target="_blank">as I’ve discussed in the past</a>, mixed microbial fermentations involving “the activity of a wide range of microorganisms such as yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria (AAB), spore-forming bacteria, and molds.” (Masoud et al. 2004; Schwan and Wheals 2004; Nielsen et al. 2007, 2013). Typically, over the course of a coffee fermentation, the population dominant in the tank will modulate based on the environmental temperature, pH of the fermentation, availability of oxygen and nutrient, fermentable sugar concentration, and finally, ethanol content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While yeast is associated with degradation of the pectins in coffee mucilage, bacteria such as LAB and AAB are associated with the production of acids (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/%20fermentation7010009" target="_blank">Ruta,L.L.; Farcasanu,I.C. Coffee and Yeasts: From Flavor to Biotechnology. <em>Fermentation</em> 2021, 7, 9</a>). The specific fermentation kinetics dictate the microbial succession as different microbes will be better adapted for certain conditions at different times during the fermentation. At the onset of fermentation, lactic acid bacteria and yeast may grow in tandem, with LAB having a briefer (or no) lag phase and therefore producing metabolites before yeast has established. However, as a byproduct, in addition to lactic acid (which lowers the pH in the fermentation tank) LAB may produce—or enable production from other microorganisms—compounds that are toxic to LAB, leading the bacteria to die off or stagnate. Yeast, however, are more robust and would continue to ferment and replicate, and by virtue of their metabolism, continue to break down sugar and produce alcohol, carbon dioxide and (under ideal conditions) secondary metabolites.</p>



<p>This daisy chain of microbial activity creates a situation where the pH in the tank has dropped (probably to between 5-6), the moisture level has increased (as water is liberated from the disintegrating mucilage), there is quite a bit of ethanol (because of the yeast), and there is plenty of oxygen in the environment (because these fermentations are conducted uncovered and in ambient air). This is the most favorable set of conditions for the replication of AAB. Whether or not LAB continues its own metabolism, left unchecked, AAB will replicate and produce vinegar—rendering the resulting coffee defective.</p>



<p>But Kenyan processors introduced an extra step to interrupt this cycle halfway through—they washed the coffee (stripping away most of the food source for our fermenters, as well as the acids hanging out loose in the tank) and added fresh water (diluting the concentration of sugars thus inhibiting LAB and yeasts, decreasing availability of oxygen, and raising the pH). The temperature of the water is also cooler than that of the previous fermentation—and as we know from basic biology, lower temperatures result in slower metabolism of microorganisms (this is one of the main reasons that fridges help to stop spoilage).&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this means that Kenyan coffee producers were able to extend the time that coffee sat in the tank prior to drying without risking spoilage—solving the issue of needing to make the wash cycle last long enough to wait for the previous load of laundry to come out of the drier.</p>



<p>But there was an unexpected benefit: as the washed, previously-fermented coffee sat in the tank, it was still microbially charged. Yeast like <em>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</em>—a facultative anaerobe—would continue to replicate and produce alcohol underwater (though initially slower than before). With oxygen still readily available (whether dissolved in the water or through cellular oxygen), pH once again between 5-6 in the interstitial liquid, and with abundant ethanol from the previous and continuing fermentation, AAB once again kicked into gear and produced vinegar. Because it had to build population again, the initial rate of this production, though, would be low; and the water the coffee soaked in would mix with the vinegar produced by AAB and dilute it, meaning that the coffee would not spoil but would absorb just a small concentration of acetic acid from this production, while the other metabolites from the prior, dry fermentation redistributed and homogenized in the lot.</p>



<p>In low concentrations, humans perceive acetic acid as “fruity” or “floral” as well as quite sour. And in coffee, acetic acid is the only volatile organic acid present—helping to draw other volatile compounds in coffee toward the cupper and heightening the aromatic intensity of the coffee.</p>



<p>Much like the “signature” Kenyan profile.</p>



<p>But we’re not done: After the soak, the coffee would be put on raised beds in the sun in a thin layer to rapidly dry the surface water in a “pre dry” stage. This could very quickly—within a day or two—get the coffee down to ~45% moisture, accelerating the wet coffee through the most precarious stage of drying. The coffee would then be moved to the drying stage.</p>



<p>If there was not room on the drying beds, though, coffee that was partially dried—down to 20-24%—could be moved to a “holding pen” for up to several days—allowing the previous batch the opportunity to finish drying completely, and creating room on the skin drying tables for any incoming coffee exiting the soaking tanks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this “holding” of partially dried coffee would have <em>less</em> of an impact on quality<em> </em>per se (though microbial activity would continue at a lower level, and likely modulate toward filamentous fungi and yeasts) it would create an opportunity for intracellular moisture in the coffee—which was abundant due to soaking, but unevenly distributed due to the pre-drying step—to redistribute and homogenize before the coffee completed drying. The benefits of interrupted or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/130295/WOS000350408000016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">intermittent drying</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scielo.br/j/cagro/a/rCJyTYJSrwvkPhkKWhjHbsG/?format=pdf&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">resting periods during drying</a> have been well established—and this additional rest would, additionally, help to preserve and protect the coffee from fade by helping the coffee dry more uniformly after resting.</p>



<hr>



<p>Over the last four years, I’ve noticed a change in the character of the coffees from the coops I bought from—coops of whose coffee I’ve been cupping since 2013 or 2014 and thought I knew quite well. The mix of cultivars hadn’t changed, and they were being processed at the same factories and mills and through the same marketing agents and exporters as before.</p>



<p>But a couple things had changed: their volume of exports had slowly decreased, and the premiums we’d paid toward improving the infrastructure at the factories, as far as we could tell, had not actually resulted in those improvements being made.</p>



<p>I noted that some changes were made to the way the coffee was processed. Because drying space was no longer in short supply—except perhaps for a short while at peak harvest—the holding pens weren’t in use anymore. The coffee went on the beds and stayed there. And of course, because in Kenya’s export system a coffee must first pass through a dry mill before auction and export, this means that unlike other countries—where coffee can be stored in parchment to homogenize or stabilize prior to final sale, it’s removed from its protective layer months before shipping and stored in warehouses without climate control dotting Nairobi. </p>



<p>If it doesn’t stabilize during drying—like in a holding pen—it would be more susceptible to fade, a phenomenon I have observed in the samples I’d tasted and Kenyan coffees I’d hoped to enjoy from other roasters.</p>



<p>And then there was the fermentation: the factories I bought from no longer practiced Kenya’s signature “secondary fermentation” or soak—and they insisted that they weren’t the only ones who’d given up the practice. I looked around, and—they were right.</p>



<p>All of those extra steps—an extra day or two in the tanks, an extra 4-5 days in drying—amount to extra costs.</p>



<p>And it’s not like the producers were getting paid more for the coffee, so—why bother?</p>



<p>At the dry mill, we faced similar volume-based conundrums. While lot sizes passing to auction might be anywhere from 1-100 bags, it was common for smaller lots to be aggregated into larger ones simply as a matter of cost efficiency. There’s “changeover” loss when mills switch between distinct lots—there’s coffee retained in the system as well as recalibrations that need to be performed. With larger mills—like those in Kenya and those that were endemic to Colombia until the last decade—the amount of loss was greater. This means that they perform more efficiently as larger lots pass through them.</p>



<p>Think of it like a coffee grinder: if your grinder retains or exchanges 2.3g of coffee every time you grind and your dose is 20g, every time you grind coffee you’re theoretically losing about 11% or adulterating the coffee you’re grinding with 11% of previous batches. But if you’re grinding 500g, loss or interjection of 2.3g is just 0.46%—hardly likely to have any significant impact on your cup, and acceptable levels of loss.</p>



<p>So if these mills need more coffee passing through them to create the Kenyan coffee we remember—and coffee production is in decline—what now?</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m pretty ambivalent about the notion of trying to buy coffee from any certain place, especially for something as increasingly available as quality. Every export system in the world functions with its own set of rules and challenges and possibilities. But Kenya’s challenges are decidedly in a class of their own.</p>



<p>I stopped working there not because I don’t love the coffee or think it’s too expensive—but because it’s too opaque, too indirect, too diffuse. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to develop an equitable relationship when it’s systematically, legally set up to be an extractive one.</p>



<p>Many of the quality challenges, I think, can be solved through appropriate economic and fiduciary mechanisms and policies. Further, small scale mills and micro mills like those in Colombia and those we’re starting to see in Ethiopia would help producers differentiate their own products as well as establish a level of traceability and separation not accessible through the current system. And liberalization efforts, like the proposed Coffee Bill 2021 under consideration by the parliament would reform many of the most egregious oversights that de facto legalize systemic corruption and the exploitation of producers today.</p>



<p>Ultimately, unless we can find ways to put more money in the hands of individual smallholders—by paying producers when an exporter takes custody, for example, and implementing financing mechanisms for producers at sustainably low interest rates, the question I asked at the outset still remains.</p>



<p>Why bother?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 05 Jan 2022]</strong></p>



<p>A few days after I published this post, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/phil.magowao/" target="_blank">Philip Magowan</a>, a PhD candidate at University of Cambridge reached out. His research focus is on the coffee production in Kenya during the colonial period, and reading through his (unpublished) dissertation, the historical record establishes that the inequity in Kenya’s coffee production and export system is calculated, intentional, systemic and institutional in nature.</p>



<p>I look forward to linking to the dissertation when it’s published, but for now will leave you with a few paragraphs from his email:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you may well know – British settlers sought to exclude Kenyan farmers from coffee production (and until the 1950s, they had largely succeeded in doing so). My MPhil thesis research investigated the role of quality in Kenya’s coffee production. I looked at how settlers used European ideas of quality-oriented coffee production to sustain the exclusion of Kenyans from coffee farming. The settlers established exclusionary coffee research facilities, credit services and even ensured that new railroads only serviced settler areas of coffee production.</p>



<p>In particular relation to your blog, when in the 1940s, the colonial government were discussing how the first Kenyan-produced coffee crops should be processed and marketed – the settler farmers proposed that coffee from the Kenyan smallholders should be processed together in larger consignments that ignored any distinction between individual farmers’ lots. In comparison, each settler estate was marketed in sacks marked with the name of the estate, and was processed as an individual lot. This process negated any value of an individual Kenyan smallholder’s efforts, and further disincentivised farmers from working to increase the quality of their coffee. As you have highlighted for the similar issue arising today –&nbsp;<em>why bother?</em></p>



<p>Indeed, one of Kenya’s agricultural officials at the time, trying to explain to the Kenya govt why these rules were unjust, noted ‘By pooling the lots into one consignment, the quality of the greatest farmer’s coffee is rendered no better than that of the worst; like a fleet of ships, progress of the whole is tied to the slowest vessel.’ It is interesting that a similar issue arises today, where to save money lots are processed together, though at the ultimate expense of quality.</p>



<p>When writing my thesis, some of the conclusions that you came to in your blog were also apparent to me. The institutional legacy of the coffee marketing structure in the colonial period has chronically pervaded the prevailing structures today. I have never felt like I understood the contemporary industry well enough to comment, but a rewrite of these institutions from a government level does seem to be the only solution. Businesses like ACR are doing a fantastic job but the co-ops are now too significant a social/welfare role to vanish completely from the lives of coffee farmers.</p>

                                        <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 2, 2024 – Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired from the company after a distinguished 40-plus-year career and has stepped down from the board of directors, effective Dec. 1, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Intel has named two senior leaders, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-david-zinsner.html">David Zinsner</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-michelle-johnston-holthaus.html">Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus</a>, as interim co-chief executive officers while the board of directors conducts a search for a new CEO. Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, a group that encompasses the company’s Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) and Network and Edge Group (NEX). Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, will become interim executive chair during the period of transition. Intel Foundry leadership structure remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The board has formed a search committee and will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.</p>

<p>Yeary said, “On behalf of the board, I want to thank Pat for his many years of service and dedication to Intel across a long career in technology leadership. Pat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021. As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.”</p>

<p>Yeary continued, “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence. As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do. Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them. With MJ’s permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeary concluded, “With Dave and MJ’s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and capital. We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.”</p>

<p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together.&nbsp;It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel across a variety of roles, he has driven significant innovation and advanced not only the business but the broader global technology industry. A highly respected leader and skilled technologist, he has played an instrumental role in focusing on innovation while also creating a sense of urgency throughout the organization. Gelsinger began his career in 1979 at Intel, growing at the company to eventually become its first chief technology officer.</p>

<p>Zinsner and Holthaus said, “We are grateful for Pat’s commitment to Intel over these many years as well as his leadership. We will redouble our commitment to Intel Products and meeting customer needs. With our product and process leadership progressing, we will be focused on driving returns on foundry investments.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zinsner has more than 25 years of financial and operational experience in semiconductors, manufacturing and the technology industry. He joined Intel in January 2022 from Micron Technology Inc., where he was executive vice president and CFO. Zinsner served in a variety of other leadership roles earlier in his career, including president and chief operating officer at Affirmed Networks and senior vice president of finance and CFO at Analog Devices.</p>

<p>Holthaus is a proven general manager and leader who began her career with Intel nearly three decades ago. Prior to being named CEO of Intel Products, she was executive vice president and general manager of CCG. Holthaus has held a variety of management and leadership roles at Intel, including chief revenue officer and general manager of the Sales and Marketing Group, and lead of global CCG sales.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why SeekStorm?</h2><a id="user-content-why-seekstorm" aria-label="Permalink: Why SeekStorm?" href="#why-seekstorm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Performance</strong><br>
Lower latency, higher throughput, lower cost &amp; energy consumption, esp. for multi-field and concurrent queries.<br>
Low tail latencies ensure a smooth user experience and prevent loss of customers and revenue.<br>
While some rely on proprietary hardware accelerators (FPGA/ASIC) or clusters to improve performance,<br>
SeekStorm achieves a similar boost algorithmically on a single commodity server.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Consistency</strong><br>
No unpredictable query latency during and after large-volume indexing as SeekStorm doesn't require resource-intensive segment merges.<br>
Stable latencies - no cold start costs due to just-in-time compilation, no unpredictable garbage collection delays.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Scaling</strong><br>
Maintains low latency, high throughput, and low RAM consumption even for billion-scale indices.<br>
Unlimited field number, field length &amp; index size.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Relevance</strong><br>
Term proximity ranking provides more relevant results compared to BM25.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Real-time</strong><br>
True real-time search, as opposed to NRT: every indexed document is immediately searchable, even before and during commit.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why latency matters</h3><a id="user-content-why-latency-matters" aria-label="Permalink: Why latency matters" href="#why-latency-matters"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Search speed might be good enough for a single search. Below &lt;10 ms people can't tell latency anymore. Search latency might be small compared to internet network latency.</li>
<li>But search engine performance still matters when used in a server or service for many concurrent users and requests for maximum scaling, and throughput, and low processor load, cost.</li>
<li>With performant search technology you can serve many concurrent users, at low latency with fewer servers, less cost, and less energy consumption, lower carbon footprint.</li>
<li>It also ensures low latency even for complex and challenging queries: instant search, fuzzy search, faceted search, and union/intersection/phrase of very frequent terms.</li>
<li>Besides average latencies we also need to reduce tail latencies, which are often overlooked, but can cause loss of customers, and revenue and can cause a bad user experience.</li>
<li>It is always advisable to engineer your search infrastructure with enough performance headroom, to keep those tail latencies in check, even on periods of high concurrent load.</li>
<li>Also, even if a human user might not notice the latency, it still might make a big difference in autonomous stock market, defense applications or RAG which requires multiple queries.</li>

<p dir="auto">Despite what the hype-cycles <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/hype-cycles" rel="nofollow">https://www.bitecode.dev/p/hype-cycles</a> want you to believe, keyword search is not dead, as NoSQL wasn't the death of SQL.</p>
<p dir="auto">You should maintain a toolbox, and choose the best tool for your task at hand. <a href="https://seekstorm.com/blog/vector-search-vs-keyword-search1/" rel="nofollow">https://seekstorm.com/blog/vector-search-vs-keyword-search1/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Keyword search is just a filter for a set of documents, returning those where certain keywords occur in, usually combined with a ranking metric like BM25.
A very basic and core functionality, that is very challenging to implement at scale with low latency.
Because the functionality is so basic, there is an unlimited number of application fields.
It is a component, to be used together with other components.
There are uses cases which can be solved better today with vector search and LLMs, but for many more keyword search is still the best solution.
Keyword search is exact, lossless, and it is very fast, with better scaling, better latency, lower cost and energy consumption.
Vector search works with semantic similarity, returning results within with a given proximity and probability.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you search for exact results like proper names, numbers, license plates, domain names, and phrases (e.g. plagiarism detection) then keyword search is your friend. Vector search on the other hand will bury the exact result that you are looking for among a myriad results that are only somehow semantically related. At the same time, if you don’t know the exact terms, or you are interested in a broader topic, meaning or synonym, no matter what exact terms are used, then keyword search will fail you.</p>

<p dir="auto">Vector search is perfect if you don’t know the exact query terms, or you are interested in a broader topic, meaning or synonym, no matter what exact query terms are used. But if you are looking for exact terms, e.g. proper names, numbers, license plates, domain names, and phrases (e.g. plagiarism detection) then you should always use keyword search. Vector search will but bury the exact result that you are looking for among a myriad results that are only somehow related. It has a good recall, but low precision, and higher latency. It is prone to false positives, e.g. in in plagiarism detection as exact words and word order get lost.</p>
<p dir="auto">Vector search enables you to search not only for similar text, but everything that can be transformed to a vector: text, images (face recognition, finger prints), audio and it enables you to do magic things like queen - woman + man = king.</p>

Fast algorithms will shine even more with a performance-conscious programming language 🙂</p>

<p dir="auto">Facets are defined in 3 different places:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>the facet fields are defined in schema at create_index,</li>
<li>the facet field values are set in index_document at index time,</li>
<li>the query_facets/facet_filter parameters are specified at query time.<br>
Facets are then returned in the search result object.</li>

<p>I am grateful to the journalist Tom Webb, who specialises in data protection, for alerting me to <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill</a>, currently going through the House of Lords.</p>



<p>It concerns the legal presumption that “mechanical instruments” (which seems to be taken to include computer networks) are working properly if they look to the user like they’re working properly. This has come in for quite a kicking in recent years. I was <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2013/08/post-office-2nd-sight-report-into.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first alerted to it in 2013</a> by the barrister Stephen Mason. </p>



<p>Mason has spent longer than a decade telling anyone who will listen it is a deeply flawed legal presumption. <a href="https://read.uolpress.co.uk/read/3a219939-14d3-45c9-9fe0-9b42298ac587/section/0f113452-78ad-4c82-b28f-08cff1877036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here he sets out his reasoning</a>. Mason has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/12/update-law-on-computer-evidence-to-avoid-horizon-repeat-ministers-urged" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won some influential supporters</a> along the way, including Lord (James) Arbuthnot who has also spent longer than a decade campaigning on behalf of Subpostmasters affected by the Post Office scandal.</p>



<p>Although the “mechanical instruments” presumption has never, to the best of my knowledge, been quoted in any civil or criminal proceedings involving a Subpostmaster, it has been said to effectively reverse the burden of proof on anyone who might be convicted using digital evidence. </p>



<p>The logic being if the courts are going to assume a computer was working fine at the time an offence allegedly occurred because it looked like it was working fine, it is then down to the defendant to prove that it was <em>not</em> working fine. This can be extremely difficult to do (per the Seema Misra/Lee Castleton cases).  </p>



<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the amendment proposed</a> by Lord Arbuthnot and others. I am grateful to Tom for bringing it to my attention. It says:</p>



<p>After Clause 132, insert the following new Clause – </p>



<p>“<strong>Reliability of computer-based evidence</strong></p>



<p>(1) Electronic evidence produced by or derived from a computer, device or computer system (separately or together “system”) is admissible as evidence in any proceedings –</p>



<p>(a) where that electronic evidence and the reliability of the system that produced it or from which it is derived are not challenged;<br>(b) where the court is satisfied that the reliability of the system cannot reasonably be challenged;<br>(c) where the court is satisfied that the electronic evidence is derived from a reliable system.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="498" src="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-2048x996.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>James Arbuthnot</figcaption></figure>



<p>(2) Rules of Court must provide that electronic evidence sought to be relied upon by a party in any proceedings may be challenged by another party as to its admissibility.</p>



<p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), Rules of Court must provide for the circumstances in which the Court may be satisfied that the admissibility of electronic evidence cannot reasonably be challenged.</p>



<p>(4) When determining whether a system is reliable for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) the matters that may be taken into account include –</p>



<p>(a) any instructions or rules of the system that apply to its operation;<br>(b) any measures taken to secure the integrity of data held on the system;<br>(c) any measures taken to prevent unauthorised access to and use of the system;<br>(d) the security of the hardware and software used by the system;<br>(e) any measures taken to monitor and assess the reliability of the system by the system controller or operator including steps taken to fix errors or address unexpected outcomes including the regularity of and extent of any audit of the system by an independent body;<br>(f) any assessment of the reliability of the system made by a body with supervisory or regulatory functions;<br>(g) the provisions of any scheme or industry standard that apply in relation<br>to the system.</p>



<p>(5) For the purposes of this section – </p>



<p>“<em>computer</em>” means any device capable of performing mathematical or logical instructions;<br>“<em>device</em>” means any apparatus or tool operating alone or connected to other apparatus or tools, that processes information or data in electronic form;<br>“<em>electronic evidence</em>” means evidence derived from data contained in or produced by any device the functioning of which depends on a software program or from data stored on a computer, device or computer system or communicated over a networked computer system.”</p>



<p><em><strong>Member’s explanatory statement</strong><br>This amendment overturns the current legal assumption that evidence from computers is always reliable which has contributed to miscarriages of justice including the Horizon Scandal. It enables courts to ask questions of those submitting computer evidence about its reliability.</em></p>

languages, you’ll learn that Lispy languages have a special property:
they are <span>homoiconic</span>. This property is vested with mystical
powers that both enrich Lisps and debase its competitors.</p><p>I have programmed in, and built, Lisps since the late 1980s. My blog
is called “parenthetically speaking”. And yet I’m here to tell you
that this term is mostly nonsense. However, there <span>is</span> something
special—<wbr>something far less mystical, but also very powerful and
useful—<wbr>about Lisps. It’s worth understanding what that is and
transporting its essence to other languages.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part.__.Weak__.Homoiconicity)"></a>(Weak) Homoiconicity<span><a href="#(part.__.Weak__.Homoiconicity)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>What, supposedly, is homoiconicity? You will hear things like: the
property that “a property of some programming languages that allows
programs to be represented as data within the language”, or with
“represented” substituted by “manipulated”, or more simply as
“code as data”.</p><p>Let’s tease these apart a bit. Consider the following Python code:
</p><p>This is clearly a program. But can I <span>represent</span> this as a datum
within the language? Sure:
</p><p>is a perfectly good representation. (Well, it may be <span>good</span> but
it’s not <span>great</span>; we’ll return to that!) Can I <span>manipulate</span>
it? Sure, I can concatenate strings to create it:
</p><p>will produce that program, and
</p><p>will take it apart into constituent pieces.</p><p>Does that make Python homoiconic?</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing special about Python here. We can use
JavaScript to represent and manipulate JavaScript programs, C to do
the same to C programs, and so on. Essentially, any programming
language with a string datatype seems to be homoiconic. Heck, we
didn’t even need strings: we could just as well have represented the
programs as numbers (e.g., using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering">Gödel numbering</a>).</p><p>One of the traits of a good definition is that it be non-trivial: it
must capture some things but it must also exclude some things. It’s
not clear that this notion of homoiconicity excludes much of anything.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part.__.Strong__.Homoiconicity)"></a>(Strong) Homoiconicity<span><a href="#(part.__.Strong__.Homoiconicity)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>But there’s a reasonable objection to what we wrote above. All that
we’ve done is written, combined, and taken apart <span>strings</span>. But
strings are not necessarily <span>programs</span>; strings are just strings,
a form of data. Data are data, but programs—<wbr>entities
that we can <span>run</span>—<wbr>seem to be a separate thing.</p><p>How do we turn data into programs? We do need some language support
for that. We need something that will take some agreed-upon data
<span>representation</span> of a program and <span>treat it like a program</span>,
i.e., do whatever the program would have done. Typically, this is a
function called <span>eval</span><span></span>: it evaluates the datum, performing the
effects described in the datum, just as if it were a program. (Note
that <span>eval</span><span></span> really treats “data as code”, not “code as
data”.)</p><p>So maybe <span>eval</span><span></span> is the real characteristic of homoiconic
languages? Maybe. It’s certainly true that <span>eval</span><span></span> is a
distinctive feature, and some languages have it while others don’t:
that is, it non-trivially distinguishes between languages. But it’s
worth noting:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Many languages, including Python and JavaScript, have an
<span>eval</span><span></span>. If they’re all homoiconic, then clearly this isn’t a
particularly Lispy trait.</p></li><li><p><span>eval</span><span></span> interacts poorly with its lexical environment,
thereby making it hard to even program with effectively.
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">We showed</a> that JavaScript’s
<span>eval</span><span></span> is not one but four operations and there are eight
contexts that determine which of the four to use. This kind of
complexity is overwhelming.</p></li><li><p>The complexity might be worth it if <span>eval</span><span></span> were a good
idea, but it’s often a bad idea in programs! It makes code statically
invisible, making every other aspect of program management—<wbr>static
analysis, compilation, security checking, and more—<wbr>much, much harder
(or, for some important and useful kinds of analysis, impossible).</p></li></ul></div><p>This seems like a disappointing way to end: homoiconic languages are
ones that have a complex, excessively-powerful feature that we
probably shouldn’t use but is anyway found in many languages that are
not Lispy at all…which certainly doesn’t seem to be a good way to
describe what makes Lispy languages distinctive.</p><p>But this just shows why we shouldn’t be talking about homoiconicity at
all. Let’s talk about what’s actually interesting instead.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.The_.Parsing_.Pipeline)"></a>The Parsing Pipeline<span><a href="#(part._.The_.Parsing_.Pipeline)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>Let’s talk briefly about the classical parsing pipeline. For decades,
we’ve been taught to think of parsing a program as having two phases:
tokenization (sometimes colloquially called “lexing”) followed by
parsing (<span>not</span> colloquially called “yaccing”), and more. What do
they do?</p><p>A program is a list, or stream, of characters. A language
implementation needs to first understand what a program is saying
before it can make the program do what it says. That is, it has to
understand the meaning of a program. This process of determining
meaning is usually done in several stages, which make sense once we
understand them in terms of their expressiveness.</p><p>A typical dataflow in the front-end of a language implementation looks
like this:</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>Just as you don’t read this article at the level of individual
letters, given a program like <span>hello = 1</span>, we don’t want to deal
with it at the level of each <span>letter</span>: <span>h</span>, <span>e</span>, <span>l</span>, …
either.  Instead, we’d like to start by thinking of it as having three
<span>tokens</span>: <span>hello</span>, <span>=</span>, and <span>1</span>. Note that in the
process, we can ignore whether or not the <span>=</span> was surrounded by
spaces (which Python does not require, but some languages
do).<span><span><span>We’ll return to the elided spaces later!</span></span></span> This is the job
of the <span>scanner</span>.</p><p>So the input list or stream of characters gets transformed, by the
scanner, into an output list or stream of tokens. But as a reader, you
still don’t really read the program at the level of tokens; instead,
you assign <span>meaning</span>. That is, you presumably read the above as
“assign <span>hello</span> to <span>1</span>”.<span><span><span>The actual meaning of <span>=</span> in
Python is much more messy.</span></span></span> This is the job of the <span>parser</span>: to
create a data structure representing the high-level semantics of the
language. In this case, it might create an abstract syntax tree of a
“variable assignment”-type node with two children, one the variable being
assigned (here, <span>hello</span>) and one the value expression (here, just
<span>1</span>). If the actual expression were more complicated—<wbr>say the
program were <span>hello = 1 + 2</span>—<wbr>then there would be a more
complicated tree representing addition with two children.<span><span><span>This
being Python, of course the actual meaning of <span>+</span> is also messy.</span></span></span></p><p>The exact mechanisms by which this form of parsing happens is somewhat
outside scope here. For many languages, grammars are ambiguous and
top-down parsing strategies—<wbr>the ones you might first think
of—<wbr>don’t work, and parsing must instead happen bottom-up. This
process is complicated, algorithmically fascinating, and often bad at
giving good errors. There are very interesting trade-offs here that we
often don’t pay enough attention to.</p><p>Not every language implementation follows the above pipeline. People have,
for instance, experimented with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scannerless_parsing">parsing
without using a scanner</a>. Both conceptually and practically, it is
still useful to have this separation:
</p><div><ul><li><p>The scanner usually sits at the lowest level of the Chomsky
hierarchy: it is regular. It is therefore quick and efficient and its
rules are easy to reason about in depth.</p></li><li><p>The parser, in contrast, is usually context-free or worse,
making it a much more complicated beast.</p></li></ul></div><p>We should want to take advantage of complexity theory in building our
tools! This also represents a good separation-of-concerns, whereby we
could imagine building multiple parsers—<wbr>for instance, trading off
speed or space (or both) for better error messages—<wbr>while reusing the
same scanner.</p><p>In what follows, therefore, I will take the scanner as a
given. Thus, the traditional pipeline then has just one stage:
the parser. I therefore call this the <span>unicameral</span> pipeline.</p><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.The_.Bicameral_.Analogy)"></a>The Bicameral Analogy<span><a href="#(part._.The_.Bicameral_.Analogy)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>Many countries have what is called a <span>bicameral</span> legislature:
“bi” meaning two, “camera” meaning room. That is, there are two
houses of parliament. India, for instance, has the Lok Sabha and Rajya
Sabha; England has the House of Commons and House of Lords; the USA
has the House of Representatives and Senate. In all cases, there is a
“lower” house and “upper” house.</p><p>My goal here is not to endorse various class-related associations or
to delve into the actual practices, but rather to employ this as a
useful, rough analogy. A theory of bicamerality is this. The lower
house is a bit more rowdy and boisterous. It filters out some of the
more absurd legislations, but it allows through many that are perhaps
not entirely wise. The upper house is more calm and deliberative; in
legislatures, its members are either appointed or serve longer terms,
so they do not need to bend to every populist will. Therefore, the
upper house usefully serves as a filter.</p><p>So: we have two houses. The lower house filters out dreck, but lets
through several bills, some of which are unwise. The upper house
passes judgment on these bills, allowing only the ones it considers
wise. Enough political science, back to computer science.</p><h3>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Bicameral_.Syntax)"></a>Bicameral Syntax<span><a href="#(part._.Bicameral_.Syntax)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>As I’ve alluded above, having just a parser gives you a unicameral
syntax. What Lispy languages give you is a <span>bicameral</span>
syntax. But they are not unique in this; other notations, such as XML
and JSON, are also bicameral. To make my point, I will use these other
notations.</p><p>First of all, all these notations have to get through a scanner. In
XML, you can’t write <span>&lt;title</span> <span>without</span> a closing <span>&gt;</span>;
that’s just not even a valid opening tag. In JSON, you can’t write
<span>"hi</span> without a closing <span>"</span>; that’s just not a valid string. We
can think of these as basic tokenization failures. So let’s assume our
input passes the scanner and we get a list or stream of tokens.</p><p>Even once you’ve written proper tokens, there are still things you
cannot do in XML or JSON. For instance, the following full document is
not legal in XML:
</p><div><p><span>&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;This is my bar&lt;/bar&gt;</span></p></div><p>because we didn’t “close” <span>&lt;foo&gt;</span> with a <span>&lt;/foo&gt;</span>; this
isn’t legal either,
</p><div><p><span>&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;This is my bar&lt;/foo&gt;&lt;/bar&gt;</span></p></div><p>because we didn’t preserve the nesting structure (we should close
<span>bar</span> befor we close <span>foo</span>). The same is true in JSON: we can’t
open a structure without closing it (or vice versa); similarly, we
have to close braces and brackets in the opposite order of how we
opened them.</p><p>Observe that we can make these judgments <span>without knowing what
the datum represents</span>. There’s a reason I used names like <span>foo</span> and
<span>bar</span> instead of something meaningful. That’s because it doesn’t
matter: these XML and JSON data are wrong at a <span>basic</span> level. We
say that they fail to be <span>well-formed</span>. This is our lower house.</p><p>However, there may be more complicated rules at play. It may be that
a <span>bar</span> really should not reside within a <span>foo</span>; it may be that
every <span>baz</span> requires one or more <span>quux</span>es. If you’ve ever worked
with an XML or JSON format, you know that there are all kinds of rules
like this (that may or may not have been documented well!) that you
need to follow. For instance, when you read the documentation of a Web
API, it might tell you that a certain kind of request needs to provide
certain fields, but must also <span>not</span> provide certain other
keys. All these are called rules of <span>validity</span>. They build on top
of—<wbr>indeed, leave unstated—<wbr>the well-formedness rules, and focus on
what wasn’t checked there. This is the upper house.</p><p>This leads to a new pipeline, one where some tool performs an
intermediate check for well-formedness, and another for validity. The
last stage—<wbr>the one that checks validity and, having confirmed it,
produces terms tagged with their “parts of speech”—<wbr>is still the
parser. But now there’s one more tool in the middle. I don’t believe
there’s a standard name for it, but there should be; following Lisp
tradition, I call it the <span>reader</span>:
</p><div><p><span>Scaner --&gt; Reader --&gt; Parser</span></p></div><p>Now, as written, it’s not clear what the output of the reader is. It
could be that the reader just <span>checks</span> the tokens, and then
passes on the same token list or stream to the parser, just as in the
previous pipeline. But this would be a loss! The reader has the
ability to construct an extremely useful intermediate data
structure. The main property the reader looks for is that
“things match up and nest properly”. In other words, the reader is
confirming that the input is a <span>tree</span>. Thus, instead of passing
on a dumb, flat list of tokens to the parser, it constructs trees.</p><p>This greatly simplifies the job of the parser for two reasons. At a
more basic level, some of the checking that the parser previously had
to do is already done. More interestingly, tokens are very low-level;
trees are high-level. It’s much easier to write a recursive function
that checks for validity and produces abstract syntax trees when
already given well-formed trees as an input!<span><span><span>For this reason,
<a href="https://plai.org/">PLAI</a> calls this the “Primus Inter
Parsers”, a joke that seems lost on most.</span></span></span></p><p>Again, complexity theory is a useful guide, and what we have done is
steadily ratchet up the complexity:
</p><div><ul><li><p>The scanner is still regular, with all the attendant benefits
and weaknesses.</p></li><li><p>The reader is context-free. It does not need to do more
than that.</p></li><li><p>The parser is now freed of basic context-free checks, and can
focus on other context-free and, in particular,
context-<span>sensitive</span> checks.</p></li></ul></div><p>And once again, we can exploit this separation of concerns to swap out
other implementations if we need to.</p><p>This, then, is a <span>bicameral syntax</span>. The reader is the “lower
house”; it rejects basic mistakes, but still lets through some
invalid things. But it also presents them wrapped up in a cleaner,
simpler structure to work with. The parser is the “upper house”; it
receives this clean structure and can look for deeper flaws in it,
only allowing those things that pass its more exacting scrutiny.</p><p>The advantages to a bicameral syntax are many:
</p><div><ul><li><p>We get a greater separation of concerns, making it easier to
both understand and to swap out components.</p></li><li><p>We get to more gradually walk up the complexity hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>The reader sits at a key intermediate level, turning tokens into
trees, thereby greatly simplifying the parser’s task while itself
being quite easy to write.</p></li></ul></div><p>This simplicity of (correct!) implementation matters! It doesn’t
matter as much when you have only one implementation of a
language. However, a lot of our traffic in computing is best
represented as trees: they are much more powerful than strings, but
also simple enough to write and read. It is therefore no surprise that
bicameral syntaxes like JSON have become ubiquitous. <span>Every</span>
language now needs a reader for them, and these readers have to
implement the same language, so simplicity of specification and of
implementation are a virtue. In turn, many systems need to separately
validate a JSON input; again, the simplicity of writing this kind of
(tree-consuming) parser is a big win.</p><p>This additional level also has other tooling advantages. It’s not only
language implementations that need to support syntax; so do
editors. It’s a lot easier to support matching, indentation, coloring,
and so on at the well-formedness level. And it’s <span>easy</span> to indent
trees! It’s also easy to traverse them: there are meaningful
<span>generic</span> tree-level operations (“go to the opening”, “go to
the closing”, “go up a level”, “go down a level”, etc.) that can
be applied to all languages with the same well-formedness
characteristic (e.g., JSON).  And again, we have lots of editors, and
they each need to support the same syntaxes; bicameral languages, by
providing the intermediate notion of well-formedness, let tools hit
the trifecta of: correct, useful, and relatively easy.</p><p>These advantages are offset by one drawback: some people just don’t
<span>like</span> them. It feels constraining to some to always write
programs in terms of trees, rather than more free-form syntax. Even in
this bicameral space, there are trade-offs: XML requires you to repeat
tags at closing, which improves error-checking and catches errors in
refactoring, but makes authoring painful; Lisps don’t require tag
repetition but, traditionally, use only one kind of parenthesis,
making structure harder to see; JSON mixes delimiters while avoiding
closing tags, which seems to be some kind of sweet-spot (because it
still provides some checking against editing errors). Still, what
people are willing to embrace for writing data seems to irk them when
writing programs, leading to the long-standing hatred for Lispy
syntaxes.</p><h3>6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Back_to_.Lisps)"></a>Back to Lisps<span><a href="#(part._.Back_to_.Lisps)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>We started with Lisp, so let’s go back there. What is Lisp? Lisp is a
feeling, an emotion, a sentiment; Lisp is a vibe; Lisp is the dew on
morning grass, it’s the scent of pine wafting on a breeze, it’s the
sound of a cricket ball on a bat, it’s the…oh, wait, where was
I. Sorry.</p><p>Okay, seriously. Note that I keep writing “Lispy languages”: both
the “y” and “[language]s” should have stood out by now. What do I
mean by this?</p><p>I’m not referring to a particular language: Common Lisp, say. I’m
referring to a family of languages, which includes Common Lisp but
also Scheme and Racket and Clojure and many others. This family is
bound by some cultural antecedents, but the individual languages can
be wildly different. What they share is a <span>philosophy of
syntax</span>. And now that we’ve fleshed out that philosophy, if we are
being generous, we could allow that <span>any</span> bicameral language is
at its essence “Lispy”.</p><p>The power of this philosophy is that the language platform can
implement its bicameral syntax once, and well, and lots of languages
can inherit it. We noted above that there are many (data) languages
built atop JSON, each of which has its own validity rules. We can
likewise build many data and programming languages atop any bicameral
syntax; they will share some familial traits but differ quite a bit in
the details.</p><p>The bicamerality of Lisps, however, leads to some
misconceptions:
</p><div><ol><li><p>It does not dictate a particular implementation strategy. For
instance, the argument in Lisp sometimes goes, “code is data because
code is represented using s-expressions, which are also Lisp data”. A
full tutorial of what these terms means is beyond what I want to get
into here. What I will just say is that there are Lispy languages
where this is not true at all.</p><p>The one I know best is Racket, because I originally built some of
these parts of it. In Racket, code is not represented using
s-expressions. This is because “code” requires many more things: it
needs, for instance, to record the source locations so that it can use
it to report errors;<span><span><span>Remember those whitespaces we said we could
ignore? We can’t if we want to report errors!</span></span></span>
it needs hygiene information to avoid inadvertent
capture; and more. Therefore, Racket has a notion of
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stxops.html"><span>syntax</span> object</a>
(which, yes, is a datum) that captures this much richer notion of
“program source”. Syntax is a separate type that happens to parallel
(and enrich) s-expressions and can be interconverted with them, but it
is not an s-expression. So, while there is a large family of functions
that operate on (say) lists, and s-expressions include lists, none of
those functions will apply to syntax.</p></li><li><p>People will sometimes say that the <span>read</span><span></span> primitive
“parses”. It does not: it reads. It “parses” inasmuch as it
confirms that the input is well-formed, but it is not the parser of
convention—<wbr>one that determines validity according to
context-sensitive rules, and identifies “parts of speech”—<wbr>so it is
false to say that Lisps ship with a parser.</p><p>To make this concrete, here is a well-formed Lispy term that
<span>read</span><span></span> has no problem with: <span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span></span>. That is, however,
a <span>syntax</span> error in most Lisps: a determination made by the
parser, not the reader. Of course, nothing prevents us from creating a
new language where that term has some meaning. That language’s parser
would be responsible for making sense out of the pieces.</p></li><li><p>People sometimes believe you can only have macros if you have a
bicameral syntax. This isn’t true: all you need is a way to represent
code, because macros transform code to code. But as more languages
have realized the benefits of having macros, some have added
<span>procedural</span> macros (an idea that dates back decades in Lisp
lore). Bicameral syntaxes just provide a gateway to gloriously rich
macro systems, because we’ve learned that the well-formedness layer is
an especially good layer atop which to build macros.</p></li></ol></div><h3>7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.What_.About_.Other_.Languages_)"></a>What About Other Languages?<span><a href="#(part._.What_.About_.Other_.Languages_)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>I want to end with some forward-looking comments.</p><p>One of my frequent sources of amusement—<wbr>and frustration—<wbr>is to
search for people asking “How do I build a programming language?”
and reading the advice they get. These conversations invariably get
mired in syntax issues. But by the time the novice gets through
building all the knick-knacks of syntax and learning to build parsers,
they’ve usually exhausted their complexity, cognitive, and time
budget. The resulting language either never gets done or is a semantic
mess.</p><p>I would like to suggest another path forward: start with a bicameral
syntax. Quickly get to the point where you can think about
<span>semantics</span>. What does your language <span>do</span>? How does one
reason about programs? How does one run them? Do all the hard and
interesting and important parts first.</p><p>But, you argue, “Now I have a bicameral syntax! Nobody will want to
program in it!” And that may be true. But I want you to consider the
following perspective:</p><blockquote><p>Syntax is a view.</p></blockquote><p>One of the enduring lessons we’ve learned from software design is the
model-view separation: that is, there are often many useful ways to
view the same thing, some of which we haven’t even dreamt up yet, so
it’s wise to separate an object from how we view it (and coordinate
the different views). This principle seems to virtually never be
applied to programs, but it should! We should view the <span>abstract</span>
syntax as the model—<wbr>the “one true program”—<wbr>and <span>every</span>
syntax as a view on it.</p><p>So what you should really do is define an abstract syntax, and layer a
light bicameral concrete syntax on top of it. Then build all the other
parts. And then, think about what views you want to provide. Some
people may be happy with the bicameral syntax. Others may want a more
traditional infix syntax. Some may want braces, some may want
significant whitespace. Some users may even want to use blocks—<wbr>the
ultimate bicameral syntax. You can (and should) view syntaxes as the fun
desserts that you get to design and deploy once the hard work is
done.<span><span><span>This is not to say syntax is not hard; it’s actually
harder than most people think, because it requires a delicate
interplay between mathematics and human factors.</span></span></span>
Both
<a href="https://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/">F*dging up a Racket</a> and, in much more depth,
<a href="https://beautifulracket.com/">Beautiful Racket</a>
illustrate this principle practically and beautifully.</p><p>This perspective also gives you a useful artifact: a bicameral syntax
that is a very nice target for programs that need to generate programs
in your language. This is no longer a new idea, so you don’t have to
feel radical: formats like SMT-LIB and WebAssembly text format are
s-expressions for a reason. Our <a href="https://forge-fm.org/">Forge</a> tool supports both an
syntax based on <a href="https://alloytools.org/">Alloy</a> and one in s-expressions, the former
for (most) people to use, the latter a target to tools that use Forge
as a back-end.</p><p>In short, I hope this inspires a new vision of syntax
design. Bicamerality is the best intermediate language we’ve come up
with; it’s driven by both theoretical elegance and practical
experience. For some, the bicameral syntax is also a lovely source
language, but it should be just one of many views onto the core
abstract syntax. Tools will become more reusable, and at the same
time, the syntax wars can end. We can find peace, joy, and
happiness. It is not a coincidence that a pair of parentheses looks
like an embrace.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Following a public vote in which more than 37,000 people had their say, we’re pleased to announce that the Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is ‘brain rot’.</p>
<p>Our language experts created a shortlist of six words to reflect the moods and conversations that have helped shape the past year. After two weeks of public voting and widespread conversation, our experts came together to consider the public’s input, voting results, and our language data, before declaring ‘brain rot’ as the definitive Word of the Year for 2024.</p>

<div data-aos="fade-up" id="block_4c972f2c674656b1ba770666f7af4238">
                <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3><strong>Why ‘brain rot’?</strong></h3>
<p>‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”.</p>
<p>Our experts noticed that ‘brain rot’ gained new prominence this year as a term used to capture concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media. The term increased in usage frequency by 230% between 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>The first recorded use of ‘brain rot’ was found in 1854 in Henry David Thoreau’s book <em>Walden</em>, which reports his experiences of living a simple lifestyle in the natural world. As part of his conclusions, Thoreau criticizes society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas, or those that can be interpreted in multiple ways, in favour of simple ones, and sees this as indicative of a general decline in mental and intellectual effort: <em>“While England endeavours to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot – which prevails so much more widely and fatally?”</em></p>

        </div>                
                <p><img src="https://corp.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/OxfordWOTY_brainrot_graph.png" alt="A trend graph that depicts usage of " brain="" rot'="" in="" 2024.'="">
                                    </p>
            </div>







<p>The term has taken on new significance in the digital age, especially over the past 12 months. Initially gaining traction on social media platform—particularly on TikTok among Gen Z and Gen Alpha communities—’brain rot’ is now seeing more widespread use, such as in mainstream journalism, amidst societal concerns about the negative impact of overconsuming online content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, ‘brain rot’ is used to describe both the cause and effect of this, referring to low-quality, low-value content found on social media and the internet, as well as the subsequent negative impact that consuming this type of content is perceived to have on an individual or society.</p>



<p>It has also been used more specifically and consistently in reference to online culture. Often used in a humorous or self-deprecating manner by online communities, it is strongly associated with certain types of content—including creator Alexey Gerasimov’s viral <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> video series, featuring humanoid toilets, and user-generated ‘only in Ohio’ memes, which reference bizarre incidents in the state. This content has given rise to emerging ‘brain rot language’—such as ‘skibidi’, meaning something nonsensical, and ‘Ohio’, meaning something embarrassing or weird—which reflects a growing trend of words originating in viral online culture before spreading offline into the ‘real world’.</p>



<p>Now also gaining momentum is a broader, more serious conversation about the potential negative impact that excessively consuming this content might have on mental health, particularly in children and young people. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/co-occurring-disorders/brain-rot/#:~:text=Brain%20rot%20is%20a%20condition,negative%20and%20distressing%20news%20online." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mental health centre</a> in the US even published advice online about how to recognize and avoid ‘brain rot’.</p>



<p>Speaking about this year’s selection process and the 2024 winner, Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, said:</p>



<p><em>“It’s been insightful and deeply moving to see language lovers all over the world participate and help us select the Oxford Word of the Year 2024.</em></p>



<p><em>“Looking back at the Oxford Word of the Year over the past two decades, you can see society’s growing preoccupation with how our virtual lives are evolving, the way internet culture is permeating so much of who we are and what we talk about. Last year’s winning word, ‘rizz’, was an interesting example of how language is increasingly formed, shaped, and shared within online communities. ‘Brain rot’ speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time. It feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology. It’s not surprising that so many voters embraced the term, endorsing it as our choice this year.</em></p>



<p><em>“I find it fascinating that the term ‘brain rot’ has been adopted by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, those communities largely responsible for the use and creation of the digital content the term refers to. These communities have amplified the expression through social media channels, the very place said to cause ‘brain rot’. It demonstrates a somewhat cheeky self-awareness in the younger generations about the harmful impact of social media that they’ve inherited.”</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Throughout my career, I have found git submodules to be a pain. Because I did not understand them, I kept getting myself into frustrating situations.</p>

<p>So, I finally sat down and learned how git tracks submodules. Turns out, it’s not complex at all. It’s just different from how git tracks regular files. It’s just one more thing you have to learn.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll explain exactly what I needed to know in order to work with submodules without inflicting self-damage.</p>

<p>(This article doesn’t discuss whether submodules are good/bad, or if you should use them or not – a valid discussion, but out of scope.)</p>

<h2 id="the-lay-of-the-land">The lay of the land</h2>
<p>This article will make more sense if we use concrete examples.</p>

<p>Allow me to describe a toy webapp we’re building. Call this repo <code>webapp</code>. Here are the contents of the repo.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] ls

.git/
README.md
tests/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Say you want to import some library. It lives in its own repo, <code>library</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/library] ls

.git/
README.md
my_cool_functions.py
</code></pre></div>

<p>Shortly, I’ll explain how submodules work. But, first, let me dramatically re-enact something that has happened to me multiple times. This is what it looks like to use submodules without understanding them.</p>

<h2 id="a-day-in-the-life-of-someone-who-doesnt-understand-submodules">A day in the life of someone who doesn’t understand submodules</h2>
<p>Ah, 2012. What a time to be a “full-stack engineer”! I wonder what contributions await me on the main branch!</p>

<p>(For the sake of readability, in this article, instead of using real commit SHAs, I’m going to use fake descriptive ones.)</p>

<p>Let’s pull to make sure I’m up-to-date with the remote.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>[</span>/webapp] git pull

<p>After I pull, I like to confirm that my working tree is clean.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
 M library
</code></pre></div>

<p>What’s this? I’ve made modifications to <code>library</code>? I never touch that directory.</p>

<p>It’s weird that I’ve modified a <em>directory</em>. Usually git just says I’ve modified a specific <em>file</em>.</p>

<p>Well, what does <code>git diff</code> have to say?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git diff

diff --git a/library b/library

</code></pre></div>

<p>Apparently, I deleted <code>Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha</code> and added <code>Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>Surely I didn’t do that. That’s weird, let me do a hard reset.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git reset --hard origin/main

HEAD is now at webapp_new_commit_sha point submodule to newest commit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Did it make the git diff go away?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
 M library
</code></pre></div>

<p>It did not! I am really confused now!</p>

<p>Well, the usual way I make local modifications go away is <code>git reset --hard</code>, and that didn’t work. The other way is to commit the changes.</p>

<p>(Sometimes, people don’t even notice the diff above, and accidentally do this.)</p>

<p><strong>My future self</strong>: <em>Don’t do it! If you <code>git add</code> that change, you’ll be rolling back a change someone else made!</em></p>

<p>What’s going on, of course, is that <code>library</code> is a submodule, and you have to do special stuff to deal with them.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into submodules.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-submodule">What’s a submodule?</h2>
<p>A git submodule is a full repo that’s been nested inside another repo. Any repo can be a submodule of another.</p>

<p>So, <code>library</code> is a full repo that has been nested inside <code>webapp</code> as a submodule.</p>

<p>That doesn’t seem so confusing, does it? However, there are two important, and tricky, facts about submodules. These facts are why so many people trip up on submodules.</p>

<h3 id="1-a-submodule-is-always-pinned-to-a-specific-commit">1. A submodule is always pinned to a specific commit</h3>
<p>You know how package managers let you be  fuzzy when specifying a package version (“get me any version of <code>requests</code> so long as it’s 2.x.x”), or to pin an exact version (“use <code>requests</code> 2.31.0 exactly”)?</p>

<p>Submodules can <em>only</em> be pinned to a specific commit. This is because a submodule isn’t a package; it’s code that you have embedded in another repo, and git wants you to be precise.</p>

<p>We’ll see exactly how this pinning works shortly.</p>

<h3 id="2-git-does-not-automatically-download-or-update-submodules">2. git does not automatically download or update submodules</h3>
<p>If you clone <code>webapp</code> afresh, git <em>will not</em> automatically download <code>library</code> for you (unless you clone using <code>git clone --recursive</code>)</p>

<p>Similarly, if a collaborator pins <code>webapp</code> to a new commit of <code>library</code>, and you <code>git pull</code> <code>webapp</code>, git <em>will not</em> automatically update <code>library</code> for you.</p>

<p>This is actually what’s happening in the dramatic re-enactment above. Let me rewind a little bit to show what happened.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-someone-updates-a-submodule">What happens when someone updates a submodule?</h2>
<p>In the beginning, <code>webapp</code> pointed to <code>webapp_old_commit_sha</code>, which pinned <code>library</code> to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules1.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram of two git repositories, webapp and library. It shows that the old_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the old_sha commit of the library repo. The old_sha commit of the webapp repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. The old_sha commit of the library repo also has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'."></p>

<p>(Think of <code>HEAD</code> as “current commit”.)</p>

<p>Then, my collaborator made changes to <code>library</code>. Remember, <code>library</code> is a full repo, so after they did their work, they did what you always do after you make changes: they committed and pushed the new commit, <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>They weren’t done, though. <code>webapp</code> must point to a specific commit of <code>library</code>, so in order to use <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, my collaborator then pushed a new commit to <code>webpapp</code>, <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>, which points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, though! <em>git does not automatically update submodules</em>, so <code>library</code> still points to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules2.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram of two git repositories, webapp and library. It shows that the old_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the old_sha commit of the library repo. The new_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the new_sha of the library repo. The new_sha commit of the webapp repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. The old_sha commit of the library repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. A red arrow points to the purple border around old_sha in the library repo. The red arrow is linked to a speech bubble which says, 'library still points at old_sha!'"></p>

<p>I think this will be a lot less confusing if we look at exactly how git tracks submodules.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-git-pin-a-submodule-to-a-specific-commit">How does git pin a submodule to a specific commit?</h3>
<p>The latest commit of <code>webapp</code> is <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>. Let’s inspect that commit.</p>

<p>A commit is just a file on disk. However, it’s optimized/compressed, so we use a built-in utility to view it. Here’s what the commit stores.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git cat-file -p `webapp_new_commit_sha`

tree 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4
parent webapp_old_commit_sha
author Dmitry Mazin &lt;dm@cyberdemon.org&gt; 1708717288 +0000
committer Dmitry Mazin &lt;dm@cyberdemon.org&gt; 1708717288 +0000

point submodule to newest commit
</code></pre></div>

<p>What we care about is <code>tree 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4</code>. The <em>tree</em> object represents the directory listing of your repo. When you think trees, think directories.</p>

<p>Let’s inspect the tree object.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git cat-file -p 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4

100644 blob     6feaf03c7a9c805ff734a90a245a417e6a6c099b    .gitmodules
100644 blob     a72832b303c4d4f1833da79fc8a566e8a0eb37af    README.md
040000 tree     a425c23ded8892f901dee7fbc8d4c5714bdcc40d    tests
160000 commit   library_new_commit_sha                      library
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note how <code>tests</code> is a <code>tree</code> (just like directories can hold directories, trees can point to trees).</p>

<p>But <code>library</code> is a… commit?!</p>

<div><pre><code>160000 commit   library_new_commit_sha                      library
</code></pre></div>

<p>That weirdness, right there, is precisely how git knows <code>library</code> points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, the way git implements submodules is by doing a weird trick where a tree points to a <em>commit</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules3.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram showing the text 'webapp_new_commit_sha' connected, via arrow, to 'tree a425' which is itself connected, via arrow, to 'library_new_commit_sha'"></p>

<p>Let’s use this knowledge to understand the <code>git diff</code> from earlier.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-git-diff">Understanding git diff</h2>
<p>Here’s the diff again.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git diff

diff --git a/library b/library
index library_old_commit_sha..library_new_commit_sha 160000
--- a/library
+++ b/library
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha
+Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s confusing that it’s saying that <strong>I</strong> modified <code>library</code>. I didn’t modify it, someone else did!</p>

<p>Usually, I think of <code>git diff</code> as “here are the changes I have made”. But this isn’t exactly correct.</p>

<p>When you invoke <code>git diff</code>, you’re asking git to tell you the difference between your working tree (that is, your unstaged, uncommitted local changes) and the most recent commit of your branch (<code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>).</p>

<p>When you look at it that way, the above git diff starts to make sense. In <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>, <code>library</code> points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, but in our working tree, <code>library</code> still points to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>git has no idea which change happened first. It only knows that your working tree is different from the commit. And, so it tells you: <code>library_new_commit_sha</code> is saying that library should point to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, but it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Understanding the above took the pain out of submodules for me. However, I still haven’t told you how to update a submodule.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-update-a-submodule">How to update a submodule</h2>
<p>We now understand that we need to point <code>library</code> to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>. How?</p>

<p>Because <code>library</code> is a full repo, I could just <code>cd</code> into it and literally check out that commit:</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] cd library

$ [/library] git checkout library_new_commit_sha

Previous HEAD position was library_old_commit_sha README
HEAD is now at library_new_commit_sha add some cool functions
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we go back into <code>webapp</code>, we’ll see that <code>git st</code>/<code>git diff</code> finally look clean.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
# (no output)

$ [/webapp] git diff

# (no output)
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, you don’t actually need to do the above.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-really-update-a-submodule">How to really update a submodule</h2>
<p>From <code>webapp</code>, we can invoke <code>git submodule update</code>. This updates <em>all</em> of a repo’s submodules.</p>

<p>People often use certain flags with <code>git submodule update</code>, so let’s understand them.</p>

<h3 id="initialize-a-submodule-git-submodule-update---init">Initialize a submodule: <code>git submodule update --init</code></h3>
<p>Remember how I said that if you <code>git clone webapp</code>, git won’t actually download the contents of <code>library</code>?</p>

<p>What you’re supposed to do is, after cloning webapp:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run <code>git submodule init</code> to initialize the submodules. This doesn’t actually download them, though 🙃️.</li>
  <li>Run <code>git submodule update</code> to actually pull the submodules.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is kind of a silly dance, so git lets you just do <code>git submodule update --init</code>. This initializes any submodules and updates them in one step. I <em>always</em> pass <code>--init</code> because there is no harm in doing so.</p>

<p>You can skip <code>--init</code> by cloning with <code>--recursive</code>: that is, you could have done <code>git clone webapp --recursive</code>. I never remember to do this, though. Plus, you end up having to do <code>git update submodule</code> anyway.</p>

<h3 id="update-submodules-of-submodules-git-submodule-update---recursive">Update submodules of submodules: <code>git submodule update --recursive</code></h3>
<p>Submodules can nest other submodules. Yeah.</p>

<p>So, to take care of updating submodules <em>all the way down</em>, pretty much just always pass <code>--recursive</code> to <code>git submodule update</code>.</p>

<p><strong>So, the command I always end up using is <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="make-git-automatically-update-submodules-git-config-submodulerecurse-true">Make git automatically update submodules: <code>git config submodule.recurse true</code></h3>
<p><code>submodule.recurse true</code> makes submodules automatically update when you <code>git pull</code>, <code>git checkout</code>, etc. In other words, it makes submodules automatically point to whatever they are supposed to point to. It’s only available in git 2.14 and newer.</p>

<p>That makes running <code>git submodule update</code> unnecessary.</p>

<p>I don’t use this setting, because I’m not sure if there are drawbacks or not. Plus, I work on submodules enough that I think it could cause conflicts. Let me know if you’re aware of shortcomings, or if you’ve been using this setting forever without issue!</p>

<p>This setting definitely does <em>not</em> apply to <code>git clone</code>. So you still need to do <code>git clone --recursive</code> or init/update submodules using the commands above.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>I think I can summarize submodules pretty simply.</p>

<p>It’s possible to embed a repo within another repo. This is called a submodule.</p>

<p>Each commit of the outer repo always specifies an <em>exact</em> commit that submodule. This is done by the <code>outer commit -&gt; tree -&gt; submodule commit</code> link.</p>

<p>When you check out commits, git doesn’t automatically update submodules for you. You have to do that using <code>git submodule update</code>.</p>

<p>And there we have it!</p>

<h2 id="further-topics-in-submodules">Further topics in submodules</h2>
<p>The above is enough to hopefully take the confusion out of submodules. However, there are more common commands and configs that I’d like to explain.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-add-a-submodule-git-submodule-add">How to add a submodule: <code>git submodule add</code></h3>
<p>Let’s say that I start <code>webapp</code> fresh, and I have not added <code>library</code> to it yet.</p>

<p>To add <code>library</code>, I’d do <code>git submodule add https://github.com/dmazin/library.git library</code>.</p>

<p>This will add (or update) the <code>.gitmodules</code> file of <code>webapp</code>, download <code>library</code>, and point <code>webapp</code> at the latest commit of <code>library</code>.</p>

<p>Remember, this actually modifies <code>webapp</code>, so you need to commit after that. But you thankfully don’t need to do <code>git submodule update</code> after doing <code>git submodule add</code> or anything.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-do-after-ive-modified-a-submodule">What do I do after I’ve modified a submodule?</h3>
<p>Remember that <code>library</code> is a full repo, so if you want to make changes to it, you can. Just make changes and commit them to the main branch.</p>

<p>But how do you make <code>webapp</code> point at the new commit? There are a couple ways.</p>

<h4 id="without-a-command">Without a command</h4>
<p>You can go into <code>webapp</code>, then <code>cd library</code>, and just do <code>git pull</code> in there. When you <code>cd</code> back into <code>webapp</code>, if you <code>git diff</code> you’ll see that <code>webapp</code> points to the newest branch of <code>library</code>. You can commit that.</p>

<h4 id="using-git-submodule-update---remote----library">Using <code>git submodule update --remote -- library</code></h4>
<p>This tells git “make the submodule point to the latest remote commit”. Since you have pushed the latest commit of library to library’s remote, this will make <code>webapp</code> point to that commit.</p>

<p>But note that <code>git submodule update --remote</code> will do this to <em>all</em> your submodules. You likely do not want that.</p>

<p>For that reason, you have to do <code>git submodule update --remote -- library</code> to limit this to library only. (If you’re thrown off by the fact that you have to do <code>-- library</code> – yeah, it’s kind of weird.)</p>

<p>Because <code>--remote</code> might accidentally update all the submodules, honestly I usually do the “without a command” method.</p>

<h3 id="the-gitmodules-file">The .gitmodules file</h3>
<p>How does git know where to download <code>library</code> from?
git uses a file called <code>.gitmodules</code> to track the basic facts of a submodule, like the repo URL.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] cat .gitmodules

[submodule "library"]
        path = library
        url = https://github.com/dmazin/library.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>The nice thing about <code>.gitmodules</code> is that it’s a regular file, tracked the regular way in git. That makes it not confusing.</p>

<p>(What I don’t understand is, why git didn’t just put the submodule commit right in .gitmodules? The commits of <code>webapp</code> would <em>still</em> be able to specify exact commits of <code>library</code> to use. What am I missing?)</p>

<h3 id="making-submodules-use-branches-other-than-main">Making submodules use branches other than main</h3>
<p>If you want to, you can make <code>library</code> track whatever branch you want. Otherwise, it defaults to whatever the “main” branch is.</p>

<div><pre><code>[submodule "library"]
        path = library
        url = https://github.com/dmazin/library.git
        branch = staging
</code></pre></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The message appears in <code>sudo</code>’s revision control (in its current guise) <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/c101e9572d7f" rel="noreferrer">in June 1993</a>, in the University of Colorado version of <code>sudo</code>, in a slightly shorter form:</p>

<pre><code>We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local Systems
Administrator. It usually boils down to these two things:

        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
</code></pre>

<p>This initial commit also introduced <code>sudo</code>’s <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/" rel="noreferrer">other famous message</a>, “This incident will be reported.”</p>

<p>The author of the commit is Todd C. Miller, the maintainer of CU <code>sudo</code> (now plain <code>sudo</code>, still maintained by Todd), but the source code predates the commit; and while the source mentions Jeff Nieusma, the messages <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-message-that-comes-up-when-you-use-sudo-for-the-first-time/answer/Brian-Bi" rel="noreferrer">predate his involvement too</a> and their author is presumably either Bob Coggeshall or Evi Nemeth (see also “<a href="https://www.sudo.ws/history.html" rel="noreferrer">A Brief History of Sudo</a>”). The source history doesn’t suggest any particular background to the change. The message is typical of warning messages which were displayed when logging in to academic systems at the time.</p>

<p><code>sudo</code> was published in the <em>UNIX System Administration Handbook</em>, written by  Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, and Scott Seebass; <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_0139334416/page/468" rel="noreferrer">the version published in the first edition</a> doesn’t include a warning in the program itself, but the authors mention that users who were granted <code>sudo</code> access were sent a (lengthy) email reminding them of the responsibilities associated with that privilege.</p>

<p>The third item was <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/ebd5a76ccd7e" rel="noreferrer">added in January 2004</a>, with a more interesting commit message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add Stan Lee / Uncle Ben quote to the lecture from RedHat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Said quote (which, as <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/users/4147/tommy">Tommy</a> <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12521/when-was-the-famous-sudo-warning-introduced-under-what-background-by-whom#comment39312_12522">points out</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility" rel="noreferrer">wasn’t coined by Stan Lee</a>) was added to Red Hat’s <code>sudo</code> package as a patch on top of version 1.6.6, in June 2002.</p>
